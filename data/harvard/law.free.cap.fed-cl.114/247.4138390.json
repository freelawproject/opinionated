(\u201cSRA\u201d or \u201cPlaintiff\u2019) has provided network infrastructure support to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), pursuant to a September 2009 FDIC Infrastructure Support Contract (\u201cISC-2 Contract\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6 11; PI. Mem. Ex. A at A0003. The ISC-2 Contract was a task order, issued under the General Services Administration\u2019s (\u201cGSA\u201d) Millenia Government-Wide Acquisition Contact (\u201cMillenia GWAC\u201d). PI. Mem. Ex. A at A0008; PI. Mem. Ex. G \u00b6 1 (Contracting Officer\u2019s September 25, 2012 Statement of Facts in the United States Government Accountability Office Protest of SRA International, Inc., B-407709.5 (hereinafter the \u201cCO\u2019s Statement\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">On June 21, 2012, the GSA Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (\u201cFEDSIM\u201d) issued Task Order Request # GSC-QF0B-12-0020, on behalf of the FDIC, pursuant to the Alliant GWAC (that superseded the Millenia GWAC). PI. Mem. Ex. G \u00b6 1 (CO\u2019s Statement). On October 22, 2012, the GSA awarded Task Order # GST0013AJ0013 to Computer Sciences Corporation (\u201cCSC\u201d). After SRA filed a protest at the United States Government Accountability Office (\u201cGAO\u201d), GSA terminated the October 22, 2012 Task Order for convenience on December 13, 2012. Pl.Ex. G \u00b62.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-18\">After a series of corrective amendments,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on August 14, 2013, the GSA awarded Task Order # GST0013AJ0084 (\u201cISC-3 Contract\u201d or \u201cTask Order\u201d) to CSC for a price of $365,462,364, including all options. PI. Mem. Ex. G \u00b624. During an August 21, 2013 debriefing with SRA, the GSA confirmed that Blue Canopy Group, LLC (\u201cBlue Canopy\u201d) was going to be a subcontractor for CSC on the ISC-3 Contact. Compl. \u00b6 13. During the last five years, however, Blue Canopy worked under a FDIC contact to conduct security audits of SRA\u2019s network security, providing Blue Canopy with \u201caccess to SRA\u2019s proprietary information\u201d and knowledge of \u201chow the FDIC evaluated SRA\u2019s work.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-19\">Accordingly, on August 26, 2013, SRA filed a second protest with the GAO, citing two organizational conflicts of interest (\u201cOCI\u201d) resulting from Blue Canopy\u2019s FDIC work: (1) impaired objectivity; and (2) unequal access to information. Compl. \u00b6 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>On September 25, 2013, the GSA informed the GAO that Blue Canopy would not work on the ISC-3 Contract. Compl. \u00b620; PL Mem. Ex. F at A0110. SRA agreed that this resolved the impaired objectivity OCI, but not the unequal access to information conflict. Compl. \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In addition, SRA insisted that GAO proceed with the protest, because Section 11.9.1 of the Task Order Request also requires compliance with the FDIC ethics regulations, set forth in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 366.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6 28 (citing Section 11.9.1 of the Task Order Request). And, Section K of the Task Order Request further advises contractors that the failure to certify compliance with 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 366.1 \u201cshall result in the offeror being found non-responsible for award of this task order.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 29 (quoting Task Order Request, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 366.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On November 25, 2013, the GSA issued a Determination and Findings for Waiver of Organizational Conflict of Interest Rules (hereinafter the \u201cWaiver\u201d). PL Mem. Ex. A at A0002. The Waiver stated that \u201cFEDSIM believes that the application of the conflicts rules set forth in FAR subpart 9.5 to this [Task Order] is not in the Government\u2019s interest and that the waiver in accordance with ... FAR 9.503<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is appropriate.\u201d PL Mem. Ex. A at A0002. Consequently, on December 3, 2013, the GAO dismissed SRA\u2019s protest as \u201cacademic.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">On December 9, 2013, SRA filed a post-award bid protest Complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Count I seeks a declaration, under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), that the Waiver violated the FDIC\u2019s rules for ethics and conduct, set forth at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Tenth) and 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1822(f).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3 2, 38. Count II seeks a declaration that the Waiver violated FAR 9.503. Compl. \u00b646. Counts III and IV allege that CSC and Blue Canopy also submitted false and materially misleading certifications, in violation of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 366.1, requiring issuance of a permanent injunction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 54, 57, 61. The December 9, 2013 Complaint does not include a Count V. Count VI, however, seeks a declaration that the FDIC cannot make \u201can illegal award to an invalid offeror.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 65. Count VII seeks a temporary restraining order. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">On December 9, 2013, SRA also filed: a Motion For Temporary Restraining Order; a Motion For Preliminary Injunction; and a Motion For A Protective Order. SRA also filed a Memorandum of Points And Authorities In Support Of Plaintiffs Application For A Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">On December 11, 2013, the court convened a telephone conference to discuss jurisdictional issues raised in the December 9, 2013 Complaint and ordered the parties to brief the issue of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">On December 16, 2013, the Government filed a Motion to Dismiss. On December 20, 2013, SRA filed a Response. On December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>23, 2013, the Government filed a Reply, with leave of the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">III. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">A. Standard Of Review For Subject-Matter Jurisdiction, Pursuant To RCFC 12(b)(1) And 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">As a matter of law, the court must consider jurisdiction before reaching the substantive merits of a ease. <em>See Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 641, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (\u201cWhen a requirement goes to subject-matter jurisdiction, courts are obligated to consider <em>sua sponte </em>issues that the parties have disclaimed or have not presented.\u201d); <em>see also Special Devices, Inc. v. OEA, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 1340, 1342 (Fed.Cir. 2001) (\u201cJurisdiction is a threshold issue that the court may raise <em>sua sponte.\u201d); Holley v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1462, 1465 (Fed.Cir. 1997) (\u201cDetermination of jurisdiction starts with the complaint, which must be well-pleaded in that it must state the necessary elements of the plaintiffs claim, independent of any defense that may be interposed.\u201d); <em>View Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. Robotic Vision Sys., Inc., </em>115 F.3d 962, 963 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201c[C]ourts must always look to their jurisdiction, whether the parties raise the issue or not.\u201d). Subject-matter jurisdiction may be challenged \u201cat any time by the parties or by the court sua sponte.\u201d <em>Folden v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1344, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>RCFC 12(b)(1) (allowing parties to assert lack of subject-matter jurisdiction by motion); RCFC 12(h)(3) (\u201cIf the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u201d). When deciding a subject-matter jurisdiction challenge, the court \u201cmust accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiffs] favor.\u201d <em>Boyle v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">B. The Effect Of The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act On The Jurisdiction Of The United States Court Of Federal Claims To Adjudicate Bid Protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">The Tucker Act authorized the United States Court of Federal Claims</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (\u201cFASA\u201d),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> however, precludes the court from adjudicating protests \u201cin connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order,\u201d unless the protest is \u201con the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106(f);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>see also Bay-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>First Solutions LLC v. United States, </em>104 Fed.Cl. 493, 502 (2012) (\u201cThis court has consistently interpreted the [Section 4106(f) ] ban as prohibiting task order protests in this court on any grounds[,] other than the specific excepted allegations of excessive scope, period, or value of the proposed task order.\u201d). As to protests \u201cin connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order ____ valued in excess of $10,000,000,\" the FASA vests the Comptroller General of the GAO with exclusive jurisdiction. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106(f).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">1. The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The Government argues that the United States Court of Federal Claims consistently has dismissed bid protests that concern the issuance of a task order. Gov\u2019t Br. 11-12; <em>see also MORI Assocs., Inc. v. United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 33, 37-38 (2013) (dismissing a protest of an agency\u2019s decision to obtain services by issuing a task order); <em>Chameleon Integrated Servs. Inc. v. United States, </em>111 Fed.Cl. 564, 570-71 (2013) (determining that the court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate a bid protest concerning a task order); <em>Mission Essential Pers., LLC v. United States, </em>104 Fed.Cl. 170, 179 (2012) (\u201c[Corrective action relates to, and is connected with, the issuance of a task order.\u201d); <em>Solute Consulting v. United States, </em>103 Fed.Cl. 783, 791-94 (2012) (dismissing a challenge to an agency\u2019s evaluation of task order proposals); <em>DataMill, </em>91 Fed.Cl. at 761-62 (determining that the United States Army\u2019s decision to use a delivery order for a sole source procurement was \u201cin connection\u201d with a delivery order).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The Government contends that SRA\u2019s protest also concerns the issuance of a task order under the same kind of interagency GWAC for which the United States Court of Federal Claims previously has applied the FASA bar. Gov\u2019t Br. 12 (citing <em>Chameleon Integrated Servs., </em>111 Fed.Cl. at 571 (determining that a task order issued pursuant to an interagency GWAC is subject to the FASA ban, because the plaintiff \u201coffer[ed] no category other than FASA under which to treat the task order\u201d)). Nevertheless, \u201cSRA is attempting to bring a prohibited task order protest before this [cjourt.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 13-14 (citing, <em>e.g., </em>Compl. \u00b6 2 (\u201cThese certifications, and the absence of OCI, were expressly required by the [Task Order Request] and applicable FDIC regulations[.]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6 5 (\u201c[A]n award to CSC will deprive SRA of a task order[.]\u201d)). In addition, the relief requested in <em>Mission Essential Personnel, Chameleon Integrated Services, Bay-First Solutions, </em>and <em>DataMill </em>is the same as that sought here, <em>i.e., </em>in each case, the protestor requested that the court enjoin and set aside a task order award. In each case, however, the court correctly applied the FASA bar and \u201cdeclined to do so.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 14; <em>see also </em>Gov\u2019t Br. 15 (\u201cOnce it is understood that the ISC-3 procurement refers to GSA\u2019s task order request, FASA is plainly implicated and the lack of jurisdiction by this [c]ourt is confirmed.\u201d). In other words, because the relief requested by SRA implicates a task order, the court does not have jurisdiction. Gov\u2019t Br. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Moreover, the facts establish that \u201cthe OCI waiver at issue here was made in connection with and in furtherance of the issuance of a task order.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 16. The GSA\u2019s Senior Procurement Executive, approving the Waiver, found that the benefit of proceeding with the Task Order outweighed any alleged \u201cunsubstantiated residual possibility of an OCI in this situation.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 16 (quoting PI. Mem. Ex. A at A0011). In addition, the Alliant GWAC governing this Task Order authorizes a waiver, \u201cif the [CO] determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to issue the Order.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 17 (quoting Alliant GWAC \u00a7 H.9). Indeed, SRA also conceded that GAO has exclusive jurisdiction over the OCI and the subsequent Waiver, as the Task Order exceeded the $10,000,000 threshold. Gov\u2019t Br. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Finally, SRA\u2019s argument that the FASA bar does not apply to protests concerning violations of law or regulation \u201cin connection with a procurement\u201d (Pl.Mem. 14) \u201cis a misstatement of law.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 21. Only two exceptions exist: the increased scope, value or period exception; and the $10 million ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ception. Gov\u2019t Br. 21 (citing <em>Mission Essential Pers., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 177 n. 17 (\u201c[The] law provides for two exceptions to its general ban on task-order-related protests.\u201d)); <em>see also </em>Gov\u2019t Br. 26 (arguing that SRA could have challenged the Waiver during the 2013 GAO protest). To create an exception to challenge violations of law or regulation would obliterate the bar. Gov\u2019t Br. 21; <em>see also </em>Gov\u2019t Br. 23 (citing <em>BayFirst Solutions, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 505 (declining to adjudicate a protest, even where the procurement violated a regulation establishing a dollar ceiling for noncompeted task orders); <em>Mission Essential Pers., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 179 (same, where corrective action allegedly violated statutory and regulatory provisions); <em>DataMill, </em>91 Fed.Cl. at 762 (same, where an agency allegedly violated the Competition in Contracting Act)). In this ease, \u201call the violations of law and regulations [in SRA\u2019s Complaint] ... [are] derive[d] from the task order request itself.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">2. The Plaintiffs Response.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">SRA responds that this case challenges the Waiver, not the August 14, 2013 award of the Task Order to CSC. PI. Resp. 1-3. In issuing the Waiver, the GSA and FDIC violated several statutory and regulatory obligations. PI. Resp. 2 (citing Compl. Counts I, II, and III); <em>see also </em>PI. Resp. 5 (\u201cSRA addressed the independent obligations of FDIC law and regulation, as distinct from the terms of the Solicitation, throughout [SRA\u2019s] Complaint.\u201d). The United States Court of Federal Claims also has jurisdiction to review the Waiver, because \u201cFDIC\u2019s laws and regulations exist apart from the task order request and the task order.\u201d PI. Resp. 5; <em>see also </em>PI. Resp. 14-15 (citing <em>Emery Worldwide Airlines, Inc. v. United States, </em>264 F.3d 1071, 1080 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he [United States] Court of Federal Claims is the only judicial forum to bring any governmental contract procurement protest.\u201d)); <em>Novell, Inc. v. United States, </em>109 F.Supp.2d 22, 24 (D.D.C.2000) (\u201c[T]here no longer is ... an independent, APA-based jurisdiction for the district courts in government bid protest eases; rather, Congress effectively subsumed APA jurisdiction of the district courts into the more specific jurisdictional language of [the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996].\u201d). Although the GAO can \u201crecommend an appropriate remedy,\u201d GAO decisions \u201clack the force and effect of law, even where GAO finds a procurement violation.\u201d PI. Resp. 30 (citing 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554(b)-(e)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In this case, \u201cGAO offers no meaningful remedy.\u201d PL Resp. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The Tucker Act authorizes the United States Court of Federal Claims to adjudicate objections to: (a) solicitations; (b) awards; or (c) \u201cany alleged violation of a statue or regulation in connection with a procurement.\u201d PL Resp. 21 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1)). The FASA bar on bid protests \u201cin connection with the issuance of a task order\u201d corresponds to (b), precluding judicial review, where an award or proposed award concerns a task order. PL Resp. 21. That bar, however, does not affect (c), <em>i.e., </em>any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement. Pl. Resp. 21; <em>see also </em>PL Resp. 18-19 (citing <em>Distrib. Solutions, Inc. v. United States, </em>539 F.3d 1340, 1345-46 (Fed.Cir.2008) (holding that the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to review a bid protest of a task order that allegedly violated the Competition in Contracting Act\u2019s requirements)). In this case, SRA does not challenge GSA\u2019s award of the Task Order, but the <em>\u201cpost-award </em>decision\u201d by GSA to issue the Waiver. PL Resp. 19, 22-23 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">It is well established that the conduct at issue in this case is subject to judicial review when the \u201cconduct is segregable from the issuance or proposed issuance of a task order.\u201d PL Resp. 19 (citing <em>Distrib. Solutions, </em>539 F.3d 1340; <em>see also Global Computer Enters. v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 350, 410 (2009), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 466 (2009) (explaining that the FASA bar governs only the issuance or proposed issuance of a task order)). For example, in <em>McAfee v. United States, </em>111 Fed.Cl. 696 (2013), the court examined \u201c[t]he predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>for [the plaintiffs] claim\u201d and determined that the court had jurisdiction because the contractor did not challenge the delivery order, but rather a separate decision to shift to a sole source, standardized network security system. Pl. Resp. 23 (citing <em>McAfee, </em>111 Fed.Cl. at 707-08); <em>see also </em>Pl. Resp. 25 (citing <em>Global Computer Enters., </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 414-15 (exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate a modification to a task order); <em>Unisys Corp. v. United States, </em>90 Fed.Cl. 510, 517 (2009) (exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate a challenge to a decision to waive a stay provision during a GAO protest of a task order)).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Only \u201cwhere the protest challenges the issuance or prospective issuance of a task order\u201d does the FASA bar apply. Pl. Resp. 26 (citing <em>Chameleon Integrated Servs., </em>111 Fed.Cl. at 570-71 (applying the FASA bar to prohibit a challenge to corrective action made to a task order); <em>see also Mission Essential Pers., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 179 (\u201c[T]he Army\u2019s corrective action is ... intimately entwined with the issuance of the two initial task orders.\u201d)). In this case, \u201cSRA seeks relief [that] is simply not inextricably linked to the issuance or proposed issuance of a task order.\u201d Pl. Resp. 29. Instead, the relief requested is tied to specific alleged violations of law and regulation stemming from the issuance of the Waiver. Pl. Resp. 29. The Government\u2019s \u201cnovel proposition that asking for relief that might upset a task order award strips this [c]ourt of jurisdiction\u201d is an \u201codd rule\u201d that is not supported in law, regulation, or appellate precedent.

The Court\u2019s Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The threshold issue in this case is whether SRA\u2019s challenge to the Waiver is a protest <em>\u201cin connection with </em>the issuance or proposed issuance of a task ... order.\u201d <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106(f)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has interpreted the phrase \u201cin connection with,\u201d as used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), broadly. <em>See RAMCOR Servs. Group, Inc. v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 1286, 1289 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\u201cThe operative phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d [of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b) ] is very sweeping in scope.\u201d). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit also has held that, \u201c[u]nder [the <em>in pari materia </em>] canon, courts should interpret statutes with similar language that generally address the same subject matter together, \u2018as if they were one law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strategic Hous. Fin. Corp. of Travis County v. United States, </em>608 F.3d 1317, 1330 (Fed.Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Erlenbaugh v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 239, 243, 93 S.Ct. 477, 34 L.Ed.2d 446 (1972)). To be sure, the subject matter of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) and 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106(f) concern the bid protest jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims, but the Government does not argue that application of the <em>in pari materia </em>canon is appropriate here. In any event, the court reads the appellate court\u2019s \u201csweeping\u201d characterization of the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) as dicta. <em>See Global Computer Enters., </em>88 Fed. Cl. at 419 (\u201cThe [United States Court of Appeals for the] Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the phrases \u2018in connection with\u2019 and \u2018procurement\u2019 in the Tucker Act ultimately offer no guidance concerning the meaning of the phrases \u2018in connection with\u2019 and \u2018task order\u2019 in the FASA.\u201d); <em>cf. Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States, </em>575 F.3d 1352, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2009) (Dyk, J., dissenting) (limiting the scope of the military task order bar, codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2304c(e)(l) (similar to the FASA bar), to \u201cchallenges to the task order or delivery order,\u201d but not \u201cprotests of an overall solicitation or IDIQ contract\u201d). Instead, the court is persuaded that \u201ca careful analysis of the connectedness of each challenged procurement decision to the issuance or proposed issuance of a task order\u201d is required. <em>BayFirst Solutions, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 503; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[V]ariations in interpretation of the task order protest ban ... arise in the complex and distinct fact patterns of individual bid protests.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The gravamen of the Government\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge that the court\u2019s jurisdictional inquiry is not whether the alleged unlawful agency action is <em>related to </em>the issuance of a task order, but rather whether the alleged unlawful agency action was made <em>\u201cin connection with \u201d </em>the issuance of a task order. <em>See, e.g., </em>Gov\u2019t Br. 15 (\u201cOnce it is understood that the ISC-3 procurement <em>refers </em>to GSA\u2019s task order request, FASA is plainly implicated and the lack of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>by this Court is confirmed.\u201d (emphasis added)). In such circumstances, the court has exercised jurisdiction to adjudicate the lawfulness of a variety of actions <em>related </em>to a task order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For example, the court has determined that an agency decision to cancel a solicitation so it could transition contract services to another contractor by task order was \u201ca discrete procurement decision,\u201d not subject to the FASA bar. <em>See BayFirst Solutions, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 507. Although the cancellation and subsequent issuance of the task order nominally were \u201cconnected,\u201d the court exercised jurisdiction, because the agency\u2019s cancellation action still \u201ccould have been the subject of a separate protest.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 508 (citing <em>e-Management Consultants, Inc.; Centech Group, Inc., </em>B-40585.2, B-400585.3, 2009 CPD \u00b6 39, 2009 WL 416345 (Comp.Gen. Feb. 3, 2009) (allowing a challenge to the cancellation of a solicitation, but not allowing a challenge to the subsequent task order)). In addition, the court has determined that \u201c[djiserete, preliminary matters that may not necessarily lead to the proposed issuance of a task order,\u201d are not subject to the FASA bar. <em>See Mori </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 33, 38-39 (2013) (exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate a small business set aside); <em>see also Savantage Fin. Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>81 Fed.Cl. 300 (2008) (exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate a challenge to an agency\u2019s Brand Name Justification); <em>Weeks Marine, Inc. v. United States, </em>79 Fed.Cl. 22 (2007), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>575 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir.2009) (exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate a challenge to a decision to use task orders, instead of sealed bidding).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In this ease, the best evidence that the Waiver was not made \u201cin connection with\u201d the award of the Task Order to CSC is that fact that the Waiver was issued well after the award. \u201cProcurement decisions that are made <em>after </em>task orders have been issued\u201d are not subject to the FASA bar. <em>See Mori Assocs., </em>113 Fed.Cl. at 38 (citing <em>Global Computer Enters., </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 410-15 (exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate a modification of a task order)). In contrast, a challenge to an award of a task order is subject to the FASA bar. <em>See BayFirst Solutions, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 503. In this ease, the GSA, \u201cacting with the concurrence of the FDIC,\u201d waived the alleged conflict of interest, 102 days after the Task Order was awarded to CSC. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24- 25 (quoting the Waiver, PL Mem. Ex. A0002).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Another salient fact is that the text of FAR 9.503 includes the word \u201cmay,\u201d indicating that a decision as to whether to waive an OCI is a matter left to agency discretion. <em>See Turner Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>94 Fed.Cl. 561, 584 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>645 F.3d 1377 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201cThe [Government responds that the decision to waive [under FAR 9.503] is entirely discretionary and need not be documented____ The [Government is also correct ... [because the regulation] contains no hint of a requirement that an agency <em>must </em>waive or <em>must </em>document the reasons for a waiver decision.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Government Contract Guidebook \u00a7 3:35 (4th ed. 2013) (\u201cAgencies have discretion under FAR 9.503 to seek an OCI waiver.\u201d). Interestingly, in this case the GSA acknowledged that the Waiver may not have been necessary, regardless of the outcome of the GAO protest;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>[I]t should be noted that the waiver may prove unnecessary if the outcome of the GAO protest is favorable to the Government____ Conversely, if the outcome of the GAO protest is unfavorable to the Government on the non-OCI (technical evaluation) issue, the waiver may prove insufficient, as the non-OCI issues cannot be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">PI. Mem. Ex. A at A0009.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Therefore, not only is the Waiver in this case discretionary, it is also distinct\u2014in both a temporal and causal sense\u2014from the ISC-3 Task Order. It is true that prior to waiving an OCI, the CO must determine the existence of an OCI, a determination that \u201cdepends on the particular facts and circumstances of the contract being performed and on the nature of the new procurement.\u201d <em>See Jacobs Tech. Inc. v. United States, </em>100 Fed. Cl. 198, 210-11 (2011). That does not mean, however, that the Waiver had a \u201cdirect, causal relationship\u201d to the issuance of the Task Order. <em>See Mori Assocs., </em>113 Fed.Cl. at 38 (\u201cThere is no direct, causal relationship between these decisions and the issuance of task orders ... since the task orders had already issued.\u201d). In fact, the Waiver was not a necessary step towards issuance of the task order. Instead, the Waiver was a discretionary agency action to prevent GAO\u2019s review of the substance of SRA\u2019s protest. Thus, the Waiver is not similar to a corrective action that the court has found was \u201cintimately entwined\u201d and directly and causally linked to a series of task orders. <em>See Mission Essential Pers., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 178-79 (finding the task order bar applied to the challenged corrective action); <em>see also id. </em>at 179 (\u201c[T]he Army\u2019s corrective action <em>was </em>its decision to compete a new task order under the IDIQ [Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity] contract.\u201d). Here, SRA\u2019s challenge to the substantive merits of the Waiver parallels a challenge to the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cTSA\u201d) independent, discretionary decision to cancel an automatic stay of performance of a task order during the protest before the GAO. <em>See Unisys, </em>90 Fed.Cl. at 515-16. In <em>Unisys, </em>the court determined that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate TSA\u2019s decision to override an automatic stay, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), despite the FASA bar, because the court could \u201creview!] an agency\u2019s compliance with [The Competition in Contracting Act section] 3553 \u2018independent of any consideration of the merits of the underlying contract award.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517 (quoting <em>Planetspace Inc. v. United States, </em>86 Fed.Cl. 566, 567 (2009)). Although corrective action may be a necessary component for the issuance of a task order, discretionary agency waivers designed only to short-circuit substantive review of a task order are not necessary for the issuance. <em>Compare, e.g., Mission Essential Pers., </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 178-79 (finding corrective action to be \u201cintimately entwined\u201d with a series of task orders), <em>with Unisys, </em>90 Fed.Cl. at 515-16 (finding a decision to override an automatic stay in a task order protest to be independent from the task order itself).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">For these reasons, the court has determined that the Waiver in this case was not made \u201cin connection with\u201d the issuance of the Task Order, but was an independent discretionary agency action and therefore, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4106(f)(1) does not bar the court from adjudicating whether the Waiver otherwise violated APA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">IV. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The Government has represented that the \u201ccontinuing delay of the procurement is resulting in the loss of experienced staff from the [existing] SRA contract and a diminishing level of confidence in their ability to perform.\u201d PL Mem. Ex. L (11/19/13 Decl. of Russell G. Pittman, Director, FDIC Division of Information Technology). In light of the exigent circumstances and at the Government\u2019s request, the court has decided to request that the GAO issue an advisory opinion as to whether the Waiver violated APA standards and, if so, to adjudicate the merits of the August 26, 2013 protest no later than close of business, January 23, 2014, <em>i.e., </em>as if the Waiver had not issued. <em>See </em>4 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.II.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, the Clerk of the Court is directed to communicate with the GAO, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and to request an advisory opinion accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\">.
