RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-28\">On November 4, 1998, Davis Wetlands Bank, LLC (\u201cthe Bank\u201d), the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cthe Army Corps\u201d), the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (\u201cUSFWS\u201d), and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cVDEQ\u201d), established a wetlands mitigation bank,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to an Umbrella Memorandum of Agreement (\u201cUmbrella Agreement\u201d). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 19, Ex. B. The Umbrella Agreement \u201cestablish[ed] general provisions for the design, development, construction, use and monitoring of a compensatory wetland bank ... and ... a procedure for providing off-site compensation for unavoidable wetland impacts (primarily) in Southeastern Virginia.\u201d Compl. Ex. B at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">On November 24, 1998, a Site-Specific Plan for the Davis Wetland Bank (\u201cSite-Specific Plan\u201d) was implemented, that was revised on March 31, 1999. Compl. \u00b6 20 &amp; Ex. C. That plan required the Bank to \u201cbloek[ ] the drainage discharge from the site to increase the hydrology\u201d and \u201cplant[ ] thousands of free seedlings.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 28. On September 26, 2001, the signatories amended the Umbrella Agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b621 &amp; Ex. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Under the Final Agreement, the Bank committed to restore agricultural and forested areas to wetlands and preserve existing wetlands, as well as provide financial assurance for the Bank\u2019s performance. Compl. \u00b6 23 &amp; Ex. B at 5. In exchange, the Army Corps agreed to issue the Bank one wetland credit per 1.00 acre of restored cropland, 0.50 acres of restored previously-drained forest; or 7.5 acres of existing wetlands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Compl. Ex D. The Bank could then \u201csell credits to third parties as compensation mitigation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands that were permitted, pursuant to Section 404 [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344] of the [Clean Water Act].\u201d Compl. \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The Final Agreement also required that the Bank provide the Army Corps with an annual report for seven years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compl. Ex. C. At the end of the first 5-year monitoring period, \u201cthe credit composition [would] be reevaluated and may be adjusted to reflect maturation of the restored or created wetlands.\u201d Compl. Ex. B. On October 30, 2001, the Army Corps agreed to issue the Bank 389.9 credits, \u201csubject to the success of [the Bank\u2019s] restoration and creation efforts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6 39 &amp; Ex. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The Army Corps, however, suspended the performance of the wetlands bank from June 16, 2006 to September 8, 2009, because of \u201ca temporary property ownership dispute.\u201d Compl. \u00b629. During that time, the Bank continued to monitor and report on the restoration activities and, in 2009, provided a final progress report to the Army Corps. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Sometime in 2012, the Bank requested that the Army Corps issue an additional 139.5 credits to reflect the development of certain agricultural fields into mature forested wetlands. Compl. \u00b6 47. On August 24, 2012, however, the Army Corps denied that request. Compl. \u00b6 49, Ex. E, &amp; Ex. F.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">On April 15, 2013, the Bank filed a Complaint in the United States Court of Federal Claims alleging that the Army Corps\u2019 refusal to adjust credit composition to reflect the maturation of the restored agricultural fields into forested wetlands violated 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.8(o)(3), and breached the Final Agreement. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-53. Accordingly, the Bank seeks alleged damages for the Army Corps\u2019 refusal to issue the additional 139.5 credits, in the amount of $1,395,000. Compl. \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">On July 24, 2013, the Government filed a Motion To Dismiss. On August 23, 2013, the Bank filed a Response. On September 6, 2013, the Government filed a Reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">III. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">A. Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The United States Court of Federal Claims has \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act, however, is only a \u201cjurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). Therefore, in order to pursue a substantive right, a plaintiff must identify and plead an independent contractual relationship, constitutional provision, federal statute, and/or executive agency regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages for the court to have jurisdiction. <em>See Todd v. United States, </em>386 F.3d 1091, 1094 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201c[Jjurisdiction under the Tucker Act requires the litigant to identify a substantive right for money damages against the United States separate from the Tucker Act.\u201d); <em>see also Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc) (\u201cThe Tucker Act ... does not create a substantive cause of action; in order to come within the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages. In the parlance of Tucker Act cases, that source must be \u2018money-mandating.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">B. Standard Of Review For A Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To RCFC 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">A challenge to the United States Court of Federal Claims\u2019 \u201cgeneral power to adjudicate in specific areas of substantive law ____is properly raised by a [Rule] 12(b)(1) motion[.]\u201d <em>Palmer v. United States, </em>168 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed.Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d) 12(b)(1) (allowing a party to assert, by motion, \u201clack of subject-matter jurisdiction\u201d). When considering whether to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the court is \u201cobligated to assume all factual allegations of the complaint to be true and to draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Henke v. United States, </em>60 F.3d 795, 797 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">Nonetheless, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201c[Ojnce the [trial] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction [is] put in question ... [the plaintiff] bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>C. Standard Of Review For A Motion To Dismiss Pursuant To RCFC 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">A challenge to the United States Court of Federal Claims\u2019 \u201c[ability] to exercise its general power with regard to the facts peculiar to the specific claim ... is raised by a [Rule] 12(b)(6) motion[.]\u201d <em>Palmer, </em>168 F.3d at 1313; <em>see also </em>RCFC 12(b)(6) (\u201cEvery defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading____ But a party may assert the following defenses by motion: ... (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">When considering whether to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim, the court must assess whether \u201ca claim has been stated adequately\u201d and then whether \u201cit may be supported by [a] showing [of] any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 563, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations must be substantial enough to raise the right to relief \u201cabove the speculative level,\u201d accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">D. Issues Raised In The Government\u2019s July 24, 2013 Motion To Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">1. Whether The Court Has Jurisdiction To Adjudicate Breach Of Contract Claims Arising From The Final Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">a. The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The Government advances two arguments in support of the Motion To Dismiss, pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1). First, the court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims alleged in the April 15, 2013 Complaint under the Tucker Act, because the Final Agreement is not a contract. Gov\u2019t Mot. 6-8. Second, the court does not have jurisdiction, because the Final Agreement does not contemplate money damages as a remedy. Gov\u2019t Mot. 8-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">A clear indication of intent to contract must be found before concluding a contract has been formed. Gov\u2019t Mot. 6 (citing <em>D &amp; N Bank v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2003)). The Government, however, insists that the Final Agreement was not a contract but \u201ca regulatory instrument,\u201d the purpose of which was to \u201cestablish general provisions for the design [and] development ... of a compensatory wetland bank[.]\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 7. The Army Corps\u2019 actions to \u201ceffectuate regulatory proclamations\u201d and \u201cexercise the Government\u2019s sovereign function does not signify intent to contract.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 6 (citing <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>344 F.3d 1343, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2003); <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d at 1378).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">More specifically, the Government contends that the Army Corps\u2019 role in the Final Agreement was in the nature of a regulator and supervisor, <em>i.e. </em>to verify \u201cthe geographic parameters of the proposed mitigation bank, ... over[see] ... the project, establish criteria that [the Bank] must follow to obtain credits, adjudge the suitability for a particular compensation proposal or compensation site, determine appropriate credit composition ratios, and generally inform [the Bank of non-compliance].\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 7 (internal citations and quotations omitted). As such, the Army Corps was not a party to the Final Agreement, but the regulation. Gov\u2019t Mot. 7 (citing <em>Hearts Bluff Game Ranch, Inc. v. United States, </em>669 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed.Cir. 2012) (\u201cThe mitigation bank program is run exclusively by the [Army] Corps, subject to its pervasive control, and no landowner can develop a mitigation bank absent [its] approval.\u201d)). And, the Final Agreement is a \u201cregulatory arrangement[ ],\u201d not a contract. Gov\u2019t Mot. 8. In fact, the Government suggests that the court should view the Final Agreement as a permit. Gov\u2019t Reply 1-2 (citing <em>Hearts Bluff Game Ranch, </em>669 F.3d at 1331 (referring to an application to establish a mitigation bank as a \u201cpermit\u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>39 F.2d 851, 856 (C.C.A. 1930) (\u201cIn general, a license is not a contract.\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009) (defining \u201cpermit\u201d as a \u201clicense\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">Only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d may a court construe a permit to be a contract. Gov\u2019t Reply 3 (citing <em>Son Broadcasting, Inc. v. United States, </em>52 Fed.Cl. 815 (2002) (find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ing that a Special Use Permit, together with an incorporated Site Plan, concerning the development of mountaintop broadcasting towers in a national forest was a contract)). In this case, the Final Agreement, unlike a contract, limits transferability. Gov\u2019t Reply 4 (citing <em>Hage v. United States, </em>35 Fed.Cl. 147, 166-67 (1996) (stating that nontransferability weighs in favor of finding a permit to be a license, not a contract)). The Army Corps also maintained a \u201cunilateral right to suspend activity under the [Final Agreement],\u201d if the Army Corps determined that the Bank did not meet certain requirements. Gov\u2019t Reply 4 (citing <em>Hage, </em>35 Fed.Cl. at 166-67). In addition, the Final Agreement affords the Army Corps \u201cthe right to inspect, oversee, penalize, and generally manage and police, while [the Bank] is given little, if any, commensurate rights and privileges.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 4 (citing <em>Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp. v. Hathaway, </em>936 F.2d 601, 604 (1st Cir.1991) (treating a permit as a contract, where the terms did not grant \u201csome special advantage\u201d to the Government)); <em>see also </em>Gov\u2019t Reply 5-7 (arguing that the Final Agreement includes no reciprocal obligations by the Army Corps). In other words, this is not a case where the permittee\u2019s substantial capital investments create an inference of intent to contract, because \u201cthe only security offered ... is ... a staggered release of credits upon approval by the [Army] Corps for [the Bank] achieving various benchmarks in the creatfed] wetlands.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In the alternative, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Final Agreement is a contract, it does not contemplate the remedy of monetary damages, because the words \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cdamage\u201d are not included in the Final Agreement. Gov\u2019t Mot. 8 (citing <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d at 1378 (\u201c[T]he intent to contract ... is implausible because none of the documents ... mentions goodwill or the accounting treatment thereof.\u201d)). Instead, in this case, the Bank attempts to transform its demand for additional credits into a demand for money damages. Gov\u2019t Mot. 10. The only relief contemplated by the Final Agreement is \u201cnonmonetary,\u201d namely \u201ccredit adjustments under the Disputes Resolution Clause.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 9. Thus, \u201cthe only relief [the Bank] can rightly seek is extra credits____ [and t]he proper forum for such a dispute is the district courts.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 10.</p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">b. The Plaintiff\u2019s Response.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The Bank responds that the Final Agreement is an enforceable government contract and any claims arising thereunder are within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Pl. Resp. 4 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1)). The Army Corps wanted to protect ecological health and water quality. In response, the Bank agreed to \u201cdesign, construct and maintain [a] wetlands bank\u201d in exchange for mitigation credits that could be sold to third parties. Pl. Resp. 4-5. This was an \u201cexchange of consideration between parties\u201d memorialized in a \u201cmulti-page written agreement.\u201d Pl. Resp. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">The Umbrella Agreement, the Site-Specific Plan, and subsequent amendments reflect mutual obligations, rights, and responsibilities evidencing a contract. Pl. Resp. 5. For example, Section IX of the Final Agreement states that \u201c[t]he terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto.\u201d Compl. Ex. B at 13 (Umbrella Agreement). Section IX thereof contains an integration clause, allows only written modifications, and restricts third-party claims. Pl. Resp. 5-6 (citing Compl. Ex. B at 14-15 (Umbrella Agreement)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">Irrespective of what definition one choses, the Final Agreement includes all elements of a contract. Pl. Resp. 6-7 (citing <em>Harbert/Lummus Agrifuels Projects v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 1429, 1434 (Fed.Cir.1998) (holding that an express government contract is evidenced by: mutual intent; an exchange of consideration; and lack of ambiguity in offer and acceptance); <em>Buchanan v. Doe, </em>246 Va. 67, 72, 431 S.E.2d 289 (1993) (defining a contract as an agreement between two or more persons that obligates them to do or not do a specific thing)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this case, mutual understanding exists, because the Final Agreement sets forth the signatories\u2019 \u201crela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tive rights and duties regarding future performance related to design, construction and maintenance of the wetlands bank and the credit compensation to be provided ... in exchange for such performance.\u201d PL Resp. 7. And, Section IX(J) of the Final Agreement authorizes the signatories \u201cto seek enforcement hereof.\u201d PL Resp. 7 (quoting Compl. Ex. B at 15 (Umbrella Agreement)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The assertion that the Final Agreement is a \u201cregulatory pronouncement\u201d is not supported by the eases cited by the Government. PL Resp. 7 (citing <em>Anderson, </em>344 F.3d 1343; <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d 1374). In <em>Anderson, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was not a party to a contract when it issued a resolution that approved a bank merger, but instead was a regulator. PL Resp. 8-9 (citing <em>Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1357). In this ease, the Final Agreement does not only approve of a wetlands bank, but sets forth \u201ca mutual and detailed agreement\u201d and \u201cevidences the [Army] Corps\u2019 agreement to award specific credits for specific types of wetlands restoration within the bank.\u201d PL Resp. 9. Because \u201cthe analysis in <em>D &amp; N Bank </em>is essentially the same [as in <em>Anderson </em>] and <em>Anderson </em>relies on <em>D &amp; N Bank,\" </em>that case is similarly inapposite to \u201cthe facts and agreement in the case at bar.\u201d PL Resp. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In addition, as the Government concedes, contracts \u201cgenerally are presumed to create a substantive right to damages as a remedy.\u201d PL Resp. 10 (quoting Gov\u2019t Mot. 9). Therefore, according to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1303 (2011), \u201cwhen a breach of contract claim is brought in the [United States] Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, the plaintiff comes armed with the presumption that money damages are available, so that normally no further inquiry is required.\u201d PL Resp. 12 (quoting <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1314). In fact, a government contract expressly must disavow money damages to avoid this presumption. PL Resp. 12 (citing <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1314). Here, the Final Agreement contemplates money damages, because the Army Corps was well aware that the Bank sold the credits to third parties, and thus any breach \u201cwould inherently affect the monetary compensation [the Bank] could derive from ... the wetlands bank.\u201d PL Resp. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"Amt\">c. The Court\u2019s Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Common law governs the contractual relationship between a private party and the United States. <em>See United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 871, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996) (explaining that \u201cordinary principles of contract construction and breach ... [that apply] to any contract action between private parties\u201d govern a contract with the Government); <em>Perry v. United States, </em>294 U.S. 330, 352, 55 S.Ct. 432, 79 L.Ed. 912 (1935) (\u201cWhen the United States, with constitutional authority, makes contracts, it has rights and incurs responsibilities similar to those of individuals who are parties to such instruments.\u201d). Accordingly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that \u201cjurisdiction under the Tucker Act requires the litigant to identify a substantive right for money damages against the United States separate from the Tucker Act itself.\u201d <em>See Todd, </em>386 F.3d at 1094. An express contract with the Government entails the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">(1) mutuality of intent to contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">(2) lack of ambiguity in offer and acceptance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">(3) consideration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">(4) a government representative having actual authority to bind United States in contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-15\"><em>Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1352; <em>see also Massie v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 1184, 1188 (Fed. Cir.1999) (\u201c[A]ny agreement can be a contract within the meaning of the Tucker Act, provided that it meets the requirements for a contract with the Government.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">First, contract formation requires \u201can objective manifestation of voluntary, mutual assent.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1353 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u00a7 18 (1981)). In other words, there must be a \u201cclear indication of intent to contract and the other requirements for concluding that a contract was formed.\u201d <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">A good example is found in <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>where a Bank Board Resolution was deemed not to be a product of negotiation between the two parties, but only a memorialization of the Board\u2019s approval of a merger between D &amp; N Bank and another thrift bank. <em>See </em>331 F.3d at 1379; <em>see also Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1357 (same). In this case, unlike <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>the Final Agreement indicates a clear intent by the Army Corps to contract, and imposes mutual obligations on both parties. Compl. Ex. B at 11 (Umbrella Agreement) (\u201cBank Sponsor shall be responsible for maintaining the Bank in perpetuity[.]\u201d); Compl. Ex.

[t]o satisfy its burden to prove ... mutuality of intent.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1353; <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 22(1) (\u201cThe manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange ordinarily takes the form of an offer or proposal by one party followed by an acceptance by the other party or parties.\u201d). In this case, the Final Agreement contains definite terms and recites the obligations contained and acceptance manifested by the signatures from a Bank representative, a District Engineer for the Army Corps, and a representative from USFWS. The documents and exhibits that together comprise the Final Agreement were reviewed and signed by the parties over the course of several years, suggesting a negotiated arms-length process. This ongoing process, culminating in the parties signing three separate agreements, represents \u201cthe manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1353 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">As consideration for the Bank\u2019s promise to restore wetlands subject to the Final Agreement, the Army Corps promised to issue the Bank credits, each now allegedly valued at $10,000 (Compl.\u00b6 51).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Mountjoy, </em>280 Va. 46, 53, 694 S.E.2d 598, 602 (2010) (\u201cConsideration is, in effect, the price bargained for and paid for a promise. It may be in the form of a benefit to the party promising or a detriment to the party to whom the promise is made.\u201d) (quoting <em>Brewer v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Danville, </em>202 Va. 807, 815, 120 S.E.2d 273 (1961)). In addition, under Virginia law, the Bank\u2019s substantial remediation efforts investments are sufficient consideration for the Army Corps\u2019 promise to award marketable credits. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Government is mistaken in minimizing the substantial investment that the Bank has undertaken (Gov\u2019t Reply 5-7), including the set-aside of a large number of acres of land, restoration of the land, and promises of long-term maintenance of that land. <em>See, e.g., </em>Compl.

To distinguish a regulatory proclamation from a contract, the court may examine \u201cresolutions, forbearance letters, assistance agreements, and supervisory action agreements to see if they consist of only regulatory proclamations, or if they include additional language, which clearly manifests the government\u2019s intention to contract.\u201d <em>First Fed. Lincoln Bank v. United States, </em>60 Fed.Cl. 501, 503-04 (2004); <em>cf. Anderson, </em>344 F.3d at 1358 (citing <em>First Commerce Corp. v. United States, </em>335 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2003)). The fact that \u201cno landowner can develop a mitigation bank absent [Army] Corps approval,\u201d does not preclude the Army Corps from contracting with a private party.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Hearts Bluff Game Ranch, </em>669 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Nor is the Government correct that the absence of words such as \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cdamage\u201d preclude the remedy of money damages. \u201c[I]n a contract case, the money-mandating requirement for Tucker Act jurisdiction normally is satisfied by the presumption that money damages are available for breach of contract, with no further inquiry being necessary.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1314. The Government has cited no explicit language in the Final Agreement that overcomes the presumption of money damages, because none exists. To the contrary, explicit language in the Final Agreement and in communications between the parties manifests the Army Corps\u2019 intention to enter into a contractual relationship with the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">For these reasons, the court has determined that it has jurisdiction to adjudicate the alleged breach of contract claims in the April 15, 2013 Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">2. Whether The April 15, 2013 Complaint Pled A Breach Of Contract Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">a. The Government\u2019s Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">The Government also argues that the Bank did not sufficiently plead a breach of contract claim, requiring the court to dismiss the April 15, 2013 Complaint, pursuant RCFC 12(b)(6). Gov\u2019t Mot. 10-11. First, the Bank did not allege a contractual duty by the Army Corps to adjust credit composition. Gov\u2019t Mot. 11. The relevant provision of the Final Agreement states: \u201cthe credit composition ... may be adjusted to reflect the maturation of the restored or created wetlands.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 12 (quoting Compl. Ex. B at 11 (Umbrella Agreement)); <em>see also </em>Gov\u2019t Mot. 12 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l By-Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 1256, 1264 (Ct.Cl.1969) (\u201c[F]or a government representation ... to be binding as a contractual obligation, it must have been in the form of an undertaking rather than a mere prediction or statement of opinion or intention.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Second, the Government\u2019s \u201ccontinued willingness to discuss an adjustment of the credit composition\u201d cannot be construed as a breach of duty. Gov\u2019t Mot. 14 (citing Compl. Ex. F).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Third, the Bank has claimed speculative damages based on a \u201cfair market value\u201d of $10,000 per credit. Gov\u2019t Mot. 15 (citing <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1012, 1023 (Fed.Cir.1996) (declining to award speculative damages)). The Bank\u2019s valuation, however, \u201cmakes the implausible assumption that [the Bank] could have sold those credits on top of the cache of credits it hasn\u2019t sold.\u201d Gov\u2019t Mot. 15 (citing Compl. \u00b6 51).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">b. The Plaintiff's Response.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The Bank responds that, because the Army Corps breached its contractual duty to adjust credit composition, the suggestion that \u201cnegotiations\u201d are ongoing is not accurate, and the damages claimed are the foreseeable loss of profits. PI. Resp. 20, 22. The only reasonable interpretation of the Final Agreement at issue, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe credit composition will be reevaluated and may be adjusted to reflect maturation\u201d (Comp. Ex. B at 11), is that \u201cthe provision <em>obligates </em>the [Army] Corps to adjust the credit composition, if the required reevaluation reflects a different outcome than the breakdown contemplated by the parties prior to construction of the wetlands bank.\u201d PI. Resp. 17 (emphasis in original). To interpret that text of the Final Agreement as an option within the discretion of the Army Corps \u201cflies in the face of the entire purpose of the agreement and ... renders the phrase meaningless surplusage.\u201d PI. Resp. 17; <em>see also id. </em>at 16 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l By-Prods., </em>405 F.2d 1256 (requiring that the text of a contract be construed in context)); <em>United Int\u2019l Investigative Servs. v. United States, </em>109 F.3d 734, 737 (Fed.Cir.1997) (holding that a contract must be interpreted, \u201cas a whole and in a manner which gives reasonable meaning to all its parts\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). Moreover, applicable federal regulations require that the wetland mitigation banks\u2019 credits reflect actual site conditions. PI. Resp. 18 (citing 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 332.8(o)(3) (\u201cThe number of [wetland mitigation bank] credits must reflect the difference between pre- and post-compensatory mitigation project site conditions.\u201d)); 60 Fed. Reg. at 58,612 (\u201cThe number of available credits in a mitigation bank may need to be adjusted to reflect actual conditions.\u201d). In addition, as a matter of law, Virginia courts have construed \u201cmay\u201d as a mandatory term. PI. Resp. 18-20 (citing <em>Martin v. Howard, </em>273 Va. 722, 727, 643 S.E.2d 229 (2007) (construing \u201cmay\u201d as mandatory in a statute allowing for exhumation of a body for genetie testing)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Second, the August 24,2012 email does not evidence ongoing negotiations, but instead the Army Corps\u2019 attempt to impose additional requirements on the Bank not included in the Final Agreement. PI. Resp. 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Third, the amount of damages incurred by the Bank has been addressed in <em>Neely v. United States, </em>285 F.2d 438, 443 (Ct.Cl.1961), wherein the United States Court of Claims held that lost profits were compensable damages. <em>See Neely, </em>285 F.2d at 443 (explaining that, in certain circumstances, \u201closs of [sic] anticipated profits____is a recognized measure of damages\u201d). In addition, <em>Wells Fargo Bank, </em>cited by the Government, supports the Banks\u2019 position that the loss of profits tied to the loss of credits \u201cwere foreseeable at the time the parties entered into the Agreement.\u201d PI. Resp. 21-22 (citing <em>Wells Fargo Bank, </em>88 F.3d at 1023).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">c. The Court\u2019s Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">For a claim to survive a motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6), it must be supported by more than merely speculative factual allegations, but the court also must make all reasonable inferences.in favor of the plaintiff. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Interpretation of a contract starts with the plain language, interpreted in light of the context, and giving \u201creasonable meaning to all its parts.\u201d <em>United Int\u2019l Investigative Servs., </em>109 F.3d at 737 (quoting <em>Granite Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 998, 1003 (Fed.Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">In this case, the plain language of the Final Agreement supports the Bank\u2019s allegation (Comply 50) that the Army Corps had a duty to fairly consider adjustments to the credit compensation. Compl. Ex. B at 11 (Umbrella Agreement) (\u201c[A]t the end of the 5-year monitoring period ..., the credit composition will be reevaluated and may be adjusted to reflect maturation of the restored or created wetlands.\u201d). The April 15, 2013 Complaint also alleges that the Army Corps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>acknowledged that the forested wetlands at issue matured. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the Army Corps breached the Final Agreement by not fairly and reasonably considering an adjustment to the credits at that time. Of course, the underlying factual issue of whether the Army Corp acted reasonably cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., TrinCo Inv. Co v. United States, </em>722 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2013) (\u201cTo avoid dismissal under [RCFC] 12(b)(6), a party need only plead ... with facts sufficient to nudge \u2018claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955)). Although the word \u201cmay\u201d appears to give the Army Corps\u2019 discretion in adjusting the credit composition, that does not relieve the Army Corps from its obligation to issue credits, and the text of the Final Agreement does not state an \u201copinion or intention.\u201d <em>Cf. Nat\u2019l By-Prods., </em>405 F.2d at 1264 (\u201c[F]or a government representation ... to be binding as a contractual obligation, it must have been in the form of an undertaking rather than a mere prediction or statement of opinion or intention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Therefore, whether the Army Corps denied the Bank\u2019s request for a credit adjustment is a factual inquiry that cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss. <em>See Bradley v. Chiron Corp., </em>136 F.3d 1317, 1321 (Fed. Cir.1998) (When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201cfactual statements in the complaint are accepted as true ____ [and dismissal] is proper only when, on the complainant\u2019s version of the facts, the premises of a cognizable claim have not been stated.\u201d). The Complaint alleges that the August 24, 2012 email contains that denial. Compl. \u00b649. The August 24, 2012 email states that the Army Corps does not support \u201cissuing additional credit to the bank merely because the project ... is an ecological success.\u201d Compl. Ex. E at 1. To the extent that the Army Corps suggested other ways in which the Bank could generate additional credits, that is beside the point. Compl. Ex. E at 1 (\u201cAdditional compensatory mitigation credits could be generated from this site through additional real estate protection.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The August 24, 2012 email evidences that the Army Corps denied the Bank\u2019s request to issue credits, and, therefore, is sufficient to overcome the Government\u2019s Motion To Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Finally, although the Government argues that $10,000 per credit of damages (Comply 51) is speculative, this is not grounds for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">IV. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">For these reasons, the Government\u2019s July 24, 2013 Motion To Dismiss is denied. The court will contact the parties to convene a status conference to discuss discovery and a trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-16\">.
