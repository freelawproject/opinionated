(\u201cNextec\u201d) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in connection with the alleged infringement of six patents held by Nextec relating to the manufacture of treated fabrics. Nextec alleges in its complaint that the government, through its acceptance, receipt, and/or use of military uniforms containing fabrics manufactured by Brookwood Companies, Inc. (\u201cBrookwood\u201d), infringed one or more of the claims in Nextec\u2019s patents. Pri- or to filing the present case, Nextec had filed suit directly against Brookwood in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court dismissed several of Nextee\u2019s claims, including the infringement claims based on fabrics sold directly or indirectly to- the United States. <em>Nextec Applications v. Brookwood Cos., </em>No. 07-CV-6901 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2009). Ultimately, the district court ruled against Nextec on its remaining infringement claims. <em>Nextec Applications v. Brookwood Cos., </em>703 F.Supp.2d 390 (S.D.N.Y.2010). That decision was affirmed on appeal by the Federal Circuit on November 18, 2013. <em>Nextec Applications v. Brookwood Cos., </em>Nos. 2012-1670, 2012-1685, 2013 WL 6050870 (Fed.Cir. Nov. 18, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">The government has moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint in its entirety for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on the patent infringement lawsuit Nextec had filed against Brookwood in district court. The government argues that because the plaintiff had a case \u201cfor or in respect to\u201d the same claim in another court at the time that this ease was filed, this court is barred under \u00a7 1500 from hearing this case. According to the government, both this case and the district court case involve the same operative facts because the allegedly infringing fabric in both eases was manufactured for garments that were intended for purchase by the United States, even though some of those garments ultimately were sold commercially instead. As such, the government concludes, the pending complaint is barred under \u00a7 1500.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">The plaintiff contends that \u00a7 1500 does not apply to the pending case for two reasons. Nextec argues that it did not file its case in this court until after the district court had dismissed all claims against Brookwood for which the United States could have been liable under \u00a7 1498(a), and thus Nextec did not file the present action while it had an action pending against the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 1500. In addition, Nextec argues that \u00a7 1500 is not a bar because this case involves infringement claims based on patents that were never at issue in the district court litigation. Nextec contends that in such circumstances the infringement claims involve different operative facts and thus \u00a7 1500 is not a bar to the pending suit. For the reasons discussed below, the court agrees with plaintiff and DENIES the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>dant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The present ease has its roots in United States Army Contract No. W911 QY-07D0003 (\u201c0003 Contract\u201d or \u201cContract\u201d). The request for bids for the 0003 Contract was issued by the United States Army to create an Extreme Cold Weather Clothing System. The system is a collection of multiple levels of clothing to be worn under varying weather conditions. At the time that the 0003 Contract request for bids was issued, the plaintiff and Brookwood were identified as authorized sources of fabric that would fit the initial specifications of the contract. The contract was awarded to ADS, Inc. (\u201cADS\u201d), which subcontracted with the plaintiff and with Brookwood for the manufacture of certain fabrics. Both companies manufactured fabrics and delivered them to garment manufacturers, who made the fabrics into garments and delivered the garments to ADS. ADS then assembled packs of clothing and delivered the packs to the United States Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The plaintiff filed a suit against Brookwood on July 31, 2007 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging four counts of patent infringement in the manufacture and sale of the same type of fabrics as were eventually sold to the United States. In the district court, Nextec alleged the infringement of seven patents by Brook-wood, numbered 5,418,051 (\u201cthe \u2019051 patent\u201d); 5,856,245 (\u201cthe \u2019245 patent\u201d); 5,869,-172 (\u201cthe 172 patent\u201d); 6,071,602 (\u201cthe \u2019602 patent\u201d); 6,129,978 (\u201cthe \u2019978 patent\u201d); 5,954,902 (\u201cthe \u2019902 patent\u201d); and 6,289,841 (\u201cthe \u2019841 patent\u201d). Nextec did not reference ADS or the 0003 Contract in its district court complaint. The district court ordered that Nextec narrow the specific patent claims that it alleged were infringed by Brookwood, after which ten claims from four patents remained. These claims were from the \u2019051, 172, \u2019902, and \u2019841 patents; the other patents were dismissed in their entirety. Thereafter, Brookwood filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that a substantial portion of the allegedly-infringing fabrics were produced as part of the 0003 Contract, entitling it to immunity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a). On January 6, 2009, the district court granted Brookwood\u2019s motion to the extent that the fabrics were delivered to and accepted by the United States, leaving only commercially-sold fabrics before the district court. Specifically, the district court stated in its January 6, 2009 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">All claims asserted by Plaintiff [Nextec] in the present action for the alleged infringement of any product claims in the asserted patents-in-suit, based on the manufacture and sale by Brookwood of fabrics in furtherance of [the Contract] are hereby dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a), except where the record shows that certain fabrics were not delivered to and accepted by the United States Government under the Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-11\"><em>Nextec Applications, Inc. v. Brookwood Cos., </em>No. 07-CV-6901 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2009).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nextec did not appeal from this order. On March 31, 2010, the district court granted Brookwood\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the construction of the term \u201cthixotropic\u201d as applied to the remaining patents, holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that Brookwood did not infringe the \u2019051 and \u2019172 patents. Finally, on June 21, 2012, after five weeks of trial, the district court found that Brookwood did not infringe Nextee\u2019s \u2019902 and \u2019841 patents. On September 12, 2012, Nextec filed an appeal challenging the district court\u2019s claim construction and findings of non-infringement. As noted above, the Federal Circuit recently affirmed the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">On April 5, 2013, while the appeal of the district court\u2019s decisions was pending, Nextec filed the present case in the United States Court of Federal Claims. In its complaint, Nextec alleged the infringement of six patents, including the \u2019172, \u2019978, \u2019902, and \u2019841 patents, in connection with the manufacture and sale of fabrics to the United States under the 0003 Contract. In addition, Nextec alleged the infringement of patents numbered 5,004,643 (\u201cthe \u2019643 patent\u201d) and 5,876,792 (\u201cthe \u2019792 patent\u201d) in connection with the same manufacture and sale of fabrics to the United States under the 0003 Contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Infringement of these latter patents was not alleged in the earlier district court litigation. As noted, Nextec has dismissed all infringement claims involving the patents that were at issue before the district court. Thus, only the product claims asserted in Claims 1 and 4 remain before this court, dealing with the \u2019643 and \u2019978 patents, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A3o\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q2\">The court reviews the government\u2019s motion to dismiss under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 under the standards set for motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d). <em>See Brandt v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir.2013) (citing <em>United States v. Tohono O\u2019Odham Nation, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1723, 179 L.Ed.2d 723 (2011) for the proposition that \u201c[w]here \u00a7 1500 applies, the Court of Federal Claims lacks subject matter jurisdiction and must dismiss the complaint.\u201d). The standards for ruling on such a motion are well established. Jurisdiction is a threshold matter, and a case can proceed no further if a court lacks the jurisdiction to hear it. <em>See Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (\u201c[W]hen a federal court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). <em>See generally John R. Sand &amp; Gravel v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 130, 128 S.Ct. 750, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008), <em>aff'g </em>457 F.3d 1345 (2006). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Alder Terrace, Inc. v. United States, </em>161 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.1998) (citing <em>McNutt v. Gen. Motors, </em>298 U.S. 178, 189, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936)), and must do so by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Brandt, </em>710 F.3d at 1374 (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>303 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed.Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">When a party has moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cthe allegations stated in the complaint are taken as true____\u201d <em>Folden v. United States, </em>379 F.3d 1344, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Shearin v. United States, </em>992 F.2d 1195, 1195-96 (Fed.Cir.1993)). However, the court may look beyond the pleadings and \u201cinquire into jurisdictional facts\u201d to determine whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">B. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 prevents a plaintiff from pursuing what is essentially the same case in multiple jurisdictions against the United States or its proxy. As noted above, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-15\">The United States Court of Federal Claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any other court any suit or process against the United States or any person who, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500. Under \u00a7 1500, dismissal is mandated if three requirements are met. First, the defendant in both lawsuits must be the United States or a person or entity acting or professing to act directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States. <em>See Brandt, </em>710 F.3d at 1373-74 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500). Second, the two suits must share the same operative facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1374 (quoting <em>Tohono, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1731). Third, the action must be pending in another court when the suit is filed in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Trusted Integration v. United States, </em>659 F.3d 1159, 1163-64 (Fed. Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">To begin, the court turns briefly to the history and purpose of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500. Congress enacted \u00a7 1500 in response to a problem that arose after the Civil War. <em>See Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993). Claimants whose property had been seized during the war filed suits in the Court of Claims under the Abandoned Property Collection Act. <em>Id. </em>The claimants then separately filed suits in other courts against federal officials alleging different, but closely related, causes of action based on those seizures. <em>Id. </em>(citing Schwartz, Section 1500 of the Judicial Code and Duplicate Suits Against the Government and Its Agents, 55 Geo. L.J. 573, 574-80 (1967)). Section 1500 was enacted to protect the United States from the complications of defending itself in multiple lawsuits in separate fora relating to the same subject matter, including the possibility of double recovery by a plaintiff for a single act by the United States. <em>Brandt, </em>710 F.3d at 1374 (\u201cAs the Supreme Court recently explained, \u00a7 1500 \u2018effects a significant jurisdictional limitation\u2019 and was designed to \u2018save the Government from burdens of redundant litigation.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Tohono, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1723, 179 L.Ed.2d 723 (2011))); <em>Trusted Integration, </em>659 F.3d at 1170 (\u201cFinally, our conclusion that Count II and the district court complaint are not for or in respect to the same claim, is consistent with the purpose of the predecessor to \u00a7 1500, which was to prevent claimants from seeking double recovery by maintaining two suits arising from the same factual foundation, but pleaded under different legal theories.\u201d). Under \u00a7 1500, a claimant must choose between filing against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims for monetary damages or against the United States or its proxy in district court for other relief. <em>See Tohono, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1730 (\u201cThere is no merit to the Nation\u2019s assertion that the interpretation adopted here cannot prevail because it is unjust, forcing plaintiffs to choose between partial remedies available in different courts.\u201d). If the plaintiff has sought relief relating to the same subject matter in another court, it may not seek compensation in the Court of Federal Claims while that prior case is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">C. Section 1500 Does Not Bar Nextec\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">In deciding whether Nextec may maintain its present case, the court turns first to Nextee\u2019s contention that a case against the United States was neither directly or indirectly pending in the district court at the time that the present action was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Nextec argues that \u00a7 1500 does not bar its action in this court because at the time it filed the present case the district court had dismissed all of Nextee\u2019s claims in connection with the manufacture or sale of the allegedly infringing fabric to the United States based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a). For this reason, Nextec argues, the only issues before the district court\u2014and, at the time the present case was filed, the Federal Circuit\u2014related to commercial sales that occurred outside of any government contractual relationship. In such circumstances, Nextec contends, there was no lawsuit pending against the United States or a person or entity acting directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States when it filed the pending suit. Thus, Nextec concludes, the present action is not barred by \u00a7 1500.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">The government argues that the fact that certain claims were dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a) in the district court is irrel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>evant for the purpose of applying \u00a7 1500 because the infringement claims against Brookwood arose, in the first instance, from the manufacture of fabric for the government pursuant to the 0003 Contract. The fact that certain fabric was not accepted by the United States and was sold commercially, the government argues, is immaterial to the \u00a7 1500 determination. For purposes of \u00a7 1500, the government argues, Brookwood was a proxy for the United States in the district court litigation at all times, regardless of whether the United States faced any liability for infringement in the district court litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The court must disagree with the government. As discussed above, the purpose of \u00a7 1500 is to prevent the United States from facing liability involving the same subject matter at the same time in separate fora. Where, however, the possibility of duplicative litigation is eliminated, there is no reason to invoke \u00a7 1500. Here, the district court clearly intended to protect the United States from duplicative litigation or double liability by acknowledging that it lacked jurisdiction over any claims that implicated the United States and by dismissing those claims. The fact that Brookwood faced other claims by Nextec, which did not implicate the United States but may have involved fabric that Brookwood originally manufactured under a subcontract with the United States, does not alter the court\u2019s conclusion. The United States did not have to defend itself and did not face any liability in district court for patent infringement arising from Brookwood\u2019s actions following the district court order dismissing claims arising from sales to the United States. Thus, because the district court dismissed all claims by Nextec covered by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a) before this case was filed, Nextec\u2019s suit in this court is not barred by \u00a7 1500.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Because plaintiffs claims for patent infringement are not barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED. The plaintiff shall have until January 20, 2014 to file an amended complaint consistent with this ruling.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The parties shall file a joint preliminary status report by February 18, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">.

However, that complaint, according to the government, must postdate the Federal Circuit decision and may not relate back to the pending complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\">. Nextec has moved to dismiss its claims against the United States with respect to infringement of the same patents it had pursued and lost in the litigation against Brookwood. Those claims all pertain to methods of manufacture and are set forth in Claims 2, 3, 5, and 6, as well as a portion of Claim 1 in the pending suit. The court GRANTS Nextec\u2019s request; thus, the only claims now pending before the court are the product claims from Claims 1 and 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b547-13\">.

On two separate instances, Brookwood requested that the district court issue an express order stating that Nextec may only seek damages for sales to the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims. Brookwood argued that Nextec had argued that the manufacturing specifications under the Contract necessarily required patent infringement. In response, Nextec contended that it had never made that argument, and that infringement of its patents was not a necessary result of complying with the government's manufacturing specifications. The district court denied both requests, first on March 31, 2010 and again on March 2, 2012. <em>Nextec Applications v. Brookwood Cos., </em>No. 07-CV-6901 (S.D.N.Y.
