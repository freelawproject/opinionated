Defendant\u2019s motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for decision. Oral argument was neither requested by the parties nor required by the court. Because the court concludes that plaintiffs\u2019 claim is time-barred under \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) (2012), defendant\u2019s motion is granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-25\">BACKGROUND <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-26\">Donna and Glenn Ebeyer <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed their 2006 joint federal income tax return on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>14, 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s Proposed Findings of Uneontroverted Fact (DPFUF) \u00b6 1; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6 1.

DPFUF \u00b6 2; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF 112; Def.\u2019s Mot.App. E, Ex. 1 at E5 (Lines 73 and 74a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The requested refund constituted the difference between the Ebeyers\u2019 tax liability of $8946 and their withholdings of $12,298, as reported on their 2006 return.

Def.\u2019s Mot.App. E, Ex. 1 at E6. The Ebeyers filed an administrative appeal of the IRS disallowance on March 9, 2011. <em>See id. </em>App. E, Ex. 4. In their appeal, the Ebeyers stated that their 2006 return \u201cwas due by April 15, 2007,\u201d but that they had waited to file their return (and their refund claim) because they had lost their 2006 tax files in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\"><em>Our 2006 tax return was due by April 15, 2007. </em>In 2005 &amp; 2006 after Hurricane Katrina, we extended housing (our home) to family members (our son and parents) who lost their homes in the storm. Consequently, the different families\u2019 belongings and <em>important documents </em>were commingled in our home and eventually ended up stored in one central location. This included our tax info for 2005 and 2006. Finally when all families went to their own homes, some of our belongings and important files went missing. We were not able to locate our tax info for 2006. At that time we felt as though they were lost and there was nothing we could do. <em>It was past the deadline (April 15, 2007) to file and we were under the impression that if we had not filed for an \u201cextension\u201d we were going to lose our refund.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">In late 2010 we spoke to an income tax preparer who advised us that we could still file taxes for 2006 (that it was not too late since we did not owe taxes but were entitled to a refund).

In a letter to the Ebeyers dated July 26, 2011, IRS Appeals Officer Grace Schmitz concluded that \u201cthere is no basis to allow any part of your claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The crux of the controversy in this case originates from the following statement provided by Ms. Schmitz, setting forth an explanation of her determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">You had extended your time to file your return with form [4868]. This would have protected the right to a refund until 10/15/2010. The 2006 tax return did not have federal postponements due to Katrina. Although your actions toward [the] member[s] of your family were a reasonable excuse for not filing timely, reasonable cause cannot extend or change the limitations of time for filing a claim set by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Plaintiffs filed this refund suit on March 19, 2012, seeking judgment for the amount of the refund claimed on their 2006 return, plus fees and costs under I.R.C. \u00a7 7430. In them complaint, plaintiffs allege that they \u201chad been granted an automatic 6-month extension for the filing of [their 2006] return after filing a form 4868,\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. App. E, Ex. 1 \u00b6 3, and therefore they \u201chad until October 15, 2010 to request a refund,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 7. Plaintiffs attach to them complaint a copy of Ms. Schmitz\u2019s July 26, 2011 letter stating that the Ebeyers \u201chad extended your time to file your return with form [4868].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at E7. Plaintiffs rely upon that statement to assert that the IRS \u201crecognized\u201d that the Ebeyers had been granted a six-month extension in which to file their 2006 return.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Defendant\u2019s discovery efforts in this case, which included written discovery as well as the depositions of Mr. and Mrs. Ebeyer, focused upon plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that they requested and were granted a six-month extension of time to file their 2006 return. These discovery efforts, however, yielded little specific information regarding the Ebeyers\u2019 alleged request for an extension. Although Mr. and Mrs. Ebeyer provided interrogatory answers and deposition testimony stating, in general terms, that Mr. Ebeyer prepared the extension request and submitted it to the IRS before the April 2007 deadline for the filing of the Ebeyers\u2019 2006 return, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot.App. C at 18, 22-23, 25; <em>id. </em>App. D at 16-17; <em>id. </em>App. E, Ex. 8 at E22 (Mrs. Ebeyer\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 1 stating that \u201c[m]y husband, Glenn Ebeyer, prepared the extension form for the 2006 taxable year\u201d), E23 (Mr. Ebeyer\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 1 stating that \u201cthere is no doubt in my mind that I did prepare [the extension request] and did send it [to the IRS]\u201d); <em>id. </em>App. E, Ex. 15, they provided scant detail regarding their alleged request.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Most notably, the Ebeyers were unable to recall specific details regarding how and when their alleged extension request was prepared and sent to the IRS. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6\u00b6 12-14. Mr. Ebeyer testified that he \u201cprobably filed [the extension request] electronically\u201d but did not \u201caccurately remember which method I used.\u201d Def.\u2019s MotApp. C at 18; <em>see also id. </em>App. C at 22 (\u201cI cannot a hundred percent say I did it via a letter or via a piece of mail or electronically.

Additionally, although Mr. Ebeyer testified that he submitted the extension request to the IRS \u201c[p]rior to April 15th, [2007,]\u201d he could not recall a specific date or even a range of dates. Def.\u2019s MotApp. C at 25; <em>see also id. </em>App. E, Ex. 15 at E51 (Mr. Ebeyer\u2019s supplemental answer to Interrogatory No. 1 stating, \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly when [the extension request] was prepared or sent, but it was sometime before April 15, 2007\u201d). Mrs. Ebeyer was likewise unable to provide specific details regarding when and how her husband submitted the alleged extension request. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot.App. D at 16-17; <em>id. </em>App. E, Ex. 8 at E22 (Mrs. Ebeyer\u2019s answer to Interrogatory No. 1 stating that \u201cI do not remember exactly how [the extension request] was transmitted, but I distinctly remember [Mr. Ebeyer] going on the computer and printing it out\u201d); <em>id. </em>App. E, Ex. 15 at E50 (Mrs. Ebeyer\u2019s supplemental answer to Interrogatory No. 1 stating, \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly when it was prepared or sent, or exactly where it was transmitted to\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The Ebeyers also admitted that they could not produce a copy of their alleged extension request, or, for that matter, <em>any </em>contemporaneous documentary evidence of their having mailed or otherwise filed such a request. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6 10 (\u201cagreeing]\u201d that \u201c[p]laintiffs do not have a copy (signed or unsigned) of the alleged application for an extension of time to file their 2006 income tax return\u201d); Def.\u2019s Mot.App. C at 17-18 (Mr. Ebeyer\u2019s deposition testimony that he \u201cdo[es] not have a physical copy\u201d of the alleged extension request and has \u201cno physical proof\u2019 of having submitted the request); <em>id. </em>App. D at 10 (Mrs. Ebeyer\u2019s deposition testimony that she \u201ccould not find any copies\u201d of the alleged extension request); <em>id. </em>App. E, Ex. 8 at E20 (plaintiffs\u2019 responses to defendant\u2019s document requests stating that the Ebeyers \u201care unable to locate a copy of the 6-month extension form that was filed\u201d or \u201cany ... mail receipt or similar item,\u201d and \u201cdo not recall receiving any document sent by the IRS for the purpose of \u2018confirmation\u2019 of the extension in 2007 and ... are not able to locate such a document\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On April 26, 2013, after the close of discovery, the government filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1). In that motion, the government argued that plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim is barred by I.R.C. \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A), and, consequently, plaintiffs are unable to establish this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over their claim. On July 31, 2013, while the government\u2019s motion to dismiss was pending, the Federal Circuit issued a precedential decision in which it stated that \u201cthe look-back provision [in \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A)] is not jurisdictional in nature\u201d and that a refund claim barred by \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) must be dismissed pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Boeri v. United States, </em>724 F.3d 1367, 1369 (Fed.Cir. 2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Following <em>Boeri, </em>this court denied the government\u2019s RCFC 12(b)(1) motion on August 7, 2013 but allowed the government an opportunity to advance its contentions based on \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) by filing a motion for summary judgment under RCFC 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on September 4, 2013. In that motion, which has been fully briefed, the government advances the same principal argument as it advanced in its previous motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(1), <em>i.e., </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim is barred by \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">I. Standard of Review for RCFC 56 Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The availability of summary judgment helps a federal court \u201c\u2018to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u2019\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v.

Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. RCFC 56(a); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A fact is material if it would affect the outcome of the suit. <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A dispute of material fact is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>genuine if a reasonable trier of fact could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. <em>Id.; Matsushita Electric Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted) (stating that there is no genuine issue of material fact \u201c[w]here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is an absence of any genuine issue of material fact, and the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party. <em>Dairyland Power Coop. v. United States, </em>16 F.3d 1197, 1202 (Fed.Cir.1994) (citations omitted). \u201cThe moving party, however, need not produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Celotex, 477 </em>U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548). Rather, \u201cwhen the non-moving party bears the burden of proof on an issue, the moving party can simply point out the absence of evidence creating a disputed issue of material fact\u201d and thereby shift the burden to the nonmoving party to produce evidence showing that there is such a disputed factual issue in the case. <em>Simanski v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>671 F.3d 1368, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2012) (citing <em>Celotex, 477 </em>U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, and <em>Dairyland, </em>16 F.3d at 1202).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Mere allegations or denials, conclusory statements, or evidence that is merely colorable or not significantly probative are not sufficient to preclude summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 248-50, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>see also Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (\u201cWhen the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56[], its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Barmag Barmer Maschinenfabrik AG v. Murata Mach., Ltd., </em>731 F.2d 831, 835-36 (Fed.Cir.1984) (\u201cWith respect to whether there is a genuine issue, the court may not simply accept a party\u2019s statement that a fact is challenged.\u201d) (citation omitted). \u201cThe party opposing the motion must point to an evidentiary conflict created on the record by at least a counter statement of a fact or facts set forth in detail in an affidavit by a knowledgeable affiant.\u201d <em>Barmag, </em>731 F.2d at 836. Summary judgment must be granted against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an essential element to that party\u2019s case and on which that party bears the burden of proof at trial. <em>Dairyland, </em>16 F.3d at 1202 (citing <em>Celotex, 477 </em>U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">II. Timeliness Requirements for Tax Refund Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">I.R.C. \u00a7 6511 contains two separate timeliness requirements for tax refund claims, both of which must be satisfied in order for a taxpayer to recover. First, \u00a7 6511 contains a filing deadline specifying that unless a \u201c[cjlaim for credit or refund of an overpayment of any tax ... [is] filed by the taxpayer within 3 years from the time the return was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later,\u201d \u00a7 6511(a), \u201c[n]o credit or refund [of an overpayment] shall be allowed or made,\u201d \u00a7 6511(b)(1). It is well-settled that satisfaction of this filing deadline is a jui\u2019isdictional prerequisite to a tax refund suit in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See, e.g., Sun Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>698 F.2d 1203, 1206 (Fed.Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">In this ease, it is undisputed that plaintiffs filed their 2006 federal income tax return on October 14, 2010, and on that return claimed an overpayment of $3352 for which plaintiffs requested a refund. <em>See </em>DPFUF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Def.\u2019s Mot.App. E, Ex. 1 at E5 (Line 74a). Because plaintiffs\u2019 2006 return also constitutes a valid claim for refund of $3352, plaintiffs have satisfied the filing deadline set foi\u2019th in \u00a7 6511. <em>See Musungayi v. United States, </em>86 Fed.Cl. 121, 124 (2009) (\u201cBecause an original income tax return that discloses the amount of overpayment constitutes a claim for refund, a taxpayer who has filed such a tax return has satisfied the three-year filing requirement of section 6511(a).\u201d (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6402-3(a)(5) (2008))); Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 2006 tax return, which they filed on October 14, 2010, and on which they claimed a refund of $3,352, is considered to be a \u2018claim for refund\u2019 for such amount within the meaning of \u00a7 6511. Therefore, because plaintiffs\u2019 original return also constitutes their refund claim, plaintiffs\u2019 claim satisfies the 3-year filing deadline of \u00a7 6511(a).\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Unfortunately for plaintiffs, however, \u00a7 6511 contains another timeliness requirement. Specifically, \u00a7 6511(b)(2), often described as a \u201clook-back\u201d provision, limits a taxpayer\u2019s available refund to the amount of tax paid during the applicable \u201clook-back\u201d period. Under that provision, if a refund claim is filed within three years from the time the return was filed, \u201cthe amount of the ... refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period, immediately preceding the filing of the claim, equal to 3 years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A). If a claim is not filed within three years from the time the return was filed, \u201cthe amount of the ... refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6511(b)(2)(B). If no tax has been paid within the applicable look-back period, plus any applicable extensions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> then the available refund is zero. <em>See, e.g., Baral v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 431, 436, 120 S.Ct. 1006, 145 L.Ed.2d 949 (2000) (holding that \u201cthe ceiling on [the taxpayer\u2019s] requested credit of $1,175 is zero\u201d under \u00a7 6511(b)(2) because no tax was paid during the applicable look-back period); <em>Doyle v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 314, 321-22 (2009) (same); <em>Minehan v. United States, </em>75 Fed.Cl. 249, 254 n. 7 (2007) (\u201cBecause Ms. Minehan hopes to recoup funds which were paid outside the period of time for which recovery is allowable under the IRC, her refund claim undoubtedly fails.\u201d). Unlike the filing deadline, the look-back provision in \u00a7 6511(b)(2) is not a jurisdictional prerequisite but, rather, a \u201csubstantive limitation ] on the amount of recovery.\u201d <em>United States v. Brockamp, </em>519 U.S. 347, 352, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997); <em>see also Boeri, </em>724 F.3d at 1369 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">In its motion for summary judgment, the government contends that plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim is barred by \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) because \u201cplaintiffs paid no tax within the 3-year period directly preceding the filing of their refund claim on October 14, 2010\u201d and because plaintiffs neither requested nor were granted an extension for filing their 2006 return.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A. Whether Official IRS Records Demonstrate that Plaintiffs Did Not Request an Extension</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In support of its motion for summary judgment, defendant relies primarily upon official IRS records that defendant contends \u201cestablish that plaintiffs never requested, and at all events were never granted, any extension of time to file their 2006 return.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5. Such records, which defendant offers through the declaration of Roman G. Hernandez, an IRS Court Witness Coordinator, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s MotApp. A, include \u201cphysical records maintained by the [IRS] with respect to the Ebeyers\u2019 2006 income tax year,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b65, as well as a \u201ctranscript of account electronically maintained by the [IRS] for the Ebeyers\u2019 2006 tax year,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b63.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In his declaration, Mr. Hernandez states that \u201c[i]t is the regular practice of the [IRS], when it receives a taxpayer\u2019s timely request for an extension of time to file [a return] (whether filed electronically or in paper form), to record the request in the account electronically maintained for that taxpayer for the relevant tax year.\u201d Def.\u2019s MotApp. A \u00b6 4. Therefore, had plaintiffs requested an extension of time to file their 2006 return, that request \u201cwould have been entered into [plaintiffs\u2019] account and would be reflected on the ... transcript of account\u201d attached to Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs do not dispute Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration in this regard.

The \u201ctranscript of account\u201d pertaining to plaintiffs\u2019 2006 return\u2014otherwise known as a Form 4340, or \u201cCertification of Assessments, Payments, and Other Specified Matters\u201d\u2014is attached as an exhibit to Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration along with a signed \u201cCertificate of Official Record\u201d bearing the seal of the Department of the Treasury, see Def.\u2019s Mot.

According to Mr. Hernandez, \u201c[t]he physical records maintained by the [IRS] with respect to the Ebeyers\u2019 2006 income tax year also do not include a request for an extension of time to file.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b65.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Relying upon Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration and the attached Form 4340, the government asserts that \u201c[t]he IRS has no record of ever receiving, processing, or granting an application for an extension of time for plaintiffs to file their 2006 income tax return.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 6. Defendant further argues that \u201cIRS records are presumed to be true, accurate, and correct,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing <em>Harris v.

Thus, the government contends that IRS records establish that the Ebeyers never requested and were never granted any extension of time to file their 2006 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">The court agrees with defendant that Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration and the attached Form 4340 are sufficient to presumptively demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact regarding whether plaintiffs requested an extension of time to file their 2006 return.

Instead, in an attempt to cast doubt on the reliability of these records, plaintiffs cite to decisions of various courts supposedly documenting \u201cIRS malfeasances\u201d in other eases, including instances in which the IRS lost or misplaced documents filed by taxpayers. Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 3 (citing cases). Based on these decisions in other eases, plaintiffs contend that the \u201c[t]he IRS is not a trustworthy organization\u201d and, therefore, may have lost or misplaced the Ebeyers\u2019 alleged request for an extension. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs also suggest, without record support, that the IRS \u201ccook[ed] [its] records for purposes of this litigation.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 4 (\u201cThe Ebeyers believe that the IRS made \u2018updates\u2019 to their records after they were sued mentioning the absence of the extension.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 unsubstantiated assertions that the IRS altered its records so as to delete reference to plaintiffs\u2019 alleged request for extension are plainly insufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding the accuracy of IRS records introduced by the government. As noted, to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must produce sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable finder of fact to rule in its favor. <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 248, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Mere denials, conelusory statements, or evidence that is merely colorable or not significantly probative are not sufficient to preclude summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 248-50, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>see also Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348; <em>Barmag, </em>731 F.2d at 835-36. Under this binding authority, plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory assertions of wrongdoing on the part of the IRS, devoid of any factual support, cannot preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Nor are plaintiffs\u2019 references to supposed \u201cIRS malfeasances\u201d in <em>other </em>cases sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding the accuracy of IRS records proffered by the government in <em>this </em>ease. Plaintiffs\u2019 speculation that the IRS may have lost or misplaced the Ebeyers\u2019 alleged request for an extension because the IRS has done so in other cases raises nothing more than a \u201ctheoretical possibility or \u2018metaphysical doubt,\u2019 which is insufficient to create a <em>genuine </em>issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Jansen v. Rexall Sundown, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 1329, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 261, 106 S.Ct. 2505); <em>see also Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (\u201cWhen the moving party has carried its burden under Rule 56[ ], its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Plaintiffs also attack the government\u2019s records on the ground that these records contain hearsay not falling within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 7-8; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8-9. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that these records are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with Ms. Schmitz\u2019s July 26, 2011 letter and, therefore, \u201cthe circumstances show a lack of trustworthiness\u201d precluding the application of the public records exception under Rule 803(8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">Mr. and Mrs. Ebeyer are also of the position that the government\u2019s \u201crecords\u201d are inadmissible under the hearsay rule.

FRE 802.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>While the federal rules of evidence carve out an exception to this for public records, this exception does not apply when the circumstances show a lack of trustworthiness. <em>See </em>FRE 803(8). Mr. and Mrs. Ebeyer feel that these circumstances do demonstrate such a lack of trustworthiness. The government sent them a formal Notice of Disallowance stating that they had been granted an extension, and then, after they hired an attorney and pursued this in court, the government denied ever granting an extension. This inconsistency calls into question the trustworthiness of the government\u2019s alleged records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 7. Additionally, plaintiffs contend that the \u201cbusiness records\u201d exception under FRE 803(6) is similarly inapplicable \u201cbecause this rule also may not be used when the circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Finally, plaintiffs assert that Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration is \u201cnot admissible under FRE 803(10) relating to absence of records, because there is no regular or set policy of the government to keep extensions for any particular length of time.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 3 (\u201c[T]he IRS does not have any clear policy on how long it keeps extensions and may destroy records of them ... in as little as a year.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The court rejects plaintiffs\u2019 hearsay arguments as meritless for several reasons. First, this court and others have routinely considered Forms 4340 under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See, e.g., Int\u2019l Fid. Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>27 Fed. Cl. 107, 111 (1992) (noting that \u201c[ojther courts have held that an IRS Form 4340 is admissible evidence that creates a presumption that the IRS assessment is valid,\u201d and holding that a Form 4340 submitted by the government was \u201cadmissible evidence in support of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment\u201d (citing <em>Hughes v. United States, </em>953 F.2d 531, 539-40 (9th Cir.1992))). Indeed, as noted <em>supra, </em>this court has routinely considered such documents to presumptively establish the accuracy of the matters to which they attest.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Second, plaintiffs have not shown any circumstances indicating a lack of trustworthiness requiring exclusion of the government\u2019s records. Although plaintiffs contend that the government, as a party to this litigation, \u201chas every incentive to lie or skew records,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 7, plaintiffs have not offered any evidence that even remotely suggests that the government altered its records to omit reference to plaintiffs\u2019 alleged request for an extension. Moreover, the court is not persuaded that a mere \u201cinconsistency\u201d between the Form 4340 attached to Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration and one sentence within Ms. Schmitz\u2019s July 26, 2011 letter disqualifies the Form 4340 as a public record under FRE 803(8). Plaintiffs offer no authority, and the court is not aware of any, requiring the exclusion on hearsay grounds of a certified government record based on mere \u201cinconsistency\u201d between the certified record and another document.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Third, plaintiffs cite no authority requiring exclusion of Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration in which he stated that he reviewed the records maintained by the IRS with respect to the Ebeyers\u2019 2006 tax return and found no reference therein to any request for an extension. Plaintiffs cite to a section of an \u201cInternal Revenue Manual\u201d purportedly setting forth the IRS\u2019s records and information management policies, and argue based on that document that \u201cthe IRS does not have any clear policy on how long it keeps extensions and may destroy records of them ... in as little as a year.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 3; <em>see also id. </em>at 8. Yet plaintiffs fail to demonstrate how that document rebuts Mr. Hernandez\u2019s testimony that \u201c[i]t is the regular practice of the [IRS] ... to record [a taxpayer\u2019s] request [for an extension] in the account electronically maintained for that taxpayer for the relevant tax year\u201d and to \u201csend paper-filed requests for an extension ... to a centralized files location where they can later be retrieved.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot.App. A \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Accordingly, the court concludes that Mr. Hernandez\u2019s declaration and the attached Form 4340 are sufficient to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact regarding whether plaintiffs requested a six-month extension of time to file their 2006 return. Because plaintiffs bear the burden at trial of establishing entitlement to their claimed refund, <em>see, e.g., Bubble Room, Inc. v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>States, </em>159 F.3d 553, 561 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201c[T]he taxpayer has the burden of establishing entitlement to the specific refund amount claimed.\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 440, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976))), to survive summary judgment plaintiffs must come forward with sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the Ebeyers requested a six-month extension, <em>see Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248-50, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505. The court now tons to an analysis of whether plaintiffs have identified sufficient evidence to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">B. Whether Plaintiffs\u2019 Proffered Rebuttal Evidence Is Sufficient to Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The government contends that \u201cplaintiffs have no competent evidence\u201d to support their allegation that they submitted a request for an extension of time to file their 2006 return and therefore plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate a genuine issue of fact as to their alleged extension. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 7; <em>see also id. </em>at 11-12. Plaintiffs, in response, argue that Ms. Schmitz\u2019s July 26, 2011 letter, considered together with plaintiffs\u2019 testimony that they submitted a request for an extension, is sufficient to preclude summary judgment. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 5-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">As noted, summary judgment must be granted against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an essential element to that party\u2019s case and on which that party bears the burden of proof at trial. <em>Dairyland, </em>16 F.3d at 1202 (citing <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548). Once official IRS records are introduced by the government, the taxpayer bears the burden of showing that the information presented therein is incorrect. <em>See, e.g., Dallin, </em>62 Fed.Cl. at 599-600 (citations omitted). Having considered all of the parties\u2019 arguments, the court agrees with defendant that plaintiffs have not produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of fact regarding the accuracy of the IRS records reflecting that plaintiffs never requested an extension of time to file their 2006 income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">1. Appeals Officer Schmitz\u2019s July 26, 2011 Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Plaintiffs do not dispute that they have no contemporaneous documentary evidence of their having mailed or otherwise filed a request for an extension. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6 10; Def.\u2019s Mot.App. C at 17-18; <em>id. </em>App. D at 10; <em>id. </em>App. E, Ex. 8 at E20. Plaintiffs nevertheless assert that Ms. Schmitz, in her July 26, 2011 letter upholding the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim as untimely, \u201cquite clearly stated that Mr. and Mrs. Ebeyer had been granted such an extension.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 3; <em>see also id. </em>at 5 (\u201cThe IRS sent a Notice of Disallowance to Mr. and Mrs. Ebeyer dated July 26, 2011, clearly stating that the Ebeyers had filed for and had been [granted] such a six-month extension for the year 2006.\u201d); Def.\u2019s Mot.

Defendant contends that the referenced sentence simply omitted the word \u201cnot\u201d and that Ms. Schmitz meant to inform plaintiffs that they \u201chad <em>not </em>extended\u201d their filing deadline. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 9 (citing Def.\u2019s Mot.App. B \u00b6 6). In support of this contention, defendant offers Ms. Schmitz\u2019s declaration in which she explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">[t]he July 26, 2011[ ] letter ... mistakenly states that \u201cYou had extended your time to file your return with form [4868].\u201d The word \u201cnot\u201d was inadvertently omitted from that sentence, which should have read \u201cYou had <em>not </em>extended your time to file your return with form [4868].\u201d In fact, the Ebeyers did not file a request for an extension for 2006, and the letter\u2019s erroneous statement that they did conflicts with the conclusion in the same paragraph that they did not satisfy the \u201climitations of time for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>filing a claim set by law,\u201d which was the basis for denying their claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Def.\u2019s Mot.App. B \u00b6 6.

Instead, although it is not entirely clear from plaintiffs\u2019 response, plaintiffs appear to object to the documents attached to Ms. Schmitz\u2019s declaration on the ground that these documents constitute inadmissible hearsay. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 7-8; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21. Plaintiffs also object to Ms. Schmitz\u2019s declaration itself on the ground that it \u201cappears to be dated after this action was filed\u2014[i.e.,] it contains the marking \u2018(4/20/2012)\u2019 in the corner.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 4; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to DPFUF \u00b6 18. The court finds these arguments to be unpersuasive. The \u201cCase Activity Record\u201d and \u201cAppeals Transmittal and Case Memo\u201d attached to Ms. Schmitz\u2019s declaration were themselves prepared prior to the filing of this case. Furthermore, these documents are admissible as business records under FRE 803(6) based upon Ms. Schmitz\u2019s assertion, in her declaration, that she prepared these records based upon her personal observations, and did so in her official capacity and in the ordinary course of business. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. App. B \u00b6\u00b63-4. Plaintiffs cite no authority prohibiting the court from considering declarations in support of a motion for summary judgment merely because such declarations were created after the initiation of litigation. To the contrary, as defendant correctly notes, such declarations are expressly authorized by RCFC 56(c), which identifies \u201caffidavits or declarations\u201d as evidence that may be used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">b.

United States, </em>445 F.3d 1355, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citing <em>Brockamp, </em>519 U.S. at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849, and <em>Office of Pers. Mgmt. v.

As a general matter, tax law requires strict adherence to the Code as written.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Although the United States Supreme Court \u201chas declined to adopt a broad rule that equitable estoppel is never available against the government,\u201d <em>Frazer v. United States, </em>288 F.3d 1347, 1352-53 (Fed.Cir.2002) (citing <em>Richmond, </em>496 U.S. at 423-24, 110 S.Ct. 2465), the Court has unequivocally stated that equitable estoppel will not lie against the United States for \u201celaim[s] for the payment of money from the Public Treasury contrary to a statutory appropriation.\u201d <em>Richmond, </em>496 U.S. at 424, 110 S.Ct. 2465; <em>accord Burnside-Ott Aviation Training Ctr., Inc. v. United States, </em>985 F.2d 1574, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1993) (citing <em>Richmond, </em>496 U.S. at 424, 110 S.Ct. 2465). To read equitable exceptions into \u00a7 6511 to excuse plaintiffs\u2019 otherwise untimely tax refund claim would violate the rule announced in <em>Richmond </em>and its progeny. This conclusion finds support in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brockamp, </em>in which the Court noted that \u00a7 6511 \u201csets forth its limitations in a highly detailed technical manner, that, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions,\u201d 519 U.S. at 350, 117 S.Ct. 849, and also \u201csets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits\u201d which do not include equitable exceptions, <em>id. </em>at 351, 117 S.Ct. 849. In declining to apply the analogous doctrine of equitable tolling to the timeliness requirements of \u00a7 6511, the Supreme Court in <em>Brockamp </em>concluded that \u201c[\u00a7 ] 6511\u2019s detail, its technical language, the iteration of the limitations in both procedural and substantive forms, and the explicit listing of exceptions, taken together, indicate to us that Congress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned, open-ended, \u2018equitable\u2019 exceptions into the statute that it wrote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 117 S.Ct. 849. The Court further stated that \u201c[t]ax law, after all, is not normally characterized by ease-specific exceptions reflecting individualized equities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These authorities preclude the application of equitable estoppel to resuscitate plaintiffs\u2019 otherwise time-barred refund claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The court notes that the government has presented arguments in support of its contention that, even if equitable estoppel were permitted in tax refund cases, plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel in this instance. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 7-9. Specifically, defendant claims that \u201cplaintiffs cannot under any circumstance establish the element of detrimental reliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Because the law is clear that equitable estoppel will not lie against the government for tax refund claims otherwise barred by \u00a7 6511, an extensive examination of defendant\u2019s alternative arguments is not necessary. <em>Cf. RHI Holdings, Inc. v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 1459, 1463 (Fed.Cir.1998) (stating that \u201csince there clearly is no equitable exception in [the statute of limitations set forth in I.R.C. \u00a7 6532], it is not necessary to decide if equitable estoppel would be enforced against the United States if an equitable exception were found in a tax refund statute of limitations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Defendant is correct to point out, however, that \u201cif equitable estoppel is to apply against the government, then \u2018some form of affirmative misconduct must be shown in addition to the traditional requirements of estoppel.\u2019\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply at 8 (quoting <em>Zacharin v. United States, </em>213 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed.Cir. 2000)); <em>see also United States v.

Plaintiffs in this case have produced no evidence of such affirmative misconduct on the part of the IRS or its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Nor have plaintiffs produced any evidence of detrimental reliance on Ms. Schmitz\u2019s July 26, 2011 letter. As the government convincingly argues in its reply brief, by July 26, 2011 the look-back period under \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) had already expired, regardless of whether plaintiffs had requested or been granted a six-month extension to file their 2006 return. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 8. Therefore, Ms. Schmitz\u2019s letter could not possibly have induced any action by plaintiffs that could have had any effect on the timeliness of their refund claim under \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A), and plaintiffs\u2019 estoppel claim fails as a matter of law for this additional reason. <em>See Heckler v. Cmty. Health Servs., </em>467 U.S. 51, 61, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984) (\u201c[Hjowever heavy the burden might be when an estoppel is asserted against the Government, the private party surely cannot prevail without at least demonstrating that the traditional elements of an estoppel are present.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">2. Plaintiffs\u2019 Uncorroborated Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Finally, without any documentary evidence supporting them contention that they requested and were granted an extension to file their 2006 return, plaintiffs are left with nothing but their testimony, in answers to interrogatories and in depositions, that Mr. Ebeyer prepared and submitted a request for an extension at some point before April 15, 2007. This testimony is not only uncorroborated but is also contradicted by the documentary evidence presented by defendant. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 8-9. Specifically, as noted, the Ebeyers stated in their administrative appeal that their 2006 return \u201cwas due by April 15, 2007\u201d and they \u201cwere under the impression that if we had not filed for an \u2018extension\u2019 we were going to lose our refund,\u201d but that they had waited until October 2010 to file their 2006 return because they lost their 2006 tax files in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Def.\u2019s Mot.App. E, Ex. 4 at E10-E11. Then, in subsequent correspondence to the IRS dated April 28, 2011 and June 16, 2011, the Ebeyers acknowledged that they had filed their refund claim \u201clate\u201d yet asked the IRS to make an exception to the deadline \u201cbased on exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>App. E, Exs. 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The government, citing several decisions of this court and its predecessor, argues that plaintiffs\u2019 uncorroborated testimony is \u201cinadequate at all events to prove proper filing [of a request for an extension] with the IRS\u201d and is also \u201cinsufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness associated with IRS records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 11-12 (citing, <em>e.g., Doyle, </em>88 Fed.Cl. at 320 (\u201c[A] taxpayer\u2019s own uncorroborated testimony to show timely mailing is not enough to establish a presumption of delivery under any view of the law.\u201d) (citation omitted), <em>Davis, </em>43 Fed.Cl. at 94-95 (holding that plaintiffs uncorroborated testimony that he timely mailed his refund claim to the IRS was insufficient to prove timely filing and to rebut a presumptively accurate \u201cIRS Certification of Lack of Record\u201d and an accompanying declaration from an IRS employee), and <em>McIlvaine v.

The court finds these authorities to be persuasive, and agrees that plaintiffs\u2019 self-serving and conclusory assertions are insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether plaintiffs requested an extension of time to file their 2006 return, particularly in light of the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 own written statements contradict such assertions. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248-50, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348; <em>Barmag, </em>731 F.2d at 835-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim is barred by \u00a7 6511(b)(2)(A) unless plaintiffs requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and were granted a six-month extension of the statutory deadline to file their 2006 return. Because plaintiffs have failed to present sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find that plaintiffs requested such an extension, and because plaintiffs have failed to rebut the presumption of correctness afforded IRS records contradicting plaintiffs\u2019 assertions in that regard, the government is entitled to summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 refund claim. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">(1) Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, filed September 4, 2013, is GRANTED;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">(2) The Clerk\u2019s Office is directed to ENTER final judgment in favor of defendant DISMISSING the complaint with prejudice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">(3) Each party shall bear its own costs.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-14\">.
