Pending before the court is the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d) or, alternatively, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">On April 30,1999, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cthe Corps\u201d), Mobile District, awarded American Renovation and Construction (\u201cARC\u201d) a contract for the design and construction of family housing at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 3. Following the award, ARC entered into a subcontract with Mr. Montano to complete electrical work on the project. <em>Id. </em>In January 2002, ARC defaulted on its contract with the government, and its surety, St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company (\u201cSt. Paul\u201d), took over and completed the contract using Soltek Pacific (\u201cSoltek\u201d) as the completion contractor. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. 3, \u00b6 4 (A <em>Montano Electrical Contractor, </em>ASBCA No. 56951, 10-2 BCA \u00b6 34587, 2010 WL 4418630 (Oct. 27, 2010) (\u201cASBCA Op.\u201d)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Montano and St. Paul executed two agreements, assigning Mr. Montano\u2019s electrical subcontract to Soltek and releasing St. Paul from any claims Mr. Montano had against it. Compl. at 7. The complaint alleges that Mr. Montano signed the agreements under economic compulsion. <em>Id. </em>During the construction process, the original subcontract had been subject to a number of change orders. Compl. at 8-9. The complaint alleges that although Mr. Montano completed the electrical work for ARC, and later Soltek, as required, he was not fully compensated for a number of the change orders. Compl. at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">On April 14, 2003, St. Paul filed a claim with the government for an equitable adjustment attributable to the additional work and time needed to complete the Redstone Arsenal family-housing project. Compl. Ex. 29, at 2. On September 11, 2003, St. Paul submitted an amendment to its claim, indicating under the heading \u201cAdditional Subcontractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Costs\u201d that it was negotiating a settlement with Mr. Montano. <em>Id. </em>at 7. On December 23, 2003, Mr. Montano sent a claim to St. Paul seeking additional payments of $520,303.43 under the subcontract, Compl. at 4, also providing a copy of the claim to Gene Curtis, the Corps\u2019 contracting officer, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleges that Mr. Montano made telephone calls to Mr. Curtis during this time, seeking assistance regarding his claim against St. Paul. Compl. at 5. According to the complaint, during these conversations, Mr. Curtis stated that he could not help or provide advice because Mr. Montano was a subcontractor. <em>Id. </em>On April 30, 2004, however, Mr. Curtis wrote to Mr. Montano to remind him of his possible remedies against St. Paul under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133, and to inform him that Mr. Curtis had no authority to help him recover from St. Paul. Compl. Ex. 31 (Letter from Curtis to Montano (Apr. 30, 2004)). In this letter, Mr. Curtis mentioned that St. Paul had filed a claim with the government on the prime contract. <em>Id. </em>Over the next months, Mr. Montano and the Corps met twice to discuss the disputes between Mr. Montano and St. Paul. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. 32, at 1 (Letter from Curtis to Montano (Sept. 8, 2004)). Among other things, Mr. Montano claimed that St. Paul was violating the Federal Acquisition Regulations (\u201cFAR\u201d), but Mr. Curtis informed him that the government had found no FAR violations by St. Paul and reiterated to Mr. Montano that the Miller Act was the appropriate remedy for nonpayment by the prime contractor. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Curtis also reminded Mr. Montano that the dispute did not involve the United States as a party and concluded that he found \u201cno basis to pursue this [matter] further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">On November 24, 2004, Mr. Montano submitted a Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) request for documentation concerning the inspection and acceptance reports for the family-housing project at Redstone Arsenal, the takeover agreement between ARC and St. Paul, and St. Paul\u2019s claim against the government regarding the Redstone Arsenal contract. Compl. Ex. 37, at 2 (Letter from Joseph Gonzales to Montano (Feb. 15, 2005)). The government denied this request because the relevant documents contained confidential business data. <em>Id. </em>Mi\u2019. Montano filed an appeal of the denial. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. 29, at 9 (Letter from Donna Black to Montano (Nov. 17, 2006)) (responding to the appeal). The Corps\u2019 counsel advised that the appeal was under consideration at the Corps\u2019s headquarters, and that St. Paul\u2019s claim against the government \u201cincluded costs for settlement with A. Montano Electrical in the amount of $156,200.00.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Montano sought additional information regarding this settlement from the government, and on March 14, 2007, he received a letter, through counsel, from the Corps stating that a tentative settlement had been reached between St. Paul and the government but that \u201cdetails [were] still being worked out.\u201d <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. 30, at 2 (Letter from David Brasfield, Jr. to Robert Presto (Mar. 14,2007)). The Corps indicated that by June 30, 2007, it hoped to have the necessary funds available to implement the settlement. <em>Id. </em>On June 15, 2007, Mr. Montano\u2019s counsel then contacted St. Paul in an attempt to secure a portion of the funds for Mr. Montano. <em>Id. </em>at 3 (Letter from Presto to Montano (June 15, 2007)). Mi*. Montano contends that he did not receive any portion of the settlement funds from St. Paul. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 19. Subsequently, the Corps informed Mr. Montano that the government had paid St. Paul the amount due under the settlement in June 2007 and considered the claim closed. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. 28 (Letter from Black to Montano (Mar. 20, 2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">On September 13, 2009, Mr. Montano filed a request with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cASBCA\u201d) for \u201chelp\u201d on his case. ASBCA Op. at 4. The ASBCA treated the request as an appeal under the Contracts Dispute Act (\u201cCDA\u201d), 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7104(a), 7105(e)(1)(A). Ultimately, the ASBCA determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because Mr. Montano <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>was not a contractor as required by the CDA but rather was a subcontractor. ASBCA Op. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Eventually, on June 28, 2013, Mr. Montano filed suit in this court, seeking monetary relief from the government respecting his subcontract and damages for tortious conduct by the contracting officer. <em>See </em>Compl. In lieu of an answer, the government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Montano\u2019s contract claims and that Mr. Montano failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted regarding his tort claims. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 2-3. That motion has been fully briefed, as has Mr. Montano\u2019s request that the court transfer the ease if jurisdiction is lacking in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">STANDARDS FOR DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">When considering a motion to dismiss for either lack of subject matter jurisdiction or alternatively for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing sufficient facts to show the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over each claim and the plausibility of the claims. <em>See McAfee, Inc. v. United States, </em>111 Fed.Cl. 696, 706 (2013) (citing <em>McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., </em>298 U.S. 178, 189, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936)); <em>see also Bell Atlantic Corp v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The court construes all unchallenged factual allegations in the complaint in favor of the pleader, but any disputed jurisdictional facts must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>McAfee, </em>111 Fed.Cl. at 706; <em>see also Connolly-Lohr v. United States, </em>112 Fed.Cl. 350, 352 (2013) (quoting <em>Cambridge v. United States, </em>558 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2009)). When considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the court \u201cmay look beyond the pleadings and \u2018inquire into jurisdictional facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Central Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 104, 107 (2009) (quoting <em>Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir.1991)). Mr. Montano\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed, but this leniency does not relieve Mr. Montano of his burden to show jurisdiction. <em>See Heger v. United States, </em>103 Fed. Cl. 261, 263 (2012) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-15\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a), grants this court jurisdiction to hear disputes arising under governmental contracts. <em>Central Freight Lines, </em>87 Fed.Cl. at 107.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Paragraph 1491(a)(1) applies generally to express or implied-in-fact contracts with the government, while Paragraph 1491(a)(2) pertains specifically to claims subject to the CDA, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(b)(1). <em>See Record Steel &amp; Constr. Inc. v. United States, </em>62 Fed.Cl. 508, 518 (2004). In this case, the parties\u2019 focus is specific to whether Mr. Montano can establish privity of contract as required for claims under the CDA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">A. Contract Disputes Act</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Congress enacted the CDA to provide \u201ca fair, balanced, and comprehensive statutory system of legal and administrative remedies in resolving government contract claims.\u201d <em>Winter v. FloorPro, Inc., </em>570 F.3d 1367, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2009) (citing <em>Contract Disputes Act of 1978, </em>S.Rep. No. 95-1118, at 1 (1978), <em>as reprinted, in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5235, 5235). The statute provides that a contractor can, upon receiving an adverse decision from a contracting officer, either appeal the contracting officer\u2019s decision to an agency board of contract appeals or file a claim against the government in this court. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In either situation, the CDA only applies to \u201ccontractors,\u201d defined as \u201ca party to a [federal [government contract other than the [fjederal [g]overnment.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(7); <em>see also FloorPro, </em>570 F.3d at 1369-70 (citing what is now codified as 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(7)) (also citing <em>Admiralty Constr. Inc. v. Dalton, </em>156 F.3d 1217, 1220 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201c[T]he Act emphasizes that only a \u2018contractor\u2019 may appeal the decision of a contracting officer.\u201d)). The courts repeatedly have held that, as a general matter, subcontractors lack privity of contract with the federal government and thus cannot bring a claim under the CDA. <em>See e.g., E.R. Mitchell Constr. Co. v. Danzig, </em>175 F.3d 1369, 1370 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citing <em>Erickson Air Crane Co. of Wash. v. United States, </em>731 F.2d 810, 813 (Fed.Cir.1984)); <em>Johnson Controls, </em>713 F.2d at 1550 (citing <em>Merritt, </em>267 U.S. at 340-41, 45 S.Ct. 278).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In accord with these precedents, the government argues that as a subcontractor, Mr. Montano cannot bring a claim under the CDA because he lacks privity of contract with the government. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 7. Mr. Montano accepts that he \u201cwas not in privity with the United States.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 13. He nonetheless argues that he should be permitted to proceed despite the lack of privity. First, Mr. Montano contends that the contracting officer failed to adequately inform him about, and preserve his rights under, the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133, and that the contracting officer should have withheld funds from St. Paul pursuant to 48 C.F.R. (\u201cFAR\u201d) \u00a7 52-222.7, but failed to do so. Compl. at 2. Mr. Montano fails to explain how either of these alleged shortcomings should bear on the court\u2019s ability to exercise jurisdiction over his CDA claim. These arguments more logically relate to Mr. Montano\u2019s tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Second, Mr. Montano argues that St. Paul\u2019s settlement with the government encompassed a pass-through claim made on his behalf, entitling him to a portion of the proceeds of the settlement. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 6-7. Even absent privity of contract, a subcontractor\u2019s claims may be brought against the government if the prime contractor brings the suit on behalf of the subcontractor\u2014as a pass-through or sponsored claim. <em>See E.R. Mitchell, </em>175 F.3d at 1373-74; <em>see also Harper/Neilsen-Dillingham, Builders, Inc. v. United States, </em>81 Fed.Cl. 667, 675 (2008); <em>ACE Constructors, Inc. v. United States, </em>70 Fed.Cl. 253, 289 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>499 F.3d 1357 (Fed.Cir.2007). \u201c[A] suit of this nature may be maintained only when the prime contractor has reimbursed its subcontractor for the latter\u2019s damages or remains liable for such reimbursement in the future.\u201d <em>George Hyman Constr. Co. v. United States, </em>30 Fed.Cl. 170, 174 (1993) (quoting <em>J.L. Simmons Co. v. United States, </em>304 F.2d 886, 888-89 (Ct.Cl. 1962)). Although Mr. Montano sought information regarding the settlement, neither St. Paul nor the government has provided him with any details about the nature of, or amounts paid under, the settlement. Compl. at 38 &amp; Ex. 29, at 9. In all events, the claim Mr. Montano has brought in this court is not a pass-through claim over which the court may exercise jurisdiction. St. Paul is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>plaintiff in this action and has maintained that it is not liable to Mr. Montano for the damages he seeks. Both of these predicates are required for a proper pass-through claim. Furthermore, because the settlement resolved all of St. Paul\u2019s claims against the government, St. Paul could not have sponsored Mr. Montano\u2019s claim against the government under the terms of the settlement agreement. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. 28. The court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any claims arising under the CDA. Mr. Montano\u2019s remedy was to file a Miller Act suit in the proper United States district court against St. Paul.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">B. Federal Tort Claims Act</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1), enables federal district courts to hear tort claims against the government.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Claims of negligence by a contracting officer fall within this grant of jurisdiction. <em>See Wickliffe v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 102, 110 (2011) (citing <em>Rick\u2019s Mushroom Serv., Inc. v. United States, </em>521 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed.Cir.2008)). Conversely, \u201c[t]he plain language of the Tucker Act excludes from the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction claims sounding in tort.\u201d <em>Rick\u2019s Mushroom Serv., </em>521 F.3d at 1343. Therefore, this court cannot consider such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">After conceding that his tort claims do not belong in this court, Mr. Montano asks the court to transfer his tort claims to an appropriate district court. PL\u2019s Resp. at 15-16. The pertinent statutory authority for such a transfer is provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Section 1631 allows a court that finds that it lacks jurisdiction over a civil case to transfer the case to a court where the actions could have been brought at the time of filing, if such transfer is in the interest of justice. <em>See Fisherman\u2019s Harvest, Inc. v. PBS &amp; J, </em>490 F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed.Cir. 2007).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In determining if transfer is warranted, the court must decide not only that it lacks jurisdiction but that the transferee court would possess jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Id. </em>For a district court to exercise jurisdiction over a FTCA claim, an administrative claim must first have been filed in accord with the procedure provided in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.2-14.4. <em>See Kokotis v. United States Postal Service, </em>223 F.3d 275, 278-79 (4th Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted); <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>730 F.2d 808, 809-10 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Gonzales v. United States Postal Service, </em>543 F.Supp. 838, 839 (N.D.Cal.1982). Failure to file an administrative claim results in dismissal of a claim brought in district court for lack of jurisdiction. <em>E.g., Gonzales, </em>543 F.Supp. at 841. Mr. Montano has not filed an administrative claim as required, and as a result, no district court could exercise jurisdiction over his tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>claims. Therefore, the court cannot transfer his claims to an appropriate district court because Mr. Montano could not have brought his FTCA claims in district court at the time he filed in this court. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>105 Fed.Cl. 85, 96 (2012) (refusing to transfer a case to district court when no district court could have heard plaintiffs claim at the time of filing).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">For the reasons stated, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is GRANTED. Mr. Montano\u2019s request for transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Clerk shall enter judgment accordingly-</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-12\">. Among other things, the government argues that Mr. Montano cannot proceed <em>pro se, </em>representing Montano Electrical. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. To Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mot.\u201d) at 9, EOF No. 7 (citing RCFC 83.1). The rule states that \u201d[a]n individual who is not an attorney ... may not represent a corporation, an entity, or any other person in any proceeding before this court.\u201d RCFC 83.1. This rule is not, however, implicated in this case because Mr. Montano is representing himself <em>pro se </em>doing business as Montano Electrical Contractor, <em>see </em>Compl. Civil Cover Sheet, ECF No. 1-1, which he is permitted to do, <em>see Nova Express v. United States, </em>80 Fed.Cl. 236, 237-39 &amp; n. 1 (2008).

Therefore, the court\u2019s analysis regarding jurisdiction over Mr. Montano\u2019s claim under the CDA, <em>i.e., </em>if there is privity of contract between Mr. Montano and the government, is also applicable to jurisdiction under Paragraph 1491(a)(1) of the Tucker Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">. Generally a contractor's choice of forum to challenge a contracting officer\u2019s final decision is binding. <em>See Bonneville Assocs. v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 649, 653 (Fed.Cir.1994) (citing <em>National Neighbors, Inc. v. United States, </em>839 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed.Cir.1988)). This election doctrine does not apply when the forum originally selected lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, because the ASBCA determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Montano's appeal before the ASBCA, <em>see </em>ASBCA Op. at 5, he may still bring a claim in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">. In pertinent part, the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133(b), provides a subcontractor with the right to bring a civil suit against the prime contractor in the appropriate district court for unpaid labor or materials. 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133(b)(1), (3). A specific statute of limitations requires such a suit to be brought within one year after the last of the labor was performed or material was supplied.
