The government counterclaims that AEY is liable for forfeiture of its claims because the two invoices at issue pertain to a contract tainted by fraud in an unrelated, earlier aspect of contractual performance and that AEY additionally is liable for damages under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729, for pri- or false invoices submitted pursuant to the contract.

The government executed a search warrant on AEY\u2019s place of business in Miami Beach, Florida on August 23, 2007. Hr\u2019g Tr. 27:1-6. This timing is significant; the search warrant was executed shortly after Delivery Orders 3 and 4 had been issued to AEY in June and early August, and seven months before Shipment Nos. AEY0007 and AEY0017, were shipped and accepted pursuant to Delivery Orders 3 and 4, respectively. On March 25, 2008, the day Shipment Nos.

The motions have been thoroughly briefed and a hearing was held on October 15, 2012. Two extended rounds of supplemental briefing occurred subsequent to the hearing, to address related arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>being made in appeals pending before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, as well as decisions rendered by the Circuit.

The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d RCFC 15(a)(2). RCFC 15(a) mirrors, in all pertinent respects, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), and consequently application of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) is highly persuasive in this court. <em>See Mitsui Foods, Inc. v.

Mr. Merrill, an investor in AEY, challenged his criminal fraud conviction in connection with Delivery Order 2, in part, by asserting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>(1) that AEY never\" \u201cacquired\u201d ammunition from a communist Chinese military company within the terms of DFARS \u00a7 225.770-2 and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to show materiality of the purported violations. <em>See Merrill, </em>685 F.3d at 1010-11. Mr. Merrill argued that because the Albanian MEICO acquired the ammunition from a communist Chinese military company long before AEY secured the ammunition from the Albanian MEICO to fulfill a contract with the United States, AEY did not \u2018\u201cacquire supplies or services covered by the United States Munitions List ... through a contract or subcontract at any tier, from any [cjommunist Chinese military company\u2019 \u201d within the terms of DFARS \u00a7 225.770-2. <em>Id. </em>at 1011 (quoting DFARS \u00a7 225.770-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">AEY\u2019s amended counterclaim reply seeks to make this same argument. <em>See </em>Pi\u2019s Am.

United States, </em>152 F.Supp. 84 (Ct.Cl.1957), which is frequently cited in support of a broad interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514. In <em>Little, </em>the plaintiff had received a contract from the Veterans Administration to educate and train veterans. <em>Little, </em>152 F.Supp. at 85. The school was to operate under contract from January 1, 1949 to December 31, 1949. <em>Id. </em>In April 1949, the plaintiff received notice that his school was at risk of closure because it was not meeting the state\u2019s minimum requirements for the training of veterans. <em>Id. </em>at 86. After an initial spot check of the school\u2019s records, funding was suspended as of April 30, 1949. <em>Id. </em>After learning that a further investigation would be required, the school destroyed its attendance records for all veterans who were in training prior to January 3, 1949. <em>Id. </em>A more complete audit report by the Veterans Administration in July 1949 revealed a series of substantial irregularities in the school\u2019s attendance records. <em>Id. </em>Approval of the school was withdrawn entirely, and the contract was can-celled. <em>Id. </em>at 87. The plaintiff then sought, among other things, reimbursement for tuition, books, and supplies for the period from May 1 to August 4,1949 when the school was in operation but no payments had been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ceived for services rendered. <em>Id. </em>The government filed counterclaims asserting violations of the False Claims Act for claims for payment submitted to the government prior to May 1, 1949 and asserting forfeiture of the plaintiffs claims under the Forfeiture Statute. <em>Id. </em>The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\">Plaintiffs present suit is for services rendered after April 30,1949____ The defendant does not allege that plaintiff practiced fraud after April 30, 1949, and the record does not establish fraud after that date. It is true that [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514] was not intended to forfeit an otherwise valid claim of a claimant merely because, in some other unrelated transaction, he had defrauded the [g]overnment. But where, as in the present case, fraud was committed in regard to the very contract upon which the suit is brought, this court does not have the right to divide the contract and allow recovery on part of it. Since plaintiffs claims are based entirely upon contract V3020V-241, a contract under which he practiced fraud against the [g]overnment, all of his claims under that contract will be forfeited pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1L\"><em>Id. </em>at 87-88. <em>Little </em>has served as the basis for decisions in this court holding that fraud in the performance of a contract leads to forfeiture of all claims arising out of the contract. <em>See, e.g., American Heritage Bancorp v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 376, 386 (2004) (The requirement of <em>Little ... </em>has led ... this court to apply the forfeiture statute to situations outside the strict terms of the statute.); <em>UMC Electronics Co. v.

The government determined that KBR had charged the government some unreasonable costs and refused to pay a portion of them. <em>Id. </em>KBR sued the government for the unpaid costs. <em>Id. </em>During discovery, the government learned that employees of KBR had been receiving kickbacks from a subcontractor in exchange for giving dining facility subcontracts to the subcontractor, and the government filed a forfeiture counterclaim. <em>Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Servs. v. United States, </em>99 Fed.Cl. 488, 493 (2011) <em>(\u201cKBR I\u201d). </em>The government argued that the kickbacks \u201ctainted\u201d the entire contract with fraud, and that \u201cany invoice submitted upon a fraudtainted contract supported] the finding of a \u2018false or fraudulent\u2019 claim.\u201d <em>KBR II, </em>728 F.3d at 1365-66. It urged that KBR should be liable for forfeiture of any and all claims under that contract. <em>Id. </em>The government\u2019s legal theory omitted any requirement of a nexus between the fraud and the claim submitted. The trial court had distinguished <em>Little </em>and ruled in part in favor of KBR on issues involving the Forfeiture Statute. <em>KBR I, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 498-501, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">On appeal, the Federal Circuit rejected the government\u2019s position, drawing in part on the trial court\u2019s analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">A valid cause of action under [the Forfeiture Statute] must be tied to the submission of a claim, whether in producing false proof to support a claim, <em>see, e.g., [Kamen Soap Prods.

United States, </em>124 F.Supp. 608, 622 (Ct.Cl.1954) ] (forfeiting claim because falsified documentation was submitted in presentation of claim), or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>falsely establishing the claim, <em>see, e.g., [.N.Y.

As the Circuit\u2019s decision noted: \u201cOn its face, the statute is limited to those circumstances where the [gjovernment proves fraud \u2018in the proof, statement, establishment or allowance\u2019 of a <em>claim at the Court of Federal Claims, not in the execution of a contract.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Further, the Federal Circuit agreed with the trial court that the expansive interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514 that had developed and persisted in this court was not in keeping with the plain meaning of the statute. <em>See KBR II, </em>728 F.3d at 1366 n. 18 (\u201cSeveral other Court of Federal Claims decisions state otherwise: \u2018The words of the statute make it apparent that a claim against the United States is to be forfeited if fraud is practiced during the contract performance or in the making of the claim.\u2019 <em>Crane Helicopter Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>45 Fed.Cl. 410, 431 (1991) (emphasis added); <em>see also Anderson v. United States, </em>47 Fed.Cl. 438, 444 (2000); <em>Supermex, Inc. v.

This is an impermissibly broad reading of the statute.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Federal Circuit stressed that the statutory context confirms a more particular reading of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">The provision codified at section 2514 was part of legislation creating the Court of Federal Claims and regulating its operations and procedure. <em>See </em>Act of Mar. 3, 1863, ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765, 767. The surrounding provisions concern requirements for filing claims, including time limits and verification. Thus the neighboring provisions illustrate that the forfeiture statute is best understood as a companion requirement of claims procedure rather than a catch-all anti-fraud provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">In upholding the trial court\u2019s decision in <em>KBR I, </em>the Federal Circuit did not address that court\u2019s interpretation of the continuing validity of <em>Little. </em>The Federal Circuit only confirmed the invalidity of much of its progeny. The trial court had limited <em>Little </em>to its factual predicate, <em>i.e., </em>that false proof had been submitted in a related claim under the contract. <em>See KBR I, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 498. Falsified attendance records, unrelated to the time period at issue in the claim, had been presented to the government for payment, and the government was seeking recovery of those overpayments made in reliance upon the fraudulent attendance records. Thus, according to the tidal court, the rule from <em>Little </em>is that \u201cfraud in the \u2018proof of a claim, <em>i.e., </em>the falsification of the underlying documents upon which the claim was based, voids each of the claims associated with the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>considered the matter, the rule derived from the Forefeiture Statute is not so broad as to conclude that every act of fraudulent performance is fraud in the \u201cproof, statement, establishment, or allowance\u201d of a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The facts in this case have some parallels to those in <em>Little. </em>As in <em>Little, </em>invoices based on false information were submitted to the government regarding Delivery Order 2, and later invoices, valid and conforming, were subsequently submitted regarding Delivery Orders 3 and 4 and were not paid by the government. The unequivocal statement in the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>KBR II </em>that the \u201cstatute is limited to those circumstances where the [government proves fraud \u2018in the proof, statement, establishment or allowance\u2019 of a claim at the Court of Federal Claims, not in the execution of a contract,\u201d 728 F.3d at 1366, is in tension with applicability of <em>Little </em>to this case. Additionally, <em>KBR II </em>adheres to the plain meaning of the statutory text. <em>See KBR II, </em>728 F.3d at 1366 (citing <em>Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 288, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001)). Nonetheless, this court need not now rule on the continuing validity of <em>Little </em>or its applicability to this ease.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue of waiver, discussed below, provides the immediate basis for ruling on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">2. <em>Waiver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">AEY contends that the government has waived its rights under the Forfeiture Statute because it \u201cknew of AEY\u2019s fraud under [Delivery] Order 2 at the time it required and accepted delivery of the two shipments under [Delivery] Orders 3 and 4.\u201d PL\u2019s Mot. for Summ.

Judgment at 19. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Moreover, the government avers that requiring the contracting officer to have refused delivery of the shipments at issue \u201cwould place [g]overnment contracting officials [in] an impossible position: reveal a criminal investigation by informing a contractor that they should halt deliveries of already placed [delivery] orders, or risk being forced to pay a contractor who may be engaged in fraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">As precedent for finding waiver of the Forfeiture Statute, AEY cites <em>Carrier Corp. v. United States, </em>328 F.2d 328 (Ct.Cl.1964). <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. Judgment at 10-13. In <em>Carrier, </em>the plaintiff contracted with the government to produce high-explosive shells. <em>Carrier Corp., </em>328 F.2d at 328. A detailed quality-control system had been specified by the government, but eventually the government discovered that the plaintiff was bypassing a portion of the established quality control system to keep up with required production levels. <em>See id. </em>at 329-332. Upon discovery of the bypass, the government ordered production to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 332. Subsequently, the plaintiff and the government informally, via phone calls and letters, worked out provisions under which production could resume, and after fulfilling the requested provisions, plaintiff resumed production. <em>Id. </em>at 332-33. Ultimately, governmental officials rejected the provisions that allowed the resumption of production and canceled the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 334. The plaintiff then sued for breach, and the government sought forfeiture of the plaintiffs claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that \u201c[i]t would be manifestly unfair for defendant to practically agree to such an arrangement, induce [the plaintiff] to incur considerable new expense, and at the same time have lurking in the back of its mind the intention to cancel the whole contract, including the extra expense which the defendant had permitted and for practical purposes had authorized after full knowledge of the facts in connection with the basis for final cancellation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. Accordingly, the court held that the government\u2019s discussions with the plaintiff amounted to a supplemental agreement untouched by fraud and that the government was not entitled to forfeiture of the plaintiffs claims. <em>Id. </em>at 336. The Court of Claims rejected the idea that the government could knowingly continue to benefit from a contract it knew it intended to cancel. <em>See id. </em>at 336-37 (\u201c[D]efendant\u2019s officials continued to discuss ways and means of canceling the entire contract, while the plaintiff incurred additional needless expense without its being advised of the nature of the discussion. While the decision was reached on December 16, plaintiff was not notified until December 29.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The government resists applicability of <em>Carrier </em>by asserting that there was no \u201csupplemental agreement\u201d in this case, Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. For Summ. Judgment at 17, but the factual patterns in that ease and this one have many similarities. Here the government became aware of a fraud, but it chose to continue benefitting from the contract before ultimately canceling the contract and claiming forfeiture of the contractor\u2019s claims. The government\u2019s contention that it was under a \u201cgag order\u201d and could not halt shipments without jeopardizing its investigation, <em>id. </em>at 20, ignores the record evidence that the ordered shipments of ammunition were continued because they were desperately needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In the alternative, the government argues there are outstanding issues of material fact that would make a decision on waiver premature, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. for Summ. Judgment at 29-30. The court agrees. The specific timing of the issuance, delivery, and acceptance of Delivery Orders 3 and 4 are generally delineated by the existing record, as are some of the government\u2019s activities to investigate AEYs activities to deliver Chinese-made ammunition for Delivery Order 2.

AEY\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Government\u2019s Counterclaims, Which Sets Out Allegations Premised on the False Claims Act</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Count II of the government\u2019s counterclaims alleges that AEY is liable under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) for the prior invoices submitted for the ammunition shipped under Delivery Order 2 that was manufactured by a communist Chinese military company. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-92. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Ans. &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-92. AEY has moved to dismiss this count of the government\u2019s counterclaims, arguing that it was a compulsory counterclaim that should have been brought in <em>AEY I, </em>the prior civil case in this court, and is barred by claim preclusion. Pl.\u2019s RCFC 12(b)(6) Mot. to Dismiss Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, ECF No. 38.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The government alleges violations of two provisions of the FCA, calibrating its allegations to fit the effective dates of amendments to the Act. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-92. The Act was amended by Public Law 111-21, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (\u201cFERA\u201d), enacted on May 20, 2009. Generally, the amended provisions only \u201capply to conduct on or after the date of enactment,\u201d but with one exception that is arguably applicable to this case. Pub.L. 111-21, \u00a7 4(f), 123 Stat. 1625 (codified at 31 USC \u00a7 3729 note (2012) (effective date of 2009 amendment)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The count of the government\u2019s counterclaims rests on one unamended provision and one amended provision. The unamended provision, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1) provides that, for any person who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval ... the court may assess not less than 2 times the amount of damages which the [government sustains because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>act of the person. A person violating this subsection shall also be liable to the United States Government for the costs of a civil action brought to recover any such penalty or damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1) (2006). Notably, the government\u2019s count sets out minimal allegations of damage sustained as a result of AEYs delivery of Albanian-derived, Chinese-manufactured ammunition to satisfy Delivery Order 2. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b689 (\u201cBecause of the false [Certificates of Conformance], the United States Government paid AEY a total of $10,331,736.44 to which AEY was not entitled.\u201d). The government apparently accepted and used that ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The amended provision, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B), took effect as if enacted on June 7, 2008 and applies to all claims under the False Claims Act that were pending on or after that date. The pertinent portion of Section 3729 states that any person who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim ... [,] is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2641 note; Public Law 10[1]\u2014410), plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">In <em>AEY I, </em>AEY challenged the Army\u2019s termination of its contract for default, seeking a declaration that AEY was not in default and conversion to a termination for convenience. Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. at 3, ECF No. 37-1. In that action, that government filed a motion to dismiss, which the court treated as a motion for summary judgment because \u201cmatters outside the pleadings [were] presented to and not excluded by the court.\u201d <em>AEY I, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 303 (quoting RCFC 12(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">RCFC 13, the rule governing compulsory counterclaims, requires that \u201c[a] pleading state as a counterclaim any claim that\u2014 at the time of its service\u2014the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.\u201d RCFC 13(a)(1). The government does not dispute that its FCA counterclaim arises out of the same \u201ctransaction or occurrence\u201d addressed in the prior civil ease, but it contends that it never filed a \u201cpleading\u201d within the terms of the rules, and so it was never required to bring the counterclaim. Def.\u2019s Resp. to PL\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 5-6, ECF No. 41. The government is correct. RCFC Rule 7(a) lists the pleadings allowed in this court, and neither a motion to dismiss nor a motion for summary judgment is considered a pleading. As a consequence, courts have consistently held that a motion for summary judgment is not a \u201cpleading\u201d and does not trigger a requirement to file compulsory counterclaims. <em>See, e.g., Horn &amp; Hardart Co. v. National Rail Passenger Corp., </em>843 F.2d 546, 549 (D.C.Cir. 1988) (ruling in a claim for further relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, that a motion for summary judgment filed in the prior proceeding did not trigger the compulsory counterclaim requirement of Fed. R.Civ.P. 13(a)); <em>Trotter v. Jack Anderson Enters., Inc., </em>818 F.2d 431, 436 (5th Cir.1987) (holding that motion for summary judgment is not a responsive pleading).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">Similarly, the government is not otherwise prohibited from bringing its counterclaim by the common law rules of claim preclusion. Claim preclusion refers to the \u201ceffect of foreclosing any litigation of matters that never have been litigated, because of a determination that they should have been advanced in an earlier suit.\u201d 18 Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 4402 (2d. ed.2002); <em>see also Nevada v. United States, </em>463 U.S. 110, 129-30, 103 S.Ct. 2906, 77 L.Ed.2d 509 (1983) (considering that a final judgment is \u201ca finality as to the claim or demand in controversy ... not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose\u201d (quoting <em>Cromwell v. County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 352, 24 L.Ed. 195 (1876))). In this respect, the Federal Circuit has recognized rules particular to \u201cdefendant preclusion.\u201d <em>See Nasalok Coating Corp. v. Nylok Corp., </em>522 F.3d 1320, 1324 (Fed.Cir.2008). The court in <em>Nasalok </em>applied the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 22(2) (1982), which states: \u201cA defendant who may interpose a claim as a counterclaim but fails to do so is precluded after the rendition of judgment in that action, from maintaining an action on the claim, if: (a) [t]he counterclaim is required to be interposed by a compulsory counterclaim statute or rule of court <em>\\e.g., </em>RCFC 13(a) ] or (b) [t]he relationship between the counterclaim and the plaintiffs claim is such that successful prosecution of the second action would nullify the initial judgment or would impair rights established in the initial action.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, </em>\u00a7 22(2); <em>see Nasalok, </em>522 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In this case, the government was not required by RCFC 13(a) to bring its counterclaim in the prior action, and there is no concern that if the government prevails on its FCA counterclaim that it would have an adverse effect on the court\u2019s prior judgment. Consequently, the government\u2019s FCA counterclaim is not barred by application of RCFC 13(a) or claim preclusion. '</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">For the reasons stated, AEY\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Count I of the government\u2019s counterclaims and its motion to dismiss Count II of the government\u2019s counterclaims are DENIED. The government\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Count I of its counterclaims is also DENIED. AEY\u2019s motion to file an amended reply to the government\u2019s counterclaims is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-13\">.

In its most recent filings with the court, AEY has altered its terminology and appears to be referring to Delivery Order 2 as the \"first\u201d of three delivery orders, and to Delivery Orders 3 and 4 as the \"second\u201d and \"third,\u201d respectively. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Second Responsive Supplemental Br. at 2, ECF No. 67; Pl.'s Responsive Supplemental Br. at 3, ECF No. 61-1. The parties do not explain or describe Delivery Orders 1 and 5, if, indeed, any such Delivery Orders actually existed. Notwithstanding the resulting gap in the record, the court will maintain the original terminology used by the parties throughout all prior briefing, in part because the government has not altered its use of the terms, and in part because the exhibits that accompany AEY\u2019s Complaint and Motion for Summary Judgment refer to the invoices at issue as arising out of Delivery Orders (labeled as Task Orders) 3 and 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\">.

In <em>KBR I, </em>the trial judge opined that while <em>Little </em>was not wrongly decided, it had been stretched far beyond its holding, pointing to <em>Brown Constr. Trades, Inc. v. United States, 23 </em>Cl.Ct. 214, 216 (1991), as the first major expansion of <em>Little. See KBR I, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 499. In <em>Brown Construction, </em>a contractor\u2019s vice-president was charged with bribery and conspiring to bribe a government official responsible for inspection of his work. <em>Brown Constr., </em>23 Cl.Ct. at 215. The contract was terminated, and the contractor filed suit for work completed prior to the default termination. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15. The court held that the Forfeiture Statute applied to plaintiff\u2019s claim because the contract was \"tainted by fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216. \"As a consequence, the court effectively read out of the law the requirement that the fraud relate to the 'proof, statement, establishment or allowance,\u2019 of [a] claim.\u201d <em>KBR I, </em>99 Fed.Cl. at 500. This improper interpretation of <em>Little </em>had been carried forward to stand for the proposition that the Forfeiture Statute applies if there has been any fraud in the performance of a contract. <em>See, e.g., American Heritage Bancorp, </em>61 Fed.Cl. at 387; <em>Anderson, </em>47 Fed.Cl. at 444 (\u201d[T]he statute is not confined to the presentment of the claim.\u201d); <em>UMC Electronics, </em>43 Fed.Cl. at 790 (\"[A] claim against the United States is to be forfeited if fraud is practiced during contract performance or in the making of a claim.\u201d); <em>Crane Helicopter Servs., </em>45 Fed.Cl. at 431 (same); <em>Supermex, </em>35 Fed.Cl. at 39-40 (same); <em>Ab-Tech Constr., Inc. v.

The term \"claim\u201d in the context used by the court in <em>KBR I </em>in explaining <em>Little </em>was apparently not limited to a legal claim presented to the court but instead referred to invoices (falsified vouchers) submitted to the government based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>false attendance records maintained by Little pri- or to May 1, 1949. <em>See KBR I, 99 </em>Fed.Cl. at 498-99.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">. This would be a very different case if the government were able to malte credible allegations that AEY had obtained the underlying contract by fraudulent means. <em>See United States ex rel.

Countercl. Reply at 21. In a hypertechnical legal sense, this position can be understood as a restatement of the principle that the Contract Disputes Act does not allow a contracting officer to consider claims involving fraud. <em>See Martin J.

The contracting officer's action in this case to rule on fraud in denying AEY\u2019s claims regarding Delivery Orders 3 and 4 does not, however, affect in any realistic way this court\u2019s judicial power to adjudicate AEY's and the government\u2019s competing claims because the court can ignore the contracting officer\u2019s specific conclusions and treat the officer's action as a straightforward denial of AEY\u2019s claims. In all events, the court considers an action on a claim as a <em>de novo </em>matter, and not as an appeal from a contracting officer\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(b)(4) (\"An action under paragraph (1) or (2)[, <em>i.e., </em>inclusive of an action brought in this court on a claim that has been presented to a contracting officer] shall proceed de novo in accordance with the rules of the appropriate court.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\">.
