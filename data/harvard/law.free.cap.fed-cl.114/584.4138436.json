Defendant has moved instead to dismiss Plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, on the grounds that both of her claims are barred by this Court\u2019s applicable six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs claims accrued more than six years prior to the filing of her complaint, it is jurisdictionally obliged to grant Defendant\u2019s motion and to dismiss her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">Plaintiff, Ms. Jaime L. Feliciano, enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on August 26, 2002, and obtained the rank of Lance Corporal (E3). Compl. \u00b6 6. She was discharged on September 24, 2004. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">Ms. Feliciana avers that on September 25, 2002, during recruit combat training, she fell from an obstacle course tower and was knocked unconscious. Compl. \u00b6 6. She asserts that she was diagnosed with a concussion \u201cas a result of traumatic brain injury\u201d and that she later developed migraines, syncopal episodes, and dementia. <em>Id. </em>She alleges that her medical issues persisted into 2003, after having reported to duty station in Okinawa, Japan. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 7. In July 2003, she was medically evacuated from Japan to Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California, for treatment, medication, and injury management. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 8. She was placed on limited duty upon return to her duty station in Japan. In December 2003, she asserts she was counseled by her command for deficiency in performance, including in particular\u2019 an inability, which she attributes to her migraines, dizziness, and fainting, to participate in various exercises, conditioning hikes, and field duty. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">In February 2004, military police investigated the alleged theft of Ms. Feliciano\u2019s prescription medication by a fellow Marine. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 10. The accused admitted the theft and that he had shared the medications with a roommate. The roommate required medical intervention for overdosing. <em>Id. </em>The accused subsequently recanted his admission and claimed that Ms. Feliciano had given him the medication. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">Ms. Feliciano\u2019s own medical issues continued. On March 3, 2004, the Neurology Department at Naval Hospital Okinawa notified her command that she was not responding well to treatment for her loss of consciousness/syncopal episodes and migraines and that a medical board had been initiated. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 11. On March 25, 2004, she was afforded preliminary counseling regarding disability processing and a Medical Evaluation Board (\u201cMEB\u201d) referred her medical record to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Physical Evaluation Board (\u201cPEB\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 12; Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.\u201d) at 2. As her complaint recites, \u201cThis counseling indicated that she was being considered for separation or retirement based on her disabilities.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">On April 2, 2004, however, she received non judicial punishment (\u201cNJP\u201d) under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the offenses of having wrongfully distributed two prescription medications: amitriptyline pills in January 2004 and Pereocet pills in November 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 14. She was reduced in rank and forfeited two months\u2019 pay. <em>Id. </em>On May 12, 2004, she was notified of the initiation of administrative separation proceedings due to misconduct related to drug abuse. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 16. The misconduct was characterized as \u201cwrongful use of amitriptyline.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Citing her pending administrative separation due to misconduct, the PEB \u201crejected\u201d Ms. Feliciano\u2019s medical evaluation referral. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 17; Def.\u2019s Mot., App\u2019x A009. The rejection was not a merits-based determination, but rather made because the service-member had a preemptory action for legal/administrative-based separation already pending. <em>Id. </em>As Plaintiff noted in her response to the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, citing Secretary of the Navy Instruction (\u201cSECNA-VINST\u201d) 1850.4E, Para. 3403, \u201cdisciplinary separation ... normally superseded] disability separation or retirement.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">While her administrative separation action was proceeding, Plaintiff was evacuated in June 2004 to the Naval Medical Center in San Diego for continued neurological treatment. Compl. \u00b6 19. A medical treatment note in September 2004 asserted that she was determined \u201cunfit for duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b620. On September 10, 2004, the Navy issued a second MEB for her post-eoneussive syndrome. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 21. She was given a processing memo relating to a PEB separation physical exam requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Nevertheless, she was discharged from the Marine Corps on September 24, 2004, under \u201cother than honorable conditions\u201d due to misconduct related to drug abuse. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 23. Although the second MEB had again referred her to a PEB for disability consideration, a second PEB never was convened. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">On August 8, 2005, Ms. Feliciano applied to the Naval Discharge Review Board (\u201cNDRB\u201d) for an upgrade to honorable of the characterization of her discharge. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 25. On May 4, 2006, the NDRB denied the relief sought. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 26. Nearly three years later, on February 12, 2009, Ms. Feliciano submitted an appeal to the NDRB of the denial of her request for relief. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 27. On April 30, 2010, the NDRB granted her relief to the extent that her discharge was upgraded to \u201chonorable\u201d pursuant to \u201cSecretarial Authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Consequently, on June 16,2011, Ms. Feliciano applied to the Board for Correction of Naval Records (\u201cBCNR\u201d) for relief including back pay, removal of her NJP, and disability retirement benefits. On September 20, 2012, however, the BCNR denied her application. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 33. It found that her application was untimely and that it was not in the interest of justice to excuse its untimeliness. <em>Id.; </em>Def.\u2019s Mot., App\u2019x A001. The BCNR noted that it was \u201cunable to conduct a meaningful review of your contentions of legal error in the imposition of your nonjudieial punishment, or of your claim of factual innocence of the charge offenses, due to the amount of time which has elapsed since the punishment was imposed ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BCNR further noted that the NDRB\u2019s upgrade of Ms. Feliciano\u2019s discharge to honorable due to Secretarial Authority \u201cdid not have the effect of setting aside the discharge, and it did not entitle you to consideration of your case by the Physical Evaluation Board, or correction of your naval record to show that you were retired by reason of physical disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 33; Def.\u2019s Mot., App\u2019x A002.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Plaintiff filed her complaint in this Court on July 1, 2013. She asserts that the BCNR decision was arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law and regulations, and not supported by substantial evidence. Compl. \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">II. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">Under the Tucker Act, the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction \u201cto render judgment upon any claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (2006). While the Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for monetary damages, it is \u201conly a jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). That substantive right must derive from a source that is \u201cmoney-mandating.\u201d <em>See Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc in relevant part).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In this case, Ms. Feliciano claims disability retirement pay under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 and restoration of military rank and forfeited pay under 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204. However, all claims before this court under the Tucker Act are subject to a six-year statute of limitations: \u201cEvery claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. The limitations period under \u00a7 2501 \u201cmay not be waived\u201d because it is \u201ca jurisdictional requirement for a suit in the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, </em>457 F.3d 1345, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2006), aff<em>'d, </em>552 U.S. 130, 128 S.Ct. 750, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008). Likewise, it is \u201cnot susceptible to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>552 U.S. at 136, 128 S.Ct. 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In <em>Martinez v. United States, </em>the Federal Circuit determined that \u201c[a] cause of action cognizable in a Tucker Act suit accrues as soon as all events have occurred that are necessary to enable the plaintiff to bring suit, i.e., when \u2018all events have occurred to fix the Government\u2019s alleged liability, entitling the claimant to demand payment and sue here for his money.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martinez v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1295, 1303 (Fed.Cir.2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Nager Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>368 F.2d 847, 851 (Ct.Cl.1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In the context of a claim arising from a military discharge, a \u201cplaintiffs cause of action for back pay accrues at the time of the plaintiffs discharge.\u201d \u201c[T]he claim for back pay,\u201d however, \u201cis not a \u2018continuing claim\u2019 that accrues each time a payment would be due throughout the period that the service member would have remained on active duty.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>333 F.3d at 1303 (internal citations omitted). Rather, it accrues on the date of discharge, \u201c \u2018once and for all.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mathis v. United States, </em>391 F.2d 938, 939 (Ct.Cl.1968)). Therefore, a claimant must file suit within the six-year limitation period provided under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 or \u201cthe plaintiff loses all rights to sue for the loss of pay stemming from the challenged discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304. Consistently, a claimant cannot toll the claim by seeking permissive administrative review before a military corrections review board. <em>Id. </em>at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Federal Circuit differentiates, however, between the accrual date of claims arising from a military discharge and \u201cclaims of entitlement to disability retirement pay\u201d because the latter claims \u201cgenerally do not accrue until the appropriate military board either finally denies such a claim or refuses to hear it.\u201d <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1218, 1224 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citing <em>Real v. United States, </em>906 F.2d 1557, 1560 (Fed.Cir. 1990)). Because, under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, Congress entrusted the military with the initial task of assessing retirement due to disability, \u201cno cause of action arises (and the statute of limitations does not run) until a proper board has acted or declined to act.\u201d <em>Friedman v. United States, </em>310 F.2d 381, 389 (Ct.Cl.1962). By contrast, \u201cmere release from active duty without a Retiring Board (or request for one) or without disability retirement pay is not enough to start the limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In <em>Real, </em>the Federal Circuit characterized the <em>Friedman </em>rule: \u201cThus, under <em>Friedman </em>if the service member had neither requested nor been offered consideration by a retiring board prior to discharge, the later denial of his petition by the corrections board was the triggering event, not his discharge.\u201d <em>Real, </em>906 F.2d at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Ms. Feliciano\u2019s claims must be dismissed because they accrued more than six years before she filed her complaint on July 1, 2013 and her claims cannot otherwise be tolled. Both of Ms. Feliciano\u2019s claims, requesting disability retirement pay under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201and restoration of military rank and forfeited pay under 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a), accrued at the time of her military discharge on September 24, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A. Claim for Restoration of Military Rank and Forfeited Pay</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The Federal Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Martinez, </em>stating that \u201ca plaintiffs cause of action for back pay accrues at the time of the plaintiffs discharge,\u201d renders Ms. Feliciano\u2019s claim for the restoration of military rank and forfeited pay under 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 204 time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 because it accrued when she was discharged from the Marine Corps on September 24, 2004. <em>Martinez, </em>333 F.3d at 1303 (internal citations omitted). Ms. Feliciano must have filed her case on or before September 2010 in order for her claim to have been within the six-year limitation period prescribed by \u00a7 2501.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">B. Claim for Disability Retirement Pay</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Whether Ms. Feliciano\u2019s claim for disability benefits accrued as of the September 2004 date of her military discharge or in September 2012 when the BCNR denied her application is a closer question than the accrual date of her claim for back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">In <em>Chambers, </em>the Federal Circuit indicated that a disability retirement pay claim wouldn\u2019t generally \u201caccrue until the appropriate military board either finally denies such a claim or refuses to hear it.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>417 F.3d at 1224 (internal citations omitted). The Federal Circuit also stated in <em>Chambers </em>that, \u201cif at the time of discharge, the service member requested review by an appropriate board and the request was denied, or if the board heard the service member\u2019s claim and denied it, then the limitations period begins to run upon discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225. Prior to <em>Chambers, </em>the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Real </em>stated pertinently that \u201c[a] subsequent petition to the corrections board does not toll the running of the limitations period.\u201d <em>Real, </em>906 F.2d at 1560 (citing <em>Friedman, </em>310 F.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">Prior to Ms. Feliciano\u2019s discharge from the Marine Corps on September 24, 2004, the PEB had already rejected Ms. Feliciano\u2019s MEB\u2014on May 18, 2004\u2014because of her pending administrative separation. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 23. Prior to her military discharge, the Department of the Navy initiated a second MEB for Ms. Feliciano\u2019s postconeussive syndrome on September 10, 2004, but that report was not referred to an PEB for adjudication until October 1, 2004, subsequent to her discharge. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b621, 24. Since Ms. Feliciano was discharged from the Marine Corps without the PEB having considered her second MEB referral, Plaintiff argues that the BCNR in 2012 was \u201cthe first proper board to act on her claims.\u201d PL\u2019s Resp. at 9. Thus, per the guidance in <em>Chambers, </em>she argues, \u201cthe statute of limitations did not begin to run until the decision of the BCNR was issued.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">Unfortunately for Ms. Feliciano, it is significant that the second MEB derives from the same injury addressed in the first MEB, which was referred to a PEB on March 25, 2004. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 6,12,13,17. At the time of her discharge, therefore, the PEB had already rejected, i.e., \u201cdenied,\u201d her first MEB and did not convene to address the second MEB referral regarding the same injury. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 24. Under <em>Chambers, </em>the PEB\u2019s refusal to consider Ms. Feliciano\u2019s first MEB establishes that her disability claim accrued upon the date of Ms. Feliciano\u2019s discharge. <em>Chambers, </em>417 F.3d at 1224 (disability claim accrues when \u201cthe appropriate military board either finally denies such a claim or <em>refuses to hear it.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). The decision in <em>Chambers </em>also firmly establishes that a PEB constitutes such an appropriate board. <em>Id. </em>at 1225 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">However, Plaintiff insists that Ms. Feliciano\u2019s discharge without a final determination on her second MEB evidences the BCNR\u2019s 2012 decision as the date her claim accrued, based the following statement from <em>Chambers </em>: \u201cBut where the claimant \u2018has not had or sought a [PEB], his claim does not accrue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>until final action by the Correction Board (which in that instance stands in the place of the [PEB] as the proper tribunal to determine eligibility for disability retirement).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225 (quoting <em>Friedman, </em>310 F.2d at 396). Plaintiff also contends that the following statement in <em>Chambers </em>supports her argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">Thus where the service member was released from service without a board hearing and subsequently files a claim for disability retirement before a military correction board, \u2018the Correction Board becomes the first proper board to act (or to be asked to act) on the matter, and the claim does not ripen until that Board\u2019s action is final____\u2019 The Correction Board proceeding \u2018becomes a <em>mandatory </em>remedy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Friedman, </em>310 F.2d at 396).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Accordingly, Plaintiff contends that \u201c[h]ad Ms. Feliciano filed suit in this court [soon after her 2004 discharge] there would be a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because she was not eligible to receive disability compensation because of her misconduct discharge.\u201d PL\u2019s Resp. at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Ms. Feliciano is mistaken. In fact, a PEB took cognizance of Ms. Feliciano\u2019s first MEB referral and rejected it before her discharge. Compl. at \u00b6 17. Thus the PEB, not the Corrections Board, became \u201cthe first proper board to act (or to be asked to act) on the matter.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>417 F.3d at 1225 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Plaintiff also contends that because she herself had not requested the PEB, her claim could not have accrued until the BCNR\u2019s 2012 decision. PL\u2019s Resp. at 9. \u201cUnder either MEB, Ms. Feliciano did not have or seek a retiring board. Both MEB\u2019s were convened at the direction of military medical officers and not by request of Ms. Feliciano.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court does not find that distinction to be determinative. The key element in determining the accrual date of a disability retirement claim is the <em>action </em>of an authorized board, not who requested the PEB. <em>See Real, </em>906 F.2d at 1560 (\u201cif the service member had neither requested <em>nor been offered consideration </em>by a retiring board ...) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">As Defendant soundly argues, \u201cMs. Feliciano\u2019s disability claim for injuries suffered during basic training was forwarded from the MEB to the PEB, which took cognizance of the claim but ultimately refused to hear\u2019 it because of administrative separation proceedings related to her drug abuse.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">It is not necessary that the PEB must have acted on the merits of Plaintiffs disability consideration. It refused to hear her claim and that \u201crejection\u201d triggered the running of the six-year statute of limitations from the time of her discharge on September 24, 2004. She filed her complaint in this Court, however, more than six years later, on July 1, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">Because the limitations period is jurisdictional, this Court is not empowered to proceed in hearing her claims. For the above reasons, Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
