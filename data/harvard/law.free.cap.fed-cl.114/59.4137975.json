No.) 1, \u00b6 3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. of Invalidity of All Claims of the Patent-in-Suit (defendant\u2019s Motion or Def.\u2019s Mot.), Dkt. No. 59, Ex. A (\u2019652 patent). Plaintiff brought this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a) (2006) to recover compensation for the government\u2019s alleged unlawful use or manufacture of the invention covered by the \u2019652 patent. Compl. 1; <em>cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a) (providing a cause of action for patent infringement by the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Defendant has moved for summary judgment on its affirmative defense of invalidity, contending that each claim of the \u2019652 patent is anticipated by U.S. Patent No. 5,035,472 (filed July 30, 1991) (the Hansen patent or the Hansen device), pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e) (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s Mot. 1; <em>see also id. </em>Ex. B (Hansen patent). In the alternative, defendant contends that claims two and three of the \u2019652 patent are rendered invalid as obvious by the combination of the Hansen patent and a second prior art reference. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. Defendant asserts that \u201cthe testimony of plaintiffs expert [witness], Mr. [James Brian] Gillespie, should be ignored by the court because it has been proven unreliable.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply in Supp. of its Mot. for Summ. J. of Invalidity of all Claims of the Patent-in-Suit (defendant\u2019s Reply or Def.\u2019s Reply), Dkt. No. 69, at 23 (emphasis and some capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">The central issue to be resolved on summary judgment is whether the earlier-issued Hansen patent anticipates the independent brightness adjustment feature of the \u2019652 patent. <em>See infra </em>Part III.A.2 (discussing the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this issue). Both the Hansen patent and the \u2019652 patent contain two types of imaging assemblies: (1) an image intensifler, which amplifies dim light and near-infrared energy; and (2) a thermal imager, which detects the far-infrared thermal signature of warm objects, such as human beings. <em>See infra </em>Part I.A-B (describing these assemblies). The \u2019652 patent also describes a mechanism for independently adjusting the output brightness, or intensity, of the two imaging assemblies, which allows a user to determine how much of the final viewed image is made up of output from the respective imaging assemblies. <em>See infra </em>Part I.A,</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">Relying on the testimony of its expert witness, Mr. Gillespie, as to how the Hansen patent would be interpreted by a person of ordinary skill in the art as well as the testimony of its fact witness, Mr. Roland G. Dumais, Jr., as to the capabilities of the night vision systems in the Army\u2019s possession at the relevant time,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plaintiff contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Hansen patent does not anticipate the independent brightness adjustment feature. <em>See </em>PI. CANVS Corp.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to the Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. of Invalidity (plaintiffs Response or PL\u2019s Resp.), Dkt. No. 66, at 8-9. Defendant contends that the Hansen patent does anticipate this feature, relying on the testimony of its expert witness, Dr. Allen M. Waxman, as to the correct interpretation of the Hansen patent. Def.\u2019s Mot. 14-16 (applying Dr. Waxman\u2019s interpretation of the Hansen patent); Def.\u2019s Reply 14 (same); <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex.

No. 78, filed by leave of the court on September 5, 2013. Oral argument was conducted on September 18, 2013.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This matter was transferred to the undersigned on October 18, 2013. Order of Oct. 18, 2013, Dkt. No. 79. For the following reasons, defendant\u2019s motion is GRANTED-IN-PART and DENIED-IN-PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"AAt\">A. The \u2019652 Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The \u2019652 patent is directed toward a \u201clow light imaging device\u201d with two imaging assemblies: an image intensifier and a thermal imager.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. A (\u2019652 patent) [57]. The output brightness of each imaging assembly can be adjusted independently so that each assembly provides more or less of the output image viewed by the user.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>According to the \u2019652 patent\u2019s specification, the image intensifier \u201camplif[ies] ... photons in order to generate an enhanced photon based image.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col.4 1.44-45. The thermal imager \u201cis preferably of a class of imaging assemblies which are able to detect or identify thermal energy emitted or radiated by a particular object\u201d and \u201cpreferably includes an infrared imaging device,\u201d commonly known as a \u201cforward looking infrared deviee[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>col.41.12-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">The independent adjustments are intended to allow the user to take advantage of the benefits of both types of imaging assemblies while minimizing the deficiencies of each. <em>See id. </em>col.2 1.32-36. For instance, image intensifiers are not useful in total darkness because they require \u201cat least some photons to be perceived by the night vision device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>eol.l' 1.41-43. Contrastingly, thermal imagers can function in total darkness, <em>id. </em>col.2 1.15-18, because they operate by detecting the thermal signatures of warm items, <em>id. </em>col.2 1.5-8. \u201c[H]owever, in some cireum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>stances[,] [thermal imagers] do not provide a sufficiently clear image and/or may be blocked by other objects which can mask or interfere with ... the perception of emitted infrared radiation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col.2 1.18-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The \u2019652 patent contains seven claims, the first of which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">1. A low light imaging device comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">a) an optical input structured to define a line of sight;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">b) a thermal imaging assembly responsive to radiation signatures disposed within said line of sight;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">c) an image intensification assembly responsive to photons at least within said line of sight;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">d) said thermal imaging assembly structured to generate a real time thermal image representative of said radiation signatures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">e) said image intensification assembly structured to generate a real time enhanced photon based image;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">f) an image adjustment assembly including a thermal image adjustment assembly and a photon image adjustment assembly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">g) said thermal image adjustment assembly structured to adjust an intensity of said thermal image;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">h) said photon image adjustment assembly structured to adjust said image intensification assembly so as to adjust an intensity of said enhanced photon based image generated thereby;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-14\">i) said thermal image adjustment assembly and said photon image adjustment assembly being structured to be operable independent from one another; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-15\">j) an output image generation assembly structured to combine said thermal image and said enhanced photon based image to generate a real-time, direct view output image.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-19\"><em>Id. </em>col.61.33-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-20\">Claims four, five and seven describe the independent brightness adjustment feature. Claim four, which depends from claim one, provides: \u201cA low light imaging device as recited in claim 1 wherein said thermal image adjustment assembly and said photon image adjustment assembly are structured to be independently and separately adjusted relative to one another.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>col.7 1.19-23. Claim five describes image adjustment assemblies \u201coperable to adjust ... [the] imaging assemblies so as to adjust an intensity of said thermal image and said enhanced photon based image.\u201d <em>Id. </em>eol.7 1.33-38. Claim seven, although it appears to be missing several words, also seems to describe independent adjustment. <em>See id. </em>col.81.29-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-21\">B. The Hansen Patent</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">The Hansen patent lists Charles L. Hansen\u2014an employee of the United States Army stationed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia\u2014as its inventor and \u201c[t]he United States ... [whose interest is] represented by the Secretary of the Army,\u201d as the assignee. <em>See id. </em>Ex. B (Hansen patent) [73], [75]. The Hansen patent is directed toward a \u201cmultispectral sight.\u201d <em>See id. </em>[57]. According to its specification, the Hansen device has \u201cprocessing means for each of ... three distinct spectrum channels,\u201d which \u201care preferably a visible spectrum for daytime viewing, a near infrared spectrum for twilight viewing, and a far infrared spectrum for thermal viewing at nighttime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col.l 1.61-66. The Hansen device uses fully reflective mirrors and partially reflective mirrors (called beam splitters)\u2014arranged as shown in the following schematic drawing, labeled figure 4\u2014to separate, direct, and ultimately recombine the three types of radiant energy (visible light, near-infrared energy and far-infrared energy) into a final output image:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><em>Id. </em>fig. 4; <em>see also id. </em>col.3 1.10-13 (describing figure 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The following description accompanies figure 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">The multispeetral radiant energy 6 ... enters the sight through sighting window 15.... A first partially reflective beam splitter 16A ... passes the [far-infrared] wavelengths of radiant energy ... along a far infrared spectrum channel 19A for processing. Beam splitter 16A reflects the shorter wavelength visible and near infrared speetrums to a second partially reflective beam splitter 16B[,] which passes the near infrared spectrum ... radiant energy ... [,] which is reflected off a first fully reflective mirror 16C along a near infrared spectrum channel 19C for processing. Beam splitter 16B reflects the visible spectrum of ... radiant energy ... along a visible spectrum channel 19B for processing____ All three channels have separate processing means and means for activating to process their respective radiant energy speetrums and whose processed signals exit therefrom ... for an observer to view through eyepiece lens 12A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\"><em>Id. </em>eol.3 1.14-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Both of the imaging assemblies relevant to defendant\u2019s Motion are portrayed in Figure 4. The Hansen device\u2019s thermal imager \u201cis comprised of the readily available U.S. Army forward looking infrared sight electro-optic elements\u201d\u2014including \u201can uncooled focal plane array 18[,] controlled by focal plane array electronics 24[,] in which the far infrared spectrum is converted to equivalent electrical signals[,] which are in turn fed directly to a cathode ray tube display 26 for reconverting the electrical signals to the visible spectrum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col.3 1.43-53. The output of the cathode ray tube, which is red, \u201cis reflected off a fourth partially reflective beam splitter 56, which is red reflective, ... to an observer.\u201d <em>See id. </em>eol.3 1.53-57. The image intensifier \u201cis preferably a U.S. Army third generation image intensifier tube 28[,] which amplifies and magnifies the near infrared image.\u201d <em>Id. </em>col.4 1.13-15. The output of the image intensifier, which is green, is reflected \u201conto beam splitter 54, which is green reflective ... for viewing by an observer.\u201d <em>See id. </em>col.4 1.15-20. \u201cThe visible spectrum channel 19B operates as a daytime sight\u201d and directs visible light to an observer. <em>See id. </em>col.3 1.62-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Of particular relevance to whether the Hansen device provides for independent brightness adjustment are the control knobs and switches on the device. These control knobs and switches activate the near-infrared, far-infrared and visible light channels, and adjust the image viewed by the user. The controls are visible in the following diagram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><em>Id. </em>fig. 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">By turning rotary switch 30 on the Hansen device, the observer can activate the near-infrared channel, the far-infrared channel, the visible light channel or both the near-infrared and far-infrared channels. <em>See id. </em>col.2 1.38-44. When the visible light channel is not activated, visible light is blocked by light valve 50 (visible in figure 4). <em>See id. </em>col.3 1.65-coL41.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The sight\u2019s output can be adjusted in several ways. Directly relevant to the parties\u2019 arguments are the adjustment capabilities described in the Hansen patent: \u201cSwitches 34 and 36 control the power to [image intensifier tube] 28, [uncooled focal plane array] 18, [focal plane array electronics] 24, and [cathode ray tube] 26 to respectively control the scene contrast and brightness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>eol.4 1.26-28; <em>see also id. </em>col.21.44-48 (\u201cA plurality of thumb nail rotary switches 36, 34, and 32 ... respectively adjust scene brightness, contrast, and the brightness of the reticle.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">C. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Plaintiff filed this action on August 11, 2010, \u201cseeking recovery of CANVS\u2019 reasonable and entire compensation, as well as all other appropriate remedies[] arising from Defendant\u2019s [alleged] infringement of [the \u2019652 patent] and Defendant\u2019s [alleged] use and/or manufacture, without license or lawful right, of inventions described in and covered by CANVS\u2019 \u2019652 patent.\u201d Compl. 1. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle (device one) manufactured by ITT Industries infringed all seven claims of the \u2019652 patent and \u201chas been and is being used by and has been and is being manufactured for the United States without license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. In subsequent briefing, plaintiff identified nine additional accused devices, produced by several manufacturers, including the Dual Band Universal Night Sight (device two). <em>See CANVS Corp. v. United States, </em>110 Fed.Cl. 19, 25 n. 3 (2013) (listing the ten accused devices). After a series of delays and subsequent failures to comply with the court\u2019s rules and orders, plaintiffs claims with respect to accused devices three through ten have been dismissed for failure to prosecute. <em>See generally CANVS Corp. v. United States, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 100 (2012) (dismissing plaintiffs claims with respect to devices three through ten); <em>CANVS Corp., </em>110 Fed.Cl. 19 (denying reconsideration). As a result, plaintiff is currently proceeding only with its claims respecting devices one and two. <em>See CANVS Corp., </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">On November 16, 2012, plaintiff filed a motion to amend its claim chart to add six additional devices. <em>See </em>PI. CANVS Corp.\u2019s 2d Mot. to Show Good Cause Supporting the Amendment of its Infringement Claim Charts, Dkt. No. 51, at 1. The court stayed this motion to amend pending the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>resolution of defendant\u2019s instant Motion. <em>See </em>Order of Mar. 26, 2013, Dkt. No. 63, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Defendant filed its Motion on March 12, 2013. <em>See generally </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Ordinarily, courts conduct claim construction proceedings before addressing whether the patent-in-suit is invalid. <em>See, e.g., Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Cable &amp; Wireless Internet Servs., Inc., </em>344 F.3d 1186, 1192 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cThe first step in any invalidity analysis is claim construction____\u201d). In this case, however, the parties agree that claim construction is not required before the court decides defendant\u2019s Motion. See Def.\u2019s Mot. 2 (adopting plaintiffs position on claim construction\u2014 that, with the exception of one claim term, no claim construction is necessary\u2014for purposes of defendant\u2019s Motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">II. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"Aon\">A. Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC), a motion for summary judgment may be granted only when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d RCFC 56(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A dispute about a material fact is genuine if, \u201cview[ing] the record evidence through the- prism of the evidentiary standard of proof that would pertain at a trial on the merits,\u201d <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Barr Labs., Inc., </em>251 F.3d 955, 962 (Fed.Cir.2001), \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable [factfinder] could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The moving party has the initial burden of establishing \u201cthe absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Crater Corp. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>255 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2001). Thereafter, \u201c[t]he party opposing the motion must point to an evidentiary conflict created on the record; mere denials or conclusory statements are insufficient.\u201d <em>SRI Int\u2019l v. Matsushita Electric Corp. of Am., </em>775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en banc). \u201cThe evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Accordingly, the court may not weigh evidence or make credibility determinations when ruling on a motion for summaiy judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">B. Anticipation</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">Patents are presumed to be valid, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282(a), a presumption that can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Mfg., L.P., </em>424 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2005). Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102, a patent is invalid if it is anticipated by the prior art, that is, if \u201cthe invention was described in ... a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention by the applicant for patent.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e). Specifically, \u201ca claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior art reference.\u201d <em>Celeritas Techs., Ltd. v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998). The anticipating reference must be enabling, meaning that it \u201cmust teach one of ordinary skill in the art to make or carry out the claimed invention without undue experimentation.\u201d <em>Minn. Mining &amp; Mfg. Co v. Chemque, Inc., </em>303 F.3d 1294, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">\u201c[A] prior art reference may anticipate when the claim limitation or limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it.\u201d <em>Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc. v. VUTEk, Inc., </em>537 F.3d 1349, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnder the principles of inherency, if the prior art necessarily functions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>accordance with, or includes, the claimed limitations, it anticipates.\u201d <em>Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco Inc., </em>190 F.3d 1342, 1347 (Fed.Cir. 1999). Courts properly may rely on extrinsic evidence<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to determine whether a particular feature is inherently present in the prior art reference. <em>Telemac Cellular Corp. v. Topp Telecom, Inc., </em>247 F.3d 1316, 1328 (Fed.Cir. 2001). \u201cThe evidence must make clear that the missing feature is necessarily present, and that it would be so recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhile anticipation is a question of fact, it may be decided on summary judgment if the record reveals no genuine dispute of material fact.\u201d <em>Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc., </em>537 F.3d at 1352 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Because a patent must be proven invalid by clear and convincing evidence, <em>Invitrogen Corp., </em>424 F.3d at 1378, \u201ca moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit such clear and convincing evidence of invalidity so that no reasonable [factfinder] could find otherwise,\u201d <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>251 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">A. Anticipation</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Defendant contends that the \u2019652 patent is invalid because each of its claims is anticipated by the Hansen device. Def.\u2019s Mot. 1. Defendant provides a meticulously thorough analysis of where it believes each limitation of the claims enumerated in the \u2019652 patent can be found in the Hansen patent. <em>See generally id. </em>Having reviewed defendant\u2019s analysis and the record evidence in detail, the court finds that defendant has satisfied its burden of initially establishing \u201cthe absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Cf. Crater Corp., </em>255 F.3d at 1366 (stating that a party moving for summary judgment must establish \u201cthe absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">To avoid summary judgment, plaintiff in turn \u201cmust point to an evidentiary conflict created on the record____\u201d <em>Cf. SRI Int\u2019l, </em>775 F.2d at 1116. Plaintiff has identified two potential evidentiary conflicts. Plaintiff contends that defendant has improperly grouped claims five, six and seven together with claim one for analysis. PL\u2019s Resp. 28-29. And plaintiff argues that the Hansen device does not anticipate the \u2019652 patent because it \u201cdoes not teach the independent adjustment of the [thermal imager] and [the image intensifier].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Plaintiff identifies no other potential evidentiary conflict and posits no other reason that defendant is not entitled to summary judgment of anticipation. For this reason, the court finds, as an apparent concession by plaintiff, that any claims of the \u2019652 patent that do not describe independent brightness adjustment and that have not been improperly grouped with other claims are anticipated by the Hansen patent. The court therefore focuses the following discussion on the grouping of claims and independent brightness adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">1. Defendant\u2019s Grouping of Claims Is Appropriate</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Plaintiff contends that defendant has improperly grouped claims five, six and seven together with claim one in its discussion of anticipation instead of addressing each claim with separate evidence and argument. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29; <em>cf, e.g., </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 13 (stating that, \u201c[d]ue to the similarity of the claim language, the same reasoning [that applies to the thermal imager in claim one] applies to the \u2018first imaging assembly\u2019 in part (b) of claim 5 and the \u2018thermal imaging assembly\u2019 in part (b) of claims 6 and 7\u201d). Plaintiff contends that defendant has \u201ca statutory obligation ... to address the invalidity of each claim separately.\u201d PL\u2019s Resp. 29 (citation omitted). Plaintiff cites to <em>Dayco Products, Inc. v. Total Containment, Inc. (Dayco), </em>329 F.3d 1358, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2003), for the proposition that defendant\u2019s failure to discuss the claims of the \u2019652 patent individually \u201cis contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>law, which requires that \u2018[e]aeh claim of a patent (whether in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims; [and] dependent or multiple dependent claims shall be presumed valid even though dependent upon an invalid claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370 (alterations in original) (quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">However, as defendant correctly notes, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Reply 22, the <em>Dayco </em>decision upon which plaintiff relies states that \u201cit is permissible to group claims together for disposition where resolution involves the same issues of validity; however, the justification for such grouping is possible only where those issues are substantially materially identical,\u201d <em>Dayco, </em>329 F.3d at 1370. In this case, defendant has explained why it believes that its anticipation analysis of claim one also applies to claims five, six and seven. <em>See, e.g., </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 13 (stating that, \u201c[d]ue to the similarity of the claim language, the same reasoning [that applies to the thermal imager in claim one] applies to the \u2018first imaging assembly1 in part (b) of claim 5 and the \u2018thermal imaging assembly\u2019 in part (b) of claims 6 and 7\u201d). And claim one does appear to be \u201csubstantially materially identical\u201d to claims five, six and seven for purposes of invalidity analysis. <em>Cf. Dayco, </em>329 F.3d at 1370. As one example out of many, claim one describes an \u201cimage intensification assembly structured to generate a real time enhanced photon based image.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. A (\u2019652 patent) col.6 I. 42-43. Claims five, six and seven describe a nearly identical assembly. <em>See id. </em>eol.7 1.30\u2014 32 (claim five, describing an \u201cimaging assembly structured to generate an enhanced photon based image\u201d); <em>id. </em>col.8 1.9-11 (claim six, describing \u201can image intensification assembly structured to generate an enhanced photon based image\u201d); <em>id. </em>col.8 1.26-28 (claim seven, describing \u201can image intensification assembly structured to generate an enhanced photon based image\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Plaintiff fails to rebut this showing with its own explanation of why claims five, six and seven are materially different for purposes of anticipation. On the contrary, plaintiff concedes that, for purposes of defendant\u2019s Motion, claim one is representative of claims five, six and seven. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 6 n.2 (stating that the differences between the claims, \u201cexcept for claim 4, are not material to the issues of validity raised by Defendant\u201d). The court therefore concludes that defendant\u2019s discussion of claim one simultaneously with claims five, six and seven is appropriate. <em>Cf. Dayco, </em>329 F.3d at 1370 (stating that grouping is permissible where the issues raised by each claim \u201care substantially materially identical\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">2. A Reasonable Factfinder Could Conclude that Independent Brightness Adjustment Is Not Found\u2014Either Expressly or Inherently\u2014in the Hansen Patent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-10\">a. A Reasonable Factfinder Could Conclude that Independent Brightness Adjustment Is Not Expressly Described in the Hansen Patent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Plaintiff contends that the Hansen patent does not anticipate the \u2019652 patent because it \u201cdoes not teach the independent adjustment of the [thermal imager] and [the image intensifier].\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 9; <em>see also </em>Oral Argument of Mr. Zito at 10:05:45-06:03 (contending that whether the Hansen patent anticipates this feature of the \u2019652 patent is \u201c[t]he essence of what we\u2019re talking about today\u201d). This independent brightness adjustment feature is described in claims four, five and seven of the \u2019652 patent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Mot. Ex. A (\u2019652 patent) col.7 1.19-23 (claim four), col.7 1.33-38 (claim five), col.8 1.29- 33 (claim seven).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The court first considers whether the Hansen patent expressly teaches independent brightness adjustment. Both parties focus on the following sentence of the Hansen patent specification: \u201cSwitches 34 and 36 control the power to [image intensifier tube] 28, [uneooled focal plane array] 18, [focal plane array electronics] 24, and [cathode ray tube] 26 to respectively control the scene contrast and brightness.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. B (Hansen patent) col.41.26-28; <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 15-16 (interpreting this sentence); PL\u2019s Resp. 9-15 (same); Def.\u2019s Reply 14-15 (same). No wiring diagram was included to show the connections described in this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Plaintiff contends that the \u201c[p]lain reading of the sentence demonstrates that [switches 34 and 36 control] the brightness and contrast of the entire scene,\u201d but not of the thermal imager and image intensifier individually. PL\u2019s Resp. 11 (emphasis omitted). Plaintiff contends that the sentence \u201ccould be re-written as: Switch 34 controls the power to 28, 18, 24, and 26 to control the scene contrast [and] switch 36 controls the power to 28, 18, 24, and 26 to control scene brightness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(italieization omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 10 (\u201c[B]oth switches are connected to both sensors____\u201d); Oral Argument of Mr. Zito at 10:23:54-24:01 (\u201cSwitch 34 respectively controls contrast. Switch 36 respectively controls brightness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Defendant responds that \u201cthe most logical reading\u201d of the sentence is that \u201crotary switch 34 controls power to the image intensifier 28, while rotary switch 36 controls power to the thermal imager, which comprises elements 18, 24, and 26.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 14. Stressing the Hansen patent\u2019s use of the word \u201c \u2018respectively5 \u201d and the fact that the Hansen patent describes \u201c \u2018separate processing means\u2019 \u201d for the image intensifier and the thermal imager, defendant contends that it would be logical to group element 28 (the image intensifier) apart from elements 18, 24 and 26 (the thermal imager) and to assign a separate power control to each. <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>id. </em>Ex. B (Hansen patent) col.3 1.34-35); Oral Argument of Mr. Hudalla at 11:08:44-47 (\u201c[0]f course, you would group the elements of the thermal imager together.\u201d). Therefore, defendant contends, \u201cthumb nail rotary switches 34 and 36 in Hansen control the power to the image intensifier and the thermal imager, respectively.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">It is the court\u2019s view, however, that the plain meaning of the contested sentence favors plaintiffs position. The word \u201crespectively\u201d means \u201c[s]ingly in the order designated or mentioned.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>1485 (4th ed. 2006). Therefore, if \u201c[s]witches 34 and 36 ... respectively control the scene contrast and brightness,\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. B (Hansen patent) eol.4 1.26-28, it would follow that switch 34 controls scene contrast and switch 36 controls brightness.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Additional support for this interpretation of the patent language at issue is found in the following sentence that appears on the previous page of the Hansen patent: \u201cA plurality of thumb nail rotary switches 36, 34, and 32, ... respectively adjust scene brightness, contrast, and the brightness of the reticle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>eol.2 1.44-48. This earlier appearing sentence uses a construction similar to that in the later contested sentence, without mention of the two imaging assemblies to which\u2014defendant asserts\u2014the word \u201crespectively\u201d refers. The earlier appearing sentence with similar construction would seem to unambiguously state that switch 36 controls scene brightness, switch 34 controls scene contrast and switch 32 controls the brightness of the reticle. For this reason, the court is persuaded that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the Hansen patent expressly discloses independent brightness adjustment. <em>Cf. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>251 F.3d at 962 (stating that \u201ca moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit such clear and convincing evidence of invalid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ity so that no reasonable [factfinder] could find otherwise\u201d). Having determined that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that independent brightness adjustment is not explicitly present in the Hansen patent, the court considers whether such adjustment feature could be found to be inherently present.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">b. A Reasonable Factfinder Could Conclude that Independent Brightness Adjustment Is Not Inherently Present in the Hansen Patent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">When extrinsic evidence has been presented to establish that a feature is inherently present, \u201c[t]he evidence must make clear that the missing feature is necessarily present, and that it would be so recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.\u201d <em>Telemac Cellular Corp., </em>247 F.3d at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">As the preceding discussion indicates, the Hansen patent states that switch 34 controls the power to the image intensifier and thermal imager to control scene contrast, and switch 36 controls the power to the image intensifier and thermal imager to control scene brightness. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. B (Hansen patent) col.2 1.44-48, col.4 1.26-28. Defendant contends that the term \u201cscene contrast\u201d would not be understood to refer, as plaintiff asserts, to \u201cthe relative difference between the lightest and darkest portions\u201d of the images created by the image intensifier and the thermal imager, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 15 (citing <em>id. </em>Ex. C. (Gillespie Aff.) \u00b6 50<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>), but rather to the color contrast between the green image created by the image intensifier and the red image created by the thermal imager, Def.\u2019s Reply 17; <em>see also </em>Oral Argument of Mr. Hudalla at 11:12:07-10 (\u201cThe scene contrast here is color contrast.\u201d). The user would adjust this type of color contrast by adjusting the relative brightness of the red and green images to create more or less of the final image. <em>See </em>Oral Argument of Mr. Hudalla 11:13:32-38 (\u201cThe contrast comes from color contrast. You can turn the red up; you can turn the green up.\u201d). As defendant correctly notes, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Reply 17, plaintiff agrees that \u201cscene contrast\u201d could refer to color contrast, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 16 (stating that \u2018\u201cscene contrast\u2019 could include \u2018color contrast\u2019 under certain circumstances\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. Ex. C (Gillespie Aff.) \u00b6 52 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Defendant insists that the term \u201cscene contrast\u201d would be understood to refer to this type of color contrast resulting from relative brightness because plaintiffs interpretation of the Hansen patent would require switch 34 \u201cto do the impossible\u2014namely, to control the contrast of an image intensifier.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 15. Defendant accurately observes, and plaintiffs expert witness agrees, that the contrast of an image intensifier cannot be adjusted. <em>Id. </em>(citing, inter alia, <em>id. </em>Ex. J (Gillespie Dep.) 30:19-31:18 (\u201c[Was there a way to] adjust the contrast of the output of an image intensifier ...? No, not that I know of.\u201d)). On the other hand, the record evidence establishes that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have known that it is possible to adjust the brightness of both an image intensifier and a thermal imager by controlling the power to them. <em>See id. </em>Ex. K (2d Waxman Aff.) \u00b6\u00b6 4-8 (present ing evidence that power control to adjust the brightness of image intensifiers and thermal imagers was known in the art); <em>cf. </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 19 (\u201c[C]ertain advanced [image intensification] tubes had and have the ability to manually adjust the gain or power delivered to the tube to vary the intensity of the image that is output to the user.\u201d)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; Pl.\u2019s Resp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Ex. C (Gillespie Aff.) \u00b6 57 (same). Defendant adds that plaintiffs view of the Hansen patent requires both switch 34 and switch 36 to control the power to both imaging assemblies, a redundancy that defendant argues \u201cwould be equivalent to having two volume controls on your radio in your car.\u201d Oral Argument of Mr. Hudalla at 11:17:35-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In response, plaintiff quotes testimony from its fact witness, Mr. Dumais\u2014whom plaintiff describes as \u201cthe Navy WARCOM and SOCOM Joint Night Vision Working Group leader in charge of night vision at the critical time period\u201d\u2014stating that the Army did not \u201cactually invent[ ] the subject matter\u201d of the \u2019652 patent. Pl.\u2019s Resp. 4. Mr. Dumais further testified that the CANVS device \u201cgave us capability to do things that I knew we were not capable [of] before.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1; <em>id. </em>Ex. D (Dumais Dep.) 140:9-11. The implication of this testimony is that if the Hansen device\u2014which was invented by an Army employee, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. B (Hansen patent) [75] (stating that Mr. Hansen was stationed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia)\u2014had featured independent brightness adjustment, Mr. Dumais would have been aware of it. However, as defendant rightly points out, \u201cMi*. Dumais was on active duty with the Navy at the time of [the] Hansen [device\u2019s patenting], so it is unsurprising that Mr. Dumais was not aware of all\u2014or even any\u2014 of the night vision development activities occurring within the Army.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 4 (citing Pl.\u2019s Resp. Ex. D (Dumais Dep.) 21:22-22:2).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Plaintiff then makes a number of arguments\u2014based on the testimony of its expert witness, Mr. Gillespie\u2014about how the Hansen patent would be interpreted by a person of ordinaiy skill in the art. Certain of the arguments plaintiff puts forward are not supported by the record evidence. Others contradict plaintiff\u2019s prior positions\u2014without explanation\u2014or focus on issues that are irrelevant to an anticipation analysis on summary judgment. The court has closely studied these arguments but concludes that they would fail to persuade a reasonable faetfinder that an independent adjustment feature is inherently present in the Hansen patent. The court sets forth a few illustrative examples of plaintiffs arguments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Plaintiff first contends that the Hansen patent could not have referred to red-green color contrast because, \u201cat the time the Hansen invention was made, night vision goggles did not have color displays\u201d and instead \u201cprovided a monochrome image to the user.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 16 (citing, inter alia, <em>id. </em>Ex. C (Gillespie Aff.) \u00b6 52). But, the court understands this argument to reflect a misstatement by Mr. Gillespie in his affidavit, which was subsequently addressed in his deposition. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply Ex. J (Gillespie Dep.) 177:3-179:15 (acknowledging that he had \u201cused the wrong terminology\u201d in the referenced paragraph of his affidavit, that night vision devices had \u201ccolored display but not color display\u201d and that the Hansen device would have combined a red and a green image).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Plaintiff also asserted in its briefing that defendant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Waxman, incorrectly interpreted the transmissive properties of the beam splitters described in the Hansen patent. Pl.\u2019s Resp. 17-18; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Sur-Reply 1-2, 4-7. At oral argument, plaintiff explained that it had offered this argument, \u201cnot because [it] somehow makes [the Hansen patent] a nonantieipatory reference,\u201d but to rehabilitate the credibility of its witnesses, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Dumais. See Oral Argument of Mr. Zito at 11:50:03\u2014 51:39. The court declines plaintiffs invitation to consider this argument because credibility determinations cannot be made in the context of a summary judgment motion. <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Plaintiff further argued in briefing that the Hansen patent did not anticipate the \u2019652 patent because \u201cthe Hansen patent [w]as just another example of overlay technology or \u2018poor man\u2019s fusion.\u2019 \u201d PL\u2019s Resp. 4 (quoting <em>id. </em>Ex. D (Dumais Dep.) 58:19); <em>see also id. </em>at 5-6 (stating that \u201cthe CANVS device was the first time that true optical fusion had been accomplished\u201d). As clarified during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>oral argument, plaintiffs argument appears to turn on its view of a qualitative distinction between the fusion achieved in the Hansen device and that accomplished by the \u2019652 patent. <em>See, e.g., </em>Oral Argument of Mr. Zito at 10:46:57-47:12 (\u201cOverlay is fusion; fusion is overlay. If you just do overlay, it\u2019s poor man\u2019s fusion. If you improve the overlay ..., then it becomes good fusion or true fusion.... \u201d). However, plaintiff identifies no record evidence that described precisely what this distinction is or why it is significant in this anticipation analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Although plaintiff agreed in its briefing that the terms \u201cbrightness,\u201d as used in the Hansen patent, and \u201cintensity,\u201d as used in the \u2019652 patent, are synonymous, <em>see, e.g., </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 15 (stating that \u201ca person of ordinary skill in the art would understand ... [the term] \u2018light intensity\u2019 \u201d used in the Hansen patent to mean \u201c \u2018scene brightness\u2019 \u201d), plaintiff contradicted its earlier offered view at oral argument. There, plaintiff appeared to contend that the Hansen patent\u2019s adjustment of brightness does not anticipate the \u2019652 patent\u2019s adjustment of intensity. Instead, plaintiff posited that \u201cbrightness ... refers to one way of changing the intensity,\u201d whereas intensity refers to the \u201cquant[um] of information\u201d transmitted to the viewer. Oral Argument of Mr. Zito at 10:43:10-29. When asked whether supportive evidence for this proposition could be found in the record, plaintiff responded, \u201cNo, other than how the term is used in [the \u2019652] patent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10:47:18-48:10. In accordance with the Federal Circuit\u2019s guidance, however, the Hansen patent need not use precisely the same phrasing as the \u2019652 patent to anticipate its claims. <em>Cf. In re Bond, </em>910 F.2d 831, 832 (Fed.Cir.1990) (stating that anticipation \u201cis not an \u2018ipsissimis verbis\u2019 test\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Among the many alternative arguments it put forward, plaintiff contends, \u201c[T]here is no evidence of the Hansen invention. No prototypes, no records, no proposals, nothing.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 4. But as defendant correctly observes, \u201c\u2018[a]nticipation does not require the actual creation or reduction to practice of the prior art subject matter; anticipation requires only an enabling disclosure.\u2019 \u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 21 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., </em>339 F.3d 1373, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Plaintiff suggests that the Hansen patent was insufficiently detailed to be such an enabling disclosure, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 14 (stating that the Hansen patent provides \u201cno idea, explanation or suggestion to how to achieve\u201d adjustment of scene brightness or scene contrast), but the Hansen patent is no less detailed than the \u2019652 patent. Missing from the \u2019652 patent is a description of how image brightness is to be adjusted, and as defendant accurately states in its briefing, the same presumption of enablement that applies to the \u2019652 patent applies to prior art references. Def.\u2019s Reply 21 (citing <em>Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., </em>314 F.3d 1313, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">A feature asserted to be inherent in a prior art reference must be shown to be \u201cnecessarily present, not merely probably or possibly present.\u201d <em>Trintec Indus., Inc. v. Top-U.S.A. Corp., </em>295 F.3d 1292, 1295 (Fed.Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, defendant\u2019s burden is to demonstrate that independent brightness adjustment is necessarily present in Hansen with \u201csuch clear and convincing evidence of invalidity ... that no reasonable [factfinder] could find otherwise.\u201d <em>Cf. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>251 F.3d at 962. The court is not persuaded on this record that defendant has met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Defendant effectively alleges that a person of ordinary skill in the art would know that this control configuration does not operate as described because controlling contrast through an image intensifier is not possible and because using two switches to control the power for both imaging devices is unnecessarily redundant. Defendant posits that one switch should be understood to control the brightness of each imaging assembly, which allows the color contrast of the scene to be adjusted. But the record evidence before the court does not compel a reasonable fact-finder to reach this conclusion. In addition, although defendant\u2019s interpretation of the language of the Hansen patent might offer a more functional device, it does not comport with the patent\u2019s seemingly plain language that one switch controls contrast and the other controls brightness. Accordingly, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>reasonable factfinder could conclude that defendant has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that independent brightness adjustment is necessarily present in the Hansen patent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>251 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Absent such clear and convincing proof from defendant, a genuine issue of material fact remains regarding whether the claims that describe independent brightness adjustment (these are, claims four, five and seven) are anticipated by the Hansen patent. <em>Cf. id. </em>Defendant, however, has succeeded in showing\u2014and plaintiff has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact rebutting such showing\u2014that the other claims (specifically, claims one through three and claim six) are anticipated by the Hansen patent. Plaintiffs arguments with respect to grouping and independent brightness adjustment do not persuade, <em>see supra </em>Part III.A.1 (discussing grouping), III.A.2 (discussing independent brightness adjustment), and plaintiff provides no basis upon which a reasonable fact-finder could conclude differently, <em>cf. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>251 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Accordingly, defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of anticipation with respect to claims one through three and claim six, but not with respect to claims four, five and seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">B. Obviousness</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Defendant argues in the alternative that claims two and three of the \u2019652 patent are rendered obvious by the combination of the Hansen patent and a second prior art reference. Def.\u2019s Mot. 23-24. However, because the court has determined that claims two and three are invalid due to anticipation by the Hansen patent, the court does not\u2014 and need not\u2014reach defendant\u2019s obviousness argument. <em>Cf. </em>3 <em>May\u2019s Walker on Patents </em>\u00a7 9:49 (4th ed.2013) (stating that, where claims are found to be anticipated, \u201cthe issue of obviousness need not be reached\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">C. The Offered Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Defendant\u2019s final argument is that the testimony of plaintiffs expert, Mr. Gillespie, \u201cis so defective as to call into question his qualification as an expert witness in this case.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 23. Defendant argues that \u201cthe Court should exercise its gatekeeping role and cast aside Mr. Gillespie\u2019s opinions\u201d pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Among the challenges defendant directs toward Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony are: (1) his erroneous assertion that it is not possible to adjust the brightness of an image intensifier; and (2) \u201cMr. Gillespie\u2019s faulty analysis of rotary power control switches 34 and 36 in [the] Hansen [device, which] not only ignore[d] the interaction of these switches with selector switch 30, but ... also [was] premised on the implementation of a contrast control for an image intensifier that he admitted was impracticable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, defendant points to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s concession in his deposition that he is \u201c\u2018not a beam splitter expert.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>id. </em>Ex. J (Gillespie Dep.) 169:4). Defendant argues that \u201cbecause Mr. Gillespie\u2019s faulty opinions undergird all of plaintiffs arguments, the Court should find that plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, \u201cthe trial judge must ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786. After reviewing carefully the asserted flaws in Mr. Gillespie\u2019s offered expert testimony, the court declines to grant defendant\u2019s request to exclude Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony. Mr. Gillespie did title a section of his affidavit \u201cNo gain or intensity control of an [image intensifier] tube in 1990,\u201d and he made averments consistent with that proposition. Pl.\u2019s Resp. Ex. C (Gillespie Aff.) 19 (emphasis and some capitalization omitted). Moreover, when Mr. Gillespie was asked in his deposition to confirm that, \u201cthere is no way to change the brightness of the green screen that a user sees on an [image intensifier] tube,\u201d he responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply Ex. J (Gillespie Dep. 64:18-21). But Mr. Gillespie did also acknowledge in his affidavit that \u201ccertain advanced [image intensifier] tubes had and have the ability to manually adjust the gain or power delivered to the tube to vary the intensity of the image that is output to the user,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. Ex. C (Gillespie Aff.) \u00b6 57. The court is persuaded that a reasonable factfinder could agree with Mr. Gillespie\u2019s proposed interpretation of switches 34 and 36, <em>see supra </em>Part III.A.2, and to the extent defendant is convinced that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony is erroneous on the subject of independent brightness adjustment capacity, the court urges defendant to address such concerns by further motion or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s urging, the court does not exclude Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony on the topic of beam splitters based on his concession that he is \u201cnot a beam splitter expert.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Reply Ex. J (Gillespie Dep.) 169:4. Mr. Gillespie admitted that he \u201crelied on ... the optics guys to do that when we did it at the lab\u201d and forthrightly stated that he was \u201csurmising\u201d about the operation of the beam splitters. <em>Id. </em>at 169:4-8. Expertise in beam splitting appears to be a subspecialty of the optics specialists working with night vision technology. Having reviewed Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony with respect to beam splitters, the court does not find Mr. Gillespie\u2019s-testimony on beam splitters to be so uninformed or otherwise unreliable that it must be excluded. Moreover, because the court is mindful of the cost to the parties associated with the hiring of multiple specialists in the various fields associated with night vision, <em>see </em>RCFC 1 (directing the court to pursue the \u201cjust, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding\u201d), and because both parties appear to consider the beam splitter discussion irrelevant to whether the Hansen patent is an anticipatory reference, <em>see </em>Oral Argument of Mr. Zito at 11:50:03-51:39 (stating that plaintiff presented evidence -with respect to beam splitters, \u201cnot because that somehow makes [the Hansen patent] a nonanticipatory reference,\u201d but to rehabilitate the credibility of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Dumais); Oral Argument of Mr. Hudalla at 11:28:09-29:43 (stating that plaintiffs arguments about beam splitters are irrelevant to an anticipation analysis), the court denies defendant\u2019s request. Should the functioning of beam splitters emerge, however, as an important issue in this case, defendant may renew its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Plaintiff also asserted a challenge to the admission of defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony. Plaintiff argued that \u201cif any testimony should be \u2018cast aside\u2019 based upon a suggestion, it should be the testimony of Dr. Waxman,\u201d who \u201cblatantly misquoted the Hansen reference.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Sur-Reply 1 n.l (citing Pl.\u2019s Resp. 12-13). It is plaintiffs view that Dr. Waxman engaged in an exercise of \u201cintentional misleading\u201d by \u201crefer[ing] to sentences he ... made up as direct quotes ... from [the] Hansen [patent].\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 12-13. Plaintiff contends that Dr. Waxman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cselectively removed words\u201d to alter the sentence describing switches 34 and 36 of the Hansen patent so it would appear to teach independent brightness adjustment of the image intensif\u00eder and the thermal imager. <em>Id. </em>at 12; <em>see also supra </em>Part III.A.2.a (discussing the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this sentence). But, it is apparent to the court from Dr. Waxman\u2019s affidavit that he rephrased the sentence of interest\u2014as did plaintiffs expert<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2014merely to clarify what he believed it to mean, not to mislead the court. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. Ex. E (Waxman Aff.) \u00b6 9 (explaining the referenced sentence). Thus, plaintiffs argument does not persuade. The court denies plaintiffs request to strike Dr. Waxman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As explained in much greater detail in this Opinion, defendant\u2019s Motion is GRANTED with respect to the anticipation of claims one through three and claim six of the \u2019652 patent. The court finds that each limitation of these claims is found in the Hansen patent. Defendant\u2019s Motion is DENIED, however, with respect to the anticipation of the claims of the \u2019652 patent that describe independent adjustment of the brightness of the image intensif\u00eder and thermal imager\u2014that is, claims four, five and seven\u2014because a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the Hansen patent does not teach this feature. Because it is unnecessary to reach the issue of obviousness, defendant\u2019s Motion is DENIED with respect to the obviousness of claims two and three as MOOT. Defendant\u2019s motion is also DENIED insofar as defendant requests the striking of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony because the court does not find Mr. Gillespie\u2019s testimony so unreliable as to compel such action. In addition, the court finds unpersuasive plaintiffs request to strike the testimony of Dr. Waxman as misleading and DENIES same.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">A separate order will issue shortly, after the issuance of this Opinion, to address plaintiffs stayed motion to amend its claim chart to include additional devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-11\">.
