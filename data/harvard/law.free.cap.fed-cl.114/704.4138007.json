Defendant\u2019s motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for a decision by the court. Oral argument was neither requested by the parties nor required by the court. For the reasons set forth below, the court grants defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">A. Lawrence Magdovitz and Ensley Station</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">During the time period relevant to this litigation, Lawrence Magdovitz, an attorney, realtor, and residential contractor in Clarksdale, Mississippi, owned and/or controlled several corporations which together own hundreds of properties that are leased to the United States Postal Service (the Postal Service), including the property which is the subject of this litigation. A117-18, 122, 127-28, 130-36.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That property, which is located at 700 18th Street in Birmingham, Alabama, and which the parties refer to as \u201cEnsley Station,\u201d has been leased to the Postal Service since 1965 for use as a post office. Compl. \u00b6 2; <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 2; PL\u2019s Resp. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-20\">In February 2000, Kerin Motors, Inc. (Kerin Motors), which until December 2012 was owned either in whole or in part by Mr. Magdovitz, purchased Ensley Station. A122-23, 127-28. That conveyance included a lease with the Postal Service dated March 15, 1965.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A7-18 (lease agreement with amendments).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-22\">Mr. Magdovitz incorporated Ensley, Inc. (Ensley), the plaintiff in the instant case, in 2005. A137. Mr. Magdovitz is the president of Ensley. A136. The sole shareholders of Ensley are Lawrence M. Magdovitz, III and Noah Connor Magdovitz\u2014Mr. Magdovitz\u2019s grandsons. A133. On July 17, 2005, Kerin Motors conveyed Ensley Station, and assigned the lease, to Ensley. A137,159.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-23\">B. The Lease</p>\n<p id=\"b718-24\">The lease contains two provisions which set forth the lessor\u2019s obligation to maintain the premises as well as the tenant\u2019s rights in the event that the lessor fails to fulfill that obligation. Specifically, paragraph 7 of the lease states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Lessor shall ... maintain the demised premises, including the building and any and all equipment, fixtures, and appurtenances, whether severable or non-severable, ... in good repair and tenantable condition, except in case of damage arising from the act or the negligence of the Government\u2019s agents or employees.\u201d A8. Additionally, paragraph 10(c) of the lease provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">If any building or any part of it on the leased property becomes unfit for use for the purposes leased, the lessor shall put the same in a satisfactory condition, as determined by the Post Office Department, for the purposes leased. If the lessor does not do so with reasonable diligence, the Post Office Department in its discretion may cancel the lease. For any period said building or any part thereof is unfit for the purposes leased, the rent shall be abated in proportion to the area determined by the Post Office Department to have been rendered unavailable to the Post Office Department by reason of such condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The lease also contains a \u201cTax Clause Rider\u201d (the Tax Clause), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">The lessor shall present to the Government the general real estate bills of each taxing authority for taxes due and payable on the land and buildings hereby demised when said taxes apply to any year or part thereof within the term of this lease____ After the presentation of said tax bills, the Government shall pay to the lessor, as additional rent due hereunder, the net amount of said taxes by check made payable to the lessor and the taxing authority issuing said tax bill. The lessor shall thereafter promptly indorse said cheek and turn the same over to the said taxing authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">A16.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">C. The Leaky Roof at Ensley Station</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">In the fall of 2002, shortly after Kerin Motors had purchased Ensley Station and assumed the lease with the Postal Service, the roof at Ensley Station experienced leaks. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (PSUMF) \u00b6 8. On October 7, 2002, Kenneth Means, the manager of Ensley Station, notified Mr. Magdovitz in writing that Ensley Station \u201cHAS LEAKS ON THE ROOF IN ... TWO DIFFERENT PLACES\u201d and emphasized that \u201cIMMEDIATE ATTENTION IS NEEDED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\u201d A29. In response, Mr. Magdovitz sent Joe Spencer, a plumber by trade who also performed various odd jobs for Mi\u2019. Magdovitz, to repair the roof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A141-42,146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">Despite Mr. Spencer\u2019s efforts, the roof continued to leak. On March 21, 2003, Mr. Means again notified Mr. Magdovitz that \u201cEnsley [Sjtation has roof leaks that need to be looked at.\u201d A30. In response, Mr. Magdovitz sent Mr. Spencer to Ensley Station to repair the roof a second time. A31; Pl.\u2019s Resp. Ex. 3 (Magdovitz Dep. pt. 1) at 77-79.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This second effort was similarly unfruitful, however. On April 23, 2003, Mr. Means wrote to Mr. Magdovitz yet again to notify him that \u201cTHE BUILDING STILL HAS LEAKS ON THE ROOF IN ... TWO DIFFERENT PLACES.\u201d A32. Mr. Means added that Mr. Spencer\u2019s \u201cLAST VISIT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM,\u201d and that \u201cWE HAVE LEAKS IN THE SAFE ROOM AND [IN THE] WOMEN[\u2019]S BATHROOM.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">The roof continued to leak in 2004 and 2005. <em>See </em>A38-52. On September 1, 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the Postal Service sent a letter to Mr. Magdovitz to \u201cfollow up [on] sevei\u2019al calls ... [in] the past several months ... regarding ... need[ed] repairs at the Birmingham Ensley Station post office facility.\u201d A38. Among the \u201cneed[ed] repairs\u201d listed in the letter were \u201c[r]epair roof leaks\u201d and \u201c[r]eplace ceiling tiles stained from roof leaks.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>PSUMF \u00b6 11. The letter concluded by stating that \u201c[s]hould [Kerin Motors] not take action to make the required repairs by September 24, [2004,] the Postal Service will solicit proposals and award a contract to have the work completed by a third party\u201d and would seek to recover the costs of such repairs \u201cfrom rents due ... under the terms and conditions of the lease.\u201d A38. On January 13, 2005, the Postal Service sent yet another letter to Mr. Magdovitz concerning \u201coutstanding deferred maintenance items\u201d at various post office locations, including Ensley Station. A39-40. Regarding the leaky roof at Ensley Station, the letter stated that an \u201cattempt [had been] made to repair leaks\u201d on October 11, 2004, but that leaks were \u201cSTILL IN <em>EVIDENCE\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cRAIN IS STILL COMING IN,\u201d \u201cCEILING TILES ARE FALLING,\u201d and \u201cFUNGUS [IS] NOTED IN SOME AREAS.\u201d A40.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In response to the Postal Service\u2019s persistent complaints, Mr. Magdovitz sent William Willis, the superintendent of operations for the Yazoo, Mississippi Delta Levee Board who also performed various weekend projects for Mr. Magdovitz, to repair the roof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A49-52; Pl.\u2019s Resp. Ex. 4 (Magdovitz Dep. pt. 2) at 107-08, 114-16. Mr. Willis visited Ensley Station twice to conduct repairs. A187-88; PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. During his initial visit in or about March 2005, Mr. Willis spent approximately two hours replacing water-damaged ceiling tiles inside the building, applying concrete silicone to cracks around vents on the roof and to cracks in the building\u2019s external walls near the roof, and applying plastic cement to cracks along the flashing of an overhang on the front of the building. A169-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Despite the repairs performed by Mr. Willis, the roof at Ensley Station continued to leak. <em>See </em>A42-48. In an effort to stop the leaks, the Postal Service\u2019s maintenance personnel placed a plastic tarp over approximately one-third of the roof and secured it with 3/8 inch staples. Compl. \u00b6 11; A56. Later in March 2005, Mr. Magdovitz sent Mr. Willis a second time to Ensley Station to perform additional repairs to the roof. A152, 179-84. During that visit, Mr. Willis discovered the tarp on the roof, removed it, and applied a layer of aluminum roof coating called \u201csilver coat\u201d over the surface of the roof. A182-84, 187-88; PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17-18. Mr. Willis did not inspect the subsurface of the roof before applying the coating, nor did he verify whether the staples had actually punctured the subsurface. A181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The roof at Ensley Station continued to leak through the end of March 2005 and into April 2005. A47-48, 74. On April 4, 2005, Bryan Pease, the Real Estate Manager for the Postal Service\u2019s Southeast Facilities Service Office, sent a letter to \u201cLarry\u201d Magdovitz\u2014Mr. Magdovitz\u2019s son and attorney\u2014 stating that Ensley Station \u201chas the attention of the District Manager\u201d because workers at the station were \u201ccomplaining about having to work in wet conditions every time it rains.\u201d A56-57. Mr. Pease also stated that the Postal Service was \u201chaving a roofing consultant examine the roof and provide us with an existing conditions survey and recommendation for repair/replaeement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">D. The House Report</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">On April 18, 2005, Charles House, an expert in commercial and residential roofing systems and a registered roof observer for Thompson Engineering Inc., inspected Ensley Station\u2019s roof and conducted a moisture survey. A58, 61-64, 66. In his written report of the inspection, Mr. House noted that the roof consisted of \u201cmultiple layers of a granulated modified bitumen surface material,\u201d most likely a material called \u201cRuberoid.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>A59; <em>see also </em>A66. Mr. House also stated that, during his inspection, he conducted a moisture survey of the roof using a \u201cTramex Leak Seeker non-destructive moisture detection system.\u201d A67. Mr. House explained that \u201c[t]he Leak Seeker is a solid state electronic capacitance meter especially designed to locate topped moisture in a roof system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Mr. House, the moisture survey revealed \u201cextremely high\u201d levels of moisture \u201cunder the roof membrane in all locations throughout the entire roof area with heavy concentrations at the perimeter and locations around the metal flashing collar\u2019s.\u201d A66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In addition, Mr. House observed that the \u201cside laps\u201d and \u201cend laps\u201d of the granulated modified bitumen surface material had been taped over and/or adhered to the roof membrane using roof cement. A67, 69, 72. This condition, Mr. House concluded, is indicative of \u201c[p]oor sealing\u201d of the surface material as well as \u201cpast roof leaks.\u201d A67; <em>see also </em>A69 (\u201cTaping of the side laps would indicate separation of the laps in the past.\u201d), 72 (\u201cThe end laps of the modified cap sheet are also being sealed with roof cement prior to the application of the new top coating. This form of cement application is indicative of past roof leak problems.\u201d). Mr. House also noted that only seventy percent of the surface material was \u201cturned down over the existing perimeter metal drip edge and nailed,\u201d while the remaining thirty percent \u201cterminated at the edge of the [perimeter] metal and turned slightly upward.\u201d A67; <em>see also </em>A73. Mr. House opined that this condition resulted in \u201cwater accumulating] on the roof surface ... [and] run[ning] over the raised edge of the modified sheet and into the roof system underneath.\u201d A67; <em>see also </em>A70 (\u201cIn areas where the cap sheet was not turned down over the drip edge water was running back under the cap into the roof.\u201d), 73 (\u201cWhen water builds up on the roof surface it runs over the outside edge of the cap and back under the open edge at the [perimeter] metal. This condition allows a large amount of water into the roof system.\u201d). Additionally, Mr. House observed that the \u201cmetal flashing collars installed to seal the penetration of the plumbing metal vents\u201d on the roof \u201cwere not sealed properly and were allowing water into the roof system.\u201d A67; <em>see also </em>A71. Finally, Mr. House noted that \u201c[t]he metal drip edge has been moving at the end lap joints due to poor nailing,\u201d a condition which, in Mr. House\u2019s opinion, \u201ceausefd] the membrane stripping to split and allow[ed] water to enter the [roof] system at the perimeter.\u201d A67; <em>see also </em>A72.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Based upon the results of the moisture survey and his observations regarding the condition of the roof system, Mr. House concluded that \u201cmoisture has been entering the roof system and building for some time\u201d and that \u201c[t]he concentration of moisture is so large [that] a process of deterioration has begun that cannot be stopped.\u201d A67-68. Mr. House therefore recommended that \u201c[t]he only solution to this problem would be [the] complete removal of the roof membrane, roof insulation, and perimeter metal____ [d]own to the roof deck\u201d as well as replacement of the entire roof system. A68.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">E. The Postal Service Replaces the Roof and Offsets the Cost of Replacement against Rents Owed under the Lease</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">On April 27, 2005, Mr. Pease sent Mr. House\u2019s report to Mr. Magdovitz by facsimile along with a cover sheet stating that the \u201cREPORT RECOMMENDS REPLACEMENT AS THE ONLY MEANS OF MAKING THE ROOF WATER TIGHT.\u201d A74. Mr. Pease requested that Mr. Magdovitz \u201cADVISE [THE POSTAL SERVICE] OF PLANNED ACTION AND SCHEDULE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Magdovitz responded on May 11, 2005, asserting that \u201c[t]he roof at Ensley [Station] is not leaking\u201d and \u201c[i]f water is trapped under the roofing, it was caused by the thousands of staples penetrating the roof caused by [Postal Service] employees.\u201d A83.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">On May 20, 2005, Mr. Pease sent another letter to Mr. Magdovitz stating that the Postal Service would \u201cproceed to have the roof replaced as soon as practicable\u201d and would seek reimbursement of the cost of replacing the roof or, in the alternative, would \u201crecapture [the cost] through rent reductions.\u201d A84; <em>see </em>PSUMF \u00b6 19. On August 10, 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Mr. Pease sent yet another letter to Mr. Magdovitz stating that \u201cthe leaks are still in evidence\u201d and reiterating that the Postal Service would complete the necessary repairs and seek to recover the cost of such repairs \u201cfrom rents due you under the terms and conditions of the Lease.\u201d A86.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Shortly thei\u2019eafter, the Postal Service entered into a contract for the replacement of the roof, which was completed on October 6, 2005 at a cost of $55,296.14. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; A90-106; PSUMF \u00b620. On December 13, 2005, Mr. Pease provided Mr. Magdovitz with copies of invoices for the roof replacement and informed him that if the Postal Service did not receive reimbursement by January 6, 2006, \u201cthe full cost of the roof replacement under this lease may be recouped through rental deduction.\u201d A105; <em>see </em>PSUMF \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Postal Service never received reimbursement of the cost of replacing the roof. A109. Accordingly, on October 15, 2010, contracting officer Jean Scholl Berg issued a \u201cfinal decision\u201d authorizing the withholding of rent payments under the lease as a setoff. A108-11; <em>see </em>PSUMF \u00b6 21. Ms. Berg\u2019s decision stated that, unless payment was made in the full amount of $55,296.14 by January 1, 2012, the Postal Service would begin to make monthly rent deductions beginning on that date and ending in March 2015, for a total deduction of $12,982.02. A110. The decision further stated that this would \u201cleave[] a balance of $42,314.12[,] which will be deducted from any other payments due under the lease or, if necessary, collected through legal action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On November 12, 2010, Ms. Berg sent another letter to Mr. Magdovitz acknowledging Ensley\u2019s request for payment of $3,410.77 in property taxes pursuant to the Tax Clause contained in the lease. Al 12-13; <em>see </em>PSUMF \u00b6 23. This letter stated that the Postal Service \u201cwill not pay the additional rent otherwise provided for in the Tax Clause,\u201d but would instead offset the tax payments requested by plaintiff against the cost of replacing the roof. Al 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Ensley filed a three-count complaint in this court on October 14, 2011. In Count I, plaintiff alleges that the government breached the lease by \u201cimproperly attempting to reimburse itself $55,296.14 for repairs to the roof\u2019 at Ensley Station. Compl. \u00b623. Plaintiff asserts that it \u201caddressed the roof leak issues\u201d and that the Postal Service \u201creplaced the roof unnecessarily.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 24. Ensley also asserts, in the alternative, that any \u201ccontinued leaks after the Plaintiffs repairs were the result of the \u2018acts or negligence\u2019 of the Defendant\u2019s agents or employees by making thousands of staple punctures to the roof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 25; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 15. With respect to Count I, plaintiff asks the court to \u201cfind that the Defendant breached the Lease Agreement by improperly charging and withholding from the rents the amount of $55,296.14\u201d and to \u201corder the Defendant to refund all funds withheld by the Defendant ... [and] cease any future withholding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">In Count II, plaintiff alleges that the government breached the lease by refusing to pay property taxes it allegedly owed pursuant to the Tax Clause. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-34. With respect to this count, Ensley \u201crequests ... that the Defendant be ordered to forward a cheek for the amount of the taxes, including any penalties, interest or other charges required to be paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In Count III, plaintiff alleges that the government \u201chas taken a substantially unjustifiable position in this matter ... based on the fact that the Lease Agreement clearly states [that] the Defendant must provide payment of the real property taxes upon being presented with the tax bill for the Property.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 36. Ensley asserts that \u201c[t]he Defendant\u2019s actions were contrary to the facts presented to them in written correspondence from the Plaintiff and [in] the Lease Agreement and were done in bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 37. Plaintiff therefore requests \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees in an amount to be shown in an [Equal Access to Justice Act] application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on August 29, 2013. In its motion, defendant argues that there is no genuine issue of fact regarding plaintiffs failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>remedy the ongoing leaks in the Ensley Station roof, and that plaintiff can produce no evidence demonstrating that such leaks were attributable to the Postal Service\u2019s act of stapling a plastic tarp to the roof. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 12-16; Def.\u2019s Reply at 9-12. Defendant therefore contends that plaintiff is responsible for the cost of replacing the roof under paragraphs 7 and 10(c) of the lease. In addition, defendant argues that the Postal Service is entitled to offset the cost of replacing the roof against rent due under the lease, including by withholding tax payments otherwise owed pursuant to the Tax Clause. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 11-12, 16-18; Def.\u2019s Reply at 3-9, 12-14. Plaintiff filed its response on October 28, 2013, and defendant filed its reply on November 26, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">I. Standard of Review for RCFC 56 Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The availability of summary judgment helps a federal court \u201c\u2018to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u2019\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 327, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 1). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. RCFC 56(a); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A fact is material if it would affect the outcome of the suit. <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A dispute of material fact is genuine if a reasonable trier of fact could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>Matsushita Electric Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted) (stating that there is no genuine issue \u201c[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is an absence of any genuine issue of material fact, and the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party. <em>Dairyland Power Coop. v.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">A. Whether Ongoing Leaks at Ensley Station Were Attributable to Plaintiff or the Postal Service</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The government argues that there is no genuine issue of fact regarding plaintiffs failure to repair ongoing leaks in the Ensley Station roof, and that plaintiff can produce no evidence demonstrating that the leaks were attributable to the Postal Service\u2019s act of stapling a plastic tarp to the roof. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 12-16; Def.\u2019s Reply at 4-6, 9-12. Defendant therefore contends that the Postal Service \u201creasonably concluded that Ensley had breached the lessor\u2019s obligations in paragraphs 7 and 10(c) of the lease by failing to keep the roof in good repair and tenable condition and by failing to put the roof \u2018in a satisfactory condition.\u2019\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply at 4 (quoting lease paragraph 10(c) at A8); <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16 (\u201cEnsley cannot establish that the Government was responsible for the leaks or that the Postal Service\u2019s decision to replace the roof was unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Plaintiff responds that it \u201cfulfilled its maintenance obligation to the Defendant when it repaired the roof on the leased property, but the Defendant\u2019s contractors put staple holes in the roof afterwards causing subsequent roof leaks.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 1. Plaintiff therefore contends that \u201c[tjhere is a genuine issue of material fact as to the cause of the leaks at Ensley [Station].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 9 (\u201c[T]here exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Defendant contributed to the roof leaks by stapling plastic to the roof at Ensley thus causing new leaks.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">After careful consideration of the evidence and arguments presented by the parties, the court agrees with defendant that there is no genuine dispute of fact regarding plaintiffs failure to remedy the ongoing leaks in the Ensley Station roof. As a preliminary matter, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that leaks persisted from 2002 through 2005 despite the Postal Service\u2019s repeated complaints and Mr. Spencer\u2019s and Mr. Willis\u2019s numerous repair attempts. The Postal Service first notified Mr. Magdovitz of the leaks in October 2002. A29; PSUMF \u00b6 8. Although Mr. Magdovitz sent Mr. Spencer to make repairs to the roof shortly thereafter, the leaks reappeared in March 2003. A30, 141-42, 146-47. The Postal Service again complained of leaks in April 2003, even after Mr. Magdovitz sent Mr. Spencer a second time to repair the roof. A31-32; Pl.\u2019s Resp. App. 3 (Magdovitz Dep. pt. 1) at 77-79. Complaints of roof leaks continued in 2004 and 2005, even after Mr. Magdovitz dispatched Mr. Willis twice to conduct repairs. A38-57, 74; PSUMF \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Plaintiff concedes that \u201cthere were leaks\u201d in the Ensley Station roof but nevertheless asserts that such leaks were \u201crepaired\u201d by Mr. Spencer and Mr. Willis, thereby fulfilling plaintiffs obligations under paragraphs 7 and 10(c) of the lease. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 1 (\u201c[T]he Plaintiff fulfilled its maintenance obligation to the Defendant when it repaired the roof on the leased property____\u201d). However, Ensley offers no evidence to support this claim, or to rebut the evidence demonstrating that the Ensley Station roof continued to leak despite Mr. Spencer\u2019s and Mr. Willis\u2019s efforts. As noted <em>supra, </em>mere denials, conclusory statements, or evidence that is merely colorable or not significantly probative are not sufficient to preclude summary judgment. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248-50, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348; <em>Barmag, </em>731 F.2d at 835-36. Under this binding authority, plaintiffs bald and unsupported assertion is plainly insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding plaintiffs failure to remedy the ongoing leaks at Ensley Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Furthermore, the court agrees with the government that plaintiff has not demonstrated a genuine issue of fact as to the cause of the leaks. As noted above, the moisture survey conducted by Mr. House on April 18, 2005 revealed \u201cextremely high\u201d levels of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>moisture \u201cunder the roof membrane in all locations throughout the entire roof area.\u201d A66-67. Such high moisture levels, Mr. House concluded, signaled that water had been \u201centering the roof system and building <em>for some time.\u201d </em>A67 (emphasis added). Additionally, Mr. House observed particularly high levels of moisture \u201cat the perimeter [of the roof] and [in] locations around the metal flashing collars.\u201d A66. This condition, Mr. House concluded, resulted from improper sealing of metal drip edges and flashing collars, as well as improper installation and sealing of the granulated modified bitumen surface material overlaying the roof. A67, 69-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Ensley offers nothing to challenge Mr. House\u2019s credentials as an expert, and proffers no rebuttal to Mr. House\u2019s findings and conclusions other than to assert that they are \u201cdirectly contrary\u201d to the testimony provided by Mr. Willis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 9. Plaintiff relies specifically upon the portion of Mr. Willis\u2019s deposition testimony in which he stated that the surface material installed on the Ensley Station roof \u201cis about a sixteenth of .an inch thick\u201d and \u201cwo[uldn\u2019t] take a big staple to go through it,\u201d as well as his testimony that the roof \u201ccan\u2019t do nothing but leak\u201d as a result of the 3/8 inch staples used by the Postal Service to secure the tarp to the roof. A181; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 9. Ensley contends that this testimony demonstrates a \u201cgenuine issue of material fact as to whether and to what extent the Defendant is responsible for the roof leaks at Ensley [Station]\u201d because \u201cl/16th of an inch of roofing material is less than 3/8th of an inch of metal staple.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Undercutting plaintiffs argument, however, are two factors. The first is Mr. Willis\u2019s lack of credentials as even a licensed roofer, let alone as an expert in roofing. The second consideration is Mr. Willis\u2019s own admission that he never inspected underneath the surface of the Ensley Station roof and therefore did not know the actual thickness of the roof or whether the staples had actually punctured the roof. <em>See </em>A176, 181-82. To preclude summary judgment, Ensley must do more than offer \u201c[m]ere denials or eonclusory statements\u201d; it \u201cmust point to an evidentiary conflict created on the record by at least a counter statement of a fact or facts set forth in detail in an affidavit by a <em>knowledgeable </em>affiant.\u201d <em>Barmag, </em>731 F.2d at 836 (emphasis added). Under this standard, Mr. Willis\u2019s purely speculative statement that the roof \u201ccan\u2019t do nothing but leak\u201d as a result of the Postal Service's act of stapling a tarp to a portion of the roof cannot establish a genuine issue of fact regarding the cause of the leaks at Ensley Station. Accordingly, the court agrees with defendant that \u201cEnsley does not meaningfully dispute the findings and conclusions made by [Mr.] House regarding the roofs condition,\u201d and therefore plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine dispute of fact as to the cause of the ongoing leaks at Ensley Station as well as its failure to remedy those leaks. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">B. Whether the Government Was Entitled to Replace the Roof and Offset the Cost of Replacement against Rents Owed Plaintiff under the Lease</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">The government next argues that the Postal Service \u201cwas well within its rights [under the lease] to offset the amount that it owes [Ensley] in rents against the cost of the roof as a setoff.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 11; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 3-4, 7-9. The court agrees, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">\u201cThe right of setoff (also called \u2018offset\u2019) allows entities that owe each other money to apply their mutual debts against each other, thereby avoiding the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A.\u201d <em>Citizens Bank of Md. v.

Munsey Trust Co. of Washington, D.C., </em>332 U.S. 234, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947) (Munsey). In <em>Munsey, </em>the government had retained percentages of progress payments owed to a contractor on six contracts. 332 U.S. 234, 237, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 91 L.Ed. 2022. The contractor defaulted on a subsequent contract, resulting in damages to the government which the government offset against the retained progress payments. <em>Id. </em>In holding that the government properly exercised its right of setoff, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he government has the same right which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Following <em>Munsey, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and its predecessor, the Court of Claims, \u201chave repeatedly recognized the government\u2019s right of set-off\u2019 as a matter of federal common law. <em>Johnson v. All-State Constr., Inc., </em>329 F.3d 848, 852 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citing cases); <em>see also Applied Cos., </em>144 F.3d at 1476. Under this precedent, the government\u2019s common law setoff rights can be defeated or constricted only by \u201cexplicit contractual, statutory, or regulatory language.\u201d <em>J.G.B., </em>497 F.3d at 1261 (citing <em>Munsey, </em>332 U.S. at 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, and <em>Applied Cos., </em>144 F.3d at 1476); <em>see also Johnson, </em>329 F.3d at 853 (citations omitted); <em>Cecile Indus., Inc. v. Cheney, </em>995 F.2d 1052, 1055 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Defendant points out that the lease contains no language expressly prohibiting the Postal Service from making repairs and deducting the cost of such repairs from rent due under the lease in the event of the lessor\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in accordance with paragraphs 7 and 10(e) of the lease. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 11 (\u201cHere, the lease contains \u2018no prohibition against set-offs.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Applied Cos., </em>144 F.3d at 1476)). Defendant therefore contends that the lease does not constrict the government\u2019s common law setoff rights. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Applied Cos., </em>144 F.3d at 1476).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Applying the aforementioned authorities concerning the government\u2019s right of setoff, the court is compelled to agree with the government on the purely legal issue of the availability of setoff as a remedy for the lessor\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in accordance with paragraphs 7 and 10(c) of the lease. Although the parties frame this issue primarily as one of contract interpretation, the court notes preliminarily that the government\u2019s setoff rights are grounded in federal <em>common law, </em>not in the terms of any contract. As noted <em>supra, </em>it is well established that the government enjoys a right of setoff that can be defeated or constricted only by \u201cexplicit contractual, statutory, or regulatory language.\u201d <em>J.G.B., </em>497 F.3d at 1261 (citations omitted). And, as previously stated, the lease at issue in this case contains no language explicitly limiting the government\u2019s setoff rights, including the government\u2019s right to make repairs and to deduct the cost of such repairs from rent due under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Plaintiff nevertheless contends that the Postal Service was not entitled to replace the roof at Ensley Station and deduct the cost of replacement from rent due under the lease because paragraph 10(c) <em>implicitly </em>bars this remedy. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 7-8. Specifically, plaintiff relies upon' a portion of paragraph 10(c) which states that \u201c[i]f any building or any part of it on the leased property becomes unfit for use for the purposes leased, the lessor shall put the same in a satisfactory condition,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the lessor does not do so with reasonable diligence, the Post Office Department in its discretion may cancel the lease.\u201d A8; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 7-8. Ensley argues that paragraph 10(e), by listing a particular remedy available to the Postal Service in the event of Ensley\u2019s breach <em>(i.e., </em>cancellation), implicitly excludes all other remedies, including self-help repair and rent deduction. Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 7 (stating that paragraph 10(e) \u201cis clear and unambiguous in providing the Defendant with one remedy for the failure of the lessor to make necessary repairs: cancel the lease\u201d), 8 (\u201c[T]he words of the Lease should be given the meaning derived from it by a reasonable intelligent person acquainted with the contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>circumstances. Using that plain meaning, the Defendant only had the option to cancel the Lease, not repair the roof and deduct the amount from the rents.\u201d) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The short answer to plaintiffs argument with respect to paragraph 10(c) is that nothing in paragraph 10(e) <em>expressly </em>limits the government\u2019s setoff rights or precludes the government from making repairs and deducting the cost of such repairs from rent due under the lease. As explained <em>supra, </em>the absence of any explicit limitation on the government\u2019s common law setoff rights is dis-positive of the issue of whether the government was entitled to replace the roof and deduct the cost of such replacement from rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion would be no different even if the court were to assume that the Postal Service\u2019s right to repair and deduct were a matter of contract interpretation as to the exclusivity of the remedies enumerated in paragraph 10(c) of the lease <em>(i.e., </em>cancellation). It is axiomatic that contract interpretation begins with the plain language of the agreement. <em>E.g., Barron Bancshares, Inc. v. United States, </em>366 F.3d 1360, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citation omitted). Paragraph 10(c) states that \u201c[i]f any building or any part of it on the leased property becomes unfit for use for the purposes leased, the lessor shall put the same in a satisfactory condition.\u201d A8. It then goes on to state that \u201c[i]f the lessor does not do so with reasonable diligence, the Post Office Department <em>in its discretion may </em>cancel the lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This permissive language clearly connotes non-exclusivity as to the remedies available to the Postal Service in the event of the lessor\u2019s failure to maintain the premises. The plain language of paragraph 10(e) therefore undermines Ensley\u2019s argument that the Postal Service\u2019s remedies were limited to cancellation of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Plaintiffs argument with respect to paragraph 10(c) is also in conflict with case law interpreting similar lease provisions. \u201cIt is well settled that contracts to which the government is a party\u2014and though a lease may concern and convey a property interest it is also very much a contract\u2014are normally governed by federal law, not by the law of the state where they are made or performed.\u201d <em>Ginsberg v. Austin, </em>968 F.2d 1198, 1200 (Fed.Cir.1992) (citing <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. United States, </em>801 F.2d 1295, 1298 (Fed.Cir.1986)). When federal law does not answer the question presented, however, a court may \u201clook to general property and contract law principles as they are embodied in state law pronouncements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The parties do not cite, and the court has not found, any decisions of the Federal Circuit or this court (or their predecessors) involving similar lease provisions or addressing the exclusivity of remedies enumerated in Postal Service leases. Nevertheless, the court notes that at least two federal district courts, in construing nearly identical provisions in Postal Service leases, have held that the enumeration of particular remedies for the lessor\u2019s failure to maintain the leased premises did not render those remedies exclusive of all remedies otherwise available to the Postal Service. <em>See J &amp; R Realty Co. v. United States, </em>418 F.Supp. 391, 394 (E.D.Pa. 1976) (in an action by a lessor for recovery of rent withheld by the Postal Service as a setoff against the cost of repairs undertaken by the Postal Service, holding that \u201cthe government was justified in withholding from its rental payments the costs of ... repairs determined to be necessary\u201d notwithstanding a lease provision similar to paragraph 10(c)); <em>McClure v. United States, </em>382 F.Supp. 988, 991-92 (D.Kan.1974) (construing a lease provision identical to paragraph 10(e) in an action by a lessor for recovery of rent withheld by the Postal Service, and holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>government \u201cwas not limited in remedies to an abatement of the rent or cancellation but could elect to make the repairs and deduct the expense from the rental payments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Likewise, as the government points out in its briefs, the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals, in construing similar lease provisions, has repeatedly held that the Postal Service may make repairs to leased buildings upon the lessor\u2019s failure to make necessary repairs and may recover the cost of such repairs through rent deductions. <em>See, e.g., Spodek Nationwide Postal Mgmt. Lease Agreement, </em>PSBCA No. 4506, 02-1 BCA \u00b6 31,733, 2001 WL 1647269 (Dec. 26, 2001) (construing similar lease provisions and upholding a contracting officer\u2019s decision requiring a lessor to reimburse the Postal Service for the cost of replacing a roof that persistently leaked despite previous repairs by the lessor because \u201cthose repairs did not relieve [the lessor] of the responsibility under the lease to maintain the facility (including the roof) in good repair and tenantable condition\u201d), aff<em>'d sub nom.

Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago v. K-Mart Corp., </em>717 F.2d 394, 398 (7th Cir.1983) (applying Illinois law to hold that \u201c[t]he mere fact that a contract provides remedies a tenant may pursue on breach of a landlord\u2019s covenant does not necessarily limit the remedies available\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>cf.

While these federal courts\u2019 interpretations of state law are not dispositive, they are in harmony with both state law and respected treatises and, accordingly, constitute additional persuasive authority in support of the government\u2019s position in this case. <em>See, e.g., Marini v. Ireland, </em>56 N.

In addition, defendant argues that \u201ceven if the [Tax Clause] did not state that the real estate taxes were payable as rent, the Postal Service still would not have breached the lease because the lease does not preclude setoffs,\u201d including setoffs by means of withholding tax payments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In response, Ensley argues that the express terms of the Tax Clause prohibit the government from offsetting the cost of repairs against property tax payments. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 9-11. The specific language upon which plaintiff relies is the portion of the Tax Clause requiring the Postal Service to pay the lessor\u2019s property taxes \u201cby check made payable to the lessor and the taxing authority\u201d and requiring the lessor to \u201cindorse said check and turn the same over to the said taxing authority.\u201d A16; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 9-10. Ensley suggests that the government is precluded from setting off repair costs against tax payments because, pursuant to the \u201cclear language\u201d of the Tax Clause, the taxing authority (not the lessor) \u201cends up with the funds.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 10. Additionally, and in the alternative, Ensley invokes the rule of <em>contra proferentem </em>to argue that, to the extent that the Tax Clause is found to be ambiguous, it \u201cshould be construed against the Defendant, who drafted the [T]ax [C]lause,\u201d because \u201cthe Plaintiffs interpretation of the [T]ax [C]lause is reasonable, and the Plaintiff has reasonably relied on its interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The court finds Ensley\u2019s arguments with respect to the Tax Clause to be meritless, and agrees with defendant that the Postal Service was not precluded from withholding tax payments as a setoff against the cost of replacing the roof at Ensley Station. As an initial matter, the court has already determined that nothing in the lease expressly limits the government\u2019s setoff rights or precludes the government from making repairs and deducting the cost of such repairs from rent due under the lease. As defendant correctly notes, the Tax Clause requires the Postal Service to pay the lessor\u2019s property taxes as <em>\u201cadditional rent due hereunder.\u201d </em>A16 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 17; Def.\u2019s Reply at 13. By expressly including property tax payments as part of the \u201crent due\u201d under the lease, the Tax Clause clearly permitted the government to offset the cost of repairs against tax payments to the same extent as with any other forms of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Additionally, the court rejects the notion, advanced by Ensley, that the Postal Service was precluded from withholding tax payments as a setoff merely because the taxing authority, not the lessor, ultimately received the payments. Plaintiff offers no support for this argument other than to suggest that \u201c[a]ll of the cases cited by the Defendant concerning the right to setoff\u2019 are distinguishable because, unlike in those cases, \u201c[i]n this situation the lessor isn\u2019t actually getting the money.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 10. Plaintiff fails to explain how this distinction makes any difference with regard to the Postal Service\u2019s ability to invoke its setoff rights. Indeed, the plain terms of the lease undermine Ensley\u2019s position. The Tax Clause required the lessor to \u201cpresent to the Government the general real estate tax bills ... for taxes due and payable on the land and buildings hereby demised\u201d and required the Postal Service to pay such bills \u201cas additional rent.\u201d A16. Regardless of the ultimate recipient of the tax payments, this language plainly conferred a financial benefit to the lessor, and imposed a corresponding financial obligation upon the Postal Service, which could be offset against the cost of necessary repairs undertaken by the Postal Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Finally, the court agrees with defendant that \u201cEnsley\u2019s invocation of the rule of <em>contra proferentem </em>is misplaced.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply at 14. As the Federal Circuit has held, <em>\u201ccontra proferentem </em>is a rule of last resort that is applied only where there is a genuine ambiguity and where, after examining the entire contract, the relation of the parties and the circumstances under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>they executed the contract, the ambiguity remains unresolved.\u201d <em>Gardiner, Kamya &amp; Assocs., P.C. v. Jackson, </em>467 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A contract provision is ambiguous only if it is \u201csusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>HPI/ GSA-SC, LLC v. Perry, </em>364 F.3d 1327, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Jowett, Inc. v. United States, </em>234 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2000)). The court has already determined that the Tax Clause, by expressly including property tax payments as part of the \u201crent due\u201d under the lease, unambiguously permitted the government to offset the cost of repairs against tax payments to the same extent as with any other forms of rent. Ensley has failed to demonstrate any ambiguity in the Tax Clause which would support the invocation of <em>contra proferentem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Ensley has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the cause of the ongoing leaks at Ensley Station as well as its failure to remedy those leaks. Furthermore, the court concludes that, under the plain language of the lease, the Postal Service was entitled to offset the cost of replacing the leaky roof against rent due Ensley under the lease, including by withholding tax payments otherwise due under the Tax Clause. Defendant is therefore entitled to summary judgment on each of plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">(1) Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, filed August .29, 2013, is GRANTED;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">(2) The Clerk\u2019s Office is directed to ENTER final judgment in favor of defendant DISMISSING the complaint with prejudice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">(3) Each party shall bear its own costs.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-15\">. The facts recounted in this opinion are taken from the complaint and the parties\u2019 submissions in connection with defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.

All references in this opinion to \"A_\u201d are to the appendix to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-18\">. Although a \"Certificate of Transfer of Title to Leased Property and Lease Assignment and Assumption\u201d dated July 17, 2005 refers to the lease as \"dated March 20, 1965,\u201d A159, the lease itself states that it was \"made and entered into this [ ] X 5[th] day of March, 1965,\u201d A7, and a subsequent amendment to the lease likewise refers to the lease as an \"instrument dated March 15, 1965,\" A16. Despite this discrepancy, the precise date on which the lease was entered is not material to the court\u2019s resolution of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b719-10\">. Although Mr. Magdovitz asserted at his deposition that Mr. Spencer \"had an electrical and plumbing license,\u201d he stated that he did not know whether Mr. Spencer possessed a roofing license. A141-42. In the totality of the testimony concerning Mr. Spencer, there is nothing indicating that he was a licensed roofer or, for that matter, that he possessed any roofing experience whatsoever.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b719-17\">. Defendant's appendix includes a redacted version of the transcript of Mr. Magdovitz\u2019s deposition. Because the pertinent testimony in Mr. Magdovitz's deposition is not confined to the page ranges included in defendant\u2019s appendix, the court is obliged to refer in certain portions of this opinion to the un-redacted transcript of Mr. Magdovitz\u2019s deposition attached as an exhibit to plaintiff's response to defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b720-5\">. Like Mr. Spencer, Mr. Willis was not a licensed roofer. Mr. Willis testified that his job as operations superintendent entailed the performance of maintenance and repair work on the Yazoo, Mississippi Delta Levee. Although he admitted that he possessed no professional certifications, he claimed that he had obtained \"[h]ands-on training\u201d in sundry areas such as \"heavy equipment, welding, carpentry work, [and] roofing.\u201d A16162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\">. Although Mr. Willis was shown photographs taken by Mr. House during his April 18, 2005 investigation, he was not asked to offer any opinion as to Mr. House\u2019s findings and conclusions with respect to the condition of the roof. <em>See </em>A185-86, 194-95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">. Ensley also suggests that interpreting the lease to allow self-help repair and rent deduction would \"render portions of the [lease] meaningless,\u201d thereby violating a basic canon of contract interpretation. PL's Resp. at 7 (citing <em>Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Sys., Inc. v. West, </em>108 F.3d 319, 322 (Fed.Cir. 1997), <em>McAbee Constr., Inc. v. United States, </em>97 F.3d 1431, 1434 (Fed.Cir. 1996), and <em>Fortec Constructors v. United States, </em>760 F.2d 1288, 1292 (Fed.Cir. 1985)). Defendant is correct to point out, however, that Ensley \"fails to identify what provision of the lease, if any, is rendered meaningless\u201d under the government\u2019s proffered interpretation. Def.\u2019s Reply at 8. The court therefore rejects plaintiff's perfunctory, and unsupported, argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. With regard to Ensley\u2019s request for an award of attorney fees in Count III of the complaint, the court notes that attorney fees may be awarded under the Equal Access to Justice Act only to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (2012); <em>see, e.g., 360Training.com, Inc. v.
