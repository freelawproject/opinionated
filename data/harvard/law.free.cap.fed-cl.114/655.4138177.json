No. 47) and substitutes the following amended opinion and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">On December 20, 2013, Plaintiff Demodulation, Inc. (\u201cDemodulation\u201d) filed a motion to vacate Judge Susan G. Braden\u2019s prior substantive rulings in this case and to compel discovery. (Dkt. No. 42). Judge Braden disqualified herself from this case in August 2013, but had issued rulings on July 12, 2013 on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for partial summary judgment, and on February 29, 2012 on Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Demodulation\u2019s motion to vacate has been fully briefed, and on February 4, 2014, the Court heard oral argument on this motion. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to vacate is granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">Demodulation filed its initial complaint on April 14, 2011, and the Clerk\u2019s Office randomly assigned this case to Judge Braden. In the complaint, Demodulation identified Clarence \u201cBud\u201d Albright, former Undersecretary of Energy, as a potential fact witness. Compl. \u00b6 25. Over the course of the next 27 months, Judge Braden managed the case, and issued the two above noted opinions on substantive motions. On August 1, 2013, Judge Braden issued a notice of intent to disqualify herself pursuant to Canon 3(D) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-19\">In the notice, Judge Braden informed the parties that she intended to disqualify herself from the ease unless waivers were provided by both parties. Waivers were not received on behalf of all parties, and on August 26, 2013, Judge Braden issued an order disqualifying herself. (Dkt. No. 30). The Clerk\u2019s Office reassigned the case to Judge Thomas C. Wheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>On December 20, 2013, Demodulation filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d) to vacate the following two substantive opinions that Judge Braden had issued prior to her disqualification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\u2022 On February 29, 2012, Judge Braden issued an opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, and granting Demodulation\u2019s cross-motion to amend (Dkt. No. 15).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">\u2022 On July 12, 2013, Judge Braden entered an opinion and order granting the Government\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and denying Demodulation\u2019s cross-motion (Dkt. No. 29).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>Dismission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Under RCFC 60(b)(6) the Court may vacate an order or judgment for any reason that justifies relief. RCFC 60(b)(6) and its counterpart Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) provide courts with authority \u201cadequate to enable them to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.\u201d <em>Klapprott v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 614-15, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The circumstances that mandate disqualification of federal judges are defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but the statute does not prescribe a specific remedy. Rather, when deciding whether to vacate a judgment or order for violation of \u00a7 455(a), a court should consider: (1) \u201cthe risk of injustice to the parties in the particular case\u201d; (2) \u201cthe risk that the denial of relief will produce injustice in other cases\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe risk of undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process.\u201d <em>Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 864, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988). The appearance of partiality cames the risk of undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. United States, </em>672 F.3d 1283, 1294 (Fed. Cir.2012) (finding that judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself from entire action on grounds of financial interest was not harmless error because of the risk of undermining the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial process).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">Nothing in the limited facts available to the Court suggests that Judge Braden\u2019s association with Mr. Albright influenced her rulings in the two substantive orders that she issued prior to disqualification. The Court will not assess whether Judge Braden\u2019s recusal was warranted in the circumstances presented. Rather, the Court will assume that Judge Braden held some concern about the appearance of partiality towards the Defendant. The Court approaches Judge Braden\u2019s two substantive rulings through the same paradigm to determine whether Judge Bra-den\u2019s relationship with Mr. Albright might create the appearance of partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">Upon full consideration of the parties\u2019 positions, the Court concludes that if the orders of the now-recused judge were allowed to stand, Plaintiff could one day wonder whether the outcome of the case was influenced by a judge who later recused herself from the case. Given the Federal Circuit\u2019s strict application of disqualification requirements in <em>Shell Oil, supra, </em>Plaintiffs counsel raises the specter of incurring the time and expense to pursue this case to completion, only to have the appellate court rule that the case must begin anew. Thus, the safest course is to vacate Judge Braden\u2019s substantive orders because \u201cjustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d <em>Liljeberg, </em>486 U.S. at 864, 108 S.Ct. 2194. So that no questions remain about the appearance of Judge Braden\u2019s partiality, as unlikely as that possibility seems, the Court chooses to start with a clean slate. Accordingly, Plaintiffs motion to vacate is GRANTED. As the Court discussed with counsel at the close of oral argument, Plaintiff shall file forthwith its third amended complaint, after which Defendant shall respond to the complaint with an answer or motion as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\">. This order addresses only the motion to vacate. The motion to compel discovery will be resolved in a separate order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">. Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
