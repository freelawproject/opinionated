The parties submitted briefs on claim construction in April and May 2013, and presented arguments at a <em>Mark-man </em>hearing held on May 17, 2013. Of the eight claim terms identified by parties, four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>have an agreed construction. <em>See </em>Joint Proposed Constructions of Claim Terms, ECF No. 17-1. For those four terms, the court accepts the mutually acceptable constructions proffered by the parties. The constructions adopted by the court for the disputed terms of the \u2019024 patent are set forth below, along with the terms agreed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">A. <em>Standards for Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cThe purpose of claim construction is to \u2018determin[e] the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.\u2019 \u201d <em>02 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., </em>521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996)). The construction and meaning of claims in a patent are questions of law for the court to address. <em>Markman, </em>517 U.S. at 388-91, 116 S.Ct. 1384. The court does not have to construe every term in a patent, but it must construe any term for which claim scope is disputed. <em>02 Micro, </em>521 F.3d at 1360; <em>see also Finjan, Inc. v. Secure Computing Corp., </em>626 F.3d 1197, 1207 (Fed.Cir.2010). The court should first look to the intrinsic evidence of record because \u201cintrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.\u201d <em>Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir.1996). Intrinsic evidence consists of the \u201cpatent itself, including the claims, the speeifieation[,] and ... the prosecution history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In general, to construe claim terms properly, a court should look to the ordinary and customary meanings attributed by those of ordinary skill in the art at the date of the invention, which is the effective filing date of the patent application. <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc). \u201cThat starting point is based on the well-settled understanding that inventors are typically persons skilled in the field of the invention and that patents are addressed to and intended to be read by others of skill in the pertinent art.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Courts have recognized, however, that \u201ca patentee may choose to be his own lexicographer and use terms in a manner other than their ordinary meaning, as long as the special definition of the term is clearly stated in the patent specification or file history.\u201d <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582 (citing <em>Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. BP Chems. Ltd., </em>78 F.3d 1575, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Hormone Research Found., Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>904 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>cert. dismissed pursuant to Sup.Ct. R. 46, </em>499 U.S. 955, 111 S.Ct. 1434, 113 L.Ed.2d 485 (1991)). Accordingly, a court must review the patent\u2019s specification \u201cto determine whether [an] inventor has used any terms in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">This comports with the Federal Circuit\u2019s repeated instruction that \u201c[c]laims must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part.\u201d <em>Markman, 52 </em>F.3d at 979 (citing <em>Autogiro Co. of Am. v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 391, 397 (Ct.Cl.1967)). The specification is \u201calways highly relevant to the claim construction analysis,\u201d and often is \u201cdispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.\u201d <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582. Prosecution history may also be examined, with its principal purpose being to exclude interpretations disclaimed during prosecution. <em>See Chimie v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1371, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Extrinsic evidence, which includes \u201call evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises,\u201d <em>Markman, 52 </em>F.3d at 980, is \u201cless significant than the intrinsic record in determining \u2018the legally operative meaning of claim language,\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1317 (quoting <em>C.R. Bard, Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp., </em>388 F.3d 858, 862 (Fed.Cir.2004) (in turn quoting <em>Vanderlande Indus. Nederland BV v. International Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>366 F.3d 1311, 1318 (Fed.Cir.2004))). It should be considered by the court only when intrinsic evidence cannot resolve ambiguities in the claim language. <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>B. <em>Specific Terms of the Claims Requiring Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><em>Term 1: \u201cLocation. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Means a position or site occupied or of interest, by some distinguishing feature._</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Means the three-dimensional coordinates describing the position of an entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Term 1 appears in Claims 8 (by incorporation of Claim 1) and 15, as well as in Claims 2, 7, 9, 10, and 14. Generally, terms should be given the customary meaning attributed to them by persons with ordinary skill in the relevant art, <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1313, although a patentee may choose to be his own lexicographer, as long as the special definition is clearly stated in the patent specification or history, <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582. A \u201c \u2018person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which [it] appears, but in the context of the entire patent, including the specification.\u2019 While claim terms are understood in light of the specification, a claim construction must not import limitations from the specification into the claims.\u201d <em>Douglas Dynamics, LLC v. Buyers Prods. Co., </em>717 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed. Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1313) (internal citations omitted). Dr. Smith argues that, with respect to Term 1 of the patent, he chose to be his own lexicographer as evidenced by the specification which states: \u201cAs used in this [application, the terms \u2018location\u2019 and \u2018localization\u2019 each mean the location of an entity (e.g. hostile weapons fire) as well as the processes to locate the firing entity. Thus, these words may be used interchangeably.\u201d \u2019024 patent, col. 2, lines 52-56; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. at 6. Although this statement purports to define Term 1, it merely uses variations of the root word in its description, and thus is too indefinite to be of use in providing the meaning and scope of the term. Instead, the claim construction should delineate and clarify the customary meaning of the term as read in the context of the patent and the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The government\u2019s proffered construction is similarly unhelpful because it incorrectly imports limitations from the specification. The government argues that its definition cap-</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">tures the \u201cthree-dimensional aspects of \u2018location\u2019 \u201d as used in the patent. Def.\u2019s Br. at 7. To support this contention, it cites excerpts of the specification that describe data and locational characteristics that can be determined by acoustical and optical detection systems which may be used in the invention. <em>See id.; see also </em>\u2019024 patent, col. 5, lines 11-14 (\u201cAcoustical detection system 24, and more particularly processor or processor means 28, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, determines values such as time of energy arrival, azimuth, elevation/depression angle, arrival angle[,] and trajectory of the incoming acoustic energy.\u201d), col. 6, lines 15-17 (\u201c[0]ptieal detection system 32 will determine values such as azimuth, time of occurrence^] and elevation/depression angle of the incoming energy.\u201d). The government asserts that the use of this language \u201cindicate[s] coordinates in three-dimensional space,\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 7, and should limit the use of \u201clocation\u201d to describing three-dimensional coordinates. This postulate is disproved by the specification in a number of ways. Among other things, the specification notes that the invention is not limited to use with the detection systems described. <em>See </em>\u2019024 patent, col. 5, lines 31-33, col. 6, lines 20-21. Moreover, the use of \u201csuch as\u201d indicates that the locational characteristics listed do not represent all of the possible results that can be obtained from the data the detection systems generate.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Most importantly, the government\u2019s proffered construction does not comport with the language of the claims as read in the context of the specification. Claim 1, which is incorporated by reference in dependent Claim 8, describes an acoustical detection means that transmits \u201ca first set of data describing the location of said hostile weapon fire,\u201d an optical detection means that transmits \u201ca second set of data describing the location of said hostile weapon fire,\u201d and a processing means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>that determines \u201cwhether said location of said first set of data match said location of second set of data and for generating a signal output if said match occurs.\u201d \u2019024 patent, Claim 1. Claim 15 describes a method in which acoustical energy and optical energy generated from hostile weapons fire are sensed; a first location is calculated using only the sensed acoustical energy; a second location is calculated using only the sensed optical energy; the two locations are compared; and an output signal is provided \u201conly if said first and said second locations match.\u201d \u2019024 patent, Claim 15. Nowhere in the claim language is location specifically limited to three-dimensional coordinates. Instead, the claims and the specification contemplate a meaning of Term 1 that encompasses a range of possibilities delineated by a broader set of data. The specification comments that acoustical detection systems by themselves \u201chave a fairly large error in the determination of the location of the hostile weapon.\u201d \u2019024 patent, col. 1, lines 54-55. The specification compares this problematic result to that provided by the invention, stating that the invention can use</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">an acoustic system to determine the <em>general location </em>of the hostile weapons fire ... and then us[e] an optical system ... in order to <em>farther refine the location within the field established </em>by the acoustic system. In this manner, the relatively notorious \u201cfalse alarms\u201d associated with the optical systems [can] be minimized since the optical data only from the field of view formed or \u201cfixed\u201d by the acoustical technique [are] reviewed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><em>Id. </em>at col. 2, lines 23-33 (emphasis added). This phrasing indicates that \u201clocation\u201d may refer to a broad area determined by data points, as well as a smaller area indicated by the use of more discriminating data collection methods and analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Indeed, the specification later describes a \u201csecond embodiment of the ... invention ... [which] includes an acoustical detection system 64, comprising an acoustic processor 68 ... a microphone array 66; a laser detection system 62, comprising a laser processor and a laser scanner and detector system; a processing means 70 ...; and an output display means 72.\u201d \u2019024 patent at col. 8, lines 3-12; <em>see also id. </em>Sheet 6, Fig. 9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The specification states that the acoustical detection system of the second embodiment \u201cdetermines the location of the source of the acoustic energy and transmits a first set of data describing such location to processing means 70 and laser processor 60.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 8, lines 18-21. According to the specification, the laser processor that is part of the pertinent laser detection system \u201creceives the first set of data [describing the location] from acoustic processor 68, determines the approximate direction to the missile trajectory and source and transmits this information to [a] laser scanner ... which scans <em>the area </em>received from laser processor 60.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 8, lines 40-46 (emphasis added). By using \u201carea\u201d to describe the output of the first set of data, the specification illustrates that Term 1 may refer to a relatively broad expanse indicated by the data culled by the invention\u2019s detection systems, and is not cabined to a specific site or position identified by a precise set of three-dimensional coordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">For the reasons stated, the court adopts the following construction of Term 1: \u201clocation\u201d means a bounded area indicated by data points that is not necessarily specific to a position defined by three-dimensional coordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\n<em>Term2: \u201cMatch.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Means data equal or similar to another by suitable association, of the \u201clocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Means when two separate sets of location data are equal to each other, <em>i.e., </em>describe the same position._</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Term 2 appears in Claim 8 (by incorporation of Claim 1) and Claim 15, as well as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Claims 2, 9, and 10. Again, the government\u2019s proffered construction, which requires the two sets of locational data to describe an identical position, is too narrow and is not supported by the specification. The government is correct, however, in its recognition that \u201cmatch\u201d is used with reference to <em>location, </em>as a careful reading of the claims and specification confirms. Accordingly, the court\u2019s analysis and construction of Term 1, <em>supra, </em>bears on the construction of Term 2. Location may refer to a bounded area indicated by data points, and can be broader than a position identified by three-dimensional coordinates. To a person with ordinary skill in the art, then, it follows that the first and second locations of data-bounded areas need not be identical to produce a \u201cmatch;\u201d an overlap of the first and second locational areas suffices. The specification confirms such a reading. First, the specification provides that a \u201c \u2018match\u2019 ... is indicated when a location and time from the first set of data (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018acoustic event\u2019) fall within a <em>predetermined range </em>of a location and time from the second set of data (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018optic event\u2019). If a match is detected, processing means 8 will generate a signal output ... [indicating that both the acoustic and infrared systems \u2018match\u2019 and correspond to a hostile weapons location.\u201d \u2019024 patent, col. 6, lines 55-63 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The instruction that a match occurs when data from a first set fall within a predetermined range of data from a second set contemplates that some data points from each of the first and second sets may be excluded and a match can still occur. In addition, the specification summarizes the method for determining the location of hostile weapons fire detailed in Claim 15 and notes that an output signal is provided \u201cif the first location is substantially similar to the second location.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 3, lines 51-53. The method of Claim 15 instructs that an output signal is provided \u201cif said first and said second locations match.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Claim 15. That the specification allows for an output signal when the data points comprising each of the first and second locations are substantially similar, even if they are not identical, undermines the government\u2019s proffered construction and supports a modified version of plaintiffs proposed definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">For the reasons above, the court adopts the following construction of Term 2: \u201cmatch\u201d means an overlap of at least some of the data points describing the first location with some of the data points describing the second location.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\n<em>Term 8: \u201cOptical detection means for detecting energy of a second frequency originating from said hostile weapon fire, and for transmitting a second set of data describing the location of said hostile weapon fire.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Term 3 appears in Claim 1 (and thus Claim 8 by incorporation). The parties agree that \u201coptical detection means\u201d refers to an electronic device for sensing optical energy. Joint Proposed Constructions of Claim Terms at 1. The court accepts this mutually agreed construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Term </em>J: <em>\u201cProcessing means coupled to said acoustical and said optical detection means, for receiving said first and said second set of data, and for determining whether said location of said first set of data match said location of second set of data and for generating a signal output if said match occurs. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Tern 4 appears in Claim 8, via incorporation of Claim 1. The parties agree that \u201cprocessing means\u201d refers to an electronic device that uses an algorithm, mathematical analysis, or stored program control. Joint Proposed Constructions of Claim Terms at 2. The parties further agree that \u201csignal output\u201d means a transmitted communication from an electronic device containing information to convey location; or to position a weapon and fire a counterattack. <em>Id. </em>The court accepts these mutually agreed constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The parties diverge with regard to the meaning of \u201csaid first and said second set of data,\u201d a portion of the term which the court will refer to as Term 4.A. The parties\u2019 proffered definitions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Plaintiffs Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Means the electrical transmissions from acoustical detection means and optical detection means, respectively, containing information from which spatial orientation as to the position of the entity can be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Means the information describing the position of an entity by three-dimensional coordinates from acoustical detection means and optical detection means, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Once again, the construction of Term 4.A hinges on the court\u2019s construction of Term 1, \u201clocation.\u201d The language of Claim 1 instructs that the first set of data describes a location and is transmitted from acoustical detection means, while the second set of data describes a location and is transmitted via optical detection means. See\u2019024 patent, Claim 1. The specification confirms that both sets of data describe a location, and that the first set is derived from acoustical detection means, with the second set being supplied by optical detection means. <em>Id. </em>at col. 3, lines 8-16. The government\u2019s proffered construction fails to capture this relationship adequately because it refers to \u201cthree-dimensional coordinates\u201d and attempts to use a narrow construction of Term 1 that this court has rejected. <em>See supra </em>pp. 433-34. Plaintiffs proposed construction includes a clause, \u201cfrom which spatial orientation as to the position of the entity can be rendered,\u201d which finds limited support in the specification because it would equate \u201cspatial orientation\u201d with \u201clocation.\u201d It seems preferable not to introduce yet a further variant of the definition of location in deriving the construction of the \u201csaid first and second set of data.\u201d Those data represent distinct bounded areas delineated through acoustical and optical detection means. Accordingly, the court concludes that Term 4.A, \u201csaid first and said second set of data,\u201d means information describing bounded areas indicated by acoustically and optically derived data, which areas are not necessarily specific to a position defined by three-dimensional coordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">\n<em>Term 5: \u201cSensing optical energy generated from said hostile weapons fire.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">Term 5 appears in Claim 15 and Claim 18. The parties agree that \u201csensing optical energy\u201d means detecting optical energy. Joint Proposed Constructions of Claim Terms at 2. The court accepts this mutually agreed construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\"><em>Term 6: \u201cCalculating. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Term 6 appears in Claim 15 and Claim 18. The parties agree that \u201ccalculating\u201d means determining by algorithm, mathematical analysis, or stored program control. Joint Proposed Constructions of Claim Terms at 2. The court accepts this mutually agreed construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\"><em>Term 7: \u201cComparing. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Means generating the relative data and information equivalence or difference between two portrayed locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Means determining the equivalence or difference between two calculated locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Term 7 appears only in Claim 15 and is used in the context of \u201ccomparing said first and said second locations\u201d calculated by \u201csensed acoustical energy\u201d and \u201csensed optical energy,\u201d respectively. \u2019024 patent, Claim 15. Claim 15 prescribes the step of \u201cproviding an output signal only if said first and said second locations match.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The language of the claim indicates that the patentee used a meaning of Term 7 customary to those with ordinary skill in the relevant art: that the difference or equivalence between the bounded areas obtained through the first and second sensing means should be examined and analyzed. Contrary to the government\u2019s assertion that Term 7 involves a determination, this customary meaning does not necessarily encompass a final decision, as \u201cdetermining\u201d would. Rather, it connotes an assessment of the correlation or differences between locations, after which a decision may be made. The specification\u2019s use of \u201ccompare\u201d or \u201ccomparing\u201d is also in accord with the customary meaning of Term 7. <em>See, </em>e.y.,\u2019024 patent, col. 3, lines 50-53 (\u201ccomparing the first and second locations; and providing an output signal if the first location is substantially similar to the second location\u201d), col. 6, lines 51-54 (\u201cProcessing means ... holds and/or stores all locations from the second set of data for a predetermined period of time and compares these stored locations with locations from the first set of data.\u201d), col. 9, lines 13-16 (\u201cProcessing means ... will then hold all locations from the first set of data for a predetermined period of time and compare with locations from the second set of data.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The parties agree that location must be a part of the construction of Term 7; however, both plaintiff and the government add adjectives, \u201cportrayed\u201d and \u201ccalculated,\u201d respectively, to modify \u201clocation.\u201d The court finds the additions without support from the specification, and thus declines to incorporate them into a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">For the stated reasons, the court adopts the following construction for Term 7: \u201ccomparing\u201d means assessing the equivalence, correspondence, or difference between locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">\n<em>Term 8: \u201cProviding an output signal only if said first and said second locations match.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Term 8 appears in Claim 15. The parties agree that \u201coutput signal\u201d means a transmitted communication from an electronic device containing information to convey location; or to position a weapon and fire a counterattack. Joint Proposed Constructions of Claim Terms at 3. The court accepts this mutually agreed construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">No extrinsic evidence is necessary for resolution of claim construction. For the reasons detailed above, the terms identified by the parties shall be construed as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-18\">. Because this opinion and order might have contained confidential or proprietary information within the meaning of Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims (\"RCFC\") and the protective order entered in this case, it was initially filed under seal.

Subsection 1498(a) of Title 28 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of the United States is used or manufactured by or for the United States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture the same, the owner's remedy shall be by action against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and manufacture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-30\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-13\">. This embodiment is encapsulated in independent Claim 10, which combines use of acoustic detection means with laser detection means,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-11\">. Time is thus pertinent to whether a match is found. The specification draws upon the fact that light travels much faster than sound to analyze the data from the sensing means. For example, the specification states for one embodiment that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">[t]he signal output will also indicate whether the acoustic event occurred before the optically sensed event. When the acoustic event occurs before the optically sensed event, the optical event actually represents a subsequent attack from the same location, since optical energy general reaches the observer before acoustic energy and the associated missile. In such a cases, a counter-measure against the incoming missile may be launched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">'024 patent, col. 6, line 67 through col. 7, line 7. The specification elaborates on the use of time to refine location:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">To determine the range or distance to the hostile weapons fire, the invention uses a \"flash-bang\u201d analysis. In one embodiment, processing means 8 takes the second or optical data and notes the time of its arrival. Then, processing means 8 takes the first or acoustical data which arrives later than the optical data and note[s] the time of this arrival. Then processing means 8 takes the difference between the two times (which is directly proportional to the range) and by a known mathematical algorithm determines the range. In one example, the difference is multiplied by the speed of sound and this value is used as the range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-15\"><em>Id. </em>at col. 7, lines 30-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
