(\u201cOpen Range\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the Loan Agreement, RUS agreed to provide funds to Open Range that were to be used to construct a wireless broadband network in hundreds of rural communities under the Rural Development Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. G4S, which was one of Open Range\u2019s vendors, alleges that RUS breached its promise to pay G4S for $10,321,340.11 worth of services that remained due to G4S after Open Range filed for bankruptcy in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Pending before the court is the defendant, the United States\u2019 (\u201cthe government\u201d) motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d). The government has moved, in the alternative, for judgment on the pleadings under RCFC 12(c) or for summary judgment under to RCFC 56. The government contends that G4S cannot establish that it was a third-party beneficiary to the Loan Agreement between Open Range and RUS. Although G4S has not cross-moved for summary judgment, plaintiff contends that it has alleged sufficient facts\u2014and that the undisputed evidence establishes\u2014that G4S was an intended third-party beneficiary of the Loan Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">For the reasons discussed below, the court finds that it has jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs claim, and that the government is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">I. STATEMENT OF FACTS<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">a. The 2009 Loan Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b676-14\">On January 9, 2009, Open Range and RUS entered into a Loan Agreement by which RUS agreed to make a $267,298,000 loan to Open Range to finance construction of wireless broadband in 540 RUS-approved markets. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resp. at 4. The Loan Agreement established two conditions required for closure. First, One Equity Partners III, L.P. (\u201cOEP\u201d), a private equity firm with an interest in Open Range, was required to deposit $97 million into Open Range\u2019s deposit account. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A222. This amount was to be used for operating expenses and construction of broadband networks outside of the RUS-approved markets (\u201cNon-RUS Markets\u201d). <em>See id.) </em>2d. Am. Compl. Ex. A at 7; 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1738.20 (2009) (listing eligibility requirements for loan applicants). Second, Open Range was required to furnish to RUS a six-month plan that described the construction to be performed by tower site, estimated cost of construction, commencement and completion time frames, and the workforce that would be carrying out the construction. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A199. Open Range later submitted a six-month plan made clear that third-party vendors would be used to complete portions of the construction work. <em>Id. </em>at A469.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-15\">b. Funding procedures under the Loan Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b676-16\">The Loan Agreement required Open Range to establish a pledged deposit account into which RUS would deposit loan funds. <em>Id. </em>at A202-03. Funds in the pledged deposit account were to be used solely for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>purposes for which RUS advanced the funds. <em>Id. </em>at A203. Further, disbursements from the account were required to be made in accordance with RUS Bulletin 1738-2 (\u201cthe Bulletin\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In addition, Article VII of the Loan Agreement established certain \u201cLender\u2019s Rights\u201d related to RUS\u2019s obligation to fund loan advances. Specifically, Section 7.1(b) stated that \u201cRUS, in its sole discretion, may terminate the offer to make the Loan(s) and/or obligation to make Advances hereunder, under the circumstances specified in Schedule 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at A212. The circumstances listed in Schedule 1 included, <em>inter alia, </em>Open Range\u2019s loss (or anticipated loss) of access to the spectrum necessary to operate the planned wireless broadband network. <em>Id. </em>atA224.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">For advances to be used for engineering services (such as those provided by G4S), the Bulletin generally required that Open Range and the vendor forward a RUS Form 245 to RUS for approval. <em>Id. </em>at A238. If approved, RUS was to send one copy of the approval to Open Range and one copy to the vendor. <em>Id. </em>The Bulletin also established procedures for small-scale construction contracts. When an outside contractor was used, the Bulletin required that either a RUS Contract Form 773 or other appropriate RUS contract be used. Open Range, as the borrower, was required to finance small-scale construction projects (i.e., those of amounts not exceeding $500,000), and obtain reimbursement with loan funds once construction was completed. <em>Id. </em>at A239.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is undisputed that there was no provision in the Loan Agreement to provide direct payment from RUS to the third-party vendors hired by Open Range.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">c. Master Services Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Open Range\u2019s relationships with the third-party vendors such as G4S, which it hired to help carry out its obligations under the Loan Agreement, were each governed by a Master Service Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d). The MSA established a variety of requirements on third-party vendors and Open Range, including the markets and committed dates, technical specifications, general scope of work, and pricing. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. C at 13. Plaintiff has provided evidence that Open Range submitted for RUS\u2019s review, comment, and approval, a template of the MSA that it used for most of its vendors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A356-60 (e-mail message from Open Range seeking RUS feedback on MSA and vendor selection process).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">The MSA that G4S and Open Range executed contained provisions related to the work ordering process. Specifically, the MSA required that work being performed in RUS-approved markets be conducted pursuant to an approved six-month plan and the terms of RUS Forms 245 or 773. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. C. at 3. For RUS-approved markets, invoicing and payment was to be in accordance with RUS regulations, however the MSA included a provision that Open Range \u201cshall not be required to remit amounts to [vendors] until thirty (30) days following receipt of such funds by [Open Range] and from RUS.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. C. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">Invoicing and payment in Non-RUS Markets was to follow a different procedure than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>for RUS-approved markets. Specifically, the MSA required that Open Range provide a purchase order to authorize work. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The MSA with G4S further required G4S to provide an invoice in accordance with the purchase order, with a payment due date of 45 days after Open Range\u2019s receipt of the invoice. Notably, the MSA included a provision stating, \u201cRUS is not liable for payment on any PO.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 6; <em>see </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A31.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">d. Vendor concerns following suspension of RUS advances to Open Range</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Open Range began to experience cash-flow difficulties following the June 2, 2010 suspension of RUS loan advances to Open Range. The suspension was due to the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (\u201cFCC\u201d) decision to suspend the spectrum permit of Globalstar\u2014the company through which Open Range had been licensing the spectrum rights necessary to operate its network. As noted above, Open Range\u2019s loss of spectrum entitled RUS to cease making advances on the loan. On July 14, 2010, RUS provided Open Range with notice of its intent to terminate any remaining, unadvanced funds on the loan if Open Range failed to obtain an alternate agreement to gain access to spectrum rights. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. App. at A208.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">By September 15, 2010 (if not earlier), Jonathan Adelstein, the Administrator of the RUS, received an e-mail indicating that Open Range\u2019s vendors were seeking immediate payment of past-due bills from Open Range. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A317. On September 22, 2010, the FCC issued a temporary permit to Open Range that allowed Open Range access to spectrum until January 31, 2011. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s. Suppl. Mem. App. at A206-07. This permit, however, only covered 264 \u201cApproved Communities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, the maximum number of communities that Open Range could serve under the Loan Agreement was reduced from the original 540 markets to 264 markets. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Having secured access to at least some spectrum, an Open Range Executive Vice President contacted a Special Assistant to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture on September 23, 2010, to ask when Open Range\u2019s funding requests would be fulfilled. PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A396. The record contains evidence that Open Range informed RUS that Open Range\u2019s vendors were concerned about being paid and that Open Range was worried that these vendors might leave the project. <em>Id. </em>The Special Assistant responded by stating that Open Range could \u201cexpect the letter and simultaneous release of funds by the end of the day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at A395. With regard to the vendors, the Special Assistant stated that \u201cI think at this point our team feels the letter will serve as the press release and we will continue to talk to anyone (vendors, press, etc) who we need to [in order to] help calm fears and rebuild credibility. Jonathan [Adelstein] can talk to whomever you\u2019d like in this regal\u2019d.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">In a letter dated that same day, RUS modified its July 14, 2010 letter. Specifically, RUS withdrew its 90-day notice of intent to terminate the Loan Agreement, but left the suspension of funds in place with respect to certain communities that no longer had access to spectrum (i.e., those outside of the 264 \u201capproved communities\u201d). <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. App. at A206-08. RUS authorized the immediate release of $14 million (for work done in June and July), and a future release of $5 million (for work done in July and August) upon receipt of a request from Open Range. <em>See id.; </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A392. RUS stated that it would only consider advance requests for approved communities, and that no funds would be provided for conversion from Globalstar spectrum to any alternative. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. App. at A206-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">On October 4, 2010, the Mr. Adelstein was copied on an email sent by Open Range to the Director of the RUS Broadband Division, Ken Kuchno, which stated that Open Range</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>has a number of vendors requesting that [Open Range] give them assurances that RUS funding has been re-opened and it not [sic] currently curtailed. They are most concerned due to the information in the press that indicates that advances were suspended on July 14 and there has been no public notice that this has been modified. These vendors include [G4S]____ They have asked to see written confirmation that RUS is continuing to fund on a [sic] on-going basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A393.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">On October 8, 2010, Mr. Adelstein sent a letter to Open Range approving a revised business plan that would provide support to the 264 communities covered by the PCC\u2019s temporary permit. The letter stated that RUS \u201cis modifying the funding restrictions ... to include any construction identified in the Build-Out Plan approved on October 8, 2010, for the period of July 1, 2010, to December 31, 2010.\u201d PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A398. On that same day, Mr. Kuchno also sent a letter to Open Range, which stated that RUS was \u201capproving the Build-Out Plan for the period of July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, that covers the deployment of 228 markets, of which 212 will be funded with RUS funds and the remaining 16 with non RUS funds.\u201d PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A399.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">e. Subsequent requests for funds to pay continuing vendor arrearages</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Notwithstanding the October 8 letters, RUS continued to withhold funding advances to Open Range through at least March 2011. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Suppl. Mem. App. A94-99. According to Mr. Kuchno, the decision to suspend advances was approved by Mr. Adelstein. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">On January 11, 2011, Open Range e-mailed Mr. Kuchno (and copied Mr. Adelstein) seeking approval of two contracts: one held by another vendor, Alvarion, and the other held by G4S. Open Range requested that the G4S contract, which RUS had allegedly rejected on December 2, 2010, be approved (i.e., funded) because (1) RUS had provided verbal approval before the end of the year; (2) the funding for the specified markets had already been approved under the July through December 2010 six-month plan; and (3) the contracts had purportedly been \u201ccirculating through RUS for several months.\u201d <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A321. The next day, Mr. Adelstein wrote to Mr. Kuchno about setting up a meeting to respond to Open Range. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A319 (\u201cWhy wait until Wednesday? They seem to be concerned about getting paid now. I get there are issues, but can\u2019t we get to the bottom of it sooner?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">On March 11, 2011, Open Range sent a Weekly Status Report to RUS that indicated, among other things, that Open Range\u2019s arrearages to its vendors represented a risk to deploying the broadband network. Included in the status report was a list of monies owed to Open Range in order to pay vendor contracts. With regard to G4S, the report listed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-14\">[G4S]: [$]2,600,000 [G4S] Contract C-9\u2014 $200k needs to be drawn down from the current contract. However, the contract needs to be amended to increase the value by approximately $250K to cover site acquisition pass through expenses. However, there may be more required on this contract once site acquisition is completed for various sites on this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A170.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">f. April 29, 2011 Loan Amendment, Equity Commitment Letter, and Shareholder Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">On April 29, 2011, RUS and Open Range executed an amendment to the Loan Agreement (\u201cLoan Amendment\u201d) in which they agreed to reduce the loan amount from $269,298,000 to $180,000,000 to reflect a network size of only 160 markets, rather than the original 540 markets. As a condition precedent to advancing additional funds, the Loan Amendment required receipt of a letter from OEP to Open Range in which OEP committed to provide up to an additional $40,000,000 of equity capital. <em>See </em>Compl. Ex. B at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">Also on April 29, 2011, Open Range Holding Company (the shareholder of Open Range) and OEP executed an \u201cEquity Commitment Letter.\u201d This letter obligated OEP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>to provide up to $40,000,000 in additional capital to Open Range Holding, which would be used to fund Open Range\u2019s operating expenses. The Equity Commitment Letter was conditioned, however, on RUS\u2019s agreement to fund certain advances listed in attached Schedules B-l and B-2. Schedule B-1 listed multiple contracts with outstanding amounts owed to G4S totaling $2,772,536. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A190.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Also on April 29, 2011, Open Range Holding and RUS entered into a \u201cShareholder Agreement.\u201d This agreement provided, among other things, that \u201c[s]ubject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter ... [OEP Holdings] shall from time to time purchase equity in the Borrower [Open Range] in an amount equal to $40,000,000 in the aggregate, at such times and in such amounts such that the Borrower would always have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet sufficient to fund the following six weeks of operating expenses as reasonably determined by the Company.\u201d <em>See </em>2d. Am. Compl. Ex. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">After the Loan Amendment, Equity Commitment Letter, and Shareholder Agreement were executed, RUS funded the advances listed in Schedules B-l and B-2. It is undisputed that G4S received the $2.7 million identified on Schedule B-l. However, an audit report prepared by a consultant to Open Range in September 2011 indicates that Open Range had not closed out its contracts with vendors, and that additional amounts were owed to G4S and other vendors at that time. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Suppl. Resp. App. at A332.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Open Range filed for bankruptcy on October 6, 2011. <em>See In re Open Range Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>Bk. No. 11-13188, 2013 WL 542471, at *1 (Bankr.D.Del. Feb. 12, 2013). On that date, Open Range held, among other assets, a deposit account with a balance of $4.9 million. <em>Id. </em>The $4.9 million in funds were subsequently moved to an escrow account. Veloeitel, Inc., another Open Range vendor, filed an adversary proceeding against the appointed trustee and the United States seeking a declaration regarding its rights to the escrow account. The trustee filed an answer and a third party complaint seeking a declaration that the escrow account was property of the estate. As a result, other parties, including G4S, were added as third-party defendants. G4S, in turn, filed an answer, counterclaims, and cross-claims against various parties, including RUS. Although most of the parties reached a settlement resolving most of the disputes, the settlement did not resolve the causes of action or claims that G4S had asserted against RUS and the trustee, among others. The Bankruptcy Court ultimately dismissed G4S\u2019s cross-claims. <em>Id. </em>at *5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\"><em>g. </em>Procedural history</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Plaintiff filed its initial complaint on January 3, 2012, and an amended complaint on January 24, 2012. The Government moved to dismiss on March 5, 2012. Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, which was deemed filed on May 31, 2012. The government moved to dismiss the second amended complaint under RCFC 12(b)(1) and RCFC 12(b)(6) on June 14, 2012. On October 15, 2012, the court stayed consideration of the government\u2019s motion, and ordered discovery on the limited issue of whether G4S could establish a contractual right to recovery against the United States. On January 24, 2013, prior to the close of discovery, the government moved for judgment on the pleadings, or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, a stay of discovery, and expedited consideration of motion to stay discovery. The court denied the government\u2019s request for a stay of discovery on February 1, 2013. The parties completed discovery on or about July 2, 2013. Supplemental briefing on the government\u2019s outstanding motions was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>pleted on September 6, 2013, and oral argument was heard on January 14, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">As noted above, the government has moved to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) on the grounds that G4S cannot establish a contractual relationship with the United States and thus this court cannot hear its case. Plaintiff, as also noted above, argues that this court has jurisdiction because it is an intended third-party beneficiary to the Loan Agreement. As a general rule, the Tucker Act does not provide the court with jurisdiction to hear a claim brought directly against the federal government by a subcontractor. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a) (2012); <em>United, States v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 1541, 1550 (Fed.Cir.1983). An exception exists, however, which allows an intended third-party beneficiary of a government contract to enforce its rights directly against the federal government. <em>See JGB Enters., Inc. v. United States, </em>497 F.3d 1259, 1261 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">It is well established that when the facts that convey subject-matter jurisdiction are intertwined with those that determine the merits, the court may deny the 12(b)(1) motion and elect to resolve the jurisdictional issues on either a motion for summary judgment or, after a hearing, on the merits. <em>See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., </em>419 U.S. 186, 203 n. 19, 95 S.Ct. 392, 42 L.Ed.2d 378 (1974); <em>Land v. Dollar, </em>330 U.S. 731, 739, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947); <em>Moden v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1335, 1340-42 (Fed. Cir.2005); <em>Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>978 F.2d 679, 689 (Fed.Cir.1992) (nonfrivolous claim within jurisdiction sufficient to withstand motion to dismiss). Moreover, when the court considers\u2014and does not exclude\u2014materials outside of the pleadings, dismissal under RCFC 12(b)(6) or 12(c) is not appropriate. <em>See Briseno v. United States, </em>83 Fed.Cl. 630, 634 (2008). Rather, such a motion must be converted into one for summary judgment under RCFC 56(c). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Here, G4S\u2019s contention that it was an intended third-party beneficiary of the Loan Agreement between RUS and Open Range goes to the heart of both the court\u2019s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and the merits of plaintiffs claim, rendering resolution of the dispute under RCFC 12(b)(1) inappropriate. The court finds that G4S has made a nonfrivolous claim regarding its potential status as a third-party beneficiary. Therefore, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is DENIED. The court will thus proceed to consider the matter on summary judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">a. Standard of review for Rule 56 motions for summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d RCFC 56(a). The court\u2019s task is to determine whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact for trial, and not \u201cto weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter____\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). As it does for all Rule 56 motions, the court views the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing reasonable inferences in its favor. <em>See Schooner Harbor Ventures, Inc. v. United States, </em>569 F.3d 1359, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2009); <em>Galvin v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>488 F.3d 1026, 1031 (D.C.Cir.2007). If the court finds that a rational trier of fact could not find for the nonmoving party, then there is no genuine issue for trial and the movant is entitled to summary judgment. <em>Ricci v. DeStefano, </em>557 U.S. 557, 586, 129 S.Ct. 2658, 174 L.Ed.2d 490 (2009) (quoting <em>Matsushita Elec. Industr. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). Whether G4S was an intended third-party beneficiary under the Loan Agreement between RUS and Open Range is appropriate for resolution on summary judgment. <em>See Flexfab, L.L.C. v. United States, </em>424 F.3d 1254, 1259, 1265 (Fed.Cir.2005) (affirming summary judgment where plaintiff did not present evidence sufficient to raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>genuine question as to status as intended third-party beneficiary).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">b. Positions of the parties</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Plaintiff contends that the Loan Agreement between RUS and Open Range demonstrated their intent to directly benefit Open Range\u2019s vendors by compensating them for work performed in constructing the broadband network. Plaintiff argues that intent can be inferred from the following facts: (1) the stated purpose of the Loan Agreement, which was to finance RUS-approved construction, could only be effectuated by using loan proceeds to pay vendors; (2) Open Range\u2019s submission\u2014and RUS\u2019s approval\u2014 of build-out plans every six months that unambiguously indicated that third-party vendors would perform construction work; (3) RUS\u2019s review, editing, and approval of the MSA between Open Range and G4S; (4) RUS\u2019s review of vendor invoices as part of the loan advance process; (5) RUS\u2019s requirement that Open Range establish a pledged deposit account from which funds could only be withdrawn as agreed to by RUS; (6) RUS\u2019s and Open Range\u2019s communication about the vendors\u2019 progress and concerns in constructing the broadband network, including that some vendors had threatened to stop work if they were not paid; (7) Schedules B-1 and B-2 of the Equity Commitment Letter, which obligated RUS to advance specific funds to pay for specific vendor work performed under specific vendor contracts; and (8) RUS\u2019s audits of the deposit account to ensure that loan funds were disbursed according to RUS\u2019s intent and the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In response, the government argues that these facts are not sufficient to show that RUS intended to confer a benefit directly on G4S, such that G4S is entitled to sue the United States for payment. According to the government, the only \u201cintended beneficiaries\u201d of the Loan Agreement were the residents of the rural communities within RUS-approved markets. Because RUS never committed to pay\u2014and never in fact paid\u2014any of Open Range\u2019s vendors directly, the government views G4S as only an \u201cincidental beneficiary\u201d of the Loan Agreement. The government asserts that G4S\u2019s status as an incidental beneficiary is unaffected by RUS\u2019s review of vendor progress reports and payment requests or its knowledge that Open Range would use the loan advances in order to pay its vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">c. The legal standard for third-party beneficiary status</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Traditionally, a third party could not sue on a contract to which it was not a party. <em>See </em>13 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 37:1 (4th ed.2013). Over time, however, courts began to recognize a limited exception in instances \u201cwhen a promisor agrees with a promisee to render a performance to a third party instead of to the promisee____\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302 (1981).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it remains the general rule that a subcontractor that agrees to supply materials or labor to a general contractor is only an incidental beneficiary of any contract between the general contractor and its ultimate client. <em>See </em>9 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 45.3 (rev. ed. 2007); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302 cmt. e., illus. 19; <em>accord BIS Computer Solutions, Inc. v. City of Richmond, </em>122 Fed.Appx. 608, 610, 612 (4th Cir.2005) (finding subcontractor was not an intended third-party beneficiary under Virginia law despite being named in prime contract and contract provision prohibiting subcontractor\u2019s removal without the government\u2019s approval). Thus, this narrow exception applies only when the contracting parties demonstrate their intent to confer a direct benefit on a third party. <em>See </em>Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ment (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 302, 304. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">B promises A to pay whatever debts A may incur in a certain undertaking. A incurs in the undertaking debts to C, D and E. If the promise is interpreted as a promise that B will pay C, D and E, they are intended beneficiaries ... [but] if the money is to be paid to A in order that he may be provided with money to pay C, D and E, they are at most incidental beneficiaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 302, cmt. b, illus. 3.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In applying these general principles, the court\u2019s task is to distinguish between prime contracts that create \u201cintended beneficiaries,\u201d which establish a duty in the government to the third-party vendor, and contracts that merely create \u201cincidental beneficiaries,\u201d which do not establish any such obligation. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 304. In conducting this analysis, the court looks first to the language of the prime contract, and then to other objective evidence. <em>See Flexfab, </em>424 F.3d at 1262. Although the express naming of a third party \u201cgreatly facilitates a determination that the promisor and promisee intended to confer enforceable rights on the named party,\u201d 9 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 44.8, the prime contract\u2019s express identification of a subcontractor is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate the requisite intent, <em>see Flexfab, </em>424 F.3d at 1260; 9 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 44.8; Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 308 cmt. a; <em>see also Montana v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1269, 1273 (Fed.Cir.1997) (plaintiff must \u201cfall within a class clearly intended to be benefited thereby\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Where a subcontractor seeks recognition as an intended beneficiary of a federal contract, it is possible to infer the requisite intent on the part of the government \u201cfrom the actions of the contracting officer and circumstances providing the contracting officer with appropi\u2019iate notice that the contract provision at issue was intended to benefit the third party.\u201d <em>Flexfab, </em>424 F.3d at 1262. Notwithstanding this theoretical possibility, it is extremely difficult to establish status as an intended third-party beneficiary by inference in the context of a government contract. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1263-65 (declining to infer contracting officer\u2019s knowledge or intent based on actions of other contracting personnel); <em>US Ecology, Inc. v. United States, </em>245 F.3d 1352, 1356 (Fed.Cir.2001) (holding government\u2019s cooperation with third-party insufficient to establish third-party beneficiary status); O. <em>Ahlborg &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>74 Fed.Cl. 178, 189-90 (2006) (holding government\u2019s involvement in negotiating subcontracts and program oversight insufficient to establish contractual privity with subcontractor); <em>JGB Enters., Inc. v. United States, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 319, 334 (2004) (declining to infer contracting officer\u2019s knowledge or intent based on actions of other contracting personnel). Indeed, because waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly, the right to sue the government on a contract to which one is not a party constitutes an \u201cexceptional privilege.\u201d <em>Glass v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1349, 1354 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quoting <em>German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Home Water Supply Co., </em>226 U.S. 220, 230, 33 S.Ct. 32, 57 L.Ed. 195 (1912)). The standards to be applied in this circuit for determining whether a subcontractor can claim status as an intended third-party beneficiary are laid out in the following cases: <em>D &amp; H Distrib. Co. v. United States, </em>102 F.3d 542 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Flexfab, </em>424 F.3d 1254; and <em>JGB, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 319, <em>aff'd, </em>497 F.3d 1259 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">In <em>D &amp; H, </em>a prime contractor (\u201cCIM\u201d) failed to pay the plaintiff (\u201cD &amp; H\u201d), its subcontractor, for materials plaintiff had furnished to the National Security Agency (\u201cNSA\u201d) on CIM\u2019s behalf. <em>See D &amp; H, </em>102 F.3d at 544. Although initially reluctant to subcontract to CIM, D &amp; H agreed after the NSA amended the prime contract to assign payment to CIM and D &amp; H jointly. Notwithstanding this modification, after D &amp; H rendered performance the NSA issued a check in CIM\u2019s name only. CIM later be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>came insolvent, having failed to fully compensate D &amp; H. The Federal Circuit concluded that D &amp; H enjoyed the status of a third-party beneficiary. The circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">The entire purpose of the <em>joint payment clause </em>was to provide protection for D &amp; H by giving it a right to control the disbursement of the contract proceeds and thereby to ensure that its invoice to CIM would be paid. The rights conferred on D &amp; H were designed to effectuate the payment of CIM\u2019s debt to D &amp; H, which would arise upon CIM\u2019s execution of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>D &amp; H, </em>102 F.3d at 547 (emphasis added). Thus, the court adopted a rule that a subcontractor is entitled to enforce a contract where the subcontractor is made a joint-payee of the prime contract. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In <em>Flexfab, </em>the Federal Circuit again addressed the right of a subcontractor to sue the federal government directly after a prime contractor failed to pay the subcontractor. In that case, the Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Columbus (\u201cDSCC\u201d) awarded a contract to Capital City to supply various materials to the Defense Department. <em>Flexfab, </em>424 F.3d at 1257. Despite initial reluctance, Flexfab eventually agreed to subcontract to Capital City after various DSCC officials promised to amend the prime contract to provide for direct payment to Flexfab\u2019s escrow account. <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding this agreement, payment was rendered to Capital City, which subsequently became insolvent without having satisfied its debts Flexfab. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. Flexfab brought suit against the federal government alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Flexfab was an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Federal Circuit concluded that Flexfab had failed to show that the relevant DSCC contracting officer intended to convey a benefit on Flexfab, and thus denied recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (\u201cThough ... the modification of a remittance clause to give a subcontractor control over payments from the government qualifies the subcontractor as an intended third-party beneficiary, that rule of law is subject to the principle that only those with authority to contract on the government\u2019s behalf can exhibit the necessary intent to give the subcontractor such control.\u201d). The court thus made clear that the government\u2019s ratification of a contract provision that expressly provides for direct payment to a subcontractor remains unenforceable by the subcontractor, absent evidence of such intent of an authorized government official. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\"><em>JGB </em>involved non-payment by the same prime contractor in Flexfab, but a different subcontractor (\u201cJGB\u201d). <em>JGB, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 319 (2004). Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Flexfab, </em>however, JGB directly contacted the DSCC contracting officer in order to obtain assistance concerning Capital City\u2019s arrearages. <em>Id. </em>at 323. Following a series of communications between JGB and DSCC officials, JGB threatened to cease performance unless the situation was addressed. The DSCC contracting officer subsequently threatened Capital City with debarment if the situation was not resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 324. Ultimately, the DSCC contracting officer agreed to amend the prime contract to allow for direct payment to an escrow account designated by the prime contractor, which in actuality was JGB\u2019s bank. <em>See JGB, </em>497 F.3d at 1260. Notwithstanding this agreement, the government mailed payment to Capital City. <em>JGB, </em>63 Fed.Cl. at 329. Moreover, the payment reflected a deduction due to monies owed by Capital City on an unrelated contract with the government. <em>Id. </em>Capital City became insolvent without having satisfied its debt to JGB. Despite the fact that JGB was not listed by name as a joint-payee, the court concluded that because the DSCC contracting officer understood that the purpose of amending the payment procedure was to set aside monies for JGB, JGB became an intended third-party beneficiary of Capital City\u2019s contract with the government. <em>Id. </em>at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">d. Tested by the aforementioned standards, plaintiff cannot show that G4S was an intended third-party beneficiary</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The court gleans from these cases that in order for a subcontractor to obtain the status of an intended third-party beneficiary, it must provide <em>clear </em>evidence that an authorized government official approved a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>contract provision for the <em>express </em>purpose of effectuating payment from the government to the subcontractor(s). This showing can be satisfied by the unambiguous language of the prime contract and any modifications made thereto, and by other objective evidence that clearly demonstrates the authorized official\u2019s unambiguous intent to ensure payment to the subcontraetor(s). The court will not, however, infer that the government intended to directly benefit the subcontractor merely because an authorized government official (1) oversees the activities of the prime contractor; (2) becomes aware that the prime contractor has failed to timely pay its subcontractors, and/or (3) makes funds available to the prime contractor in order for the prime contractor to pay its subcontractors. Applied to this case, plaintiff has failed to identify any evidence\u2014much less clear evidence\u2014that Mr. Kuchno or Mr. Adelstein approved a contract provision for the express purpose of ensuring that a portion of the loan advances would go directly to Open Range\u2019s vendors, including G4S.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">To begin, nothing in the plain language of the Loan Agreement indicates that RUS intended to assume any obligation to ensure that Open Range\u2019s vendors received, directly or jointly with Open Range, any payment from RUS. Rather, the Loan Agreement explains how, and for what purpose, RUS would disburse funds to Open Range\u2019s deposit account. Similarly, plaintiff has not identified any provision of the Loan Amendment, Equity Commitment Letter (including Schedule B-l), or Shareholder Agreement in which RUS unambiguously agreed to modify the loan advance process for the express purpose of effectuating payment directly to Open Range\u2019s vendors. Notably, none of these agreements gave Open Range\u2019s vendors control over the pledged deposit account, required RUS to advance any portion of the loan proceeds directly to any of Open Range\u2019s vendors, or required RUS to advance a portion of the loan proceeds to an escrow-account controlled by any of Open Range\u2019s vendors. At most, these agreements provided RUS with additional notice of Open Range\u2019s outstanding obligations to its vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Even granting plaintiff the inference that authorized RUS officials were concerned that Open Range\u2019s vendors might stop working if arrearages weren\u2019t addressed, the record is devoid of evidence that an authorized RUS official intended to do anything but pay Open Range so that Open Range had sufficient funds to carry out its plan of constructing a rural broadband network. RUS\u2019s close oversight of Open Range, awareness of Open Range\u2019s arrearages, and willingness to advance loan funds to Open Range, taken individually or in combination, are insufficient to demonstrate that RUS approved the Loan Amendment for the express purpose of directly or jointly paying Open Range\u2019s vendors. In this connection, plaintiffs contention that G4S is similarly situated to the plaintiff in <em>JGB </em>rings hollow. Unlike Mr. Adelstein and Mr. Kuchno, the contracting officer in <em>JGB </em>took specific actions to modify the prime contract\u2019s payment mechanism for the express purpose of ensuring that JGB received payment from the government.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See JGB, </em>497 F.3d at 1260-61. Thus, in contrast to JGB, G4S fits squarely within the category of indirect beneficiaries identified in Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 302, cmt. b., illus. 3 (if money is paid to the prime contractor in order to ensure the prime contractor has money to pay subcontractors, the subcontractors are at most incidental beneficiaries). As such, plaintiff has failed to establish that G4S was an intended third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>beneficiary of the agreements between RUS and Open Range.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">For the court to hold otherwise would transform the \u201cexceptional privilege\u201d of status as an intended third-party beneficiary into a broad right of subcontractors to sue the federal government in any case where the contracting officer closely oversees the prime contractor\u2019s work with its subcontractors, or whenever an agency pays a prime contractor with the knowledge that some of that payment would be used to compensate subcontractors. Such an expansion of an otherwise narrow exception to the requirement that a plaintiff be in privity with the government would undermine the traditional relationship between contracting officers and prime contractors, as well as between prime contractors and their subcontractors. Therefore, without clear evidence that an authorized government official approved a contract provision for the express purpose of effectuating payment from the government to the vendor, subcontractors remain merely ineidental beneficiaries. Because G4S has failed to make this showing, the court is compelled to GRANT the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Based on the foregoing discussion, the court concludes that G4S has failed to establish a genuine dispute as to whether G4S was a third-party beneficiary of the Loan Agreement between RUS and Open Range. Therefore, the Government\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly. Each party to bear its own costs. IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">. G4S was known as \u201cAdesta LLC\u201d prior to its name change, effective February 23, 2011.

Following limited discovery on whether plaintiff could demonstrate an implied-in-fact contract with the government or G4S\u2019s status as a third-party beneficiary, plaintiff abandoned its implied-in-fact contract theory. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resp. at 1 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-18\">.

App. at A231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">. Ultimately, RUS and Open Range did not consistently comply with the Loan Agreement\u2019s requirement that Open Range seek reimbursement after financing the small-scale construction projects.

Plaintiff has not identified\u2014and the court is unaware of\u2014any RUS officials other than Mr. Adelstein and Mr. Kuchno whose intent to benefit Open Range\u2019s vendors would be relevant to resolving the government\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. <em>See Flexfab, </em>424 F.3d at 1262 (\"only those with authority to contract on the government\u2019s behalf can exhibit the necessary intent\u201d to benefit a third party to establish third-party beneficiary rights).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\">.

Plaintiff has not filed an affidavit or declaration explaining with precision how additional discovery would aid its response to the government's motion for summary judgment. Because such an affidavit or declaration is required for a party to avail itself of the shelter provided by RCFC 56(d), the court DENIES plaintiff's request to postpone ruling on the government\u2019s summary judgment motion to allow for additional discovery. <em>See Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Moreover, because the court has already assumed the facts that G4S asserts (i.e., that RUS helped draft the MSA, supervised construction, and knew that payments to Open Range would be used to reimburse vendors), additional discovery to confirm those facts is unwarranted. <em>Id. </em>The government's close oversight of the prime contractor\u2014including oversight of the prime's relationships with its subcontractors\u2014is simply insufficient confer status as an intended third-party beneficiary on a subcontractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\">.
