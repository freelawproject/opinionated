Mr. Topsnik is a nonresident alien as to the United States, with a residence in Germany, who owned stock in a company located in California. That stock was redeemed by the company in 2004, with part of the redemption price paid in monthly installments. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) levied upon these installment payments to collect most of the taxes in dispute. At this juncture, a salient issue is a procedural matter, <em>i.e., </em>whether this court is the proper forum for plaintiffs refund claims, or, indeed, whether any forum is available. Related actions are pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the United States Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-4\">Because of the earlier pendency of litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, an issue had arisen respecting the application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That statute bars jurisdiction in this court of a claim by a plaintiff who has pending in any other court a suit against or in respect of the United States concerning the same operative facts. This case was stayed at the behest of the parties to await resolution of a comparable jurisdictional issue in <em>Brandt v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1369 (Fed.Cir.2013).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Brandt, </em>the Federal Circuit decided that Section 1500 did not bar an action filed in this court after a related action had been dismissed by a district court but before the time for appeal of that dismissal had run. 710 F.3d at 1379. The court of appeals held that this court\u2019s jurisdiction was not ousted by a subsequently filed appeal in the related ease because there was a \u201cperiod of time when [the] case was not, as the statute requires, \u2018pending in any other court,\u2019\u201d and an action filed in that interim was jurisdictionally proper. <em>Id. </em>The Federal Circuit denied rehearing and rehearing en banc in <em>Brandt, </em>and the government has advised that it will not file a petition for certiorari in that case. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Notice of Decision and Mot. to Continue Stay (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.\u201d), ECF No. 44. Nonetheless, the government has moved to continue the stay of this action pending the outcome of appellate proceedings in the related case pending in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b14-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b14-13\">At issue are payments of tax for the years 1992, 1993, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 19-22, Attach, at 23.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Topsnik had paid some taxes for the years 1992,1993, and 1999, Compl. \u00b66, but the IRS on February 13, 2004, issued a Notice of Tax Lien for additional taxes totaling $110,003.31, allegedly due for the 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1999 tax years. Compl. Attach, at 11. Other liens and levies were filed, and litigation in the Tax Court ensued regarding the IRS\u2019s collection activities, without fully resolving the disputed issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, on February 16, 2010, a further notice of levy was issued by the IRS, adding amounts allegedly due for 2000 and 2001 and adjusting the total sought to $257,224.97. Compl. Attach, at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-14\">On August 23, 2011, Mr. Topsnik filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>damages respecting the IRS\u2019s collection activities and a refund of taxes paid. Compl., <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 2:11-ev-6958-JHN-MRW (C.D. Cal. filed Aug. 23, 2011). Mr. Topsnik alleged that he was a non-resident alien who resided in Germany. <em>Id. </em>\u00b62. The government filed a motion to dismiss, among other things contending that venue with respect to both the damages and refund claims lay in the judicial district where Mr. Topsnik resided and that, because Mr. Topsnik resided outside the United States, venue lay with the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>Order Granting Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss, <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 2:11-ev-06958-JHN-MRW (C.D.Cal.Jan. 17, 2012).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court ruled that venue was improper, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(a)(1), and granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice to Mr. Topsnik\u2019s refiling suit in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Topsnik\u2019s motion to amend the district court\u2019s order of dismissal to provide for transfer to this court was unsuccessful. <em>See </em>Order Denying Pl.\u2019s Mot. to Amend Judgment, <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 2:11-ev-06958-JHN-MRW (C.D.Cal. Apr. 2,2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">Mr. Topsnik filed the instant suit in this court on January 30, 2012, and subsequently, on March 16, 2012, filed an appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal, which appeal remains pending in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. <em>See </em>Answering Brief for the United States, <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 12-55533 (9th Cir. Feb. 4, 2013), submitted by notice in the instant ease, ECF No. 41.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">STANDARD FOR DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u201c[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.\u201d <em>Landis v. North Am. Co., </em>299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 S.Ct. 163, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936). \u201cWhen and how to stay proceedings is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1413, 1416 (Fed.Cir.1997). This discretion, however, is not unbounded. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hendler v. United States, </em>952 F.2d 1364, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1991)). A stay that is \u2018\u201cimmoderate or indefinite\u2019 may be an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Landis, </em>299 U.S. at 257, 57 S.Ct. 163 (\u201cThe stay is immoderate and hence unlawful unless so framed in its inception that its force will be spent within reasonable limits, so far at least as they are susceptible of prevision and description.\u201d)); <em>see also Landis, </em>299 U.S. at 255, 57 S.Ct. 163 (\u201c[A] stay of indefinite duration in the absence of a pressing need\u201d may constitute an abuse of discretion.). Ultimately, a court must exercise its own judgment to \u201cweigh competing interests and maintain an even balance\u201d among those fulfilled by a stay and those frustrated by such action. <em>Cherokee Nation, </em>124 F.3d at 1416 (quoting <em>Landis, </em>299 U.S. at 255, 57 S.Ct. 163). As the Federal Circuit has said, \u201c[o]verarehing this balancing is the court\u2019s paramount obligation to exercise jurisdiction timely in cases properly before it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-12\">\u201cThe proponent of a stay bears the burden of establishing its need.\u201d <em>Clinton v. Jones, </em>520 U.S. 681, 708, 117 S.Ct. 1636, 137 L.Ed.2d 945 (1997). To justify suspending the regular course of litigation, the propo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>nent \u201cmust make out a clear ease of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to someone else.\u201d <em>Landis, </em>299 U.S. at 255, 57 S.Ct. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">The government seeks a continuation of the stay until resolution by the Ninth Circuit of the appeal by Mr. Topsnik currently pending before that court. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 2. The government argues that this result would be consistent with the \u201cfirst-filed rule,\u201d which should be applied \u201cin a manner serving sound judicial administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Orthmann v. Apple River Campground, Inc., </em>765 F.2d 119, 121 (8th Cir.1985)). The government suggests that the issues pending before the Ninth Circuit and this court are similar and that resolution of the appeal by the Ninth Circuit would serve judicial economy. <em>Id. </em>at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">Earlier, in opposing defendant\u2019s motion to continue the stay because of the <em>Brandt </em>proceedings, Mr. Topsnik emphasized that the district court had failed to invoke the transfer provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) relating to transfer to cure an improper venue. He argued that \u201c[pjlaintiffs offer ... of transfer to a forum of [djefendant\u2019s choosing [, <em>i.e., </em>the Court of Federal Claims] has been met with silence.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. to Continue the Stay at 2, ECF No. 38. He objected to continuation of the stay because of the government\u2019s arguably inconsistent positions on jurisdiction and whether the instant ease should proceed. <em>Id. </em>Now that <em>Brandt </em>is settled law in the Federal Circuit, and the jurisdictional cloud attributable to Section 1500 has been cleared, Mr. Topsnik has advised that a venue ruling by the Ninth Circuit would be beneficial. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Def.\u2019s Mot. to Continue the Stay at 1, ECF No. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-13\">No venue issue is before this court. Indeed, nothing this court might do, either to continue the stay or to lift it, would or could affect the venue issue now before the Ninth Circuit. Instead, the question presented to this court is whether this litigation should be held in abeyance to await a purely procedural ruling by the Ninth Circuit on venue when this court unquestionably has subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Topsnik\u2019s refund claim and can proceed to address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-14\">Because this litigation concerns income taxes paid as far back as the 1992 and 1993 tax years, over twenty years in the past, time is a strong consideration favoring lifting the stay. A countervailing factor rests in the fact that this court .can only address Mr. Topsnik\u2019s refund claims, not also his claims for civil damages for improper lien and collection actions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7432 and 7433.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This latter consideration is weakened, however, by the government\u2019s position that Mr. Topsnik\u2019s damages claims are merely refund claims in disguise. The District Court for the Central District of California did not address the proper venue for Mr. Topsnik\u2019s claims under Sections 7432 and 7433. The district court\u2019s order dismissing Mr. Topsnik\u2019s claims relied solely on the interaction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402. <em>See </em>Order Granting Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 2, <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 2:11-ev-06958-JHN-MRW.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That focus was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>understandable because Mr. Topsnik\u2019s complaint and amended complaint in the district court made no allegation of specific economic losses or other damages attributable to the IRS\u2019s collection activities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">Factually, this case bears at least a few similarities to those arising in <em>Cherokee Nation. </em>There also, a stay was issued because a related quiet-title action was pending in another court and the stay-issuing court considered that its order would avoid duplicative litigation and conserve judicial resources. <em>Cherokee Nation, </em>124 F.3d at 1416. The court of appeals reversed, however, concluding that these concerns fell short of \u201cthe \u2018pressing need\u2019 required when a trial court seeks to suspend its proceedings indefinitely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1416-17. The court considered that obtaining a result in the quiet-title proceedings was not essential to the resolution of the claims pending before the stay-issuing court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">In this instance, the stay sought is not quite indefinite, depending instead upon the timing of a ruling by the Ninth Circuit. Nonetheless, the government has taken, and continues to take, the position that a ruling by the Ninth Circuit would be of limited value. It argued to the Ninth Circuit that \u201cthe actual relief being sought by taxpayer is a refund of taxes that he alleges were erroneously or illegally collected, and the proper forum for a refund suit by a nonresident taxpayer is the United States Court of Federal Claims.\u201d Answering Brief for the United States at 47, <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 12-55533 (9th Cir. Feb. 4, 2013). This contention is inconsistent with continuation of the stay. Indeed, lifting the stay would advance this position taken by the government before the Ninth Circuit and potentially lead to an earlier resolution of this tax dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-11\">No pressing or evident need arises to delay further this proceeding over income taxes for years dating back to 1992. Continuation of the stay has not been justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b17-13\">The government\u2019s motion for continuation of the stay previously entered is DENIED, and the stay is LIFTED. To date, the government has not filed an answer in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Its answer shall be due on or before February 4, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-14\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b14-5\">.

The Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over damages actions.\u201d Answering Brief for the United States, <em>Topsnik v. United States, </em>No. 12-55533, at 22 (9th Cir.
