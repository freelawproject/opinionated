In its initial complaint, plaintiff contended that the contracting officer improperly awarded the contract to another bidder despite her beliefs that the awardee\u2019s bid was nonresponsive and that the awardee was not responsible. After plaintiff filed its protest, the government terminated the awardee\u2019s contract for its convenience and cancelled the procurement. Arguing that plaintiff\u2019s protest is now moot, defendant moves to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiff opposes the dismissal of its complaint, asserting that the cancellation of the procurement did not divest the court of jurisdiction. Plaintiff also moves for leave to amend its complaint to challenge the government\u2019s cancellation decision. For the reasons set forth below, the court will permit plaintiff to amend its complaint, but dismisses as moot plaintiffs claim that the contracting officer improperly awarded the contract to another bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b139-19\">On March 29, 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an invitation for bids (\u201cIFB\u201d) to remediate the soil on as many as 2,600 residential properties in Omaha, Nebraska.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The EPA contemplated awarding a fixed-price, indefinite-quantity contract to the lowest bidder who was deemed to be responsible and who submitted a responsive bid. The base period of the contract was to be one year, followed by three one-year option periods. Bidders were required to submit, among other materials, resumes for key personnel that reflected the specific experience identified in the IFB. The EPA emphasized the importance of the experience and qualifications of key personnel, and declared that a bid that did not identify key personnel who had the requisite experience and qualifications would be deemed to be nonresponsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-20\">At least two companies submitted bids: plaintiff and PK Management Group, Inc. (\u201cPK\u201d). PK was the low bidder, with a total bid price of $23,897,255. Plaintiff, with a total bid price of [...], was the next lowest bidder. Upon reviewing PK\u2019s bid, however, the contracting officer concluded that PK did not meet the IFB\u2019s requirements because it lacked relevant experience, its subcontractors lacked relevant experience, and the resumes of its key personnel did not reflect the required experience. The contracting officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>therefore found that PK was not a responsible bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Because the contract was set aside for a small business, the contracting officer was required to refer the issue of PK\u2019s responsibility to the United States Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) for evaluation in the SBA\u2019s Certificate of Competency program. In the referral, the contracting officer did not address whether PK submitted a responsive bid. On June 22, 2012, the SBA issued a Certificate of Competency to PK and notified the EPA that it considered PK to be a responsible bidder. The SBA advised the EPA that the EPA was required to award the contract to PK. The contracting officer disagreed with the SBA\u2019s responsibility determination, and filed an appeal with the SBA. The contracting officer once again did not address whether PK submitted a responsive bid. The SBA denied the appeal, leading the contracting officer to award the contract to PK in September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Shortly thereafter, plaintiff protested the EPA\u2019s award decision at the Government Accountability Office (\u201cGAO\u201d), arguing that PK\u2019s bid was nonresponsive due to the nonconforming key personnel resumes and that the SBA was not legally permitted to make a responsibility determination if a bidder submitted a nonresponsive bid. PK\u2019s performance of the contract was stayed during the pendency of the GAO protest. The GAO ultimately denied the protest on January 14, 2013. Two weeks later, on January 29, 2013, plaintiff filed the instant protest, setting forth two counts in its complaint: (1) the EPA\u2019s award of the contract to a bidder with a nonresponsive bid was arbitrary and capricious and (2) the SBA\u2019s determination that PK was a responsible bidder in the absence of any finding that PK submitted a responsive bid was arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiff sought the following relief: (1) an injunction forbidding further performance of the</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">contract; (2) a declaration that the contract awarded to PK was null and void; (3) termination of the contract; (4) an injunction requiring the contract be awarded to plaintiff as the next lowest bidder; (5) attorney\u2019s fees and costs; and (6) any other relief deemed just and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">During a January 30, 2013 status conference, defendant represented that the EPA would agree to stay PK\u2019s performance of the contract pending an expedited ruling from the court on the merits of plaintiffs protest. Pursuant to the expedited briefing schedule, plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record on February 22, 2013. Then, on March 5, 2013, three days before its response and cross-motion were due, defendant filed a notice with the court indicating that the EPA intended to terminate its contract with PK for its convenience and conclude the procurement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant further noted that the EPA would then reassess its needs for the soil remediation work that was the subject of the procurement. Based on these representations, defendant stated that it intended to move to dismiss the protest as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The EPA terminated its contract with PK on March 11, 2013. That same day, defendant moved to dismiss this protest as moot pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d). Plaintiff opposed the motion. On July 9, 2013, after briefing had concluded, defendant filed another notice with the court indicating that because federal government sequestration had decimated the EPA\u2019s budget and forced it to furlough its employees, the EPA decided to satisfy its remediation needs through existing contracts. As a result, defendant stated, the EPA would change the scope of the work that was the subject of the procurement at issue in this protest from remediation to the seeming of property access agreements. The new con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>tract, worth $800,000, would be set aside for a small business.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Upon receiving defendant\u2019s notice, the court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing what effect, if any, the information contained in the notice had on the positions they advanced in them briefing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Rather than filing a supplemental brief, defendant filed a renewed motion to dismiss. Shortly after the conclusion of briefing on the renewed motion to dismiss, proceedings in the protest were stayed for twenty-three days at defendant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, pursuant to a schedule proposed by the parties, plaintiff moved for leave to file an amended complaint on November 4, 2013. The parties have completed briefing on plaintiffs motion, and, finding oral argument unnecessary, the court is prepared to rale.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">A. Defendant\u2019s Motions to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">As previously noted, defendant has filed both a motion to dismiss and a renewed motion to dismiss, arguing in both that plaintiffs protest has been mooted by the EPA\u2019s cancellation of the procurement that was the subject of the protest. In both motions, defendant seeks dismissal of plaintiffs complaint pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\u201c[A] ease is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). When a case is moot, there are no justiciable issues upon which the court can render a decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968); <em>see also Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1176 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (panel portion) (noting that justiciability \u201cencompasses a number of doctrines under which courts will decline to hear and decide a cause,\u201d including the \u201cdoctrines of standing, mootness, ripeness, and political question\u201d). The court\u2019s inquiry into the justiciability of a case is distinct from its inquiry into whether it has jurisdiction over the case\u2019s subject matter. <em>Powell, </em>395 U.S. at 512, 89 S.Ct. 1944; <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 198, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962); <em>Prasco, LLC v. Medicis Pharm. Corp.,531 </em>F.3d 1329, 1335 n.3 (Fed.Cir.2008); <em>Murphy v. United States, </em>993 F.2d 871, 872 (Fed.Cir. 1993). In other words, the court may find that it possesses jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case but that the dispute is nevertheless nonjusticiable. Thus, while mootness is jurisdictional in that it involves the court\u2019s power to adjudicate a case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>RCFC 12(b)(1) motion may not be the appropriate vehicle by which to dismiss a case as moot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Regardless of whether a moot claim should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim upon which the court could grant relief, the standard applied by the court in reviewing a motion urging dismissal of a claim as moot is the same: the court assumes that the allegations in the complaint are true and construes those allegations in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Henke v. United States, </em>60 F.3d 795, 797 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">1. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The sole basis for defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss is its contention that plaintiffs protest is moot. A court \u201cwill determine only actual matters in controversy essential to the decision of the particular case before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Alaska S.S. Co., </em>253 U.S. 113, 115, 40 S.Ct. 448, 64 L.Ed. 808 (1920). \u201cThe controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth, </em>300 U.S. 227, 240-41, 57 5. Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937). Moreover, the controversy must exist at all stages of the litigation; it is not enough that the controversy was alive when the complaint was filed. <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974). Because the \u201c[m]ootness of an action relates to the basic dispute between the parties\u201d and \u201cnot merely the relief requested,\u201d a case will not be rendered moot by subsequent acts if some of the requested relief remains available. <em>Intrepid v. Pollock, </em>907 F.2d 1125, 1131 (Fed.Cir.1990); <em>accord Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12, 113 S.Ct. 447, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992) (holding that a ease is not moot so long as the \u201ccourt can fashion <em>some </em>form of meaningful relief\u2019 for the injured party). And, even when subsequent acts render a ease completely moot, courts will allow the case to proceed under certain circumstances. For example, an otherwise moot ease will not be dismissed upon the voluntary cessation of the challenged activity unless there is no reasonable expectation that the activity will recur and the effects of the activity have been completely extinguished. <em>Cnty. of L.A. v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">2. The Claims in Plaintiffs Complaint Are Moot</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">As noted above, in its complaint, plaintiff protested the EPA\u2019s award of the soil remediation contract to PK. It therefore sought a court order preventing contract performance, declaring the contract void, terminating the contract, and requiring the EPA to award it the contract. The EPA\u2019s subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>quent termination of the contract and cancellation of the procurement, however, renders the court unable to award plaintiffs requested relief. Because the EPA has already terminated its contract with PK, the court is unable to stay performance of the contract or terminate the contract, and a declaration that the contract was void would be meaningless. And, because the EPA has cancelled the procurement altogether, the court\u2014even if it had the authority to do so\u2014could not award the contract to plaintiff as a result of any improprieties in the EPA\u2019s award of the contract to PK. In short, the actions taken by the EPA after plaintiff filed its protest rendered moot plaintifPs challenge of the contract award.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The court\u2019s conclusion is not without precedent; the Court of Federal Claims has consistently found that the cancellation of a procurement renders a protest of that procurement moot. In <em>CCL Service Corp. v. United States, </em>the protestor filed suit challenging the Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s award of seven contracts to another company, and seeking appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief. 43 Fed.Cl. 680, 681 (1999). After the protest was filed, the agency terminated the seven contracts for its convenience and cancelled the solicitation. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 686. The court held that the protestor\u2019s claims for equitable relief were \u201cdefinitely moot in light of the cancellation of the contraets[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690 (citing <em>Durable Metals Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>27 Fed. Cl. 472, 477 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The court arrived at the same conclusion in <em>Lion Raisins, Inc. v. United States, </em>69 Fed. Cl. 32 (2005). In that case, after the protestor had submitted bids in response to several invitations to bid, the United States Department of Agriculture suspended it from bidding on government contracts for one year. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The protestor filed suit challenging the suspension, and the court issued an order preventing the agency from awarding the contracts. <em>Id. </em>During the pendency of the suit, the agency cancelled the relevant solicitations. <em>Id. </em>The court held that \u201csince the contract solicitations were cancelled, Plaintiff can no longer complain that the contracts at issue were improperly awarded ..., because the contracts were not awarded to any bidder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Plaintiff attempts to rescue its complaint from dismissal by asserting that the court possesses continuing jurisdiction to entertain its protest and consider the propriety of the EPA\u2019s cancellation of the soil remediation procurement. In advancing this argument, plaintiff asserts that the court cannot dismiss its complaint so long as it remains possible for plaintiff to file an amended complaint containing a viable claim. Plaintiff misstates the standard of review. The court\u2019s focus must be on the complaint actually before it, and not on the possible contents of a not-yet-filed amended complaint. The allegations in plaintiffs complaint relate only to the propriety of the EPA\u2019s award of the contract to PK. Plaintiffs complaint does not contain any allegations concerning the EPA\u2019s cancellation of the soil remediation procurement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court therefore lacks the ability to consider such allegations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Plaintiff further claims that its request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs permits the court to retain jurisdiction over its complaint. Plaintiffs contention is contrary to law. In <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>the United States Supreme Court (\u201cSupreme Court\u201d) expressly held that \u201cinterest in attorney\u2019s fees is, of course, insufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.\u201d 494 U.S. 472, 480, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990) (citation omitted). And, the Court of Federal Claims has held that \u201c[l]egal fees in relation to filing a bid protest action are ... bid protest costs,\u201d and \u201cbecause the court does not have jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>over bid protest costs, the court cannot assert jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees in relation to the bid protest.\u201d <em>S.K.J. &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. United States, </em>67 Fed.Cl. 218, 231 (2005). Thus, plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees cannot provide an avenue for the court to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s otherwise moot protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">In sum, the EPA\u2019s termination of its contract with PK and subsequent cancellation of the procurement renders plaintiffs challenge to the award of the contract to PK moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">B. Plaintiffs Motion for Leave to Amend Its Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"AYk\">In an attempt to avoid the complete dismissal of its protest, plaintiff moves for leave to amend its complaint to challenge the government\u2019s cancellation of the soil remediation procurement. Plaintiff premises its motion on RCFC 15(a). However, because plaintiff seeks to amend its complaint to set out events that occurred after it filed its protest, the proper basis for its motion is RCFC 15(d). <em>See Frasco, LLC, </em>537 F.3d at 1337 &amp; n.5. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">Supplemental Pleadings. On motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented. The court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense. The court may order that the opposing party plead to the supplemental pleading within a specified time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">RCFC 15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The ability of a plaintiff to use a supplemental complaint to cure a jurisdictional defect in an earlier-filed complaint is well settled by binding precedent. In <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who did not satisfy a \u201cnonwaivable condition of jurisdiction\u201d until after he filed suit could have cured the jurisdictional defect of his original complaint by filing a supplemental complaint. 426 U.S. 67, 75, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cFederal Circuit\u201d) noted that the <em>Mathews </em>decision was \u201cconsistent with others holding that defects in a plaintiff\u2019s case\u2014 even jurisdictional defects\u2014can be cured while the case is pending if the plaintiff obtains leave to file a supplemental pleading under Rule 15(d) reciting post-filing events that have remedied this defect.\u201d <em>Black v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>93 F.3d 781, 790 (Fed.Cir. 1996). Whether a supplemental complaint could cure a defect, the Federal Circuit explained, depended on whether the substantive provision providing the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction expressly prohibited the filing of a complaint before a specified waiting period or before the exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>It concluded that in the absence of such a provision, and so long as a plaintiff has satisfied the jurisdictional requirements within the relevant limitations period, a complaint may be supplemented to cure the original jurisdictional defect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 791-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">Applying <em>Mathews </em>and <em>Black </em>to this case, it appears that plaintiff is not legally barred from curing, with a supplemental complaint, the jurisdictional defect arising from the cancellation of the procurement that was the subject of its protest. There are no waiting periods or administrative exhaustion requirements for bid protests. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b) (describing the bid protest jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims). Nor has the statute of limitations for plaintiffs supplemental allegations expired. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2401 (providing a six-year limitations period for civil actions filed against the United States), 2501 (providing a six-year limitations period for suits filed in the Court of Federal Claims). And, there is precedent in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of the court\u2019s ability to entertain protests challenging an agency\u2019s decision to cancel a procurement. <em>See, e.g., MORI Assocs., Inc. v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 503, 519-25 (2011); <em>Def. Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>99 Fed.Cl. 103, 114-15 (2011); <em>Madison Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>90 Fed.Cl. 673 (2009); <em>FFTF Restoration Co. v. United States, </em>86 Fed.Cl. 226, 236-45 (2009); <em>see also Croman Corp. v. United States, </em>724 F.3d 1357, 1363-65 (Fed.Cir.2013) (reviewing, without commenting on jurisdiction, a protestor\u2019s contention that an agency improperly cancelled a portion of a solicitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In fact, the procedural posture of this protest is quite similar to the posture of the protest in <em>Madison Senices, Inc. </em>In that case, the protestor sought to prevent the Federal Emergency Management Agency from reissuing a solicitation for which it was the intended awardee. 90 Fed.Cl. at 676. It set forth three claims for relief in its complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 677. Upon the agency\u2019s formal cancellation of the solicitation at issue, the government moved to dismiss the protest as moot. <em>Id. </em>The protestor immediately sought leave to file an amended complaint challenging the cancellation decision and setting forth three additional claims for relief pertaining to that challenge. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that, to the extent that the agency\u2019s cancellation of the solicitation was proper, the protest would be rendered moot. <em>Id. </em>at 680. However, it also concluded that plaintiff should be allowed to supplement its complaint with the cancellation-related allegations so that the court would be presented with a justiciable controversy. <em>Id. </em>at 682. Thus, it allowed the protestor to file the proposed supplemental complaint, but dismissed the three claims for relief that originally appeared in the initial complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Notwithstanding the above precedent, defendant argues that the court should not permit plaintiff to file a supplemental complaint because supplementation would be futile.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant contends that plaintiffs proposed supplemental complaint is barred by laches, and that a successful challenge to the EPA\u2019s cancellation decision would merely return the parties to the status quo ante, requiring the court to address plaintiffs original, moot protest. The court addresses each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">1. Defendant Has Not Met Its Burden to Invoke Laches</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">Laches is \u201cthe neglect or delay in bringing suit to remedy an alleged wrong, which taken together with lapse of time and other circumstances, causes prejudice to the adverse party and operates as an equitable bar.\u201d <em>A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co., </em>960 F.2d 1020, 1028-29 (Fed.Cir. 1992) (en banc). To invoke the affirmative defense of laches, a defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cthe plaintiff delayed filing suit for an unreasonable and inexcusable length of time from the time the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of its claim against the defendant\u201d and that \u201cthe delay operated to the prejudice or injury of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032. In analyzing whether a defendant has met its burden, \u201c[a] court must look at all of the particular facts and circumstances of [the] case and weigh the equities of the parties.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Cometia v. United States, </em>851 F.2d 1372, 1379-80 (Fed.Cir.1988) (en banc). At bottom, the application of laches is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>A.C. Aukerman Co., </em>960 F.2d at 1032, 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Laches may be invoked in bid protests filed in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1308, 1314-15 (Fed.Cir.2007). However, the court infrequently applies the doctrine. <em>See Aircraft Charter Solutions, Inc. v. United States, </em>109 Fed.Cl. 398, 408 (2013) (citing <em>CW Gov\u2019t Travel, Inc. v. United States, </em>61 Fed.Cl. 559, 569 (2004)). Rather, the consequences of a plaintiffs delay in filing a bid protest manifest in multiple ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">In some cases, delay constitutes waiver by the plaintiff of a bid protest claim. In others, delay by the plaintiff in filing a bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>protest affects the court\u2019s weighing of injunctive relief factors. In a few cases, where delay is of an unacceptable magnitude, the doctrine of laches may bar a bid protest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Defendant asserts that this case presents an ideal ease for applying the laches defense. While defendant may ultimately be correct, it has not established laches at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">To establish that laches bars plaintiffs proposed supplemental complaint, defendant must prove both (1) an unreasonable and inexcusable delay and (2) prejudice caused by that delay. With respect to the latter element, defendant contends that if plaintiff was successful in challenging the EPA\u2019s cancellation decision, the EPA could be forced to change course from its current plan to use existing contracts in conjunction with a contract to secure property access agreements back to awarding the contract contemplated in the original IFB. Due to the length of time that has passed, defendant argues, the EPA \u201cwould be severely prejudiced if it completed the tasks [under its current plan that] it would have sought under the base-period of the contract that [plaintiff] seeks, then had to pay for these now-unnecessary services again, at a significant and, in the current budgetary climate, unaffordable premium.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. Mot. Amend 11. This argument is insufficient to establish prejudice. Although defendant avers that the EPA \u201chas been moving forward\u201d with its new plan to procure the soil remediation services at issue and that a contract awarded under the original IFB would be \u201cunaffordable\u201d in \u201cthe current budgetary climate,\u201d <em>id. </em>it has offered no evidence to support these contentions. Averments made within a legal argument cannot be used to satisfy an evidentiary burden\u2014in this case, that defendant was prejudiced by plaintiffs purported delay in seeking to file a supplemental complaint. <em>See Enzo Biochem, Inc., </em>424 F.3d at 1284; <em>Mel Williamson, Inc., </em>229 Ct.Cl. at 848; <em>Del., Lackawanna &amp; W. R.R. Co., </em>54 Ct. Cl. at 41-42. In the absence of evidence that defendant has incurred costs that it would not have incurred but-for the purported delay and that the EPA could not afford to award a contract under the original IFB, defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice is merely speculative. And, because defendant cannot demonstrate prejudice, it cannot establish that plaintiffs proposed supplemental complaint would be barred by laches,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> defeating its argument that laches would render supplementation futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">2. Defendant Has Misstated the Effect of a Successful Challenge to the EPA\u2019s Cancellation Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Defendant also argues that supplementation of plaintiffs complaint would be futile because if plaintiff succeeded in its challenge to the EPA\u2019s cancellation decision, the case would revert to the original, now moot, protest filed by plaintiff. Defendant is incorrect. If plaintiff prevailed in its challenge to the EPA\u2019s cancellation decision, and if, as plaintiff requests, the court issued an injunction requiring the EPA to award a contract under the original IFB, plaintiffs original protest arguments concerning the award of the contract to PK would be irrelevant because the EPA has terminated its contract with PK. Plaintiff does not, for obvious reasons, seek to challenge the EPA\u2019s termination of its contract with PK; plaintiffs challenge is directed at the EPA\u2019s subsequent and distinct decision to cancel the procurement in lieu of awarding a new contract under the original IFB. Thus, the court would not need to revisit the EPA\u2019s decision to award the contract to PK. Defendant\u2019s second futility argument, therefore, lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">3. Plaintiff May File a Supplemental Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Defendant has not established that plaintiff should be precluded from filing a supplemental complaint. Moreover, it bears noting that if the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>leave to amend its complaint and dismissed its protest as moot, there would be nothing preventing plaintiff from filing a new protest challenging the EPA\u2019s decision to cancel the soil remediation procurement. As with any other protest, defendant would then be required to produce an administrative record pertaining to the EPA\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>RCFC App. C, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, after which it could move to dismiss the protest or request judgment on the administrative record, <em>see id. </em>\u00b68. Thus, in the absence of any showing that the filing of a supplemental complaint would be futile, it makes little sense not to permit the supplementation. <em>See Black, </em>93 F.3d at 791-92 (noting that \u201cthere would be no more than a formal distinction between filing a supplemental pleading and filing a new petition with the additional ... allegations included\u201d); <em>Madison Servs., </em>Inc., 90 Fed.Cl. at 683 (\u201cIf the court were to deny plaintiffs motion to amend (or, rather, to supplement) its complaint, forcing plaintiff to file a new petition, nothing would be gained save the court\u2019s collection of a new filing fee. To paraphrase the Supreme Court, it is far too late in the day, and entirely contrary to the spirit of the rules of the court and to longstanding principles, for decisions on the merits to be avoided or delayed on the basis of such mere technicalities.\u201d). In sum, the court will permit plaintiff to supplement its complaint pursuant to RCFC 15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As set forth above, the court GRANTS plaintiffs motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Further, the court GRANTS both of defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss and DISMISSES plaintiffs original protest, i.e., counts one and two of plaintiffs original and proposed amended complaints, as MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Plaintiff shall file its proposed amended complaint, which the court deems to be a supplemental complaint, no later than Monday, January 6, 2014. The court will then contact the parties to schedule a status conference to discuss a schedule for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The court has filed this ruling under seal. The parties shall confer to determine agreed-to proposed redactions. Then, by no later than Monday, January 6, 2014, the parties shall file a joint status report indicating their agreement with the proposed redactions, attaching a copy of those pages of the court\u2019s ruling containing proposed redactions, with all proposed redactions clearly indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\">.

In one of its briefs, defendant provides an explanation for the EPA's decision to terminate its contract with PK.

Defendant requested the stay due to the lapse of appropriations to the United States Department of Justice.

The \"lack of jurisdiction to review moot cases derives from the requirement of Article III of the Constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy.\" <em>Liner v.

The United States Court of Federal Claims (\"Court of Federal Claims\u201d), as a court established under Article I of the United States Constitution, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 171(a) (2012), is not bound by the \"case or controversy\u201d requirement of Article III, <em>Zevalkink v.

In their briefs, the parties address both (1) whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain cancellation claims and (2) the merits of plaintiff\u2019s proposed challenge to the EPA\u2019s cancellation of the soil remediation procurement.

Indeed, recognizing that its complaint is deficient in this regard, plaintiff seeks leave to file an amended complaint to set forth a claim challenging the cancellation of the procurement. That motion is addressed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\">. This rule was applied in <em>Central Pines Land Co. v. United States, </em>99 Fed.Cl. 394 (2011).
