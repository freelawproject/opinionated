RELEVANT FACTS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-27\">On September 8, 1993, Nathan T. Meidl (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019) enlisted in the Army Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (\u201cArmy ROTC\u201d) program while attending the University of Wisconsin. AR 209. On April 9,1996, Plaintiff entered active duty in the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Army. AR 10, 194-204. On April 30, 2000, he was appointed as a commissioned officer in the Active Guard Reserve (\u201cAGR\u201d) program. AEt 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Later in 2000, while serving in the AGR, Plaintiff began to experience bilateral foot pain that was aggravated by prolonged standing and running. AR 10. In 2001, he was diagnosed with pes <em>planus.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>AR 10. In early 2002, Plaintiff began to experience pain in his left wrist that was aggravated by daily activities, as a result of degenerative changes to his left wrist joint. AR 3,10.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On October 5, 2005, Plaintiff entered into active duty services in Iraq as an Acquisitions Corps Officer. AR 10, 95. In April 2006, while lifting weights, he tore his left peetoralis major and injured his shoulder, requiring surgery. AR 10. Due to these injuries, Plaintiff had a limited range of motion and difficulty bearing more than five pounds of weight. AR 10. On April 26, 2006, he was diagnosed with hypertension. AR 11. As a result of his injuries and surgical treatment, Plaintiff reverted to AGR status. AR 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Plaintiffs Officer Evaluation Report (\u201cOER\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the period ending May 9, 2008 (\u201c2008 OER\u201d) lists his promotion potential as \u201coutstanding performance, must promote,\u201d and explains that Plaintiff should be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel \u201cat the first opportunity.\u201d AR 64-65. That same OER also indicates that Plaintiff passed his Army Physical Fitness Test (\u201cAPFT\u201d) on April 15, 2008. AR 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">From October 10, 2008 to October 21, 2008, Plaintiff was again deployed to Iraq for a temporary tour of duty. AR 10. After his return, in April 2009, his <em>pes planus </em>was \u201cgraded as severe, bilaterally with pronation, intolerance to weight bearing, extended standing, and extended walking.\u201d AR 10-11. In June 2009, Plaintiff began to develop bilateral <em>plantar </em>fasciitis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that was painful when he wore military foot wear. AR 11. In 2009, Plaintiffs left Achilles tendon ruptured from playing basketball, requiring orthopedic surgery and resulting in residual heel pain. AR 11. Thereafter, Plaintiffs military physicians directed that he be evaluated for physical disability by a Medical Evaluation Board (\u201cMEB\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Plaintiffs OER for the period ending May 9, 2009 (\u201c2009 OER\u201d) explained that \u201chis permanent [physical] profile prevents him from deploying, performing the APFT and weapons qualification.\u201d AR 59. The same OER, however, listed his potential for promotion as \u201cbest qualified,\u201d and explains that Plaintiff \u201ccontinued his superb performance as an Assistant Product Manager in Heavy Tactical Vehicles during this rating period.\u201d AR 59. The OER further provided that Plaintiff \u201cexhibits all the tools necessary to perform at the next higher level [of promotion], but his permanent profile prohibits him from doing so.\u201d AR 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">On November 12, 2009, Plaintiff was examined at an orthopedic clinic in preparation for evaluation by a MEB.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> AR 1-3. The clinic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>examined Plaintiffs left shoulder, his left ankle, a surgical scar, and his left wrist. AR 2. The clinic concluded that Plaintiffs left shoulder and wrist pain did not meet Army retention standards because they interfered with his ability to perform military duties. AR 2-3. The clinic concluded that Plaintiffs left ankle pain, however, met retention standards. AR 2. The orthopedic clinic did not examine Plaintiffs <em>pes planus </em>or <em>plantar fasciitis. </em>AR 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">On February 26, 2010, Plaintiffs Commander recommended that the Army not retain Plaintiff due to his left shoulder injury, left wrist pain, bilateral <em>pes planus, </em>and bilateral <em>plantar fasciitis, </em>because Plaintiff could not perform his Military Occupational Specialty (\u201cMOS\u201d) as an acquisition or logistics officer. AR 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On February 28, 2010, a MEB considered Plaintiffs medical condition and concluded that his left shoulder, left wrist, <em>pes planus, </em>and <em>plantar fasciitis </em>did not meet the Army\u2019s retention standards. AR 10-13. The MEB found, however, that Plaintiffs left Achilles tendon rupture and hypertension met retention standards. AR 13. As a result, the MEB recommended referral to a Physical Evaluation Board (\u201cPEB\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for further evaluation. AR 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On March 9, 2010, before the PEB convened, Plaintiff was afforded an opportunity to have the MEB\u2019s findings reviewed by an impartial medical professional. AR 14. In addition, Plaintiff was afforded the opportunity to review the MEB\u2019s findings to decide whether he concurred, and if not, to submit a statement explaining any disagreement. AR 14. Plaintiff declined the opportunity for an impartial medical evaluation and did not dispute the findings and recommendation of the MEB. AR 15-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">On March 25, 2010, the PEB considered Plaintiffs medical records, determined that Plaintiffs chronic shoulder pain and wrist pain conditions rendered him unfit for service, and rated each at a ten percent disability for a total of twenty percent disability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> AR 19-20. The PEB, however, determined that the bilateral <em>pes planus, </em>bilateral <em>plantar fasciitis, </em>left Achilles tendon, and hypertension were not unfitting conditions, and thus were not rated. AR 19. Therefore, the PEB recommended discharge with severance pay at a twenty percent disability rate. AR 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">On March 31, 2010, after the PEB issued a determination, the orthopedic clinic issued an Addendum indicating that although it had not examined Plaintiffs bilateral <em>pes planus </em>and <em>plantar fasciitis, </em>an examination by a podiatrist on April 13, 2009 found that these conditions did not meet retention standards. AR 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">On April 7, 2010, Plaintiff acknowledged that he was informed of his rights by the PEB Liaison Officer (\u201cPEBLO\u201d). AR 21-27. Plaintiff was presented with three options: (1) accept the preliminary findings of the PEB and waive his right to a formal hearing; (2) contest the preliminary findings and waive his right to a formal hearing; and (3) contest the preliminary findings and demand a formal hearing. AR 21-27. Plaintiff decided to concur with the result of the PEB and waived a formal hearing of his case. AR 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">Plaintiffs OER for the period ending April 15, 2010 (\u201c2010 OER\u201d) stated that Plaintiff exhibited \u201c[ejxeeptionally outstanding performance.\u201d AR 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">On June 27, 2010, Plaintiff was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea. PI. Ex. at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>On July 13, 2010, Plaintiff was discharged from active duty in the Army with disability severance pay, but did not receive medical retirement since his disability rating was less than thirty percent and he had less than twenty years of service. AR 19,30.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On February 10, 2011, Plaintiff filed a Complaint (\u201cCompl.\u201d) in the United States Court of Federal Claims alleging that he was denied disability retirement pay and benefits to which he is entitled under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. Compl. \u00b622. The Complaint also alleges that the PEB failed to rate his disabilities at an eighty percent level, provide an adequate MEB evaluation, and apply applicable evidentiary standards. Compl. \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">On May 6, 2011, the Government filed the Administrative Record and a Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record. On June 7, 2011, Plaintiff filed a Cross-Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record, together with attached Exhibits. On July 8, 2011, the Government filed a Reply, together with a Supplemental Administrative Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">On August 10, 2011, the United States Court of Federal Claims remanded the case to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (\u201cABCMR\u201d) for further administrative action pursuant to RCFC 52.2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Meidl I, </em>100 Fed.Cl. at 8. Specifically, the court ordered the ABCMR to consider the following issues: (1) whether Plaintiffs separation from active duty complied with applicable laws and policies; (2) whether Plaintiff had unfitting physical conditions in addition to shoulder and wrist pain at the time of separation; and (3) whether Plaintiffs disability rating was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>The case was stayed during the remand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">On October 24, 2011, the United States Army Physical Disability Agency (\u201cUSAPDA\u201d) issued an advisory opinion \u201c[rjeeommending no change to the Plaintiffs military records.\u201d Gov\u2019t SR I at A35-A38. On December 13, 2011, Plaintiff responded that the USAPDA factual findings were incorrect and that the recommendation to deny relief was contrary to law and did not address the injustices in this ease. Gov\u2019t SR I at A18-A34.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">On February 2, 2012, the ABCMR denied Plaintiffs request for relief. Gov\u2019t SR I at A3-A17. The ABCMR found: (1) Plaintiffs separation from service complied with applicable laws and policies; (2) Plaintiff properly was processed through the Army\u2019s physical disability evaluation system; (3) Plaintiff was provided an appropriate disability rating, based on the unfitting conditions identified by the PEB; and (4) Plaintiffs rights were fully protected during the separation process. Gov\u2019t SR I at A15-A17.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">On May 18, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Supplemental Brief In Support Of Plaintiffs Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record. On June 22, 2012, the Government filed a Supplemental Brief In Opposition To Plaintiffs Cross-Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record And In Support Of Defendant\u2019s Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record. On July 10, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">On January 25, 2013, the court determined that, by failing to consider whether Plaintiffs foot conditions \u201ccontributed to rendering him unfit,\u201d the February 2, 2012 ABCMR decision was arbitrary and capricious and violated 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216a(b). <em>See Meidl II, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 577. The court also determined that the ABCMR\u2019s failure to consider whether Plaintiffs sleep apnea became unfitting after the MEB and PEB evaluations, but before his separation from the Army, was arbitrary and capricious, since it entirely ignored \u201can important aspect of the problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577-78 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, the court again remanded the case, pursuant to RCFC 52.2, instructing the ABCMR to consider whether: (1) Plaintiffs foot conditions contributed to rendering him unfit; (2) Plaintiffs sleep apnea became unfitting after the MEB and PEB proceedings, but before Plaintiffs separation from the Army; and (3) in light of the resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>those two issues, whether Plaintiffs disability rating was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">On April 11, 2013, the ABCMR ruled, on remand, that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to overturn the PEB\u2019s determination that Plaintiffs foot conditions did not contribute to his unfitness; (2) Plaintiffs sleep apnea did not render him unable to perform his duties and was not unfitting, because it was corrected by medication; and (3) Plaintiffs disability rating was appropriate, in light of the resolution of the preceding issues. Gov\u2019t SR II at 12-13 (\u201cthe ABCMR\u2019s decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">On July 10, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record (\u201cPL Mot. JAR\u201d). On September 4, 2013, the Government filed a Cross-Motion And Response (\u201cGov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot.\u201d). On October 7, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Reply And Response To Defendant\u2019s Cross Motion For Judgment on the Administrative Record (\u201cPL Reply\u201d). On October 31, 2013, the Government filed a Reply (\u201cGov\u2019t Reply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">III. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">A. Jurisdiction and Standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims is established by the Tucker Act. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. The Tucker Act authorizes the court \u201cto render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act, however, is \u201ca jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages____ [T]he Act merely confers jurisdiction upon [the United States Court of Federal Claims] whenever the substantive right exists.\u201d <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). Therefore, a plaintiff must identify and plead an independent contractual relationship, constitutional provision, federal statute, or executive agency regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages. <em>See Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cThe Tucker Act itself does not create a substantive cause of action; in order to come within the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages.\u201d). The burden of establishing jurisdiction falls upon the plaintiff. <em>See FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, </em>493 U.S. 215, 231, 110 S.Ct. 596, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990) (holding that the burden is on the plaintiff to allege facts sufficient to establish jurisdiction); <em>see also </em>RCFC 12(b)(1) (establishing lack of subject matter jurisdiction as a defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">In <em>Meidl I, </em>the court determined that the February 10, 2011 Complaint invoked the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1), as it challenged the determination of Plaintiffs disability status under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201. Compl. \u00b6 2; <em>see also Sawyer v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 1577, 1580-81 (Fed.Cir.1991) (holding that claims challenging disability status under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 may be adjudicated by the United States Court of Federal Claims). In addition, although Plaintiff \u201cvoluntarily waived judicial review of the informal PEB,\u201d he retained the right to seek administrative review of the informal PEB decision and judicial review of that administrative review. <em>See Meidl I, </em>100 Fed.Cl. at 8. Therefore, the court had jurisdiction to adjudicate Plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">In addition, in <em>Meidl I, </em>the court determined that the February 10, 2011 Complaint alleged that Plaintiff suffered an injury in fact that can be determined in a specific amount and is traceable to the A\u2019my\u2019s allegedly unlawful determination of disability retirement pay and benefits. Compl. \u00b6 22; <em>see also Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv., Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 180-81, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000) (\u201c[A] plaintiff must show [that] it has suffered an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 that is ... concrete and particularized and ... actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; ... the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and ... it is likely, as op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>posed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). As such, Plaintiff has standing to challenge the ABCMR\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">B. Standard for Judgment on the Administrative Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Review of a military correction board\u2019s decision is \u201climited to the administrative record before the deciding official or officials.\u201d <em>Wyatt v. United States, </em>23 Cl.Ct. 314, 319 (1991). The standard for judgment on the administrative record, pursuant to RCFC 52.1, is whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof to show that the decision was without a rational basis or not in accordance with the law, given all the disputed and undisputed facts in the administrative record. <em>See Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1357 (Fed.Cir.2005) (instructing the court to make \u201cfactual findings under RCFC 52.1 from the [limited] record evidence as if it were conducting a trial on the record\u201d); <em>see also Afghan Am. Army Servs. Corp. v. United States, </em>90 Fed.Cl. 341, 355 (2009) (\u201cIn reviewing cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record, the court must determine \u2018whether, given all the disputed and undisputed facts, a party has met its burden of proof based on the evidence in the record.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The standard of review is limited to determining whether the agency decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious, not supported by substantial evidence, or contrary to applicable statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>Porter v. United States, </em>163 F.3d 1304, 1312 (Fed.Cir.1998); <em>see also Hoskins v. United States, </em>40 Fed.Cl. 259, 271-72 (1998) (\u201cOnce a plaintiff has sought relief from a correction board ... the plaintiff is bound by that board\u2019s determination unless he can satisfy the difficult standard of proof that the correction board\u2019s decision was illegal because it was arbitrary, capricious, or in bad faith, or unsupported by substantial evidence, or contrary to law, regulation or mandatory published procedure of a substantive nature by which plaintiff has been seriously prejudiced, or money is due.\u201d) (citations omitted). The court, however, may not retry the case on the merits. <em>See Heisig v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1153, 1156 (Fed. Cir.1983) (\u201cAlthough the court might disagree with the board\u2019s decision, it cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the board if reasonable minds could reach differing resolutions of the disputed matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The plaintiff bears the burden of proving any deficiency by \u201ccogent and clearly convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Wronke v. Marsh, </em>787 F.2d 1569, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1986). Such proof must also \u201covercome the strong, but rebuttable, presumption that the administrators of the military, like other public officials, discharge their duties correctly, lawfully, and in good faith.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>163 F.3d at 1316 (quoting <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>594 F.2d 804, 813 (Ct.Cl.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">C. Whether The Army Board For Correction Of Military Records\u2019 Determination On Remand Is Arbitrary, Capricious, Not Supported By Substantial Evidence, Or Contrary To Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">1. The Plaintiffs Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Plaintiff posits three arguments for why the ABCMR\u2019s remand decision is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law or regulation, or unsupported by substantial evidence. First, the ABCMR failed to conduct a \u201cmeaningful analysis.\u201d PL Mot. JAR 7, 9. Specifically, the ABCMR\u2019s decision \u201cselectively quote[s]\u201d from OERs and lists evidence that contradicts its conclusion that Plaintiffs bilateral foot conditions were not unfitting. PL Mot. JAR 5. In that vein, the ABCMR also erred in concluding that there is \u201cno evidence that would support overturning the approved PEB finding regarding his foot conditions\u201d (PL Mot. JAR 9 (quoting Gov\u2019t SR II at 12)), because it ignored significant evidence to the contrary, including the MEB\u2019s evaluation, the Commander\u2019s determination that Plaintiff could not perform his MOS as an acquisition or logistics officer, and the fact that Plaintiff was unable to wear protective body armor. PL Mot. JAR 9. This contrary evidence \u201cdemonstrates that [Plaintiffs] foot condition was unfitting\u2014at least in combination or collectively with his other unfitting conditions.\u201d PL Mot. JAR 9; <em>see also </em>Pl. Mot. JAR 7 (concluding that the ABCMR\u2019s decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>arbitrary and capricious, because \u201cit lists evidence and findings supporting that [Plaintiffs] bilateral foot conditions are actually unfitting\u201d). In sum, the ABCMR\u2019s remand decision failed to \u201creasonably construe\u201d relevant evidence \u201cabout the impact of his foot conditions on his fitness.\u201d Pl. Reply 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Second, the ABCMR\u2019s reliance on the OERs is \u201cerroneous,\u201d because the OERs do not address any of Plaintiffs specific physical disabilities and are \u201cirrelevant to the question of which conditions are unfitting.\u201d Pl. Mot. JAR 8. The OERs simply state that Plaintiff is being medically discharged from the Army and cannot take the APFT, but do not relate that assessment to any of Plaintiffs specific physical impairments. Pl. Mot. JAR. 8. In fact, the OERs cite Plaintiffs performance rating as \u201coutstanding performance, must promote.\u201d Pl. Reply 4 (citing Gov\u2019t SR II at 12 (OERs describing Plaintiffs \u201coutstanding performance\u201d)). Accordingly, the ABCMR erred in relying on Plaintiffs \u201coutstanding OERs as evidence that [Plaintiffs] foot conditions were not unfitting,\u201d because the OERs do not address any specific medical condition directly. Pl. Reply 4. Nevertheless, on remand, the ABCMR used the positive comments in the 2008, 2009, and 2010 OERs to conclude that Plaintiffs bilateral foot conditions were <em>not unfitting, </em>but his shoulder and wrist conditions <em>were unfitting. </em>Pl. Reply 4; Pl. Mot. JAR. 8. This was illogical, arbitrary, and capricious. Pl.

In drawing a conclusion about the cumulative import of this evidence, the ABCMR reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ably concluded that, although Plaintiff \u201chad a medical condition that did not meet retention standards, he was able to achieve an outstanding performance rating in his duty position, and, therefore, [his] foot conditions were not unfitting.\u201d Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 11 (citing Gov\u2019t SR II at 12(l)(c)-(e)). That the MEB found Plaintiffs foot conditions to be disqualifying and failed retention standards is \u201cbeside the point.\u201d Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 10. \u201cNothing in the MEB\u2019s analysis can substitute for the decision of the PEB, which has the sole purview of deciding fitness for duty.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 7; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cThe MEB simply narrows the field of a service member\u2019s possible conditions to those that the PEB can consider as disqualifying^]\u201d); Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 10 (\u201c[Although the MEB found that [Plaintiffs] foot conditions were disqualifying, its findings are not conclusive[.]\u201d). Because the PEB reviewed the MEB findings, February 26, 2010 recommendation from Plaintiffs Commander, and provided a reasoned analysis as to why Plaintiffs foot conditions did not contribute to his unfitness, the ABCMR\u2019s decision is lawful.

Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 9 (citing Gov\u2019t SR II at 8-12). Because Plaintiffs OERs showed that he excelled in his duty position, despite having substantial bilateral foot impairments, both the PEB and the ABCMR \u201cconsidered whether [Plaintiffs] foot conditions contributed to rendering him unfit and found that it did not.\u201d Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 15; <em>see also </em>Gov\u2019t Reply 3 (\u201c[T]he PEB found [Plaintiffs] foot conditions not to be unfitting ...

The scope of review is not whether the ABCMR \u201ccould have reached a different result\u201d than the PEB. Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 12-13. Because the ABCMR\u2019s decision was reasonable in light of the totality of the evidence and issued after considering \u201call aspects of the fitness issue,\u201d the court has no basis to overturn that decision.

In that case, the plaintiff \u201cwas found to have an unfitting condition,\u201d whereas, in this case, neither the PEB nor the ABCMR found Plaintiffs foot condition unfitting. Gov\u2019t Opp. &amp; Cross-Mot. 15 (citing <em>Rieth, </em>462 F.2d at 535-37). Moreover, in <em>Rieth, </em>the Court of Claims determined that an increase in plaintiffs disability rating was proper, because his shoulder injury \u201ccontributed to weakness and temporary paralysis several years\u201d after his discharge. Gov\u2019t Reply 6 (citing <em>Rieth, </em>462 F.2d at 536-37). Therefore, <em>Rieth </em>is inapposite. The issue before the ABCMR on remand was to reexamine the PEB\u2019s determination of Plaintiffs fitness at the time of discharge, not the impact of any disabilities \u201cseveral years down the road.\u201d Gov\u2019t Reply 6 (citing <em>Bosch v.

That the court \u201cmight disagree\u201d with the decision of a board for correction of military records, in and of itself, is insufficient to overturn a correction board\u2019s decision. <em>See Storey v.

Thus, in reviewing the decision of a PEB, the ABCMR is limited to ascertaining whether the PEB committed a \u201cmaterial error or injustice\u201d and only if \u201csufficient evidence exists on the record [will the ABCMR] direct or recommend changes in military records to correct the error or injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 581.3(b)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Plaintiffs first argument must fail, because although \u201cthe ABCMR ... reached a conclusion with which Plaintiff disagreed ..., that disagreement does not establish that the ABCMR was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Meidl II, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 576. In this case, the ABCMR reviewed the relevant evidence, including Plaintiffs military records, OERs, November 2009 Orthopedic consult, February 28, 2010 MEB decision, and March 25, 2010 decision by the PEB. Gov\u2019t SR II at 1-7. Although Plaintiff characterizes the ABCMR\u2019s decision as flawed because it \u201clists evidence and findings supporting\u201d a contrary conclusion (PI. Mot. JAR 7), that contention represents a fundamental misapprehension: the ABCMR <em>must </em>review all relevant evidence, whether that evidence supports the ABCMR\u2019s determination or not. <em>See Jordan v. United States, </em>205 Ct.Cl. 65, 84 (1974) (holding that the correction board\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, in part, because it was \u201cnot based upon a complete and balanced consideration <em>of all the relevant evidence available and presented\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>see also Heisig, </em>719 F.2d at 1157 (\u201cUnder the substantial evidence rule, <em>all </em>of the competent evidence must be considered, whether original or supplemental, and whether or not it supports the challenged conclusion.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Chisolm v.

That is what the ABCMR did on remand, as evidenced by the explicit acknowledgment that the record presented different \u201caccounts] of [Plaintiffs] ability to perform his duties.\u201d Gov\u2019t SR II at 12. The fact that Plaintiff, after reviewing this same record, would have reached a different conclusion than the ABCMR is immaterial. For these reasons, the court has determined that the ABCMR\u2019s decision was not an \u201cunreasonabl[e] constru[ction]\u201d of relevant evidence, and therefore is not arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Joslyn v. United States, </em>110 Fed.Cl. 372, 392 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Plaintiffs challenge to the ABCMR\u2019s reliance on the 2008, 2009, and 2010 OERs has some merit. It is true that a correction board\u2019s reliance on OERs in making fitness determinations generally is justified. <em>See Rebosky, </em>60 Fed.Cl. at 311-14 (relying extensively on plaintiffs OERs to conclude that \u201csubstantial evidence [supports] the ABCMR\u2019s conclusion to separate the plaintiff from service\u201d); <em>see also Joslyn, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 392-93 (same re: fitness determination). In this case, however, while Plaintiffs OERs are overwhelmingly positive, they do not directly address which of Plaintiffs specific physical impairments, <em>i.e., </em>his bilateral foot impairments, shoulder injury, or wrist injury, were or were not unfitting. As such, Plaintiff is correct that, had the ABCMR <em>merely </em>analyzed his OERs and drawn contradictory conclusions that his shoulder and wrist conditions were unfitting, but that his bilateral foot conditions were not, the ABCMR\u2019s decision would be implausible and, therefore, arbitrary and capricious. <em>Cf. Van Cleave v. United States, </em>66 Fed.Cl. 133, 136 (2005) (explaining that where a \u201crational connection ] between the facts found and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>choices made\u201d is lacking, or the correction board\u2019s decision is \u201cimplausible,\u201d that decision is unlawful).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In this case, however, neither the PEB nor the ABCMR relied <em>solely </em>on Plaintiffs OERs to justify the fitness determinations as to his shoulder, wrist, and bilateral foot conditions. Instead, the PEB (and by implication the ABCMR) relied on, <em>inter alia, </em>Plaintiffs surgical history, difficulty lifting objects over five pounds, X-rays showing degenerative changes in the scapholunate joint, and functional loss limitations, as evidence that his shoulder and wrist conditions were unfitting. AR 19 (March 25, 2010 PEB decision). That same evidence, however, did not address Plaintiffs bilateral foot conditions. Therefore, the PEB (and the ABCMR by implication) relied on Plaintiffs November 2009 orthopedic consult, Plaintiffs passage of the APFT as late as April 2008, despite suffering from <em>pes planus </em>since \u201cat least 2002,\u201d \u201cminimal analgesic use on an occasional basis,\u201d <em>and </em>his \u201coutstanding\u201d OERs through 2009 as evidence that his bilateral foot conditions were not unfitting. AR 19. In other words, the ABCMR did not differentiate between Plaintiffs conditions exclusively on the basis of his OERs.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In light of evidence before the PEB and ABCMR showing Plaintiffs bilateral foot conditions were not unfitting, it was not \u201cerroneous\u201d for the ABCMR to reference the OERs as supporting evidence, since they were probative of the impact of Plaintiffs foot conditions on his performance. <em>See </em>Army Reg. 623-105 \u00b6 1-8 (explaining that OERs are part of the Officer Evaluation System, a system that evaluates potential for promotion based on an officer\u2019s \u201cperformance\u201d); Army Reg. 623-3 (Performance evaluations analyze \u201chow well a Soldier performs his or her assigned tasks.\u201d). The 2008, 2009, and 2010 OERs demonstrate that Plaintiff suffered from bilateral foot conditions while exhibiting \u201coutstanding\u201d (Gov\u2019t SR II at 12) or \u201csuperb\u201d performance (AR 59), and thus it was not arbitrary or capricious for the ABCMR to rely, in part, on that information as evidence that Plaintiffs bilateral foot conditions were not unfitting. <em>See Rebosky, </em>60 Fed.Cl. at 311-14 (reviewing OERs to evaluate lawfulness of ABCMR\u2019s decision); <em>see also Joslyn, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 392-93 (upholding correction board\u2019s fitness determination because plaintiffs OERs were evidence \u201cthat a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d (internal quotation omitted)). Although the court might have found the OERs less probative than the ABCMR, that is not the court\u2019s role. For these reasons, the court has determined that the ABCMR\u2019s reliance on Plaintiffs OERs was not arbitrary or capricious; and, mindful that the \u201cquestion is not whether substantial evidence weighs against the [ABCMR\u2019s] decision but whether substantial evidence supports it,\u201d <em>Joslyn, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 392, the court has determined that the ABCMR\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Finally, the court\u2019s January 25, 2013 Order directed the ABCMR to \u201cconsider whether Plaintiffs foot conditions contributed to rendering him unfit.\u201d <em>Meidl II, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 578; <em>see also </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216a(b) (providing that disability ratings \u201cshall take into account all medical conditions, whether individually or collectively, that render the member unfit to perform the duties of the member\u2019s office, grade, rank, or rating\u201d). Plaintiff has not shown by \u201ccogent and clearly convincing evidence\u201d that the ABCMR failed to comply with the court\u2019s Order, or with section 1216a(b). <em>See Wronke, </em>787 F.2d at 1576. The court is satisfied that the ABCMR on remand reviewed the relevant regulatory and statutory requirements, all relevant evidence, and came to a reasonable conclusion that the PEB acted within its discretion and authority in concluding that Plaintiffs \u201cfoot conditions did not contribute to his unfitness\u201d (Gov\u2019t SR II at 12). <em>See Volk v.

PEBs have authority to evaluate a Soldier\u2019s physical disability based on the following three factors: (1) whether the Soldier is physically fit or unfit to perform the duties of the Soldier's office, grade, rank, or rating; (2) whether the disability is of a permanent nature; and (3) whether the disability meets the criteria established by law for compensation. <em>See </em>Army Reg. 635-40 \u00b6\u00b6 4\u201419(a)(1)\u2014(3). If the PEB determines that a Soldier is unfit because of a physical disability and is entitled to benefits, the PEB determines a percentage rating for each disability rendering the Soldier unfit for duty. <em>See </em>Army Reg. 635-40 14-19(0.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b622-18\">. The Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities is used in deriving percentage ratings. <em>See </em>Army Reg. 635-40 14-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\">.

Section 1216a(b) provides that disability ratings \"shall take into account <em>all medical conditions, whether individually or collectively, </em>that render the member unfit to perform the duties of the member\u2019s office, grade, rank, or rating.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216a(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. Plaintiff also contends that on remand the ABCMR erred in analyzing this issue in terms of the \"combined\u201d effect of his conditions on overall fitness, and implies that the \u201ccombined\u201d effect is distinct from the \"collective\u201d effect of conditions. PI. Mot. JAR 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. Army Regulation 635-40 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\"><em>There is no legal requirement in arriving at the rated degree of incapacity to rate a physical condition which is not in itself considered disqualifying for military service when a Soldier is found unfit because of another condition that is disqualifying. </em>Only the unfitting conditions or defects and those which contribute to unfitness will be considered in arriving at the rated degree of incapacity warranting retirement or separation for disability. Any non-ratable defects or conditions will be listed in item 8 of DA Form 199 (Physical Evaluation Board Proceedings), but will be annotated as non-ratable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Army Reg. 635-40, \u00b6 3.5d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. The court also directed the ABCMR on remand to consider \"whether Plaintiff\u2019s sleep apnea became unfitting after the MEB and PEB proceedings, but before Plaintiff\u2019s separation from the Army.\u201d <em>Meidl II, </em>108 Fed.Cl. at 578. That issue was considered on remand. Gov't SR II at 13. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion For Judgment On The Administrative Record does not challenge the ABCMR\u2019s remand decision regarding this issue. Accordingly, this issue is waived. <em>See United States v.
