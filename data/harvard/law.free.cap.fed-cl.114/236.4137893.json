Sec\u2019y of</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\"><em>Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 10-850, 2013 WL 3745900 (Fed.Cl. June 25, 2013) (\u201cDecision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">The petitioner alleges that the influenza vaccine, which she received on October 1, 2008, caused her to develop autoimmune transverse myelitis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and associated injuries. An evidentiary hearing was held over two days in August 2012. The chief special master, applying the Federal Circuit\u2019s precedent in <em>Broekelschen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>618 F.3d 1339 (Fed.Cir.2010), and <em>Lombardi v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>656 F.3d 1343 (Fed.Cir.2011), found that the petitioner was not entitled to recover because she had not suffered from autoimmune transverse myelitis but rather had developed transverse myelitis as a result a previously-undiscovered hemorrhage of a cavernoma,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was surgically removed on July 31, 2012. In the alternative, the chief special master, applying the <em>Althen </em>test, found that the petitioner had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for her injury. The chief special master determined that petitioner had not established that her symptoms were \u201cprimary and autoimmune\u201d\u2014that is, caused by the vaccine\u2014and further found that they were \u201ca secondary effect of the trauma caused by her hemorrhaging cavernoma.\u201d Decision at 31. In her motion for review, the petitioner contends that the chief special master\u2019s decision denying her recovery on these grounds was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>As discussed below, because the court finds that the chief special master\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, petitioner\u2019s motion is denied and the decision of the chief special master is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">On December 21, 2010, Ms. Dillon filed a petition under the Vaccine Act. On March 4, 2011, after reviewing the petition, the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommended against compensation. Resp.\u2019s Report. Petitioner then filed additional medical records as well as expert reports from her treating neurologist, Dr. Sidney A. Houff. Pet\u2019s Ex. 12. Respondent then filed an expert report by Dr. Thomas Leist, an expert in neuroimmunology, arguing that petitioner\u2019s injury \u201cstemmed from a preexisting vascular malformation.\u201d Resp.\u2019s Ex. A at 8, 10. Petitioner then filed an expert report from Dr. Lawrence Steinman, an expert in neuroimmunology, and Dr. Robert M. Kessler, an expert in neuroradiology. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 44. Petitioner also noted that Dr. Houff s status as an expert witness was uncertain due to personal health issues. Pet.\u2019s Status Report at 1. Finally, respondent filed an expert report by Chip Truwit, an expert in neuroradiology, along with a supplemental expert report by Dr. Leist, to address Dr. Kessler\u2019s report. Resp.\u2019s Exs. B-C.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">On August 20, 2012, petitioner filed imaging confirming that a lesion that was surgically removed from her spinal cord on July 31, 2012 had been a cavernoma. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 63 at 64. On August 23-24, 2012, hearings were held in Nashville, Tennessee, during which testimony was heard from the expert witnesses. Decision at 3. On June 25, 2013, following attempts of the parties to resolve the case informally, the chief special master issued a decision denying compensation. On July 25, 2013, petitioner filed a motion for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-1\">B. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b251-2\">1. Petitioner\u2019s Medical History</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">Ms. Dillon was born on July 23, 1957. Pet\u2019s Ex. 2 at 1. Her medical history includes depression, anxiety, kidney stones, obesity, sleep apnea, and a hysterectomy. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 11 at 1. She had no noted neurological problems before October 2008. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 1. Her medical records indicated that on February 14, 2006, she received a skin test for tuberculosis and a flu vaccination without any identified problems. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 2 at 2. She also received a measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination on May 11, 2006 with no reported side effects. <em>Id. </em>Two years later, on September 30, 2008, petitioner conferred with Dr. Eric Smith, a doctor of osteopathic medicine, about the possibility of gastric bypass surgery. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 11 at 5. Dr. Smith\u2019s notes indicate that petitioner was suffering from morbid obesity, back pain, and elevated concentrations of lipids in her blood plasma. <em>Id. </em>Petitioner received the trivalent flu vaccine at issue on October 1, 2008. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 2 at 14. On October 19, 2008, petitioner went to the emergency room at St. Claire Regional Medical Center with complaints of severe back pain that had started the day before. Pet\u2019s Ex. 3 at 163. An abdominal ultrasound and an abdominal computed tomography (\u201cCT\u201d) scan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were performed with negative results for kidney stones and positive results for diffuse fatty gallstones. <em>Id. </em>at 168-69. She was diagnosed with acute pain, lumbar strain, and a left ovarian cyst; she was then treated with pain relievers and released. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 1; Pet.\u2019s Ex. 3 at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">On October 21,2008, petitioner returned to the emergency room with complaints of back pain, radiating leg pain, constipation, and moderate sensory loss in her legs. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 3 at 177. She was transferred to the University of Kentucky Medical Center (\u201cUKMC\u201d) that day and remained there until October 24, 2008. <em>See </em>Transcript at 90, 177-79. On October 22, 2008, a magnetic resonance im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>age (MRI)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was taken of her spine, which showed degenerative disc changes in the L5-S1 disc. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 4 at 79, 86. Another MRI showed ascending lesions of white matter in the lumbothoracic spine, which are indicative of inflammation. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 4 at 35-36. This second MRI showed signal abnormality and suggested a small, focal lesion within the distal thoracic spinal cord, centered at the T9/T10 disc space. <em>Id. </em>at 36,85-86. A hemosiderin deposit, which signals that blood was in the area, was detectable near the lesion. Transcript at 269-72; <em>see </em>Resp.\u2019s Ex. C at 4. The MRI also showed a signal enhancement at the T2 level that spanned an area of six vertebral segments. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 4 at 36, 85-86. Additionally, nearly complete resolution of vaguely observable edema was discernible within the mid and distal portions of the thoracic spinal cord. <em>Id. </em>This finding was deemed to be consistent with transverse myelitis. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner was administered methylprednisolone, an intravenous steroid which is used to treat transverse myelitis, but she showed only modest improvement. <em>Id.; </em>Transcript at 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">On October 24, 2008, a lumbar puncture study was performed, showing an abnormal elevated red blood cell count in tubes one and four. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 4 at 89. At this time, none of petitioner\u2019s physicians appear to have considered the possibility of a spinal bleed. <em>See id. </em>On October 27, 2008, Ms. Dillon was examined by a neurologist, who stated that she was suffering from transverse myelitis, \u201csecondary to possibly the flu vaccine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. On October 29, 2008, she was diagnosed with transverse myelitis. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 36. On discharge, she was sent for inpatient rehabilitation at Cardinal Hill Rehabilitation Hospital from October 29, 2008 to Dec. 11, 2008. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 5 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On June 9, 2009, Ms. Dillon was readmitted to UKMC following a neurology consult there. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 4 at 397-98, 404. While petitioner showed some improvement from 2008, she had not returned to her baseline condition. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 5 at 944-45. Additionally, she reported new vision problems, for which she was admitted to the hospital. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 4 at 397-98, 404. While hospitalized, she received further neurologic evaluation. She also received an MRI, which revealed to the radiologist that the lesion shown in earlier MRIs was \u201cmost suggestive of a cavernous malformation with remote hemorrhage.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 28 at 58. Her cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated myelin basic protein levels, which is indicative of trauma, infection, stroke, or disease in the central nervous system. <em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">On April 12, 2011, four months after filing this vaccine claim, Ms. Dillon met with Dr. Houff, who noted that the problems with sensation in her legs had shown minimal improvement since June 2009, and he attributed her ongoing symptoms to the earlier episode of transverse myelitis, which had occurred three weeks after she had received the flu vaccine. Pet\u2019s Ex. 59 at 83-84. On May 10, 2011, she received an MRI of her thoracic spine, which showed a lesion at the T9/T10 disc base. Pet\u2019s Ex. 28 at 21. According to the evaluating physician,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">the size, configuration, and signal intensity characteristic of the lesion [has] remained stable over the past 2 years. There [also] remains speckled punctuate enhancement of the lesion and evidence of prior hemorrhage. The lack of interval change overall ... favors the diagnosis of a vascular malformation or cavernous angioma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">On May 27, 2012, Ms. Dillon received another MRI, which showed that the lesion had grown approximately 200 times in volume since October 2008. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 50 at 4-5; Transcript at 149, 151-52. On June 7, 2012, Ms. Dillon received a consult from Dr. Abdulnasser Alhajeri, a radiologist, concerning the lesion, in which Dr. Alhajeri observed that the petitioner\u2019s symptoms \u201chad progressed over the last year and a half.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 50 at 4-5. In a separate consultation on that day, Dr. Houff expressed concern that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Ms. Dillon may have developed an arteriovenous malformation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in addition to what he had believed to be a vaccine-related event. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 55 at 4. As a result of escalating symptoms, she became confined to a wheelchair. <em>Id. </em>The lesion was ultimately determined to be a cavernous malformation and was surgically resected on July 31, 2012. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 63; Pet.\u2019s Ex. 64 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">2. Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">During trial before the chief special master, petitioner presented experts to support her theory of entitlement based on her contention that she suffered a post-vaccination transverse myelitis caused by the flu vaccine she received on October 1, 2008. The respondent presented experts who took the position that Ms. Dillon\u2019s neurological problems stemmed from the cavernoma that was evident but ignored when Ms. Dillon was first examined and was removed on July 31, 2012 after it had grown dramatically in size. It is undisputed that once a cavernoma becomes symptomatic, either by growing or bleeding, it can create \u201cthe same constellation of neurological problems ... [one] might see when there is inflammation in the spinal cord.\u201d Transcript at 23-24; <em>see also </em>Transcript at 88; Resp.\u2019s Ex. G. Petitioner and respondent presented testimony from two experts at trial. Their credentials appear in chief special master\u2019s decision and are not repeated here. Decision at 13-16. The chief special master accepted each of these experts as well-qualified. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Petitioner\u2019s experts presented evidence that, although a cavernoma was present in October, 2008, her injuries were caused by the flu vaccine that she received on October 1, 2008 and not by the cavernoma in her spinal cord. Dr. Steinman, petitioner\u2019s expert neuroimmunologist, presented an opinion that the flu vaccine caused an autoimmune response based on the biologic mechanism of molecular mimicry and relied on peer reviewed journals and his experience as an immunologist. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 29; Transcript at 25-26. According to him, a flu vaccine could trigger an immune response targeting the myelin basic protein that provides a protective sheath around the body\u2019s nerve fibers due to the structural similarity between components of the vaccine and the spinal cord. <em>Id. </em>In his view, the best evidence of autoimmune transverse myelitis was the results of Ms. Dillon\u2019s October 2008 MRIs and the June 2009 cerebrospinal fluid test showing elevated myelin basic protein levels, though he admitted that this could be caused by a trauma, as well. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 29 at 21; Pet.\u2019s Ex. 28 at 49. Additionally, he relied on the evidence of speckled punctuate enhancement in Ms. Dillon\u2019s October MRIs and the timing of her symptom onset in reaching his conclusion. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 29 at 22. Further, he opined that the cavernoma was not a significant factor in the injury. Transcript at 91-92. He explained that diagnostic confusion may arise when distinguishing between inflammatory disorders such as transverse myelitis and disorders involving spinal cord tumors. <em>Id. </em>He explained that the lesion found could have been caused by the inflammation associated with transverse myelitis, though he admitted that he was not aware of medical literature indicating that transverse myelitis could cause a cavernoma to grow in the spinal cord. Id. at 34, 91-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Dr. Kessler, petitioner\u2019s expert neuroradiologist, presented testimony based on radiologic evidence from reviewing MRI images of Ms. Dillon\u2019s brain, orbits, and spine taken between October 21, 2008 and March 27, 2012. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 44. He noted degenerative changes in her lower back and mid-shoulder area and increased T2 signals in her distal thoracic spinal cord. <em>Id. </em>at 1-3. He argued that these findings were consistent with transverse myelitis, although he admitted that they were non-specific and would also be consistent with inflammatory swelling, demyelination, or a tumor. <em>Id. </em>at 4; Transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>at 117-18. He also relied on the timing of her injury in coming to his conclusion. Pet\u2019s Ex. 44 at 4. While he acknowledged that Ms. Dillon\u2019s lesion seemed like a cavernoma, he dismissed a connection between it and her neurological problems associated with transverse myelitis. Transcript at 145,161.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Respondent\u2019s experts presented evidence that Ms. Dillon did not have an autoimmune reaction to the flu vaccine she received on October 1, 2008 and that her neurological problems were the result of a bleeding cavernoma in her spinal cord. Dr. Leist, respondent\u2019s expert neuroimmunologist, presented testimony challenging the petitioner\u2019s theory that Ms. Dillon\u2019s injury could be best described as autoimmune transverse myelitis. Transcript at 173. He noted that Ms. Dillon had previously received two flu vaccines without any reported issues, that the results of her imaging and spinal tap established that there had been bleeding in her spine, that she had a cavernoma, and that the relatively sudden onset of symptoms occurred around the time that the cavernoma likely began to bleed. Resp.\u2019s Ex. A at 6-7. Referring to Ms. Dillon\u2019s MRI images, he stated that the faint enhancement shown over time was not consistent with an inflammatory, demyelinating lesion; while that would decrease in size over time, Ms. Dillon\u2019s continued to grow. <em>Id. </em>He also noted that Ms. Dillon\u2019s neurologic problems did not improve much after the onset of symptoms, and that they did not respond to a steroid treatment as would be expected with inflammatory or demyelinating conditions. Transcript at 174. Referring to her cerebrospinal fluid testing, he noted that it showed modestly elevated myelin basic protein, which he explained is a non-specific marker of tissue injury. Resp.\u2019s Ex. B at 1. He further explained that the tests did not show elevated levels of inflammatory cells, which would be present if the claimed massive inflammatory changes had occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Dr. Truwit, respondent\u2019s neuroradiologist, presented testimony regarding the MRI images showing a vascular malformation in the distal aspect of Ms. Dillon\u2019s spinal cord and traces of hemosiderin as speckled punctuate enhancement. Transcript at 259-60, 272-73. He stated that early images showed a lesion that could be caused by various events, including trauma or tumor, but that later images made it more likely that the lesion was the early presentation of a small vascular malformation. Transcript at 278. Additionally, he noted that the hemosiderin deposition in Ms. Dillon\u2019s spinal cord became more evident over time. Resp.\u2019s Ex. C at 5. Relying on these findings along with the finding of red blood cells in her cerebrospinal fluid, he opined that the lesion was a cavernoma. <em>Id. </em>He further opined that Ms. Dillon\u2019s symptom onset occurred around the time that the cavernoma first began to hemorrhage. <em>Id. </em>Relying on his experience, he stated that the hemosiderin deposition shown does not occur in cases of autoimmune transverse myelitis. <em>Id. </em>He did not think that there was any connection between the vaccine and the cavernoma itself, and stated that drawing such a connection did not fit the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">C. The Special Master\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On June 25, 2013, the chief special master issued a decision denying Ms. Dillon compensation under the Vaccine Act. The chief special master determined that Ms. Dillon did not suffer from primary autoimmune transverse myelitis following her flu vaccination in October, 2008. The chief special master concluded, based on the expert testimony she received and medical records she reviewed, that Ms. Dillon\u2019s neurological problems were the result of a hemorrhaging cavernoma. Relying on the Federal Circuit\u2019s decisions in <em>Broekelschen </em>and <em>Lombardi, </em>the chief special master concluded that where, as here, she found that petitioner suffered from an injury other than the one alleged by petitioner, this determination precluded the finding of causation in petitioner\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">For these same reasons, the chief special master concluded in the alternative that petitioner could not prevail under the <em>Althen </em>test established by the Federal Circuit. Specifically, the chief special master found that petitioner failed to provide a theory causally connecting the vaccine to her injury. The chief special master also found that petitioner could not establish a logical sequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>cause and effect showing that the vaccine led to an autoimmune response and was thus the cause of her injury. On July 25, 2013, petitioner filed this motion for review. Having been briefed and argued, the matter is now ripe for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">This court has jurisdiction to review the decisions of a special master in a Vaccine Act case upon a motion from the petitioner. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2). The court uses three distinct standards of review in Vaccine Act cases: findings of fact are reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard, questions of law under the not in accordance with law standard, and discretionary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Masias v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>634 F.3d 1283, 1287-88 (Fed.Cir. 2011); <em>Munn v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1992); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B). However, the court does not \u201creweigh the factual evidence,\u201d \u201cassess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence,\u201d or \u201cexamine the probative value of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Lampe v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>219 F.3d 1357, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 871). If the special master \u201chas considered the relevant evidence of record, drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision,\u201d then \u201creversible error is extremely difficult to demonstrate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1360 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Hines ex rel. Sevier v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1528 (Fed.Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">A. Vaccine Act Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The Vaccine Act created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (\u201cVaccine Program\u201d), which provides compensation for vaccine-related injuries or deaths. Under the Vaccine Program, there are two means of recovery: claims based on injuries listed in the Vaccine Injury Table (\u201cTable\u201d) and claims based on injuries not listed in the Table, known as off-Table claims. In a Table claim, a petitioner is granted a presumption of causation if he or she shows that he or she received a vaccine listed in the Table, that he or she suffered an injury listed in the Table, and that the injury occurred within the prescribed time period. <em>See Andreu v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>569 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2009) (describing Table eases). In an off-Table case, a petitioner who received a vaccine listed in the Table but suffered an injury not listed in the table does not receive a presumption of causation, and instead must prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Moberly v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>592 F.3d 1315, 1321 (Fed.Cir. 2010) (describing off-Table cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">In order to prove causation in an off-Table case, the petitioner must show that the injury \u201cwas caused by a vaccine\u201d listed in the Table. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aall(e)(l)(C)(ii)(I). The Federal Circuit explained the evidentiary burden placed on petitioners in <em>Althen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs.: </em>in order to show causation-in-faet, a petitioner must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWc\">show by preponderant evidence that the vaccination brought about her injury by providing: (1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2005). This showing of causation requires \u201ca reputable medical or scientific explanation that pertains specifically to the petitioner\u2019s case, although the explanation need only be \u2018legally probable, not medically or scientifically certain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Broekelschen, </em>618 F.3d at 1345 (quoting <em>Knudsen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>35 F.3d 543, 548-49 (Fed.Cir.1994)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Once the petitioner satisfies this burden under <em>Althen, </em>he or she is \u201centitled to recover unless [the respondent] shows, also by a preponderance of evidence, that the injury was in fact caused by factors unrelated to the vaccine.\u201d <em>Walther v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>485 F.3d 1146, 1151-52 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Whitecotton v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>17 F.3d 374, 376 (Fed.Cir.1994), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Shalala v. Whitecotton, </em>514 U.S. 268, 115 S.Ct. 1477, 131 L.Ed.2d 374 (1995)) (citing <em>Knudsen, </em>35 F.3d at 547). Importantly, the evidence presented to establish an unrelated cause of injury may also be considered in determining whether the petitioner has met the burden of establishing a prima facie case in the first instance. <em>Stone v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>676 F.3d 1373, 1379-80 (Fed.Cir.2012). As the Federal Circuit explained, \u201cevidence of other possible sources of injury can be relevant not only to the \u2018factors unrelated\u2019 defense, but also to whether a prima facie showing has been made [under the <em>Althen </em>test] that the vaccine was a substantial factor in causing the injury in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>de Bazan v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>539 F.3d 1347, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2008); <em>Pafford v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>451 F.3d 1352, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In addition, the Federal Circuit has recognized that there may be situations in which the petitioner\u2019s injury is disputed, in which case the question of injury must be resolved before turning to the question of causation. <em>Broekelschen, </em>618 F.3d at 1346. In these situations, the symptoms presented by the petitioner could be explained by multiple injuries, and the special master may be required to \u201cfirst determine which injury [is] best supported by the evidence presented in the record before applying the <em>Althen </em>test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Federal Circuit has stated that \u201cidentifying the injury is a prerequisite to the <em>[Althen] </em>analysis\u201d when \u201cthe injury itself is in dispute, the proposed injuries differ significantly in their pathology, and the question of causation turns on which injury [the petitioner] suffered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, in the event that the special master determines that the petitioner cannot demonstrate that he or she actually suffers from the injury alleged, compensation may be denied without reaching an <em>Althen </em>analysis. <em>Lombardi, </em>656 F.3d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Application of <em>Broekelschen</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Petitioner\u2019s motion for review is largely dedicated to challenging both the correctness of the Federal Circuit\u2019s <em>Broekelschen </em>decision and the chief special master\u2019s application of the test enumerated in that decision. Petitioner argues that <em>Broekelschen </em>was wrongly decided by the Federal Circuit and should not be followed. In addition, petitioner argues that the chief special master misapplied <em>Broelcelschen </em>when she concluded that petitioner\u2019s injury for the purposes of the Vaccine Act was a bleeding cavernoma and not autoimmune transverse myelitis. Petitioner contends that all of the experts agreed that the injury at issue was the episode of transverse myelitis petitioner experienced in 2008 and thus the sole question before the court was whether the cause of that injury was the flu vaccine. More specifically, petitioner argues that the chief special master conflated the issues of \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201ccausation,\u201d causing her to apply a <em>Broekelschen </em>test when it was not required and heightening the burden on petitioner. According to petitioner, the question of alternate cause should have been considered during the respondent\u2019s portion of an <em>Althen </em>analysis instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">With regard to petitioner\u2019s first contention, respondent argues that this court must follow <em>Broekelschen </em>regardless of whether it believes the decision to be correct and the court agrees. This court is bound by the precedent of the Federal Circuit and must follow it. <em>Strickland v. United States, </em>423 F.3d 1335, 1338 &amp; n. 3 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>First Hartford Corp. Pension Plan &amp; Trust v. United States, </em>194 F.3d 1279, 1290 n. 3 (Fed.Cir.1999). As a result, this court cannot set aside the chief special master\u2019s decision simply because she relied on <em>Broekelschen </em>in making her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>With regard to petitioner\u2019s contention that the chief special master erred in her application of <em>Broekelschen, </em>respondent argues that the chief special master\u2019s decision to first determine whether petitioner\u2019s injury was a hemorrhage or bleed from a cavernoma rather than an autoimmune injury was proper under <em>Broekelschen. </em>Respondent argues that both the cavernoma and the autoimmune response could have been caused by the flu vaccine, making a determination of the actual injury that gave rise to the transverse myelitis necessary before moving to an <em>Althen </em>analysis. According to respondent, petitioner\u2019s transverse myelitis was a sequelae or secondary result of the injury, not the injury itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Whether <em>Broekelschen </em>applies where, as here, the questions of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d appear to be intertwined is greatly debated in petitioner and respondent\u2019s briefs. The court, however, finds that it is not necessary to resolve that question. Instead, because the chief special master in this case also performed an <em>Althen </em>analysis as an alternative to her <em>Broekelschen </em>analysis, and the <em>Althen </em>analysis is fully dispositive of the issue, the court will turn to the parties\u2019 challenges to that analysis instead.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> So long it was rational, based on the record as a whole, to find that petitioner had failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained an autoimmune response to the 2008 flu vaccination and thus failed to demonstrate that there was a logical sequence of cause and effect, the chief special master\u2019s decision must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">C. Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Application of <em>Althen</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Petitioner argues that the chief special master\u2019s <em>Althen </em>analysis must be overturned because (1) the record evidence established a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that petitioner had suffered an autoimmune response to her flu vaccination, causing inflammation in her spine that resulted in transverse myelitis, and (2) the chief special master impermissibly required petitioner to eliminate alternative causes rather than requiring respondent to prove them after shifting the burden. Petitioner argues that once she had established her prima facie ease that the vaccine caused her injury, the burden should have shifted to respondent to prove that the cavernoma was the sole cause of petitioner\u2019s transverse myelitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Respondent argues that this court must uphold the chief special master\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe record evidence strongly militates against a finding that Ms. Dillon suffered from an autoimmune episode of transverse myelitis.\u201d Decision at 31. According to respondent, the resulting conclusion that petitioner failed to satisfy prong two of <em>Althen </em>and make a prima facie case is well supported by the record as a whole. In addition, respondent argues that the chief special master did not require petitioner to eliminate alternative causes; rather, respondent argues, the chief special master, consistent with <em>Stone, </em>properly considered the totality of the evidence. Relying on <em>Stone, </em>the respondent explained that the chief special master was allowed to consider evidence of other possible sources of injury in deciding \u201cwhether a prima facie showing has been made that the vaccine was a substantial factor in causing the injury in question\u201d in addition to \u201cthe \u2018factors unrelated defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1379-80 (citing <em>de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1353; <em>Pafford, </em>451 F.3d at 1358-59).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">The court agrees with respondent that the chief special master\u2019s decision that petitioner did not suffer an autoimmune response to her flu vaccination and thus did not make out a prima facie case is supported by the record and therefore is not arbitrary or capricious. The court also agrees with respondent that the chief special master did not impermissibly shift the burden to petitioner to eliminate alternative causes and demonstrate that the cavernoma was not the cause of her transverse myelitis. Rather, the court agrees with respondent that the chief special master, consistent with <em>Stone, </em>properly considered all of the evidence, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>eluding the evidence purporting to demonstrate petitioner\u2019s lack of autoimmune response as well as the evidence regarding her cavernoma, in concluding that petitioner had failed to make a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In reaching this conclusion, the court is mindful that in an off-Table case such as this, the petitioner has the burden of satisfying all three prongs of the <em>Althen </em>test and that failure to meet any one of the three prongs is fatal to her claim. <em>See, e.g., Campbell v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>97 Fed.Cl. 650 (2011) (citing <em>Capizzano v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>440 F.3d 1317, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2006)) (\u201cA plaintiff must satisfy all three of <em>Althen\u2019s </em>prongs by preponderant evidence.\u201d). Second, the court is mindful of the very limited role it has in reviewing the chief special master\u2019s findings of fact. As the Federal Circuit has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">The statute makes clear that, on review, the Court of Federal Claims is not to second guess the special masters [sic] fact-intensive conclusions; the standard of review is uniquely deferential for what is essentially a judicial process. Our eases make clear that, on our review ... we remain equally deferential. That level of deference is especially apt in a case in which the medical evidence of causation is in dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Deribeaux ex rel. Deribeaux v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>717 F.3d 1363, 1366-67 (Fed.Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Hodges v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>9 F.3d 958, 961 (Fed.Cir.1993)) (alteration in original). Thus, the court cannot \u201creweigh the evidence ... [and must uphold the decision] if the special master\u2019s conclusion [is] based on evidence in the record that [is] not wholly implausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367 (quoting <em>Lampe, </em>219 F.3d at 1363) (some alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Here, based on the evidence presented to the chief special master with regard to the second prong of the <em>Althen </em>test, the court finds that the chief special master\u2019s decision must be affirmed. Specifically, under prong two of <em>Althen, </em>in order to establish a prima facie case the petitioner had the burden of establishing a logical sequence of cause and effect between her receipt of the flu vaccination and an autoimmune response. Petitioner endeavored to prove that she had an autoimmune response to her vaccination by presenting evidence to show that she had an inflammatory reaction to the vaccine, which her experts explained proved an autoimmune response.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The respondent countered the petitioner\u2019s evidence with evidence to show that petitioner did not have an inflammatory reaction to the vaccine and thus did not suffer an autoimmune response to the flu vaccination in 2008. The testimony and exhibits presented by respondent in response to petitioner\u2019s theory included evidence that (1) symptoms that typically indicate an inflammatory reaction were lacking, including a lack of fever, a lack of significantly elevated white blood cell count, less diffuse sensory loss, lack of oligoclonal banding, and lack of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid; (2) petitioner did not have a significant response to her steroid treatment; (3) petitioner had received previous flu vaccines without incident; (4) her radiologic imaging was inconsistent with an inflammatory, demyelinating lesion because it did not diminish over time; (5) there was a cavernoma at the epicenter of the petitioner\u2019s MRI images at the time of her alleged autoimmune response; (6) there were hemosiderin deposits evident in petitioner\u2019s MRI images, which are indicators of past bleeding at the cavernoma site; and (7) autoimmune transverse myelitis does not cause hemosiderin deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">While the petitioner provided evidence to show that (1) the degree of transverse myelitis shown by petitioner\u2019s 2008 MRIs is too great to be explained by a spinal bleed; (2) there is no previously reported case of an adult experiencing swelling in six segments of the spine as a result of a bleed of the size of the small cavernoma at issue at the time of the injury; (3) certain signatures in MRI images that would have indicated a spinal bleed are lacking; and (4) petitioner\u2019s treating physicians diagnosed her with an autoimmune response and opined that the petitioner\u2019s cavernoma was not associated with petitioner\u2019s transverse myelitis, the chief special master determined that this evidence was not sufficient to overcome respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>evidence. The chief special master thus concluded that petitioner had failed to establish a logical sequence of cause and effect with regard to the vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Petitioner disagrees with the chief special master\u2019s conclusion based on the evidence presented. However, on review, this court cannot reweigh or reexamine the evidence presented to the chief special master. <em>Deribeaux, </em>717 F.3d at 1366-67; <em>see, e.g., Porter v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>663 F.3d 1242, 1254 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201cThis court does not reweigh the factual evidence or assess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence, nor does it examine the probative value of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d). Moreover, this court must affirm the chief special master if her decision is not \u201cwholly implausible.\u201d <em>Deribeaux, </em>717 F.3d at 1367. Here, in light of the evidence discussed above, the court finds that the chief special master\u2019s conclusion that petitioner did not have an autoimmune response to the flu vaccine and thus could not link the vaccine to her injury is not \u201cwholly implausible.\u201d Accordingly, the court must affirm the chief special master\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed to establish the logical sequence of cause and effect necessary to make a prima facie case under prong two of <em>Althen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Additionally, the court finds that petitioner\u2019s contention that the chief special master required petitioner to eliminate alternative causes and prove that her cavernoma was not the cause of her transverse myelitis is without merit. While the chief special master did use conelusory language with regard to her finding that the evidence indicated that petitioner had a bleeding cavernoma in her analysis of the second prong of <em>Althen, </em>that finding followed her first, and critical, finding that petitioner had failed to establish that she had an autoimmune response to her 2008 flu vaccination. Because the petitioner failed to establish a prima facie case that she had an autoimmune reaction to the 2008 flu vaccination, which was the basis for her claim, the issue of burden shifting did not arise. Petitioner\u2019s objections to the chief special master\u2019s <em>Althen </em>analysis on this ground also must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">As the decision of the chief special master was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law, petitioner\u2019s motion for review is DENIED and the chief special master\u2019s decision is SUSTAINED. The clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\">.
