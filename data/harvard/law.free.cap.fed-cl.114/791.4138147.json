FIRESTONE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AFY\">Pending before the court is the motion of defendant, the United States (\u201cthe government\u201d), to dismiss, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or, in the alternative, 12(b)(6) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d), the complaint filed by plaintiff, Robert A. Green (\u201cMr. Green\u201d). In his complaint, Mr. Green \u201cclaims entitlement to damages from defendant United States of [America] for funds erroneously, mistakenly, and negligently paid to another,\u201d by the government from a Legacy Treasury Direct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> account (\u201cLegacy Account\u201d) in the United States Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d). Comp, at 1, EOF No. 1. The United States argues that the complaint does not state a plausible claim against the United States within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and thus the complaint should be dismissed. In the alternative, the government argues that, even if this court has jurisdiction over the claim, the plaintiff cannot state a claim for which relief can be granted. For the reasons that follow, the court finds that this court does not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims; thus, the case must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1) because the subject regulations do not provide a right to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">According to the complaint, Mr. Green was once named as the sole beneficiary of the Legacy Account<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established by his aunt, Ann C. Spiegel. Compl. at \u00b6 4. Apparently, when she first established the account, it was payable on death (\u201cPOD\u201d) to Mr. Green. <em>Id. </em>On August 13, 2008, Ms. Spiegel executed a durable power of attorney appointing Mark Samuels, who was also her nephew, as her attorney-in-fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> App. to Mot. to Dismiss at 22, ECF No. 5; <em>see </em>Compl. at \u00b6 7, 9. Thereafter, on September 25, 2008, an attorney, Howard S. Bornstein, electronically submitted a \u201cLegacy Treasury Direct Transaction Request\u201d to the Treasury Retail Securities Site on behalf of Ms. Spiegel requesting a registration change from \u201cAnn C. Spiegel POD Robert Green to Ann C. Spiegel, Trastee for the Ann C. Spiegel Revocable Trust [\u201cSpiegel Trust\u201d] dated August 13, 2008.\u201d App. to Mot. to Dismiss at 25-27; <em>see </em>Compl. at \u00b6 9. The request was signed for Ms. Spiegel by Mr. Samuels, her attorney-in-fact. <em>Id. </em>According to the records from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service in Parkersburg, West Virginia, the Treasury processed the request and changed the registration on October 14, 2008 at 2:14 p.m. Eastern Time. App. to Mot. to Dismiss at 28; <em>see </em>Compl. at \u00b6 10. Ms. Spiegel died in Los Angeles County, California on that same date, October 14, 2008, at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. App. to Mot. to Dismiss at 29; <em>see </em>Compl. at \u00b62.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">According to Mr. Green, Mr. Samuels violated California state law when he signed and had submitted the forms used to change the registration on Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>count. Mr. Green claims that by virtue the government making the registration change he was forced to share his inheritance with Mr. Samuels and Barbara Bautista, who was Ms. Spiegel\u2019s niece and Mr. Samuel\u2019s sister. These two individuals, along with Mr. Green, were the three beneficiaries of the Spiegel Trust. of</p>\n<p id=\"b805-2\">Mr. Green sued Mr. Samuels for tortious inference with an expected inheritance when he learned in 2010 that the Legacy Account had been originally established on March 3, 2008 and registered \u201cAnn C. Spiegel POD Robert A. Green.\u201d That lawsuit was settled before this case was filed. The plaintiff claims, however, that he remains \u201cdamaged by more than $375,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\">In this suit against the United States, Mr. Green alleges that the government violated his rights to Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Account by processing the registration change without confirming that the request complied with California state law and seeks monetary damages on this basis. The plaintiff also contends that the government\u2019s actions were negligent because the government failed to investigate Mr. Samuel\u2019s authority before changing Ms. Spiegel\u2019s account. He further contends that Treasury\u2019s actions in changing the account upon receiving September 25, 2008 request and without notice to plaintiff amounted to a violation of his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">It is well-settled that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988). Ordinarily, undisputed factual allegations contained in the complaint must be treated as true. <em>See Henke v. United States, </em>60 F.3d 795, 797 (Fed.Cir.1995). However, in resolving disputes regarding jurisdictional facts, the court may look beyond the pleadings. <em>See Rocovich v. United States, </em>933 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed.Cir.1991). If the Court finds that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, it must dis-<em>See Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). miss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Under the Tucker Act, this court has \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a) (2012). Mr. Green does not allege that he had a contract with the United States. Rather, he bases his claim on Treasury regulations set forth at 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 357.20 to 357.32,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which he alleges were violated in contravention of California state law when he was removed as the POD beneficiary on Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Account. The government argues that this court does not have jurisdiction over this claim because Mr. Green does not have any right to direct payment as the sole beneficiary under the above-cited regulations after the transfer of registration to the Spiegel Trust. Further, the government argues that the United States is immune from liability, and thus damages, for actions that it takes in making changes to Legacy Accounts in accordance with transfer requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">When a complaint is filed, the court must determine if the regulations which serve as the basis for the claim are money-mandating. <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1173 (Fed.Cir.2005). If the court determines that the source identified is not money-mandating, the court must dismiss the case. <em>Id. </em>Here, the government argues that Mr. Green\u2019s complaint must be dismissed because, under the applicable regulations, POD beneficiaries like Mr. Green do not have any rights \u201c[djuring an owner\u2019s lifetime [and that] a transaction request may be executed by the owner without the consent of the beneficiary.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 357.21(b)(2)(iii). As such, the government continues, Mr. Green had no ownership rights as the designated sole beneficiary to Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Account before Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Spiegel\u2019s death. Further, the government argues, after the registration for Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Account was changed, he no longer had a right to direct payment as the POD beneficiary. Rather, Mr. Green was only entitled to monies through the Spiegel Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The court agrees with the government. The death certificate submitted by the government establishes that Ms. Spiegel died on October 14, 2008 at 12:30 p.m. Pacific Time, after the Legacy Account change was made and Mi'. Green was removed as the POD beneficiary. Mr. Green therefore had no right to direct payment by the government as the POD beneficiary upon Ms. Spiegel\u2019s death. After the registration was changed, Mr. Green\u2019s right to payment was only from the Spiegel Trust. Indeed, Mr. Green is not seeking to compel a payment as the POD beneficiary of Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Account. Rather, as discussed below, he is challenging the government\u2019s actions in changing Ms. Spiegel\u2019s Legacy Account registration to the Spiegel Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">With regard to the registration change, the government argues that the case must be dismissed because there is no right to damages under Treasury regulations for actions taken by the United States in making changes pursuant to transfer requests. Thus, the government argues, the United States cannot be sued for allegedly \u201cdisregarding [California] state law in allowing the change of beneficiary,\u201d as Mr. Green contends in his complaint. Treasury regulations expressly provide that the United States</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At9\">may rely on the information provided in a tender, transaction request form, or Transfer Message, and [is] not required to verify the information. The Department ... shall not be liable for any action taken in accordance with the information set out in a tender, transaction request form, or Transfer Message, or evidence submitted in support thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 357.42. Because the regulations clearly state that the government cannot be liable for \u201cany action\u201d taken in accordance with the information it receives in the transaction request form, the government correctly argues that Mr. Green has not identified a money mandating source for his claim. Contrary to Mr. Green\u2019s contentions, there is no exception to the government\u2019s immunity from liability under the regulation where violations of state law or negligence by Treasury are alleged. The United States cannot be liable for \u201cany action\u201d it took in accordance with the information it received on the change form submitted and signed by Mr. Samuels on Ms. Spiegel\u2019s behalf. Because the government has immunity from liability for actions taken by the Treasury under the regulations at issue here, Mr. Green has failed to identify a money-mandating source for his claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court must dismiss the complaint under RCFC 12(b)(1). The government\u2019s motion to dismiss is therefore GRANTED. The clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\">. \"The Legacy Treasury Direct system is a non-Internet-based book-entry system maintained by Treasury for purchasing and holding marketable Treasury securities as book-entry products.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 357.0(a)(2); <em>see generally </em>TreasuiyDirect.gov, Legacy Treasury Direct, http://www. treasurydirect.gov/indiv/myaccoun1/myaccount_ legacytd.htm (last visited Feb. 20, 2014)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">.
