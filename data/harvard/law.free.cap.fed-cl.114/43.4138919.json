Factual History<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Lamona Dodd\u2019s son S.S. was healthy at birth, suffered common childhood ailments and received normal childhood immunizations. Dec. at 4-5. At age four, he received three vaccinations on October 1, 2007: measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), Diphtheria-Tetanus-aeellular-Pertussis (DTaP) and Polio. Ex. 11 at 6. Only the MMR vaccine, and, in particular, its measles vaccine component, are at issue in petitioner\u2019s theory of vaccine injury causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">According to his mother, about a week after the vaccination S.S. experienced coughing accompanied by fever, but continued to attend preschool. Ex. 12 at 1. On October 15, 2007, however, S.S. was brought to the emergency room where he presented, without a fever, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">This is a 4-year-old African American male who was brought to the emergency room by his mom with history that the child became sick this evening, complained of a headache, abdominal pain, and probably had total of about 6 episodes of vomiting. Had one episode of diarrhea and urinary incontinence. [He] was thought beginning about 8 p.m. to be having some seizure activity. No prior history of seizures and child has some history of chronic illness. The mom said that the seizures would start, last [a] few minutes and go away, and he would be able to talk between the episodes but was not himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\">Ex. 3 at 169. The hospital staff noted at the time that there was some family history of seizures.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">S.S. was discharged the next day on anti-seizure medication. The parties dispute the severity of the seizures experienced by S.S. on October 15, 2007, although certain facts are undisputed. As noted by petitioner\u2019s expert, on October 15, 2007 S.S. exhibited several episodes of \u201cstaring spells,\u201d a \u201cleft focal tonic-clonic seizure\u201d that lasted a couple of minutes, \u201cleft-sided postictal paralysis,\u201d and his EEG showed \u201csubtle slowing intermittently throughout the right hemisphere.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ex. 18 at 1. The etiology of these \u201c[n]ew onset seizures\u201d was unclear to his treating physicians. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ex. 3 at 169-70; Ex. 7 at 93; Ex. 14 at 11. None of the medical personnel treating S.S. hypothesized a causal link between the vaccinations that took place on October 1, 2007 and his subsequent diagnosis of epilepsy, although petitioner raised this issue in various treatment settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Unfortunately, two elements of the discharge plan developed on October 16, 2007 were not accomplished. S.S. stopped taking his anti-seizure medications and he was not seen for a neurological follow-up. Instead, S.S. was seen again in the emergency room, on December 9, 2007, for seizure activity of far greater severity than the seizure activity experienced on October 15, 2007. Hearing Transcript (Tr.) at 13, 66, 83-84, 95-96, 98, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">S.S. was kept in the hospital for two days to bring his seizures under control. Upon follow-up, he was diagnosed with secondary general epilepsy. Further doctor visits followed, both scheduled and emergent in nature. Several changes to his seizure medications were made. During the next few months, S.S. was noted to have developmental delays and hyperactivity problems. Although S.S. eventually controlled his seizures through medication, he has been placed in a special education program.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Ms. Dodd filed a petition under the Vaccine Act on September 4, 2009 alleging that the vaccinations S.S. received on October 1, 2007 caused S.S. to develop epilepsy and developmental delays. Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 1-2. Petitioner retained Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne as an expert while respondent retained Dr. John T. MacDonald; both physicians filed expert reports regarding the petition. Upon request, the Chief Special Master allowed petitioner to file a supplemental expert report from Dr. Kinsbourne.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">A hearing was scheduled to be held in Boston, Massachusetts on March 18, 2011. Petitioner had thus far relied upon fourteen medical articles; respondent had relied upon three medical articles. In her pre-hearing order, the Chief Special Master required that each party denote the significance of any medical articles relied upon by that party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQK\">Any party wishing to rely upon a medical article is directed to file simultaneously a short explanation of the proposition that the article is intended to support____ This explanation may be encompassed in a pre-hearing memorandum, or may appear in a separate document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Order of January 18, 2011. Respondent provided the required explanation; petitioner did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">Dr. Kinsbourne, as S.S.\u2019s medical expert, is more qualified than petitioner\u2019s counsel to explain the medical articles that support his medical theory. As such, Dr. Kinsbourne will address the proposition that the medical articles intend to support at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Pet\u2019s February 28, 2011 Resp. to January 18,2011 Order, at 4 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">The hearing transcript shows that each party had ample opportunity to elicit testimony from the experts. A post-hearing briefing schedule was established. Petitioner filed her brief first (Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br.), respondent filed the next brief (Resp.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br.), and petitioner concluded the briefing (Pet\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Reply). The Chief Special Master\u2019s decision was filed on June 5, 2013, and was later redacted to remove the child\u2019s name and birth date and re-captioned to reflect the name change of petitioner. <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">The Chief Special Master held that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case of vaccine injury causation. In her motion for review, petitioner has raised four specific objections to the decision denying her compensation under the Vaccine Act. The holdings of the Chief Special Master denying petitioner entitlement to compensation, and the objections thereto, will be addressed in the Analysis section of this opinion. The court turns now to the standard of review applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b59-17\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b59-18\">This court has jurisdiction to review the decision of a special master in a Vaccine Act case. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2). \u201cUnder the Vaccine Act, the Court of Federal Claims reviews the decision of the special master to determine if it is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>de Bazan v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>539 F.3d 1347, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B) and citing <em>Althen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>418 F.3d 1274, 1277 (Fed.Cir.2005)); <em>see also Hanlon v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>191 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\u201cUnder the Vaccine Act, the Court of Federal Claims may not disturb the factual findings of the special master unless they are \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019\u201d (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B))). This court uses three distinct standards of review in Vaccine Act eases, depending upon which aspect of a special master\u2019s judgment is under scrutiny:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">These standards vary in application as well as degree of deference. Each standard applies to a different aspect of the judgment. Fact findings are reviewed ... under the arbitrary and capricious standard; legal questions under the \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d standard; and discretionary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><em>Munn v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The arbitrary and capricious standard of review is used to consider factual findings by the special master. <em>Id. </em>The scope of this review is limited, and highly deferential. <em>Lampe v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>219 F.3d 1357, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>Burns by Burns v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>3 F.3d 415, 416 (Fed.Cir. 1993). \u201cIf the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record, drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision, reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.\u201d <em>Hines ex rel. Sevier v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1528 (Fed.Cir. 1991); <em>see also Burns, </em>3 F.3d at 416. This court\u2019s review of the fact findings of a special master under the arbitrary and capricious standard is \u201cwell understood to be the most deferential possible.\u201d <em>Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870 (citations omitted). When the court\u2019s review of a special master\u2019s decision involves statutory construction or other legal issues, the \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d standard is applied. <em>Hines, </em>940 F.2d at 1527. The third standard of review, abuse of discretion, is applicable when a special master excludes evidence or otherwise limits the record upon which she relies. <em>See Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">II. Burden of Proof in an Off-Table Vaccine Injury Case</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">There are two distinct avenues for recovery under the Vaccine Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-ll(c). First, a petitioner who has received a vaccination listed on the Act\u2019s Vaccine Injury Table (Vaccine Injury Table or Table) may recover for any resulting illness, disability, injury or condition that is also listed on the Table, or a significant aggravation thereof. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(i); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-14(a); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 (2012) (current version of the Vaccine Injury Table). Second, a petitioner who has received a vaccination listed on the Table, but whose vaccine-related injuries do not meet Table requirements, may recover under the \u201coff-Table\u201d theory of recovery. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(ii), 300aa-13(a)(1)(A). Under this theory, a petitioner may make out a prima facie case of entitlement to compensation by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a Table vaccine actually caused the petitioner to sustain an illness, disability, injury or condition which is not listed on the Table, or that first appeared outside the time limits set by the Table. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(ii); <em>Pafford v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>451 F.3d 1352, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">A petitioner such as Ms. Dodd who hopes to recover for an off-Table claim must establish causation-in-fact. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-ll(c)(l)(C)(ii), 300aa-13(a)(l); <em>Pafford, </em>451 F.3d at 1355. This requires \u201cpreponderant evidence both that [the] vaccination[ ] [was] a substantial factor in causing the illness, disability, injury or condition and that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of the vaccination.\u201d <em>Pafford, </em>451 F.3d at 1355 (citing <em>Shyface v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1344, 1352 (Fed.Cir.1999)). The vaccination \u201cmust be a \u2018substantial factor\u2019\u201d in bringing about the injury, but \u201cit need not be the sole factor or even the predominant factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357 (quoting <em>Shyface, </em>165 F.3d at 1352-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has summarized the evidentiary burden associated with causation-in-fact in off-Table eases. The Federal Circuit explained that a petitioner who wishes to demonstrate that a vaccination brought about an injury must present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Althen, </em>418 F.3d at 1278. These three factors required to prove causation-in-faet in Vaccine Act cases are now commonly referred to as the three <em>Althen </em>prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">As to the evidence related to the three factors, \u201cthese <em>[Althen </em>] prongs must cumulatively show that the vaccination was a \u2018buWor\u2019 cause of the harm, rather than just an insubstantial contributor in, or one among several possible causes of, the harm.\u201d <em>Pafford, </em>451 F.3d at 1355. Further, \u201c[although probative, neither a mere showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury, nor a simplistic elimination of other potential causes of the injury suffices, without more, to meet the burden of showing actual causation.\u201d <em>Althen, </em>418 F.3d at 1278 (citing <em>Grant v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>956 F.2d 1144, 1149 (Fed.Cir. 1992)). It is likewise critical to recognize that the special master may not make a finding of causation that is based on the claims of a petitioner alone, which are not substantiated by medical records or by medical opinion. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(l). Thus, the presentation of medical records or medical opinion supporting a claim is a prerequisite to recovery. <em>Id. </em>Only if a petitioner presents adequate evidence on the three essential aspects of causation, and thus makes a prima facie case for liability, does the burden shift to the Secretary to prove, also by a preponderance of the evidence, an alternate cause of the alleged injury. <em>Althen, </em>418 F.3d at 1278; <em>de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1352 (citations omitted). When a petitioner seeks to demonstrate causation-in-fact by meeting the three <em>Althen </em>requirements, each of those requirements must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">III. Causation of S.S.\u2019s Epilepsy and Developmental Delays</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">A. Petitioner Met Her Burden for <em>Al-then </em>Prongs One and Three 1. <em>Althen </em>Prong One</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\"><em>Althen </em>Prong One requires that \u201ca claimant\u2019s theory of causation ... be supported by a reputable medical or scientific explanation.\u201d <em>Broekelschen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>618 F.3d 1339, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2010) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Here, petitioner proposed a medical theory based on Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s expert reports and his testimony at the hearing. Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 18-23. Petitioner also asserted that Dr. MacDonald conceded that certain key elements of that theory were indeed valid. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Simply put, petitioner\u2019s medical theory rests on the assumption that \u201cthe measles component of the MMR vaccine is essentially the same as the wild virus that leads to ... measles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. According to Dr. Kinsbourne, \u201cit would be logical to conclude that the measles vaccine, a weakened version of the natural disease, can cause the same types of symptoms and adverse events as the natural disease,\u201d including seizures and encephalopathies. <em>Id. </em>In turn, seizures and anti-seizure medication regimens can cause developmental delays and behavior problems such as hyperactivity, according to petitioner\u2019s expert. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. Thus, the measles component of the MMR vaccine, according to this theory, can cause epilepsy and subsequent developmental delays, even though a precise biological mechanism has not been identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Based on a preponderance of the evidence, the Chief Special Master found that petitioner had met her burden under <em>Althen </em>Prong One to establish a \u201creputable, reliable and biologically plausible\u201d medical theory of causation for epilepsy and developmental delays. Dee. at 29-30. The analysis of <em>Althen </em>Prong One provided in the Chief Special Master\u2019s decision is thorough, logical and detailed. The court reviews this factual finding with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>great deference. <em>See, e.g., Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870. Under the standard of review required here, the Chief Special Master\u2019s holding as to <em>Althen </em>Prong One must be affirmed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">2. <em>Althen </em>Prong Three</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">a. Petitioner Met Her Burden of Proof to Establish a Proximate, Medically-Acceptable Temporal Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>Althen </em>Prong Three \u201crequires preponderant proof that the onset of symptoms occurred within a timeframe for which, given the medical understanding of the disorder\u2019s etiology, it is medically acceptable to infer eausation-in-fact.\u201d <em>de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1352. Here, two weeks elapsed between the date of the MMR vaccination and the onset of S.S.\u2019s seizures. According to petitioner, \u201ctwo weeks is an appropriate temporal relationship between the MMR vaccine and a seizure disorder to occur.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 30. In Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s first expert report, he asserted that \u201c[s]eizure onset within two weeks after MMR vaccination is a well-recognized adverse reaction to this vaccination.\u201d Kinsbourne Report at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">As support for this assertion, Dr. Kinsbourne testified that certain medical articles noted adverse events such as seizures that have occurred in this time-frame after MMR vaccination. Tr. at 15-16. He also testified that the presence of the wild measles virus in the blood peaks (peak viremia) during the second week following exposure. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 60-61. Petitioner noted, too, that a five to fifteen day onset of encephalitis or encephalopathy after MMR vaccination is the timeframe specified in the Vaccine Injury Table. Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 31. For all of these reasons, petitioner asserted that Ms. Dodd had established a \u201cproximate temporal relationship between the vaccine and the injury\u201d so as to satisfy <em>Althen </em>Prong Three. <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The Chief Special Master agreed. <em>See </em>Dec. at 32-33 (stating that \u201cpetitioner relied primarily on a proximate temporal relationship which she proved and ... the undersigned is persuaded that petitioner has satisfied the ... third prong[ ] of the <em>Althen </em>test\u201d). The Chief Special Master considered the opinion of Dr. Kinsbourne as to the timing of onset of the alleged vaccine injury and concluded that Ms. Dodd had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that there was the required proximate temporal relationship between the MMR vaccination and S.S.\u2019s epilepsy and developmental delays. <em>See id. </em>at 4, 11-13, 21-22, 24, 32-33. The Chief Special Master also noted that respondent had not mounted any challenge to petitioner\u2019s evidence regarding <em>Althen </em>Prong Three. <em>See id. </em>at 28 (\u201cRespondent does not dispute that petitioner has established a temporal relationship between the administered MMR vaccine and thus, has satisfied the third <em>Al-then </em>prong.\u201d). The court sees no reason, under the deferential standard of review applicable here, to disturb the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding as to <em>Althen </em>Prong Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">b. Petitioner Criticizes the Chief Special Master\u2019s \u201cFailure to Address\u201d the Temporal Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">One of petitioner\u2019s four challenges to the Chief Special Master\u2019s denial of her petition is a critique of the Chief Special Master\u2019s consideration of the temporal relationship between the MMR vaccination and S.S.\u2019s alleged vaccine injuries. In petitioner\u2019s view, the Chief Special Master committed reversible error by not adequately addressing <em>Al-then </em>Prong Three, the proximate temporal relationship prong of the causation analysis. Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 27. It is obvious that petitioner does not seek to overturn the Chief Special Master\u2019s favorable ruling on <em>Althen </em>Prong Three; instead, Ms. Dodd appears to attack the weight accorded to the proximate temporal relationship in the Chief Special Master\u2019s overall causation analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">Perhaps recognizing that her petition depends largely on the proximate temporal re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>lationship between the MMR vaccination and S.S.\u2019s seizures, Ms. Dodd has repeatedly emphasized that evidence relevant to one <em>Althen </em>prong can be applied to the analysis of another <em>Althen </em>prong. <em>See, e.g., </em>Petition at 20 (stating that \u201cevidence used to satisfy one prong of the test may overlap to satisfy another prong\u201d (citing <em>Capizzano v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>440 F.3d 1317, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2006))); Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 26 (asserting that <em>Althen </em>Prong Two is satisfied because, among other reasons, \u201cthe symptoms of [S.S.\u2019s] injury occurred within a medically appropriate time after the MMR vaccine\u201d); Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Reply at 11 (stating that because petitioner has proven a \u201cscientifically appropriate temporal relationship between [S.S.\u2019s] MMR vaccine and the onset of his symptoms [and other elements, she] has satisfied <em>Althen </em>prong 2\u201d); Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 18 (describing the fact \u201cthat the onset of symptoms was within an appropriate time period\u201d as a critical factor in the <em>Althen </em>Prong Two analysis). Petitioner would have preferred, it appears, that the Chief Special Master had given more weight to the proximate temporal relationship between the MMR vaccination and the onset of S.S.\u2019s seizures in her analysis of <em>Althen </em>Prong Two. <em>See </em>Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 18 (asserting that the Chief Special Master \u201capparently gave no probative value\u201d to factors such as the proximate temporal relationship between the vaccination and the alleged injury in her <em>Althen </em>Prong Two analysis), 28 (stating that \u201cthe Chief Special Master trivialized the probative significance of ... an appropriate temporal relationship between the MMR vaccine and the onset of S.S.\u2019s symptoms\u201d), 29 (alleging that \u201cthe existence of an appropriate temporal relationship\u2014not too soon or too late\u2014is highly probative\u201d for the causation analysis). Although petitioner concedes that \u201cthe existence of a strong temporal relationship between a vaccine and an injury, by itself, is not proof of causation,\u201d she apparently disagrees with the significance accorded the proximate temporal relationship issue by the Chief Special Master in this ease. <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Respondent argues that the Chief Special Master afforded adequate attention to <em>Althen </em>Prong Three, Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 13, and the court must agree. The decision evinces adequate attention to the chronology of relevant events and to Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s arguments regarding the appropriate timing of the onset of symptoms in this case. <em>See </em>Dec. at 4-6, 11-13, 21-22, 24, 32-33. Petitioner has not cited to any authority that specifies the degree to which a special master must elaborate upon the subject of an appropriate temporal relationship when the government has not contested <em>Althen </em>Prong Three. As for <em>Capizzano, </em>440 F.3d at 1326, which is cited by petitioner for the proposition that evidence may overlap between the <em>Althen </em>prongs, the court finds in that decision no standard which requires a more exhaustive review of <em>Althen </em>Prong Three and the proximate temporal relationship issue than that provided by the Chief Special Master in her decision in this case. Indeed, the Federal Circuit expressly approved a truncated discussion of this prong when a petitioner had shown a proximate temporal relationship between a vaccination and an alleged vaccine injury. <em>See Hibbard v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>698 F.3d 1355, 1364 (Fed.Cir. 2012) (\u201cThe special master acknowledged that the temporal requirement (the third <em>Al-then </em>factor) was satisfied in this ease. He therefore had no need to discuss that factor in any detail.\u201d). For these reasons, the court must reject this particular challenge to the Chief Special Master\u2019s ruling on entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">B. <em>Althen </em>Prong Two</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The court now addresses two separate but intertwined challenges to the Chief Special Master\u2019s ruling on <em>Althen </em>Prong Two, <em>i.e., </em>that the petitioner failed to provide \u201ca logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury.\u201d 418 F.3d at 1278. First, petitioner argues that the new onset seizures on October 15, 2007 were severe enough to lower S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold, giving rise to more severe seizures on December 9, 2007, and that the Chief Special Master\u2019s holding to the contrary, in light of \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence, was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and contrary to law. Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 15, 23. Second, petitioner attacks the Chief Special Master\u2019s conclusion that \u201c\u2018[o]ther than [the] temporal relationship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>there is nothing to suggest that the seizures S.S. suffered on October 15, 2007[] were caused by the measles vaccine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23 (quoting Dee. at 32). This conclusion, according to petitioner, is illogical in the face of the evidence relevant to <em>Althen </em>Prong Two that should have been weighed differently by the Chief Special Master. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">1. Ruling Regarding the Alleged Lowering of S.S.\u2019s Seizure Threshold</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">a. The Chief Special Master\u2019s Finding of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Several portions of the Chief Special Master\u2019s decision address petitioner\u2019s contention that the October 15, 2007 seizures lowered S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold and made him more susceptible to the severe seizures he experienced on December 9, 2007.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, the Chief Special Master summarized the divergent views of the experts on this topic. Dr. Kinsbourne, for example, described the new onset seizures as brief and less serious than those that followed in December of that year. Dee. at 14-15 (citing Tr. at 22-23, 37). Dr. Kinsbourne nonetheless insisted that during the October 15, 2007 episode S.S. was in an acute and abnormal neurological state, a condition which caused lasting damage and which lowered S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold. <em>Id. </em>at 21 (citing Ex. 20 at 1; Tr. at 65-66, 83-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Dr. MacDonald, on the other hand, relied on his current clinical experience and his understanding of relevant literature to testify that the brief seizures experienced on October 15, 2007 did not lower S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold, trigger an acute encephalopathy, cause encephalitis, or result in lasting brain damage. Dee. at 16-18 (citing Tr. at 95-96, 99, 134). Dr. MacDonald noted that the medical records of this event showed no signs that S.S. experienced anything more than a transient episode of brief seizures. <em>Id. </em>Although Dr. MacDonald conceded that repetitive seizures may lower a patient\u2019s seizure threshold, he saw no evidence that S.S. experienced seizure activity of such a damaging nature on October 15-16, 2007. <em>Id. </em>at 18 (citing Tr. at 117-18,134).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The Chief Special Master agreed with the clinical assessment of Dr. MacDonald and rejected Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s assertion that S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold was lowered by the October 15, 2007 seizures. Dec. at 32 (citing Tr. at 113). She relied on concessions made by Dr. Kinsbourne on cross-examination and on the testimony of Dr. MacDonald. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. In addition, the Chief Special Master stated that Dr. Kinsbourne used circular logic to demonstrate that S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold was lowered, and that his circular logic was unconvincing. <em>See id. </em>at 22 (\u201cIn support of his assertion that the seizures S.S. experienced on October 15, 2007[ ] led to a lowering of his seizure threshold and caused him to suffer seizure events on December 9, 2007 (and thereafter), Dr. Kinsbourne relies heavily on the fact that the later seizures occurred.\u201d (citing Tr. at 83-84)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The Chief Special Master also discussed the sole medical article (Holmes article) relevant to this issue that was proffered by petitioner and that was discussed by the experts during the hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dec. at 27-28. She quoted various statements in the Holmes ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tide that were relevant to the question of whether S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold could have been lowered by the October 15, 2007 seizures. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Her analysis of the Holmes article, and of Dr. MacDonald\u2019s testimony regarding its content, is more thorough than the brief discussion of this article presented in Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s report. <em>Compare </em>Dee. at 27-28, <em>with </em>Ex. 18 at 4. In her prehearing submissions, petitioner neglected to explain the significance of the Holmes article, <em>see </em>Pet.\u2019s February 28, 2011 Response to January 18, 2011 Order, at 4 n.4., and in her post-hearing briefing, petitioner failed to cite any testimony from Dr. Kinsbourne on the general topic of the lowering of seizure thresholds and failed to cite the Holmes article for any purpose. The Chief Special Master concluded that the Holmes article, and other articles proffered by petitioner, provided \u201clittle or no evidentiary support for [petitioner\u2019s] theory of causation as applied to S.S.\u2019s circumstances.\u201d Dee. at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Chief Special Master therefore made the following finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">Dr. Kinsbourne admitted that the seizure event S.S. experienced on October 15, 2007[ ] consisted of several \u201cstaring spells, each lasting for less than a minute\u201d and a seizure that lasted a few minutes. Tr. at 37. Moreover, Dr. Kinsbourne acknowledged that S.S. was \u201cbehaving normally and had no neurological symptoms the day after his hospital admission, and that this EEG was consistent with a postictal state and showed no evidence of seizure activity or brain damage. Tr. at 37-39, 41-42. As Dr. M[a]eDonald testified, and the undersigned similarly finds, S.S.\u2019s brief seizure and staring spells on October 15, 2007[] were not of the prolonged and repetitive nature needed to lower S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold. Tr. at 113.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">b. The Parties\u2019 Arguments Regarding the Chief Special Master\u2019s Finding of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Petitioner\u2019s first contention is that the Chief Special Master \u201cmiseharaeteriz[ed]\u201d and \u201cminimize[d]\u201d the severity of the October 15, 2007 seizures experienced by S.S. Pet\u2019s Mot. at 18,21. Citing various portions of the record, petitioner asserts that the \u201cseizure period ... extended] over 3 hours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19-20. Petitioner also cites to Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s testimony, the Holmes article, the Sutula article (not discussed during the hearing), and certain alleged \u201cconcessions\u201d of Dr. MacDonald. <em>Id. </em>at 21-23. Describing this cited evidence as \u201coverwhelming,\u201d Ms. Dodd asserts that the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding that the October 15, 2007 seizures did not lower S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold cannot withstand review.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Respondent counters that there was ample evidence in the record to support the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding of fact regarding the duration of the October 15, 2007 seizures and the improbability that these new onset seizures lowered S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold. Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 10-11. The government notes, in particular, that there is no real dispute as to the events of October 15, 2007 and the brief duration of each seizure experienced by S.S. that evening. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. Respondent also notes that the Sutula article was not discussed by either expert during the hearing, and that the Holmes article was not discussed by Dr. Kinsbourne at the hearing; for these reasons respondent argues that petitioner has no reason to complain that the Chief Special Master agreed with Dr. MacDonald, the only expert who testified about specific statements in the relevant scientific literature in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Finally, the government argues, the so-called \u201cconcessions\u201d of Dr. MacDonald are better described as testimony taken out of context. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">The issue of the Chief Special Master allegedly ignoring Dr. MacDonald\u2019s alleged concessions, Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 23, is quickly resolved. The court agrees with respondent that \u201cDr. MacDonald was unequivocal in his testimony that S.S.\u2019s brief seizures on October 15,2007[ ] were not sufficient to lower his seizure threshold.\u201d Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 12. Dr. MacDonald\u2019s testimony was accurately summarized by the Chief Special Master in this regard. Dec. at 32 (citing Tr. at 113). The alleged \u201cconcessions\u201d of Dr. MacDonald cited by petitioner concern his testimony that seizures can, in some instances, lower seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>thresholds, and that S.S.\u2019s October 15, 2007 and December 9, 2007 seizure episodes might have been related. Tr. at 110-12. The Chief Special Master\u2019s decision adequately takes this testimony into account in her analysis of <em>Althen </em>Prong Two. Dec. at 27, 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">c. The Chief Special Master\u2019s Finding of Fact Survives Review</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The Chief Special Master thoroughly analyzed petitioner\u2019s causation arguments as they could be applied to S.S.\u2019s alleged injury, as well as the evidence of record. At one point, she described Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s theory of causation as \u201ccobbled\u201d together. Dec. at 22. At another point, she described the evidentiary record as \u201cnot close\u201d to meeting petitioner\u2019s burden regarding <em>Althen </em>Prong Two. <em>Id. </em>at 33. Here, as to whether the October 15, 2007 seizures experienced by S.S. lowered his seizure threshold, the court finds nothing in petitioner\u2019s motion for review, or in the underlying record in this case, to disturb the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding of fact. The court defers, as it must, to the Chief Special Master\u2019s rational weighing of the evidence. <em>E.g., Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870. It was not, on this record, arbitrary or capricious to find that \u201cS.S.\u2019s brief seizure and staring spells on October 15, 2007[ ] were not of the prolonged and repetitive nature needed to lower S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold.\u201d Dee. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Finally, tucked away in a footnote at the end of the argument section of her brief devoted to petitioner\u2019s challenge to this aspect of the Chief Special Master\u2019s decision, Ms. Dodd contends that the Chief Special Master inappropriately required petitioner to \u201cprove the precise mechanism of [S.S.\u2019s] injury, [and thus] elevated [her] proof requirement and violated established Federal Circuit precedent.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 23 n.14 (citing <em>Knudsen by Knudsen v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>35 F.3d 543, 549 (Fed.Cir.1994)). Petitioner\u2019s argument fails because the Chief Special Master did not deny the petition based on petitioner\u2019s failure to identify a precise mechanism of causation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the Chief Special Master tested the proposed mechanism of causation identified by petitioner\u2019s expert and found that the proposed mechanism, as applied to the facts of S.S.\u2019s seizures on October 15, 2007 and December 9, 2007, failed to provide a logical sequence of cause and effect. <em>See </em>Dee. at 31 &amp; n.28 (holding that \u201cthe theory advanced by Dr. Kinsbourne is not supported by the facts of this ease ... [because] the evidence of record is insufficient to show\u201d a lowering of S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold). The court finds that the Chief Special Master neither impermissibly heightened petitioner\u2019s burden of proof nor violated established Federal Circuit precedent. <em>See, e.g., Hibbard, </em>698 F.3d at 1364 &amp; n.2 (noting that a failure to substantiate a critical step in the logical sequence of cause and effect proposed by the petitioner\u2019s expert is equivalent to a failure to prove <em>Al-then </em>Prong Two by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>Moberly v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>592 F.3d 1315, 1324 (Fed.Cir. 2010) (rejecting a \u201cproposed mechanism\u201d of causation because the petitioner\u2019s expert \u201cconceded that there was no evidence in the record suggesting that the proposed mechanism was at work in [that] case\u201d). Ms. Dodd has shown no error of law in the Chief Special Master\u2019s analysis of <em>Althen </em>Prong Two in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">2. Ruling Regarding a Logical Sequence of Cause and Effect Linking the Alleged Injury to the MMR Vaccination</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">a. The Chief Special Master\u2019s Finding of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The court now turns to another link in the logical sequence of the cause and effect argument proffered by petitioner, <em>i.e., </em>the proposition that the measles vaccine caused S.S.\u2019s October 15, 2007 new onset seizures. The Chief Special Master conducted a painstaking review of the record and engaged in a thorough analysis of the parties\u2019 arguments in this regard. Her decision on entitlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>includes a detailed chronology of relevant events, including a discussion of S.S.\u2019s childhood illnesses, his vaccinations on October 1, 2007, his symptoms a week later, his symptoms on October 15-16, 2007, and medical records pertinent to the onset of seizures and subsequent treatment. Dec. at 5-10 &amp; nn.67, 10-11. The opinion of each expert as to a causal link between the vaccination and alleged injury is explained in detail, and the differences in expert opinions are presented in an objective, balanced, and well-organized analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 11-18. The Chief Special Master correctly cites the governing law regarding petitioner\u2019s burden of proof on causation and applies this precedent to the facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In her decision, the Chief Special Master correctly concludes that the logical sequence of cause and effect asserted by petitioner depends on two critical links: first, the measles vaccine caused the October 15, 2007 seizures; second, the October 15, 2007 seizures lowered S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold which led to his epilepsy and developmental delays, as discussed <em>supra. </em>Dec. at 21-22, 31-32. In addition to medical records, expert reports and expert testimony, the Chief Special Master reviewed the medical literature most heavily relied upon by the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 22-27. These articles, for the most part, provide little support for the causation theory presented by Ms. Dodd, because, in the words of the Chief Special Master, \u201cthe literature petitioner filed does not pertain to the factual circumstances of S.S.\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The court will not reproduce every finding relevant to this controversy, but provides here the most persuasive and determinative findings of the Chief Special Master in that regard. \u201cS.S.\u2019s treating physicians did not know the cause of S.S.\u2019s epilepsy.\u201d Dec. at 31 (citing Ex. 14 at 17). Additionally, an alternative explanation for S.S.\u2019s epilepsy was a \u201clikely genetic predisposition to have a seizure condition\u201d because of a family history of epilepsy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 32. Much of the evidence of a causal link between the measles vaccine and seizures in the literature relied upon by petitioner was specific to seizures accompanied by fever, not afebrile seizures, as was the case here. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 27-28,32. Furthermore, Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s theory of causation relied upon a connection between peak viremia and seizures, although the typical symptoms of peak viremia were not present at the time of S.S.\u2019s new onset seizures. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Based on these findings, and others related to the literature relied upon by the parties, the Chief Special Master concluded that although \u201cthe measles vaccine can cause seizures in rare circumstances involving fever o[r] gastrointestinal illness ..., petitioner has failed to prove, and the evidence of record is insufficient to show, that [such an] event occurred in this case.\u201d Dec. at 31. The Chief Special Master summarized her analysis by stating that \u201c[o]ther than the temporal relationship, there is nothing to suggest that the seizures S.S. suffered on October 15, 2007[ ] were caused by the measles vaccine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. According to the Chief Special Master, a proximate temporal relationship and a \u201cdubious claim that no other potential cause for S.S.\u2019s injuries existed\u201d are not sufficient to meet Ms. Dodd\u2019s burden to show a logical causal sequence so as to satisfy <em>Althen </em>Prong Two. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">b. The Parties\u2019 Arguments Regarding the Chief Special Master\u2019s Finding of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">As a threshold issue, the court must identify the type of attack petitioner has mounted against the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding of fact on causation. Although petitioner\u2019s argument as a whole must properly be characterized as an assertion that the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding of fact was arbitrary and capricious, <em>see </em>Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 27 (asserting that the ruling on causation was \u201cillogical\u201d), Ms. Dodd also asserts that \u201c[t]he Chief Special Master abused her discretion by ignoring relevant evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>Petitioner has failed, however, to identify a specific discretionary ruling of the Chief Special Master, evidentiary or otherwise, which this court could re-</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>view for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870 n. 10 (stating that \u201cdiscretionary rulings [are reviewed] under the abuse of discretion standard ... [and this standard] will rarely come into play\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Having determined that the arbitrary and capricious standard, not the abuse of discretion standard, applies here, the court notes, at the outset, that any invitation to re-weigh the evidence is improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">Clearly it is not then the role of this court to reweigh the factual evidence, or to assess whether the special master correctly evaluated the evidence. And of course we do not examine the probative value of the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses. These are all matters within the purview of the fact finder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 871. Regrettably, petitioner\u2019s challenge to the Chief Special Master\u2019s fact finding is indeed a fruitless invitation to this court to re-weigh the evidence evaluated by the Chief Special Master. Ms. Dodd\u2019s challenge to the Chief Special Master\u2019s analysis of the link between the MMR vaccination and S.S.\u2019s new onset seizures offers a catalog of the evidence that, in Ms. Dodd\u2019s view, compels a ruling in petitioner\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">First, Ms. Dodd emphasizes the \u201chighly probative\u201d nature of the proximate temporal relationship between S.S.\u2019s MMR vaccination and his new onset seizures, and cites to testimony of Dr. Kinsbourne in this regard. Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 24-25. Second, she references the medical literature relied upon by Dr. Kinsbourne as support for his testimony that the measles vaccine caused S.S.\u2019s October 15, 2007 seizures. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26 (citing Tr. at 15-17, Exs. 18-A, 18-D at 1461, 18-1). Third, petitioner asserts that the record shows the \u201cabsence of an alternative cause\u201d for S.S.\u2019s seizures. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27. She concludes her invitation to re-weigh the evidence with a list of the evidence that the Chief Special Master is alleged to have ignored or evaluated illogieally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">[S.S.\u2019s] medical records, the strong temporal relationship between the vaccine and the symptoms, the absence of an alternative cause, the medical theory provided by Dr. Kinsbourne, the scientific literature upon which Dr. Kinsbourne relies, [and] the concessions made by Dr. MacDonald all demonstrate that it is logical to conclude that the MMR vaccine caused S.S.\u2019s epilepsy and developmental delays.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Respondent argues that the Chief Special Master\u2019s rulings on causation are not arbitrary or capricious:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-12\">In her Decision, the Chief Special Master properly and thoroughly considered the record evidence as a whole, and correctly found that petitioner failed to satisfy her burden of proving that the measles-mumps-rubella (\u201cMMR\u201d) vaccine caused her son S.S. to suffer epilepsy, developmental delay and hyperactivity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 1-2. Respondent asserts, further, that the motion for review \u201camounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the Chief Special Master\u2019s well-supported factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The governments notes, in particular, that Dr. Kinsbourne did not establish that S.S.\u2019s seizures were accompanied by fever, and did not address the issue of whether or not S.S. was experiencing gastrointestinal illness at the time of his new onset seizures; thus, Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s theory of causation, which relied in part on studies of febrile seizures or seizures that accompanied gastrointestinal illness, was not persuasive. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Respondent also notes that no treating physician opined that S.S.\u2019s epilepsy or developmental delays were caused by the measles vaccine. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Thus, in respondent\u2019s view, the evidentiary record fully supports the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding of fact on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">c. The Chief Special Master\u2019s Finding of Fact Survives Review</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">The court has considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the evidence of record and the thorough evaluation of that evidence that is set forth in the Chief Special Master\u2019s decision on entitlement. The court finds that the Chief Special Master \u201cconsidered the relevant evidence of record, dr[ew] plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for [her] decision.\u201d <em>Hines, </em>940 F.2d at 1528. She neither ignored relevant evidence nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>arrived at illogical conclusions. There is no reversible error in her conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">petitioner has failed to establish a logical sequence of cause and effect\u2014consistent with her proposed theory\u2014proving that the measles vaccine S.S. received on October 1, 2007 did cause his injuries. Thus, petitioner has failed to satisfy the second prong of the <em>Althen </em>test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Dec. at 32. Under the deferential standard applicable here, the Chief Special Master\u2019s ruling on causation is unassailable. Specifically, her analysis with respect to the second prong of the <em>Althen </em>test demonstrates that the Chief Special Master\u2019s ruling was neither arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">First, the court must agree with respondent that the Chief Special Master undertook a \u201cthorough evaluation of the medical literature submitted by the parties.\u201d Resp.\u2019s Resp. at 10. Her analysis of these articles was the foundation for her reasonable conclusion that while the theory advanced by Dr. Kinsbourne might support vaccine injury causation in other cases, that theory, and the medical literature underpinning that theory, did not fit the facts of the onset of S.S.\u2019s epilepsy. Dec. at 31 &amp; n.28 (citing <em>Hibbard, </em>698 F.3d at 1362-63). In other words, the medical literature cited by petitioner did not provide the Chief Special Master with enough evidentiary support to carry petitioner\u2019s burden on <em>Althen </em>Prong Two. <em>Id. </em>at 28. The court sees no flaw in this aspect of the Chief Special Master\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Second, the Chief Special Master corrected a misreading of S.S.\u2019s medical records that was presented in petitioner\u2019s arguments regarding <em>Althen </em>Prong Two. Petitioner had consistently maintained that S.S.\u2019s treating physicians had observed a causal connection between his vaccinations and his epilepsy. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 27 (\u201c[S.S.] submits that his treating physicians also associated his MMR vaccine with his injuries, and provide supporting evidence of causation in his ease.\u201d). The record does not support this contention, and the Chief Special Master accurately noted that no such causal hypothesis by S.S.\u2019s treating physicians can be found in his medical records. Dec. at 31. This finding, too, is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Chief Special Master found Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s opinion regarding the causation of S.S.\u2019s alleged vaccine injuries to be less than persuasive. She found his causation arguments to lack coherence, to employ circular logic, and, in the end, to be unsound. Dec. at 21-22. His theory of causation failed to persuade, at least in part, because of a lack of consistency between the biological mechanisms he described and the actual onset of S.S.\u2019s epilepsy. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. The court defers to the Chief Special Master\u2019s weighing of the opinion of Dr. Kinsbourne, <em>Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 870, and finds no error in this or any other aspect of her ruling regarding <em>Althen </em>Prong Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">C. Evidence of Alternative Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Finally, Ms. Dodd argues that the \u201cChief Special Master\u2019s determination that 5.5. had \u2018a likely genetic predisposition to have a seizure condition\u2019 because \u2018S.S. had a maternal great aunt with epilepsy\u2019 is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 29 (capitalization altered). This challenge to the ruling on entitlement can be divided into two sub-parts. First, indulging in the assumption that petitioner has proven her prima facie case of causation, Ms. Dodd argues that the evidentiary record is insufficient to meet respondent\u2019s burden to prove alternative causation. <em>See id. </em>at 29 (\u201cHaving demonstrated that the petitioner satisfied the <em>Althen </em>prongs, the burden shifted to the respondent to show 5.5. \u2019s MMR vaccine is unrelated to his seizure disorder and developmental delays.\u201d), 31 (\u201cThe respondent clearly failed to prove that an alternative cause of S.S.\u2019s injury existed.\u201d). Here, however, the Chief Special Master found that petitioner did not meet her burden to establish a prima facie case of causation, a finding that has been affirmed by this court, <em>see swpra\\ </em>thus, the burden to prove alternative causation has not shifted to respondent. <em>E.g., Doe 11 v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>601 F.3d 1349, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2010) (citations omitted). Any speculation of petitioner as to whether on this record the government has proved alternative cau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>sation for S.S.\u2019s epilepsy and developmental delays is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Second, petitioner argues that the Chief Special Master\u2019s evaluation of the evidence of alternative causation is arbitrary and capricious. <em>See </em>Pet.\u2019s Mot. at 30 (\u201c[T]here is no explained, known, or documented evidence in the record indicating that S.S. has an underlying genetic disorder that caused his epilepsy.\u201d) (emphasis removed); 32 (\u201cA thorough review of the evidence in S.S.\u2019s case clearly demonstrates the [ab]sence of any explained, known, or documented evidence in the record indicating an alternative cause to S.S.\u2019s seizure disorder and subsequent developmental delays.\u201d). The court must disagree. A family history of epilepsy was documented in 5.5. \u2019s medical records. <em>See supra </em>note 6. Dr. MacDonald testified that it was his opinion that a genetic disorder was the most likely cause for S.S.\u2019s seizure disorder and developmental delays. Tr. at 134; <em>see also </em>Ex. A at 4 (opining in his expert report that 5.5. \u2019s seizure disorder had a genetic basis). The Chief Special Master\u2019s consideration of this evidence has not been shown to be arbitrary or capricious. She \u201cconsidered the relevant evidence of record [and] dr[ew] plausible inferences.\u201d <em>Hines, </em>940 F.2d at 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">It is important to note that petitioner, attempting to establish a logical sequence of cause and effect in order to satisfy <em>Althen </em>Prong Two, relied to a great extent on a proximate temporal relationship between the MMR vaccination and S.S.\u2019s new onset seizures, as well as an alleged absence of alternative causes. Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 26-29; Pet.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Reply at 9-11. It was therefore within the Chief Special Master\u2019s purview to review evidence regarding alternative causation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">As this court explained in <em>Walther, </em>when petitioners attempt to eliminate other possible causes to buttress their theory of causation, the special master should evaluate such evidence in determining whether a prima facie case has been established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay\"><em>Doe </em>11, 601 F.3d at 1358 (citing <em>Walther v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>485 F.3d 1146, 1151 (Fed.Cir.2007) and <em>Pafford, </em>451 F.3d at 1359). Here, although there was limited evidence of alternative causation, the Chief Special Master rationally concluded that this evidence weakened petitioner\u2019s causation arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Furthermore, there is no indication that the Chief Special Master impermissibly required petitioner to eliminate alternative causes. <em>See </em>Dec. at 32 (\u201c \u2018 [T]he Vaccine Act does not require [a] petitioner to bear the burden of eliminating alternative causes where the other evidence on causation is sufficient to establish a prima facie case[.]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Walther, </em>485 F.3d at 1150)). Nor is there any sign that the Chief Special Master violated restrictions on the type of evidence that may be considered in the alternative causation inquiry. <em>See Doe 11, </em>601 F.3d at 1358 (noting that a special master may make findings on any evidence which bears directly on the issue of causation (citing <em>de Bazan, </em>539 F.3d at 1354)). The court sees no error of law in the Chief Special Master\u2019s consideration of evidence of alternative causation. Applying the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the fact finding of a special master, this court affirms the Chief Special Master\u2019s findings on alternative causation and rejects petitioner\u2019s final challenge to the ruling denying entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">For all of the above reasons, the court holds that the Chief Special Master\u2019s decision in this case was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">(1) Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Review, filed on July 5, 2013, is DENIED;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-15\">(2) The decision of the Chief Special Master, filed on June 5, 2013, is SUSTAINED;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-16\">(3) The Clerk\u2019s Office is directed to ENTER final judgment dismissing the petition; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-17\">(4) The parties shall separately FILE any proposed redactions to this opinion, with the text to be redacted clearly marked out and enclosed in brackets, on or before December 13,2013.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-20\">.

The medical records of S.S. as a whole reflect that a maternal great-aunt or aunt had an onset of seizures in her childhood and suffered from epilepsy. <em>See </em>Ex. 3 at 169; Ex. 7 at 4, 94; Ex. 8 at 10; Ex. 14 at 4, 17; <em>see also </em>Ex. 18 at 1 (petitioner's expert report noting that S.S.\u2019s \"family history was void of neurological disorders except for a maternal great-aunt with epilepsy\u201d). <em>But see </em>Ex. 3 at 177 (hospital physician notes stating that S.S. had \"no family history of seizures\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b58-18\">.

The court notes that the government mounted a vigorous challenge to the medical theory proposed by Dr. Kinsbourne in the Secretary\u2019s post-hearing brief. Resp.\u2019s Post-Hr\u2019g Br. at 10-18. Nothing in the record before the court establishes that the Chief Special Master\u2019s ruling on <em>Althen </em>Prong One was arbitrary or capricious. In its brief opposing petitioner\u2019s motion for review, the government does not renew its attack against Dr. Kinsboume\u2019s medical theory or challenge the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding as to <em>Althen </em>Prong One.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. The court notes that neither petitioner\u2019s post-hearing brief nor petitioner\u2019s post-hearing reply brief contained any mention of Dr. Kinsboume\u2019s testimony or opinion that the October 15, 2007 seizures lowered S.S.\u2019s seizure threshold. It is somewhat incongruous that petitioner now seeks review of the Chief Special Master\u2019s finding of fact regarding an aspect of petitioner\u2019s case that was presented only indirectly for her consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">. Dr. Kinsbourne did not address any specific statements in this article during the hearing, or reference the article by title or author\u2019s name, but may have alluded to the Holmes article obliquely in this statement: \"And from any number of studies, scientific studies, including animal models, would show that seizures are capable of lowering seizure thresholds, which is how many epilepsies get set up.\u201d Tr. at 84. Dr. MacDonald was extensively cross-examined about the Holmes article. <em>Id. </em>at 115-22. Petitioner\u2019s counsel also cross-examined Dr. MacDonald about an article (Crino article) that he had attached to his expert report that might have had some tangential relevance to Dr. Kinsbourne\u2019s lowered seizure threshold hypothesis. <em>Id. </em>at 113-15. The Chief Special Master did not discuss the Crino article, as this article was not one of those primarily relied upon by the parties. <em>See </em>Dec. at 22 n.23 (\"The parties submitted a total of 17 articles and studies; only those articles on which the parties appeared to rely most heavily are discussed in detail____\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">. Indeed, the Chief Special Master cited <em>Knudsen </em>for the rule of law relied upon by petitioner for her argument. <em>See </em>Dec. at 30 (citing <em>Knudsen, </em>35 F.3d at 549).
