This taking is the direct result of a denial of a hearing and a denial of a review of a mixed case complaint before the EEOC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Ms. Taylor also alleges that, \u201c[djefendant, Jacqueline Berrien, Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, was employed by the EEOC and was either committing or omitting [sic] to do all the acts of negligence that have been set forth and alleged in this complaint.\u201d Ms. Taylor claims that \u201c[o]n or about June 20, 2013, the Plaintiff was denied counsel by the EEOC,\u201d and that \u201cPlaintiff made a First (1st) Amendment petition for access to federal funds allocated through the EEOC to secure counsel.\u201d Plaintiff further alleges that \u201cPlaintiff raised legal questions to the EEOC regarding the review of the mixed case complaint before the EEOC,\u201d and that the \u201cEEOC refused and did not answer the legal questions of the Plaintiff.\u201d Although not discussed by Ms. Taylor in her filings with this court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in <em>Taylor v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 970 (Fed.Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>(Fed.Cir. 2013) provided some additional background about her employment and termination history. The Federal Circuit indicated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">Ms. Taylor was employed as a Computer Assistant by the Internal Revenue Service, a component of the Treasury Department (\u201cthe Agency\u201d). Between 2010 and 2011, she was the subject of several disciplinary actions which resulted in her removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-14\">Specifically, on January 5, 2010, the Agency proposed to suspend Ms. Taylor for a period of five days in response to two alleged instances of absence without leave. The Agency imposed that five-day suspension in March of 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-15\">In February of 2011, the Agency proposed to suspend Ms. Taylor for fifteen more days based upon five specifications of her alleged failure to follow managerial directions. Three days later, the Agency rescinded that proposal and replaced it with a proposal to remove Ms. Taylor on grounds that she had been absent without leave, had failed to abide by established leave procedures, and failed on numerous occasions to follow managerial direction. On April 20, 2011, the Agency issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>final decision removing Ms. Taylor, effective April 22, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 971. Another recent Federal Circuit decision involving Ms. Taylor, <em>Taylor v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>544 Fed.Appx. 973, No. 2013-3113, 2013 WL 5943153 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 7, 2013), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied </em>(Fed.Cir.2014), further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2A\">Following her removal, Taylor filed a formal EEO complaint at the Agency claiming that she was subjected to harassment that created a hostile work environment on the basis of race, age, sex, disability, and reprisal for prior EEO activities as a complainant. On December 12, 2011, the Agency issued a Final Agency Decision (\u201cFAD\u201d) on Taylor\u2019s EEO complaint, finding that there was no discrimination relating to her removal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 974, 2013 WL 5943153 at *1 (internal citation omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In this court, plaintiff claims that, \u201c[o]n or about June 20, 2013, the Plaintiff was denied access to federal funds by the EEOC,\u201d and \u201cdefendant interfered with the Plaintiff securing counsel with federal funds.\u201d Plaintiff further alleges she was \u201cdenied counsel by numerous lawyers,\u201d as well as \u201cdenied counsel by federally funded legal aid programs.\u201d Plaintiff alleges that the \u201cdefendant had a duty to answer the legal questions of the Plaintiff. The defendant had a duty to release its federal funds, equally distribute its federal funds and appoint or assign counsel to the Plaintiff.\u201d Plaintiff claims that the \u201cdefendant knew the Plaintiff could not properly provide any legal argument before the EEOC without counsel,\u201d and \u201cPlaintiffs injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The actions of the defendant were intentional. The defendant had a duty to the Plaintiff. The defendant breached its duty. There was approximate [sic] cause and the Plaintiff suffered damages due to the breach.\u201d Ms. Taylor now seeks $50,000.00, as well as \u201cdeclaratory relief, compensatory relief and injunctive relief to redress the denial of federal funds, denial of counsel, denial of a review of the mixed case complaint, denial of a hearing for Federal employees as required by the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">After some delay on defendant\u2019s part, on November 14, 2013, defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) (2013) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6). Regarding its jurisdictional arguments, defendant argues that this court does not have jurisdiction \u201cto entertain Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims for negligence, for violations of non-money mandating constitutional provisions, and for relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>against defendants other than the United States.\u201d Regarding defendant\u2019s motion for failure to state a claim, defendant argues, \u201c[t]he only claim that potentially falls within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is a takings claim, but, the complaint fails to state a plausible takings claim upon which relief may be granted. Therefore, the Court should dismiss the entire complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">On December 13, 2013, plaintiff filed a response to the motion to dismiss, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">It is a fact, the Plaintiff cannot make a proper pleading before the Court without counsel. It is a fact, the defendant has interfered with the Plaintiffs right to sue before the Court. It is a fact, the defendant has engaged in exparte [sic] communication with the Court. It is a fact, the defendant has obstructed justice and impeded the judicial process. It is a fact, the defendant has a duty to appoint or assign counsel to the Plaintiff. It is a fact, the defendant has breached its duty. It is a fact the breach caused irreparable harm to the Plaintiff. It is a fact, the defendant has failed to articulate any legal basis for denying counsel to the Plaintiff and withholding federal funds from the Plaintiff. The defendant has a weak and defenseless argument before the Court. The Plaintiff does not have the legal expertise to understand the legal jargon of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcO\">On December 16, 2013, defendant responded to plaintiffs filing, noting that \u201c[i]n her opposition, Ms. Taylor denigrates our arguments as \u201cweak and defenseless\u2019 and she \u2018objects to the dismissal of the complaint,\u2019 but she does not elaborate upon these eonelusory points at all.\u201d (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In addition to filing a response to the motion to dismiss, plaintiff has filed sixteen, additional separate filings with the court, including eleven motions and one petition for review. The motions include motions for entry of default, motions for relief from court Orders, a motion for recusal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a motion for \u201cAppointment of Counsel through the Court\u2019s Civil Pro Bono Panel,\u201d a motion to \u201cfile the notice to the court and notarized letter,\u201d and a motion for \u201cdefendant to appoint or assign counsel to the Plaintiff by releasing its federal funds, equally distribute ing its federal funds for the sole purpose of counsel for the Plaintiff,\u201d among many others. Although the motions take various forms, Ms. Taylor repeats exactly the following two sentences in twelve of her filings: \u201cThe Plaintiff is without counsel. There is a prejudice toward the Plaintiff for a lack of counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ms. Taylor also repeatedly indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">The interest of the Plaintiff is not protected due to the fact that Plaintiff does not have counsel. However, the interest of the defendant is protected because it has secured counsel. The Plaintiff has many legal questions. However, the Clerk of the Court cannot answer legal questions. The legal questions remain unanswered due to the fact that Plaintiff is without counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Ms. Taylor also has expressed frustration that the court has refused to schedule oral argument on plaintiffs many motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">When determining whether a complaint filed by a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is sufficient to invoke review by a court, <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs are entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings. <em>See Haines v.

United States, </em>47 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (Fed.Cir.1995)), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>(2004). A court first determines whether a plaintiff possesses a cognizable property interest in the subject of the alleged taking. Then, the court must determine whether the government action is a \u201c\u2018compensable taking of that property interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huntleigh USA Corp v. United States, </em>525 F.3d at 1377 (quoting <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co., L.P. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d at 1372).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">A plaintiff alleging a taking must have a legally cognizable property interest, such as the right of possession, use or disposal of the property. <em>See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 435, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982) (citing <em>United States v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>323 U.S. 373, 65 S.Ct. 357, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945)); <em>CRV Enters., Inc. v. United States, </em>626 F.3d 1241, 1249 (Fed.Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2459, 179 L.Ed.2d 1211 (2011); <em>Karuk Tribe of Cal. v. Ammon, </em>209 F.3d 1366, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied and en banc suggestion denied </em>(Fed.Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 941, 121 S.Ct. 1402, 149 L.Ed.2d 345 (2001). \u201cIt is axiomatic that only persons with a valid property interest at the time of the taking are entitled to compensation.\u201d <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d at 1372 (quoting <em>Wyatt v. United States, </em>271 F.3d 1090, 1096 (Fed.Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied </em>535 U.S. 1077, 122 S.Ct. 1960, 152 L.Ed.2d 1021 (2002) and citing <em>Cavin v. United States, </em>956 F.2d 1131, 1134 (Fed.Cir.1992)). Therefore, \u201c[i]f the claimant fails to demonstrate the existence of a legally cognizable property interest, the courts [sic] task is at an end.\u201d <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d at 1372 (citing <em>Maritrans Inc. v. United States, </em>342 F.3d 1344, 1352 (Fed.Cir.2003) and <em>M &amp; J Coal, </em>47 F.3d at 1154). The court does not address the second step \u201cwithout first identifying a cognizable property interest.\u201d <em>Air Pegasus of D.C., Inc. v. United States, </em>424 F.3d 1206, 1213 (Fed.Cir.) (citing <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d at 1381 and <em>Conti v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 1334, 1340 (Fed.Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1112, 123 S.Ct. 904, 154 L.Ed.2d 785 (2003)), <em>reh\u2019g denied and reh\u2019g en banc denied </em>(Fed.Cir.2005). Only if there is to be a next step, \u201cafter having identified a valid property interest, the court must determine whether the governmental action at issue amounted to a compensable taking of that property interest.\u201d <em>Huntleigh USA Corp. v. United States, </em>525 F.3d at 1378 (quoting <em>Am. Pelagic Fishing Co. v. United States, </em>379 F.3d at 1372).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The court agrees with defendant that Ms. Taylor\u2019s complaint does not allege that the government took anything from her at all, much less a valid property interest. To the extent plaintiff alleges that the failure to appoint counsel or provide her federal funds for counsel is a taking, plaintiff has not alleged a property interest subject to a constitutional taking claim. The Federal Circuit in <em>Taylor v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 970, addressed plaintiffs contention that she was entitled to federally-funded counsel before the Merit Systems Protection Board. In the Federal Circuit, Ms. Taylor had framed her argument as alleging that the Board abused its discretion when it failed to assign her federally-funded counsel. The Federal Circuit concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">As an initial matter, Ms. Taylor has no constitutional right to appointed counsel to assist with her appeal of the Agency\u2019s removal action. That right is usually limited to criminal cases, and generally applies to civil cases such as this only when an indigent party\u2019s liberty is potentially threatened. <em>Pitts v. Shinseki, </em>700 F.3d 1279, 1283 (Fed.Cir.2012); <em>see also Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>452 U.S. 18, 26-27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981) (\u201c[W]e ... draw from [the Court\u2019s precedents] the presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty.\u201d); <em>Arnesen v. Principi, </em>300 F.3d 1353, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2002) (generally there is no right to appointed counsel for indigent civil litigants absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>a potential loss of personal freedom); <em>Lariscey v. United States, </em>861 F.2d 1267, 1270 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201c[T]he right to counsel is highly circumscribed, and has been authorized in exceedingly restricted circumstances,\u201d such as when an indigent party \u201cmay lose his/her personal freedom if the action is lost\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><em>Taylor v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>527 Fed.Appx. at 972. Ms. Taylor has failed to demonstrate that the failure to appoint counsel or provide her federal funds for counsel threatens her physical liberty or is a taking. Therefore, Ms. Taylor has raised no cognizable claims before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As indicated above, Ms. Taylor has repeatedly expressed to this court her concerns over her lack of counsel, and the impact to her case to proceed without counsel. Indeed, Ms. Taylor continually repeats exactly the following two sentences: \u201cThe Plaintiff is without counsel. There is a prejudice toward the Plaintiff for a lack of counsel,\u201d in twelve separate filings before this court. Ms. Taylor further repeatedly indicates that \u201c[t]he interest of the Plaintiff is not protected due to the fact that Plaintiff does not have counsel. However, the interest of the defendant is protected because it has secured counsel.\u201d Ms. Taylor states, \u201c[tjhere is no federal law that gives the defendant the exclusive and sole rights to the property of federal funds and counsel for this civil action. As a federal litigant, the Plaintiff has the right to counsel of her choice.\u201d In her response to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiff states, \u201c[t]he Plaintiff cannot successfully prevail before the Court without counsel.\u201d On November 8, 2013, this court denied Ms. Taylor\u2019s motions to appointment counsel and on December 3, 2013, denied plaintiffs motions for relief from those denials. In the November 8, 2013 Order, the court noted that although plaintiff requested appointment of counsel through the court\u2019s Civil Pro Bono Panel, \u201cin this court there is no formal \u2018Court\u2019s Civil Pro Bono Panel.\u2019\u201d The court further observed that \u201c[t]his court also has no authority to request or order the defendant to appoint counsel on plaintiffs behalf.\u201d As indicated most recently in the court\u2019s December 3, 2013 Order, Ms. Taylor filed a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201cMotion for Relief from an Order,\u201d in which the court denied plaintiffs request for appointment of counsel. According to plaintiff:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">The Plaintiff cannot successfully prevail before the court without counsel. The Plaintiffs First (1st) Amendment petition for access to federal funds to secure counsel as the defendant was denied by the court. The Court has the full authority to order the defendant to appoint or assign counsel and equally distribute federal funds to the Plaintiff for the sole purpose of counsel. The plaintiff objects to the denial of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cMotion for Relief from an Order\u201d is DENIED. As fully explained in the court\u2019s previous Orders, this court does not have a program to appoint counsel on plaintiff\u2019s behalf in the civil eases before the court, nor does the defendant appoint counsel for plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">As noted in this court\u2019s prior Orders, consistent with one of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinions respecting Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims, <em>Taylor v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>527 Fed. Appx. at 972, this court does not have a responsibility or obligation to appoint counsel to cases on this court\u2019s civil docket. <em>See Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of Durham Cnty, N.C., </em>452 U.S. 18, 26-27, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981) (\u201c[A]n indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty.\u201d); <em>see also Pitts v. Shinseki, </em>700 F.3d 1279, 1283 (Fed.Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2856, 186 L.Ed.2d 910 (2013); <em>Heuss v. United States, </em>75 Fed.Cl. 636 (2007) (quoting <em>Lariscey v. United States, </em>861 F.2d 1267, 1270-71 (Fed. Cir.1988), and noting that the United States Supreme Court has not recognized a right under the Constitution to appointed counsel in civil cases); <em>Martin v. United States, </em>31 Fed.Cl. 756, 757 (1994) (\u201cThe appointment of counsel in a civil ease is not a right, but a privilege justified only by exceptional circumstances.\u201d). Moreover, appointment of counsel would serve no purpose in plaintiffs particular case, given the substantial deficiencies in plaintiffs complaint. Even the appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ment of counsel would not cure the failure of the plaintiff to raise issues within the court\u2019s jurisdiction or properly state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">As is the case before this court, the Federal Circuit noted that \u201cMs. Taylor has also filed numerous motions asking this court to supply her with counsel to assist with this appeal, all of which were denied. To the extent that her briefing invites us to reconsider those denials, we decline for reasons similar to those outlined above\u2014Ms. Taylor has no constitutional right to counsel for her present appeal, and this court has no means by which it could appoint counsel to represent her.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>527 Fed.Appx. at 974.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This court likewise declines to revisit Ms. Taylor\u2019s numerous requests to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Ms. Taylor also has expressed disappointment that the court did not hold oral argument. For example, in one of her many filings, plaintiff states: \u201cThe Court did not allow oral argument after the defendant filed a motion for an enlargement of time.\u201d Ms. Taylor again made this claim in her response to the motion to dismiss, claiming, \u201c[i]t is a fact, the court did not allow oral argument.\u201d Trial judges are given broad discretion to control and manage them dockets, including with respect to procedural matters. <em>See, e.g., Amado v. Microsoft Corp., </em>517 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2008) (citing <em>Nolan v. de Baca, </em>603 F.2d 810, 812 (10th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 956, 100 S.Ct. 2927, 64 L.Ed.2d 814 (1980)); <em>Nutrinova Nutrition Specialties and Food Ingredients GmbH v. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>224 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2000). \u201c[T]he parties\u2019 right to be heard may be fulfilled by the court\u2019s review of the briefs and supporting affidavits and materials submitted to the court.\u201d <em>Geear v. Boulder Cmty. Hosp., </em>844 F.2d 764, 766 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 927, 109 S.Ct. 312, 102 L.Ed.2d 331 (1988); <em>see also Toquero v. I.N.S., </em>956 F.2d 193, 196 n. 4 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cIt is well-settled that oral argument is not necessary to satisfy due process.\u201d); <em>Lake at Las Vegas Investors Grp. v. Pac. Malibu Dev. Corp., </em>933 F.2d 724, 729 (9th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>(9th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 920, 112 S.Ct. 1295, 117 L.Ed.2d 518 (1992) (affirming the trial court and discussed the court\u2019s interpretation of a local District Court rule, finding no prejudicial error based on the denial of oral argument in a summary judgment motion because the party \u201chad the opportunity to apprise the district court of any arguments it believed supported its position____\u201d). Therefore, a trial court is not required to hold a hearing, but may do so if the court believes the hearing would assist the court to resolve the ease. The decision of whether or not to hold oral argument is made in each case, based on the filings and issues raised in that particular case. Trial courts have broad discretion regarding this decision. Given the absence of jurisdiction for the court to review plaintiffs claims and the failure of plaintiff to state a claim for her takings allegation, the court does not believe holding oral argument on any of the motions filed in this case, including the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, would help the court in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Ms. Taylor further expresses concern that, in her view, her submissions were not filed in a timely manner. For example, regarding her motion for sanctions against the government, she states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">The Plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment on October 17, 2013. It was delivered to the Court on October 18, 2013. However, the Clerk of the Court has not docketed the motion for default judgment with the correct date of October 18, 2013. The Plaintiff is perplexed on the reason the Court continues to show an incorrect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>docket date as October 25, 2013 for the motion for default judgment. The Plaintiff has filed several pleadings such as motion for relief from an order which was filed on October 26, 2013. It was delivered on October 28, 2013. Yet, the Court refused to docket the motion. The Plaintiff filed a response or opposition to an enlargement of time on October 26, 2013. It was delivered on October 28, 2013. However, the Court refused to docket the response or opposition to an enlargement of time. The refusal of the Court to docket pleadings of the Plaintiff is [sic] to cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In a subsequent filing Ms. Taylor went further, claiming that \u201cthe Court has refused to correct the docket with correct dates.\u201d The court notes that many of Ms. Taylor\u2019s submissions have not been filed in conformance with the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims. Those documents not in conformance with the RCFC were not filed by the Clerk\u2019s Office, but were submitted to the undersigned for review for the submissions\u2019 defects, and could have been returned to plaintiff as unfiled or filed on the court\u2019s docket with the court\u2019s leave. Because of Ms. Taylor\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, this court has been extraordinary generous and filed all of plaintiffs defective submissions by leave of the court. Indeed, nine separate defective filings submitted by Ms. Taylor were filed by leave of the court. Although Ms. Taylor remains perplexed that some of her filings have a different filing date than her submission date, the filings were not considered filed until the undersigned permitted the defective submissions to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Finally, Ms. Taylor accuses the court of having <em>ex parte </em>communications with defendant and claims that \u201c[i]t is a fact, the Court made a pleading on behalf of the defendant.\u201d Although the court is unsure of how the court would have made pleadings on behalf of the government, the docket reflects that the court has only filed court Orders in the above captioned case. Moreover, the court has not had ex parte communications on the merits of plaintiffs case with the defendant during the pendency of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">For the reasons described above, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. Plaintiffs complaint is DISMISSED. The Clerk of the Court shall enter JUDGMENT consistent with this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-13\">.

On January 2, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a decision, affirming in part, reversing in part, and remanding in part to the district court a 2011 decision by the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. <em>See Taylor v. Geithner, </em>703 F.3d 328 (6th Cir.2013). Reviewing the Western District\u2019s decision to dismiss Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims of breach of setdement agreement for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Regarding Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims of retaliation, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, concluding that Ms. Taylor's claim that she had applied for, and was rejected from, fifty-two positions, along with negative references from her supervisor, established adverse employment action element of her prima facie case of retaliation. <em>See id. </em>at 340. Noting that was the \"sole issue\u201d before the court, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Ms. Taylor\u2019s retaliation claim and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on the merits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\">.
