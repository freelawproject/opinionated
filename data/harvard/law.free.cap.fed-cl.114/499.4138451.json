The parties submitted briefs on claim construction in August and September 2013, conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ed a technological primer for the court on August 27, 2013, and presented arguments at a <em>Markman </em>hearing held on September 13, 2013. Of the fifteen salient terms identified by the parties, only one has an agreed construction. <em>See </em>Joint Claim Construction Statement, ECF No. 24. For this one term, the court adopts the mutually acceptable construction proffered by the parties. For the remaining terms, the court has classified the terms into seven groups. The constructions adopted by the court for the disputed terms of the \u2019032 and \u2019946 patents are specified below.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\n<em>A. Standard for Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u201cThe purpose of claim construction is to \u2018determin[e] the meaning and scope of the patent claims alleged to be infringed.\u2019\u201d <em>02 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., </em>521 F.3d 1351, 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996)). The construction and meaning of claims in a patent are questions of law for the court to address. <em>Markman, </em>517 U.S. at 388-90, 116 S.Ct. 1384. Although the trial court is not required to construe every term in a patent, it must construe any term for which claim scope is disputed. <em>02 Micro, </em>521 F.3d at 1360. The court begins this task by first looking to the intrinsic evidence of record, as \u201cintrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.\u201d <em>Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed.Cir.1996). Intrinsic evidence consists of the \u201cpatent itself, including the claims, the specification and ... the prosecution history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">To construe claim terms, a court should generally look to the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art at the date of the invention, which is the effective filing date of the patent application. <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (en banc). \u201cThat starting point is based on the well-settled understanding that inventors are typically persons skilled in the field of the invention and that patents are addressed to and intended to be read by others of skill in the pertinent art.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Courts have recognized, however, that \u201ca patentee may choose to be his own lexicographer and use terms in a manner other than their ordinary meaning, as long as the special definition of the term is clearly stated in the patent specification or file history.\u201d <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582 (citing <em>Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. BP Chems. Ltd., </em>78 F.3d 1575, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Hormone Research Found., Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>904 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>cert, dismissed pursuant to Sup.Ct. R. 46, </em>499 U.S. 955, 111 S.Ct. 1434, 113 L.Ed.2d 485 (1991)). Therefore, a court must review the patent\u2019s specification \u201cto determine whether [an] inventor has used any terms in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the specification is important to claim construction, a court must avoid importing limitations from the specification into the claims. <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1323. Prosecution history may also be examined, with its principal purpose being to exclude interpretations disclaimed during prosecution. <em>Chimie v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1371, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> Extrinsic evidence, which includes \u201call evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises,\u201d <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 980, is \u201cless significant than the intrinsic record\u201d in the construction process, <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1317 (quoting <em>C.R. Bard, Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp., </em>388 F.3d 858, 862 (Fed.Cir. 2004)). Extrinsic evidence is not as reliable as intrinsic evidence, and the court should consider it only in conjunction with intrinsic evidence. Nonetheless, \u201cit is permissible for the [court] in its sound discretion to admit and use such evidence.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\n<em>B. Specific Terms of the Claims Requiring Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\"><em>Term 1: \u201ca high pressure area,\u201d \u201cthe high pressure area, </em>\u201d <em>and \u201ca high pressure region\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Plain and ordinary meaning Alternatively, \u201ca region of elevated pressure\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u2018A region of specific shape upon which is exerted an elevated hydrodynamic pressure which is sufficient in magnitude to produce hydrodynamic lift due to forces produced by the motion of the hull through water.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Term 1 appears in Claims 1 and 19 of the \u2019032 patent and in Claims 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the \u2019946 patent. The \u201chigh pressure area\u201d is described by these claims as located \u201cat the bottom of the hull in a stern section of the hull.\u201d \u2019032 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 2-3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Fastship avers that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the term according to its plain and ordinary meaning, Pl.\u2019s Br. at 10, while the government proposes a construction that incorporates limitations regarding magnitude, source, and shape, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 10-11. Among other things, the parties dispute whether \u201chigh pressure\u201d is limited to hydrodynamic pressure and whether the patent teaches a particular degree of pressure. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 15; Pl.\u2019s Reply Claim Construction Br. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Reply\u201d) at 7-11. This disagreement cannot be resolved by plain and ordinary meaning because the plain and ordinary meaning does not answer whether the pressure referenced is purely hydrodynamic pressure nor does it define the degree of pressure required by the term. <em>See 02 Micro, </em>521 F.3d at 1361 (holding that \u201c[a] determination that a claim term ... has the \u2018plain and ordinary meaning1 may be inadequate when a term has more than one \u2018ordinary\u2019 meaning or when reliance on a term\u2019s \u2018ordinary\u2019 meaning does not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute.\u201d). Consequently, the court must provide construction for this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">The term \u201chigh pressure\u201d is used at various points in the patent specification. Each time, the term teaches that the shape of the vessel\u2019s hull is a cause of the high pressure. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 3, lines 13-23 (\u201cThe shape of [a planing hull] is such that high pressure is induced under the hull.\u201d), col. 5, lines 14-21 (\u201cSince it is advantageous for waterjet propulsion systems to have an area of higher pressure in the vicinity of the water inlet and since a larger flat transom area is required to install the jet units, the [semi-planing] hull form is ideally suited for water-jet propulsion.\u201d). The specification compares the high pressure area of a semi-planing hull with corresponding low pressure areas created by ordinarily configured displacement hulls. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 4, lines 8-14. This is consistent with the teaching of the technical tutorial. During the tutorial, each party\u2019s representative explained that when moving at speed, a vessel with a conventional displacement hull will experience low pressure in the area at the stern of the ship, creating a suction force, pulling the stern downwards. Tech. Tutorial at 16:9-14, 33:3-5. This low pressure, coupled with higher pressure at the bow, will result in a tendency for displacement vessels to squat at the stern when sailing. Tech. Tutorial at 16:15-23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the term \u201chigh pressure area\u201d refers to higher pressure at the stern of a semi-planing hull as contrasted to the lower pressure at the stern of a displacement hull.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The government\u2019s construction containing the words \u201celevated hydrodynamic pressure\u201d indicates that the government believes the term \u201chigh pressure\u201d is compared to non-elevated levels of hydrodynamic pressure. This is in part correct, but the \u201chigh pressure\u201d necessarily reflects both hydrostatic as well as hydrodynamic pressures, and the term specifically compares the pressure experienced at the stern of a semi-planing hull to that at the stern of a conventional displacement hull.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The government\u2019s construction also adds the limitation that the \u201chigh pressure\u201d area is \u201ca region of specific shape.\u201d In this respect, the government reads a limitation from the specification into the claim language. The term \u201cspecific shape\u201d appears only once in the specification and refers to a small planing hull (shorter than 200 feet or under 200 tons) rather than a large semi-planing hull. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 3, lines 16-19. Additionally, the size and shape of the high pressure area cannot be constant, even for the same hull configuration. The hydrodynamic pressure on the hull is dependent upon the speed of the vessel as well as the configuation of the hull. <em>See </em>Odd M. Faltinsen, <em>Hydrodynamics of High-Speed Marine Vehicles </em>247 (2005). At the <em>Markman </em>hearing, the government conceded this point. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. <em>(\u201cMarkman </em>Hearing\u201d) 57:1-5 (Sept. 13, 2013) (\u201cAnd, of course, presumably, that specific shape can vary between different embodiments of the vessel____ [I]t might even change depending on the speed.\u201d). Therefore, the court cannot construe the high pressure area to be limited to any specific shape or size.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The claim language provides additional characteristics of the \u201chigh pressure area.\u201d Claim 19 of the \u2019032 patent states that the \u201chigh pressure region\u201d is responsible for hydrodynamic lift in the stern section of the vessel at a threshold ship speed. \u2019032 patent, Claim 19, col. 15, line 19 to col. 16, line l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This characteristic is also detailed in the other claims containing the term. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 1-7; <em>see also </em>\u2019946 patent, Claim 1, col. 13, line 66 to col. 14, line 3, Claim 3, col. 14, lines 26-32, Claim 5, col. 14, lines 55-59, Claim 7, col. 15, lines 8-11. These aspects of the claims are reflected in the specification. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 3, lines 19-22 (\u201cThe [semi-planing vessel] develops hydrodynamic lift above a certain threshold speed as a result of the presence of high pressure at the aft part of the hull.\u201d), col. 5, lines 63-66 (\u201cA hull of the fast semi-planing type experiences lift due to the action of [hydro]dynamie forces and operates at maximum speeds in the range of Froude Numbers 0.3 to 1.0.\u201d). The upward lift component of hydrodynamic pressure is understood in the art as an upward force vector. <em>See </em>Tech. Tutorial 21:4-6 (using the force-vector definition with relation to acceleration); <em>see also </em>Jonathan Wickart &amp; Kemper Lewis, <em>An Introduction to Mechanical Engineering </em>132 (3rd ed. 2013) (\u201cForces are vector quantities since their physical action involves both direction and magnitude.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">For the reasons stated, the court adopts the following construction for Term 1: \u201ca high pressure area\u201d is an area with hydrodynamically generated pressure sufficient in magnitude to produce an upward rather than a downward force vector. Similarly, \u201cthe high pressure area\u201d is the area with hydrodynamically generated pressure sufficient in magnitude to produce an upward rather than a downward force vector; \u201ca high pressure region\u201d is a region with hydrodynamically generated pressure sufficient in magnitude to produce an upward rather than a downward force vector.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">\n<em>Term 2: \u201cto increase the pressure\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Plaintiffs Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Plain and ordinary meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cAn increase in hydrodynamic pressure which is additional to any hydrodynamic pressure on the hull produced by the motion of the hull through water.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">This term is used in Claim 19 of the \u2019032 patent and Claims 5 and 7 of the \u2019946 patent.

Fast-ship seeks adoption of the plain and ordinary meaning of the term, PL\u2019s Br. at 19, while the government urges a construction that distinguishes between hydrodynamic pressure produced by the hull and hydrodynamic pressure produced by the waterjets, Def.\u2019s Br. at ll.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The government\u2019s construction imports unnecessary limitations into the term.

The court need not resort to anything more complicated than the common meaning of the words when their meaning is evident and not contradicted by the claims or specification. <em>See Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1314 (\u201cIn some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such eases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.\u201d).

Fastship proposes that the plain and ordinary meaning should apply to the term. PL\u2019s Br. at 14, 21. The government separates the term \u201chydrodynamic lift\u201d from \u201chydrodynamic lifting\u201d and \u201chydrodynamically lifting,\u201d assigning different defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tions to these terms. Def.\u2019s Br. at 16.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 disagreement focuses on whether the patent teaches two separate components of hydrodynamic lift, one produced by the movement of water under the shaped hull and another produced by the waterjets. Although the claims and specifications do not state that hydrodynamic lift has components, the prosecution history provides pertinent details. When writing a response to the patent examiner\u2019s initial rejection of the patent application, counsel for the patentee distinguished the application from the prior art by stating that \u201ceach of the claims recites a <em>dual </em>component of lift which is produced by (1) an area of the hull which produces a high pressure area in the stern of the hull and (2) the acceleration of the water into the water-jets which produce[s] an additional lift which <em>increases </em>efficiency of the hull and <em>reduces </em>drag.\u201d Applicant\u2019s Amendment at 9 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The government is correct that this statement made during prosecution of the application has relevance in determining the scope of the claim in the patent as issued. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 19 (citing <em>Microsoft Corp v. Multi-Tech Sys., </em>357 F.3d 1340, 1350 (Fed.Cir.2004) (stating that \u201ca patentee\u2019s statements during prosecution, whether relied on by the examiner or not, are relevant to claim interpretation\u201d)). The government nonetheless goes too far in asserting that the patentee claimed two <em>separable </em>components of hydrodynamic lift. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 19. While the prosecution history recognizes \u201cdual\u201d components of hydrodynamic lift, it does not claim that the components are functionally independent. Therefore, the court recognizes that the patent teaches dual components of lift but that these components cannot be separated in functional effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">When construing terms, the court seeks to construe terms to be consistent both with the specification and with other claim terms. <em>See Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1314 (\u201cThe construction that stays true to the claim language and most naturally aligns with the patent\u2019s description of the invention will be, in the end, the correct construction.\u201d (quoting <em>Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa\u2019 per Azioni, </em>158 F.3d 1243, 1250 (Fed.Cir. 1998))). These phrases are grouped together because it would be incorrect to ascribe a divergent interpretation to the phrases \u201chydrodynamic lifting\u201d and \u201chydrodynamically lifting\u201d as contrasted to \u201chydrodynamic lift\u201d and \u201chydrodynamically lifted\u201d because all of these terms are used interchangeably throughout the claims and specifications. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 5, 24-25, Claim 19, col. 15, line 20, and col. 16, line 6; <em>see also </em>\u2019946 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 19-20, Claim 3, col. 14, lines 31, 48-49, Claim 5, col. 14, lines 56, 62, Claim 7, col. 15, line 9 and col. 16, line 1. Therefore, the court chooses to construe these phrases harmoniously. Thus, \u201chydrodynamic lift\u201d is used throughout to patent to mean generation of an upward force vector by hydrodynamic means. Similarly, \u201chydrodynamically lifting\u201d and \u201chydrodynamic lifting\u201d mean generating an upward force vector by hydrodynamic means. \u201c[H]ydrodynamically lifted\u201d means raised by hydrodynamic means.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>Term \u201cfurther lifting\u201d and \u201cadditional\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Plaintiffs Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Oovermnent\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Plain and ordinary meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">:A second of two separate components of hydrodynamic lift on the hull produced as a result of accelerated water flow at or around the inlets\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">This term appears in the \u2019032 patent, Claim 1 (as \u201cadditional\u201d) and Claim 19 (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201cfurther lifting\u201d) and in the \u2019946 patent, Claims 1 and 3 (as \u201cadditional\u201d) and Claims 5 and 7 (as \u201cfurther lifting\u201d). In these instances, the term teaches that the waterjet propulsion system produces hydrodynamic lift causing <em>further lifting </em>or <em>additional </em>lifting compared to the lift produced by the hull. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 23-29, Claim 19, col. 16, lines 11-14. Fastship proposes the plain and ordinary meaning of the term, Pl.\u2019s Br. at 21, while the government proposes a detailed construction to distinguish this term from Term 3, the previous term concerning hydrodynamic lifting, Def.\u2019s Br. at 16-17. The parties\u2019 disagreement over this term is the same as the disagreement over Term 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The government, using prosecution history, had sought to narrow aspects of Term 3 to relate only to hydrodynamic lift caused by the shape of the hull. Similarly, the government uses the same prosecution history to aver that the proper construction of Term 4 is limited to the hydrodynamic lift caused by the waterjets. Def.\u2019s Br. at 18-19. As the court recognized in the construction for Term 3, however, the prosecution history states that there are dual components of lift but does not teach that these components are independent in function. Term 4 indicates that the lift generated by the waterjets is compounded with the lift caused by the bottom of the hull. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 24-28. In short, the patent does not teach that the lift from the waterjets can be readily separated from the lift caused by the bottom of the hull. The specifications do indicate that the lift caused by both the waterjets and the hullform is greater than lift generated by a vessel with only one of these two sources. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 5, lines 6-13 (\u201cA principal advantage of the integrated [semi-planning] hull and waterjet system is that ... the accelerated flow at the intakes also produces higher pressure and greater lift to reduce drag on the hull even further.\u201d), col. 6, lines 16-24 (\u201c[T]he acceleration of flow created by the [waterjets] produces additional dynamic lift.... The result is an improvement in overall propulsive efficiency compared to a hull with a conventional propeller propulsion system.\u201d). For these reasons, the court construes the terms \u201cfurther lifting\u201d and \u201cadditional\u201d to mean a greater upward force vector than that attributable to a single means.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\n<em>Term 5: \u201cacceleration of water into\u201d and \u201caccelerating of water flow into\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Plain and ordinary meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">\u201cAn increase in the velocity of water created by the pumps\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">Term 5 appears in Claims 1 and 19 of the \u2019032 patent and Claims 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the \u2019946 patent. Fastship again advocates adoption of the plain and ordinary meaning, Pl.\u2019s Br. at 17, while the government proposes a construction which states that any acceleration is due to a change in velocity created by the pumps, Def.\u2019s Br. at 20. In effect, the parties disagree over the technical definition of acceleration taught in the patent and about the source of the acceleration. During the <em>Markman </em>hearing, Fastship pointed out that acceleration is not merely an increase in velocity but rather depends also upon direction. <em>Markman </em>Hearing at 31:13-17 (referencing Tech. Tutorial at 21:3-6). The government acknowledges that acceleration can incorporate direction but correctly points out that the specification only discusses acceleration as an increase in velocity. <em>See Mark-man </em>Hearing at 62:17-20. Each time the word \u201cacceleration\u201d or a variation of the word is used in the specification, the patent is addressing the waterjet propulsion system, which increases the velocity of the water flowing through it. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 5, lines 6-13, col. 6, lines 16-18, col. 10, lines 34-38. Although Fastship is correct that acceleration reflects a force vector applying power in a direction, <em>see </em>Tech. Tutorial at 21:3-9, the claims of the patents appear either to assume a mid-line direction of the inlet and outlet or to assume that direction is not material to construction of the term, <em>see </em>\u2019032 patent, Fig. 15, col. 10 and lines 34-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The second point of contention is whether the patent teaches a particular source of acceleration. The government avers that it does, specifically that the pumps are the sole source of water-flow acceleration. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 20 (citing \u2019032 Patent col. 6, lines 16-18 (\u201cthe acceleration of flow created by the pumps at or around the inlet produces additional dynamic lift\u201d)). The patent indicates that the pumps do generate acceleration of the water, but the claims do not limit acceleration to the action of the pumps. Instead, the inlets of the waterjet propulsion system are also directly tied to the acceleration of water flow. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, Claim 1, col. 14, lines 23-24 (\u201cacceleration of water into the at least one inlet and from the at least one waterjet\u201d), Claim 19, col. 16, lines 11-14 (\u201caccelerating water flow into the inlets to increase the pressure\u201d). In particular, the design of the inlet makes a difference in the acceleration of the water flow. A change in the design or location of the inlet can make the waterjet more or less efficient by affecting the way water flows into the inlet. Tech. Tutorial at 34:15-22, 35:7-13.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, the acceleration of water flow is affected by the pumps and other factors, such as inlet design and placement. For the reasons stated, the court construes the term \u201cacceleration of water into\u201d to mean an increase in the speed of the flow of water into and \u201caccelerating of water flow into\u201d to mean increasing the speed of the flow of water into.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>Term 6: \u201ca threshold speed\u201d and \u201ca threshold ship speed\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction__Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"pAmSJ\">Plain and ordinary meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u201cThe minimum level of speed required to produce hydrodynamic lift under the stem of the hull\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Term 6 appears in Claims 1 and 19 of the \u2019032 patent and Claims 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the \u2019946 patent. Fastship avers that the term should be given its plain and ordinary meaning, Pl.\u2019s Br. at 24-25, and the government proposes a specific construction for the term, Def.\u2019s Br. at 21. The specification defines this term as the minimum speed at which a semi-planing ship develops hydrodynamic lift as a result of the high pressure generated at the aft part of the ship. \u2019032 patent, col. 3, lines 19-22 (\u201cThe [semi-planing] ship develops hydrodynamic lift above a certain threshold speed as a result of the presence of high pressure at the aft part of the hull.\u201d). This definition is consistently used throughout the claims and specification. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 9, lines 23-27 (\u201cIt is this hull configuration which produces at a threshold speed a hydrodynamic lift under the aft section to reduce drag in relation to conventional displacement hulls as demonstrated in FIG. 14.\u201d), col. 9, lines 32-37 (\u201cAlthough there is presently no agreed upon method for determining the onset of hydrodynamic lift as a result of the size and shape of this hull [embodiment], it has been suggested that such lift takes place at a threshold speed of about 26.5 knots at a displacement of 22,000 tons, in the ease of this ship.\u201d). These references indicate that the patentee sought to be his own lexicographer by defining this term. <em>See Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582. The court accordingly construes this term as chosen by the patentee to mean a minimum speed when a semi-planing vessel develops hydrodynamic lift as a result of the high pressure generated at the aft part of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">\n<em>Term 7: \u201cincreases efficiency of the hull\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Plaintiffs Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Plain and ordinary meaning Alternatively, \u201cincreases speed\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u201cAn increase in the ratio of useful energy produced by a hull and the total energy delivered to such a hull when compared to conventional vessels\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Term 7 is found in Claims 1 and 19 of the \u2019032 patent and Claims 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the \u2019946 patent. Fastship urges adoption of the plain and ordinary meaning but provides an alternative construction. Pl.\u2019s Br. at 26. The government provides a different construction based upon a naval dictionary. Def.\u2019s Br. at 23-25. The parties disagree on the basic meaning of \u201cefficiency\u201d as used in the patent. The parties make two important observations in their briefs. First, the term \u201cefficiency\u201d is used throughout the specification, but Term 7 is specific to \u201cefficiency of the hull.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 23 (noting that six different definitions of efficiency appear in a publication, Lloyd\u2019s Register, <em>Warship Hull Design Inquiry </em>(1983), submitted in the \u2019032 prosecution history, one of which is specific to \u201cefficiency, hull\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, the specification and claims discuss drag along with efficiency but do not combine the two into a single concept. Pl.\u2019s Br. at 27. The chief measure of utility cited in the specification is speed. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 1, lines 36- 39 (discussing the speed limitations of traditional displacement hulls), col. 2, lines 37- 42 (describing the planing hull in terms of achievable speed), col. 5, lines 1-5 (explaining efficiency in terms of speed), Fig. 11 (plotting ship speed versus shaft horsepower), Fig. 12 (comparing the speed and resistance plots of a semi-planing hull and a displacement hull).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Nonetheless, the efficiency of a hull is more than a measure of speed. The specification continually compares efficiency in terms of both speed and power delivered. It devotes four figures to demonstrate how variations in speed and horsepower impact semi-planing hulls compared to other vessels. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12. This understanding is more specific than the one offered by the government, which is derived from the <em>Warship Hull Design Inquiry. See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 23 (citing Def.\u2019s Br. Ex. F at G00000480). While both parties are correct in aspects of their construction of this term, neither construction is comprehensive. Fastship ignores that efficiency is a relative term, as seen in the patent\u2019s comparison of the semi-planing hull to conventional displacement hulls. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 5, lines 56-60 (comparing the \u201chydrodynamic efficiency of a [semi-planing hull] at speeds where traditional [displacement] hulls squat\u201d). The government\u2019s construction ignores the patent\u2019s emphasis on speed rather than reference to a general definition for efficiency. <em>See </em>\u2019032 patent, col. 5, lines 1-5. For these reasons the court adopts an amalgam of the parties\u2019 definitions, construing \u201cincreases efficiency of the hull\u201d to mean allows achievement of speed through application of less power than would be required for comparable or even lower speeds with a conventional displacement hull.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">\n<em>C.
