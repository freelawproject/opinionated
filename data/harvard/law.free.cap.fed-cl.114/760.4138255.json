Plaintiff alleges that its invoices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>for promotional goods that were custom made for, and shipped to, various Army and Air Force Exchange Services (AAFES) locations have not been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Before the court is defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint (Def.\u2019s Mot.), Dkt. No. 25, filed October 27, 2012, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC), or, in the alternative, under RCFC 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, or for violation of RCFC 9(k). Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint and points to deficiencies in the contracting authority of the alleged government actors. Also before the court are: plaintiffs response to defendant\u2019s motion (Pl.\u2019s Resp.), Dkt. No. 26, filed November 28, 2012, attached to which is plaintiffs appendix (Pl.\u2019s App.), Dkt. No. 26-1, and defendant\u2019s reply to plaintiffs response (Def.\u2019s Reply), Dkt. No. 27, filed December 17, 2012, attached to which is defendant\u2019s appendix (Def.\u2019s App.), Dkt. No. 27-1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court heard oral argument on February 28, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Documents appended to the parties\u2019 filings suggest that plaintiff may have been sending unsolicited goods to Army and Air Force exchange posts. If trae and unrebutted, plaintiffs effort to prove that it had a valid contract with the government would be unavailing. But, plaintiff insists that it can identify by name those exchange post employees who confirmed the orders for Huntington\u2019s promotional goods. Alternatively, plaintiff asserts that a contracting officer ratified the oral arrangements for the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The allegations in plaintiffs complaint and its response to defendant\u2019s jurisdictional challenge are sufficient to defeat defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. But questions about the contracting authority of the government actors persist. An evaluation of the legal effect of the actions taken by various store employees and the contracting officer, requires further development of the factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">As more fully explained below, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED-IN-PART and is CONVERTED-IN-PART to a RCFC 56 motion for summary judgment. The court STAYS the summary judgment motion to allow the parties, if desired, to conduct discovery and to file supplemental briefing. The court DISMISSES plaintiffs EAJA claim without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">I. Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">Huntington Promotional &amp; Supply, LLC, (Huntington Promotion, Huntington, or plaintiff) is a promotional products company based in Tennessee. Compl., Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5. Plaintiff alleges that it filled orders from several Army and Air Force Exchanges (exchanges, stores, or posts) at various times in 2009 for custom imprinted promotional items. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 7. The promotional items included pens, license plate holders, and ice scrapers; each item was imprinted with the name of the ordering military installation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 7; <em>id. </em>at 7-9 (invoices). Plaintiff states that its representatives telephonically confirmed orders with local military exchanges before authorizing the manufacture of the products by a third party and arranging for shipping to the posts. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. Plaintiff generated an invoice for each order and attached twenty-one invoices to its complaint. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 9; <em>id. </em>at 6-26 (invoices). The invoices total $61,473.50. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 9; <em>id. </em>at 5 (invoice summary).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">Several months prior to the transactions referenced in the complaint, representatives from Huntington met with contracting officer Robert Schmid to explore potential business opportunities with AAFES. Def.\u2019s App. 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\u00b6 4 (Decl. of Robert F. Schmid) (stating that Mr. Schmid and a colleague met with Huntington representatives on June 10, 2009). At that meeting, Mr. Schmid adverted to an impending change in the AAFES policy governing how stores acquired goods for sale. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 5. Mr. Schmid described the policy change as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">Prior to 2009, AAFES used a \u201cstore/headquarters buying responsibility,\u201d meaning some purchase decisions were made by stores and others were made by headquarters. During 2009, this process changed and headquarters took responsibility for purchasing decisions for individual stores. One requirement of the change was that all potential vendors have an AAFES-approved retail agreement. Without such an agreement, a vendor cannot sell goods to AAFES for resale purposes.... A retail agreement must be signed by both the Contracting Officer and the vendor. I discussed these changes with Huntington, including explaining to its representatives that all buying decisions would be made by headquarters <em>(ie., </em>me and my team) after August 1, 2009. Huntington has never had an AAFES retail agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><em>Id. </em>The majority of plaintiffs invoices\u2014seventeen of the twenty-one submitted\u2014are dated after August 1, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Compl. 5 (invoice summary) (listing the dates of the invoices). Four of the invoices predate the change in buying responsibility for AAFES: one invoice is dated April 26, 2009, and three are dated July 30, 2009. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">In October of 2009, a general manager at the Dyess Exchange, Sheila Miller (Ms. Miller), sent an e-mail stating that Huntington had shipped unordered goods to the exchange.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s App. 11 (e-mail from Sheila L. Miller, Oct. 13,2009). The e-mail contains the subject line \u201cHuntington Promotion\u201d and states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-10\">This company has shipped several cases of souvenir type items to our store. The problem is, no one ordered the merchandise. It arrived without invoices or any contact information. The merchandise was not even in the system. After finally tracking down the company ..., they asked if we would keep it for a lower cost. Of course, we said no. They then said they would provide call tags for pick up. The merchandise is still in our store. After all the contact with this company, they then sent us invoices. We are still trying to get this company to pick up the merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">A series of e-mails ensued conveying Ms. Miller\u2019s concerns up the chain of command. <em>See </em>Joint Preliminary Status Report App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>(JPSR App.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>), Dkt. No. 13-1, 39-42 (Oct. 13, 2009 emails). Instructions were given to place an immediate hold on payments to Huntington. <em>Id. </em>at 39 (e-mail from Edward W. Brassart, Oct. 13, 2009). As the contracting officer, Mr. Schmid sent an action alert directing that any deliveries received from Huntington were to be refused at the dock. Def.\u2019s App. 12 (e-mail from SD Store Communications, Oct. 14, 2009); <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s App. 17 \u00b6 7 (Schmid Deck). Plaintiff complains in this action that its products were returned after it had confirmed the orders. <em>See </em>Comph \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">On February 15, 2011, plaintiff submitted its invoices with a demand for payment or, alternatively, a decision from the contracting officer regarding its claim. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 13. The contracting officer had doubts about the received invoices,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s App. 17 \u00b6 9 (Schmid Deck), and requested more information from Huntington about the alleged transactions. Specifically, he asked plaintiff to furnish copies of the purchase orders and the correlative proof of receipt, bearing the requisite signatures of an authorized AAFES agent. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 10. The court cannot discern from the documents before it either when Mr. Schmid made this request or whether plaintiff responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In June of 2011, nearly three months after plaintiff submitted its invoices, plaintiffs counsel contacted the contracting officer complaining that no response to the February demand had been received. Def.\u2019s App. 15 (e-mail from Larry Magdovitz, June 8, 2011). Plaintiff advised that it would file suit if no payment were received. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The contracting officer responded to plaintiff that same day. Def.\u2019s App. 14 (e-mail from Robert Schmid, June 8, 2011). He stated that he was awaiting information about the alleged orders from those AAFES associates with whom plaintiff claimed to have had contact. <em>Id. </em>Of particular interest were the associates\u2019 recollections of any business dealings with Huntington. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs failure to supply the information earlier requested of it had prompted the contracting officer to inquire of the AAFES associates directly. Def.\u2019s App. 17, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12 (Schmid Deck). The contracting officer intended to forward the associates\u2019 responses to AAFES\u2019s general counsel who, in turn, would contact plaintiff. Def.\u2019s App. 14 (e-mail from Robert Schmid, June 8,2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Two days later, on June 10, 2011, the contracting officer sent a follow-up e-mail to plaintiffs counsel. Def.\u2019s App. 14 (e-mail from Robert Schmid, June 10, 2011) (Approval E-mail). He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-12\">After consulting with our General Counsel and reviewing all open invoices due I have decided to approve the payment of open invoices presented by your client to our accounts payable department. This decision does not condone the business practices of your client but speaks more for the desire of [t]he Exchange to at all times follow all applicable laws regarding payments and receipts from our vendors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-13\">The fact remains that your client shipped product to our stores which had not been ordered and in most cases could not be received. Repeated attempts by our stores to return this merchandise were ignored. A copy of this correspondence is being placed in your client[\u2019]s effectiveness file and will certainly be reviewed and considered in determining responsibility for future awards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-14\">Our Finance department is compiling these invoices and will also calculate any applicable late payment fees. I\u2019ll update this E<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>MAIL when I have been given the invoice total hopefully before I leave today.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote added). But, this e-mail did not resolve the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">One week later, the contracting officer emailed plaintiff\u2019s counsel again reporting that the accounts payable department had no unpaid invoices from Huntington. Def.\u2019s App. 13 (e-mail from Robert Schmid, June 17, 2011). The contracting officer asked to have the unpaid invoices, together with proof of delivery, forwarded to him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In response, plaintiffs counsel forwarded the requested invoices to the contracting officer. Pl.\u2019s App. 31 (e-mail from Larry Magdovitz, June 30, 2011). However, counsel did not forward any proof of delivery. Pl.\u2019s App. 30-31 (e-mail from Robert Schmid, June 30, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">A few months later, plaintiff sent an e-mail to the contracting officer containing a list of contact persons at the ten different exchange locations that allegedly had ordered goods from Huntington. Pl.\u2019s App. 29-30 (e-mail from Larry Magdovitz, Sept. 13, 2011) (Contact List E-mail); <em>see supra </em>note 4 (discussing the Contact List E-mail). Plaintiff also provided tracking information for two of the twenty-one orders and indicated that \u201cproof of delivery [was] attached\u201d for one order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s App. 29-30. The contracting officer reiterated in his response to plaintiff that payment would be authorized only for those orders that had proof of delivery. Pl.\u2019s App. 29 (e-mail from Robert Schmid, Sept. 18, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Huntington has not received payment for its invoices. Compl. \u00b6 14. Nor has the con-trading officer issued a final decision denying plaintiffs claim. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff filed a complaint against the government on October 18,2011. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">Plaintiff alleges that defendant failed to pay the amounts it was invoiced in breach of the parties\u2019 contract. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 19. Plaintiff complains that the custom imprinted goods cannot be resold, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 18, and it seeks attorneys\u2019 fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) asserting that defendant\u2019s refusal to pay for the shipped custom goods is not a substantially justified position, <em>see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">Defendant has moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint on jurisdictional grounds. Def.\u2019s Mot. 1. Defendant argues that the allegations in the complaint, on their face, do not support a breach-of-eontraet claim. Alternatively, defendant argues that the allegations are missing the factual underpinnings that would establish the existence of a legally binding agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">The government asks the court, in a footnote, to evaluate the allegations in the complaint by applying a failure to state a claim standard, \u201c[i]n the event that the [e]ourt declines to review the complaint through the RCFC 12(b)(1) prism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 n.l. In a subsequent footnote, defendant urges the court to dismiss the complaint because it does not comply with RCFC 9(k), <em>id. </em>at 8 n.2, which requires \u201ca party [to] identify the substantive provisions of the contract ... on which the party relies[,] ... [or] annex to the complaint a copy of the contract,\u201d RCFC 9(k). The government further asserts that plaintiffs request for attorneys\u2019 fees pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ant to EAJA is premature and must be dismissed. Def.\u2019s Mot. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">II. Applicable Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">A. The Standards for Dismissal Under RCFC 12(b)(1) and the Requirements of RCFC 9(k)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988). In the circumstance in which a plaintiff alleges a breach of contract, \u201c[a] well pleaded allegation of a breach of either an express or implied-in-fact contract is sufficient to overcome challenges to jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bank of Guam v. United States, </em>578 F.3d 1318, 1325 (Fed.Cir.2009) (citing <em>Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States, </em>104 F.3d 1321, 1325 (Fed.Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Moving for dismissal pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1), defendant questions the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint on their face and thus, mounts a facial challenge. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit instructs that in such circumstances, the allegations in the complaint are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are made in plaintiffs favor. <em>Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Watkins, </em>11 F.3d 1573, 1583 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Defendant also mounts a factual challenge to the complaint by denying plaintiffs allegations of jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit has distinguished the standard for reviewing factual challenges from the standard for reviewing facial challenges, explaining that when a factual challenge is presented in the complaint, \u201conly [the] uncontroverted factual allegations are accepted as true for purposes of the motion.\u201d <em>Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>11 F.3d at 1583. To resolve the disputed jurisdictional facts, the court may examine more than the face of the pleadings; it may consider extrinsic evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1584.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Defendant here further challenges the sufficiency of plaintiffs complaint on the ground that it fails to satisfy the requirements of RCFC 9(k). RCFC 9(k) sets forth the special manner in which contract claims are to be pleaded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-11\">In pleading a claim founded on a contract or treaty, a party must identify the substantive provisions of the contract or treaty on which the party relies. In lieu of a description, the party may annex to the complaint a copy of the contract or treaty, indicating the relevant provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">RCFC 9(k). If a plaintiff fails to comply with RCFC 9(k) and to allege sufficient facts to show that it had a contract with the United States, the court cannot exercise jurisdiction over the claim. <em>Gonzalez-McCaulley Inv. Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 710, 715 (2010) (citing <em>Mendez-Cardenas v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 162, 168 (2009); <em>Phang v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 321, 330 (2009)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">B. The Standard for Dismissal Under RCFC 12(b)(6) and Conversion to a Motion for Summary Judgment Under RCFC 56</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">A claim for relief must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d RCFC 8(a)(2). This \u201cpleading standard ... does not require \u2018detailed factual allegations,\u2019 but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal (Iqbal), </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly (Twombly), </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). The \u201ccomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). When evaluating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>RCFC 12(b)(6), the court must accept the allegations contained in the complaint as true and construe them in the manner most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>11 F.3d at 1584 n. 13. The court\u2019s 12(b)(6) inquiry is limited to examining the facts pleaded in the complaint. <em>See Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc. v. Scimed Life Sys., Inc., </em>988 F.2d 1157, 1164 (Fed.Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\u201c[T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable];, however,] to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. When legal conclusions are asserted in a complaint, \u201c[t]he court must determine \u201cwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims,\u2019 not whether the claimant will ultimately prevail.\u201d <em>Chapman Law Firm Co. v. Greenleaf Constr. Co., </em>490 F.3d 934, 938 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">If the court considers materials outside of the pleadings in its deliberation, a motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6) must be converted to a motion for summary judgment under RCFC 56 and evaluated under the applicable standard. RCFC 12(d) (\u201cIf, on a motion under RCFC 12(b)(6) ..., matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under RCFC 56.\u201d); <em>Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., </em>988 F.2d at 1164. In these circumstances, the parties are afforded the opportunity to present any material that would be pertinent to a motion for summary judgment. RCFC 12(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">C. The Standard for a Fee Award Under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">EAJA authorizes the payment of reasonable attorney fees if: (1) the claimant is a prevailing party; (2) the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified; and (3) no special circumstances exist that would make an award unjust. <em>Libas, Ltd. v. United States, </em>314 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2003). An application for such fees may be filed after entry of judgment; the filing must be made within 30 days after the court enters judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">A. Plaintiffs Allegations Are Sufficient to Invoke This Court\u2019s Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over any suit founded upon an express or implied-in-fact contract with the United States pursuant to the Tucker Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (\u201cThe United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment ... upon any express or implied contract with the United States____ For the purpose of this paragraph, an express or implied contract with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service ... shall be considered an express or implied contract with the United States.\u201d). \u201c[J]urisdiction under [the Tucker Act] requires no more than a non-frivolous <em>allegation </em>of a contract with the government.\u201d <em>Engage Learning, Inc. v. Salazar, </em>660 F.3d 1346, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">Plaintiff must allege the elements of a contract to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction over a contract claim. <em>See Trauma Serv. Grp., </em>104 F.3d at 1325. The elements are the same for an express or implied-in-fact contract: \u201ca mutual intent to contract including an offer, an acceptance, and consideration,\u201d and actual authority on the part of the government representative to bind the United States in contract. <em>Id. </em>In the circumstance in which an implied-in-fact contract has been alleged, the element of an express offer and acceptance may be missing, but the parties\u2019 conduct can demonstrate mutual assent. <em>City of Cincinnati v. United States, </em>153 F.3d 1375, 1377 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">If a government representative is discovered to have acted without appropriate contracting authority, the action can be ratified to create an enforceable contract. Ratification of a contract requires a showing, by plaintiff, that: (1) the government agent who lacked contracting authority had some similar type of authority; (2) some government agents were aware of the proposed agreement; and (3) the government received a \u201cdirect benefit\u201d from the unauthorized eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>tract. <em>Doe v. United States, </em>58 Fed.Cl. 479, 486 (2003) (citing <em>Janowsky v. United States, </em>133 F.3d 888, 889-92 (Fed.Cir.1998)), <em>aff'd, </em>112 Fed.Appx. 54 (Fed.Cir.2004). Proof of ratification also requires a showing that the ratifying official had actual or constructive knowledge of the unauthorized act based on \u201c \u2018full knowledge of all the facts\u2019 \u201d and yet, actively approved the contract. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Harbert/Lummus Agrifuels Projects v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 1429, 1433 (Fed.Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Plaintiff asserts that after it confirmed orders for its custom-made promotional goods with various AAFES stores, shipped the ordered goods and sent billing invoices, defendant breached its contractual arrangement with plaintiff by failing to pay. Compile 8, 10, 16, 19. In the alternative, plaintiff asserts that if the arranged orders did not constitute enforceable contracts, the contracting officer subsequently ratified the arranged orders in an e-mail sent to plaintiffs counsel. Pl.\u2019s Resp. 9. On its face, plaintiffs claim for relief appears to fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the court over claims founded upon a contract with the government. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491; <em>Trauma Serv. Grp., </em>104 F.3d at 1325 (\u201c[Plaintiffs] complaint alleges that an express and, in the alternative, an implied-in-fact contract underlies its claim. This allegation suffices to confer subject matter jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Defendant, however, denies the existence of a contract between Huntington and the government, challenging the factual sufficiency of plaintiffs complaint on the ground that plaintiff failed to allege that the named contacts at the exchange posts had the requisite contracting authority to bind the government. Defendant assails the underpinnings of plaintiffs claim, setting forth a factual account that differs from plaintiffs account.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Defendant contends that plaintiff shipped its goods to AAFES stores without first confirming orders. Def.\u2019s Mot. 9. Then plaintiff invoiced the stores for the delivered goods, with the hope of obtaining payment\u2014not withstanding the absence of a contract. <em>Id. </em>Urging the court to look beyond the face of the complaint, defendant mounts a jurisdictional challenge to the facts on which plaintiffs complaint is based. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">In support of its jurisdictional challenge, defendant has presented extrinsic evidence to the court that has not been excluded.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, the allegations in the complaint are not controlling. <em>See Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>11 F.3d at 1583-84. Consistent with the applicable standards of review, the court accepts as trae only the uneontroverted facts alleged by plaintiff, and considers the evidence provided by the parties outside of the pleadings to determine whether this court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The salient question presented here is not whether plaintiff has proven satisfactorily the elements of contract formation, but whether plaintiff has alleged the existence of a contract sufficiently for the court to exercise its jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim. <em>See Total Med. Mgmt. v. United States, </em>104 F.3d 1314, 1319 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he law is clear that, for the Court of Federal Claims to have jurisdiction, a valid contract must only be pleaded, not ultimately proven.\u201d); <em>see also Engage Learning, Inc. v. Salazar, </em>660 F.3d 1346 (Fed.Cir.2011) (\u201c \u2018[Jurisdiction is not defeated ... by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover.\u2019 Rather, ... \u2018it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d (internal citations omitted) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946))).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Plaintiff argues that its allegations paired with evidence in the form of invoices, email correspondence listing government actors at each of the exchanges, and a possible ratifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>cation e-mail from the contracting officer are sufficient to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">1. Plaintiffs Allegations Concerning the Authority Element of Contract Formation Are Sufficient</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Defendant argues that plaintiff has not alleged sufficiently the authority element of its claimed contract. Def.\u2019s Mot. 7. According to defendant, plaintiff has failed to assert that the government officials listed in the Contact List E-mail were the ones who ordered the goods; that the government actors had either the position or authority to bind defendant contractually; and that the agency followed the pertinent procedures to place the orders at issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Defendant contends the cited omissions warrant dismissal of plaintiffs complaint, and defendant points to two decisions in which courts found that the plaintiffs failure to identify with particularity who contracted on behalf of the government defeated plaintiffs contract claim. Def.\u2019s Reply 2. But, the cases defendant references for this proposition were decided on the merits, not on the jurisdictional grounds defendant urges here. <em>See, e.g., Trauma Serv. Grp., </em>104 F.3d at 1327 (finding that \u201c[a] well-pleaded allegation in the complaint [was] sufficient to overcome challenges to jurisdiction,\u201d but ruling that plaintiff had failed to state a meritorious claim because it had not identified any particular government representative who entered into the alleged contract); <em>Pennco Trucking Inc. v. United States, </em>20 Cl.Ct. 534, 540 (1990) (In the context of a summary judgment ruling to recover freight charges, the court found that a declaration furnished by plaintiff that failed to identify the pertinent government personnel did not satisfy plaintiffs burden of proof, but letters demonstrating the same proposition were sufficient to grant relief in plaintiffs favor.). The court does not find these cases helpful to the instant jurisdictional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Defendant also relies on the exhibits it attached to its briefing to refute plaintiffs claim that it formed contracts with AAFES\u2019s store managers. For example, attached to the government\u2019s reply brief is a declaration from Andrea Frazier (Ms. Frazier), who served as the manager of the exchange post at Nellis Air Force Base and whom plaintiff identified as a key contact person. Def.\u2019s App. 21 (Deel. of Andrea Frazier); <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s App. 29-30 (Contact List E-mail). Ms. Frazier denies meeting with Huntington, and does not recall any other contact with Huntington as a vendor. Def.\u2019s App. 21 (Frazier Deck).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Defendant provides, as another exhibit, the declaration of Ms. Miller, the store manager who first alerted upper management that Huntington was shipping unordered goods. Def.\u2019s App. 20 (Deck of Sheila L. Miller). Ms. Miller\u2019s declaration was consistent with the earlier e-mail she sent reporting that Huntington had shipped unordered goods to Dyess Air Force Base. <em>Compare id. with </em>Def.\u2019s App. 11 (e-mail from Sheila Miller, Oct 13,2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">The statements of Ms. Frazier and Ms. Miller call into question\u2014but do not resolve\u2014whether plaintiff confirmed the alleged orders for promotional goods with either authorized officials or other personnel at the various exchanges. Neither Ms. Miller nor Ms. Frazier addressed their authority to contract. Moreover, plaintiff asserts that it formed contracts with at least eight additional AAFES stores for which there is not yet any evidence or deposition testimony regarding the authority or recollections of the government actors listed as plaintiffs contacts at those exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Plaintiff has presented a list of the government actors who allegedly ordered goods or confirmed orders with plaintiff. Pl.\u2019s App. 29-30 (Contact List E-mail); <em>see </em>Tr. Oral Arg. 59:10-17. And controlling case law teaches that an allegation of contract formation with an authorized government agent is sufficient for plaintiff to meet its burden of demonstrating the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Engage Learning, Inc., </em>660 F.3d at 1353 (\u201cjurisdiction under [the Tucker Act] requires no more than a non-frivolous allegation of a contract with the government.\u201d) (emphasis omitted); <em>Gould, Inc. v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 925, 930 (Fed.Cir.1995) (ruling that \u201c[t]he Court of Federal Claims must first assume jurisdiction\u201d before it could de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>termine whether plaintiff had proven the elements of an implied-in-faet contract.) <em>see also Sommers Oil Co. v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1375 (Fed.Cir.2001) (finding that although \u201cthe complaint is not a model of pleading, as it does not specifically assert that the government\u2019s contractual commitment was made by a person with statutory or regulatory authority to do so[,] ... we conclude that the complaint alleges authorization sufficiently to withstand a motion to dismiss,\u201d and \u201c[t]o the extent that the government means that [plaintiff] was required to identify and plead the particular person who approved the contractual arrangement with [plaintiff] and the particular statute or regulation that authorized that person to commit the government in contract, we disagree. It was sufficient for the complaint to allege that the government\u2019s promise was authorized by a person having legal authority to do so.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Absent additional evidence, plaintiffs claim that it contracted with named store managers is sufficient to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction, provided the remaining elements of a contract are sufficiently alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Of the elements required for a contract, the parties have focused primarily on the authority of the government\u2019s agents. The parties devote less attention to the remaining elements of contract formation here, but the court is satisfied that those elements were pled sufficiently for jurisdictional purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Additional factual development is necessary to determine whether the store-level personnel with whom plaintiff communicated regarding its promotional goods were authorized to enter into the alleged contracts, and if not, whether defendant subsequently acted to ratify the implied agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">2. The Cases Defendant Cites in Support of Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction Are Inapposite on the Facts of This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">Defendant cites decisions on which it relies in support of its dismissal motion. Defendant asserts that in each of the eases, plaintiffs claim was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds due to the insufficiency of plaintiffs evidence regarding whether a contract with the government had been formed. Def.\u2019s Mot. 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">In <em>Cain v. United States, </em>the appeals court affirmed this court\u2019s dismissal of a failed savings and loan association ease. 350 F.3d 1309, 1310 (Fed.Cir.2004). The government had approved, in a letter to plaintiff, the proposed conversion from a mutual association to a stock company. <em>Id. </em>at 1311-12. Plaintiff argued that the letter, together with other correspondence, was evidence of a contract between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 1314-16. The court found that the letter simply reflected the Bank Board\u2019s regulatory approval of the proposed conversion, and observed that \u201c \u2018[a]n agency\u2019s performance of its regulatory or sovereign functions does not create contractual obligations. Something more is necessary.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (quoting <em>D &amp; N Bank v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1374, 1378-79 (Fed.Cir.2003)). Absent the formation of a contract between the parties, the court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 1317; <em>see also Cain v. United States, </em>53 Fed.Cl. 658, 667 (2002) (dismissing plaintiffs claim for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">In <em>Ryan v. United States, </em>another savings and loan case, plaintiff contended that regulatory approval of its transition from a savings and loan association to a state-chartered bank resulted in a contract between the bank and the government. 57 Fed.Cl. 731, 733 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>(2003). Although plaintiff alleged that the \u201ctotality of the conduct\u201d of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had produced an implied-in-faet contract, plaintiff failed to allege any of the elements of an implied-in-faet contract. <em>Id. </em>Nor did plaintiff identify a government actor with whom it had communicated at the bank who might have had authority to enter into the purported contract. <em>Id. </em>The court dismissed plaintiff\u2019s claim, on defendant\u2019s motion, for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">In another Court of Federal Claims decision, <em>Central Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>plaintiff argued that it had a contract with the United States for transportation services based on its name appearing on bills of lading. 87 Fed.Cl. 104, 108-09 (2009). The court ruled that no contract existed between plaintiff and the government because, <em>inter alia, </em>plaintiff was a subcontractor and did not have privity of contract with the government. <em>Id. </em>at 109. The court also found that the prime contractor was not an agent of the United States and had no authority to bind the government. <em>Id. </em>The court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The rulings in <em>Cain </em>and <em>Ryan </em>turned on a finding that the government\u2019s regulation of the plaintiff bank failed to create a contractual relationship. And in <em>Central Freight Lines, </em>the plaintiff was a subcontractor and was therefore unable to allege privity of contract. In contradistinction to the cases cited by defendant, plaintiff here describes a contract for the sale of goods to defendant\u2014not a regulatory one. Moreover, the government does not contend that Huntington was a subcontractor or lacks privity of contract with the government for some other reason. In the instant case, plaintiff has supplied the court with the invoices it presented to defendant and the names of plaintiff\u2019s contacts at each AAFES store to support its claim of having formed a contract with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Plaintiff alleges that it formed a contract with defendant either by its initial communication with personnel at the exchange posts or by a subsequent ratification email from Mr. Schmid. And in satisfaction of the special pleading requirement set forth in RCFC 9(k) that a claimant either \u201cidentify the substantive provisions of the contract or ... annex to the complaint a copy of the contract,\u201d plaintiff annexed to its complaint copies of the invoices sent to the AAFES exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Defendant\u2019s challenge to the existence of a contract and the evidence it has introduced compel a closer look at whether a contract, in fact, was formed in this case. But defendant does not point to a case\u2014and the court has not found one\u2014in which the plaintiff has alleged the elements of a contract for goods, and the claim was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds because the factual underpinnings for the elements of the contract were called into question. <em>Cf. Bailey v. United States, </em>40 Fed.Cl. 449, 461-62 (1998) (denying the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction where additional factual development was necessary to resolve the issues of authority to contract and contract formation). The court finds that further factual development is necessary to determine whether the parties formed the contract plaintiff alleges. That determination is pending. At this juncture, however, the court is satisfied that plaintiffs assertions survive the jurisdictional challenge posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">B. On the Record Before It, the Court Cannot Rule on Whether Plaintiff Has Failed to State a Claim for Which Relief Can be Granted</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Defendant, alternatively, moves the court to evaluate plaintiffs claim under the standard governing a RCFC 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Def.\u2019s Mot. 4 n.l. But, plaintiff has alleged in its complaint the existence of a contract with the United States and a breach of that contract caused by the government\u2019s failure to pay plaintiffs invoices. These claims, and the uncontroverted facts presented here, would appear to satisfy the plausibility standard announced in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal. See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (\u201c[The] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>ble on its face.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (2007))).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Defendant disputes the existence of a contract and has attached exhibits to its filings that the court has considered and declines to exclude. <em>See supra </em>note 11, (identifying the extrinsic evidence submitted by the parties and considered by the court). Because the court has examined the materials provided it by the parties outside of the pleadings, it cannot decide the motion as one brought under RCFC 12(b)(6). <em>See </em>RCFC 12(d) (\u201cIf, on a motion under RCFC 12(b)(6) or 12(e), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under RCFC 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\u201d). Instead, the court must convert defendant\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion to one for summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The rules of this court require that the court provide the parties with notice of its intention to treat defendant\u2019s motion as a motion for summary judgment and an opportunity to proceed pursuant to the rules of summary judgment. <em>See id.; Easter v. United States, </em>575 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\u201cBefore the court may convert a motion for judgment on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment, the court must ordinarily provide notice of its intention to do so.\u201d); <em>Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., </em>988 F.2d at 1164 (\u201c[0]n motion to dismiss on the complainant\u2019s pleading it is improper for the court to decide the case on facts not pleaded by the complainant, unless the complainant had notice thereof and the opportunity to proceed in accordance with the rules of summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">As notified, the parties shall proceed by conducting any necessary discovery and supplementing their filings with any pertinent material of their choosing. On or before March 14, 2014, the parties shall file a joint status report proposing a schedule for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">C. Plaintiffs EAJA Claim Is Dismissed as Premature</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">Defendant argues that Huntington\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees is premature and must be dismissed because it is not ripe. Def.\u2019s Mot. 9-10. The court agrees that the application was filed too early. An application for attorneys\u2019 fees under EAJA must be filed within the thirty day period after entry of judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). Attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded under EAJA when \u201cthe party is a prevailing party,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the government\u2019s position in the litigation \u201cwas not substantially justified.\u201d <em>See id. </em>None of these requirements are satisfied presently. Plaintiff does not dispute the court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to entertain its EAJA claim at this time, but expresses its concern that should the court dismiss its EAJA claim now, the government would attempt to use that ruling against plaintiff in the event that Huntington prevails on the merits. Pl.\u2019s Reply 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">Huntington\u2019s request for fees is not yet ripe, and must be dismissed without prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Tippett v. United States, </em>98 Fed.Cl. 171, 183 (2011) (dismissing plaintiffs claims for costs and fees for the instant suit as unripe). Should the time become appropriate, the court will consider a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-13\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b784-14\">Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED-IN-PART as to the jurisdictional challenge and CONVERTED-IN-PART to an RCFC 56 motion for summary judgment as to the challenge for failure to state a claim, the consideration of which is STAYED to afford the parties an opportunity, if desired, to conduct additional discovery. Plaintiffs EAJA claim is DISMISSED without prejudice. On or before March 14, 2014, counsel shall file a joint status report proposing a schedule for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">.

Plaintiff's invoices bear \"invoice dates,\u201d but do not list the dates on which the orders were placed. <em>See </em>Compl. 6-26 (invoices).

No. 34, at 56: 3-7 (\"[M]y client doesn't have any ... specific information on what day the call was made, but in the course of business practice, it would have been ... if not the day of the invoice, it would have been around that time.\u201d). Plaintiff instead submitted a document to the court purporting to represent when certain orders were verified. <em>See </em>Pl.'s App. 29-30 femad from Larry Magdovitz, Sept. 13, 2011) (Contact List E-mail). In response to the contracting officer\u2019s request for proof of delivery, plaintiff submitted a list of its local exchange contacts. <em>See id. </em>The Contact List E-mail contains the following information for each entry: name of exchange, contact person at that exchange, phone number, and the date the order was verified. <em>Id. </em>For some of the entries, a tracking number of the shipment is also listed. <em>Id. </em>Of note, the dates listed in the Contact List E-mail do not match the invoice dates. <em>Compare id., with </em>Compl. 6-26 (invoices). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Huntington verified orders on different dates. While the Contact List E-mail provides some indication of what and when Huntington communicated with the exchanges, it does not provide a comprehensive summary of the dates on which orders were placed. For example, plaintiff attached to its complaint four invoices for Dyess Air Force Base\u2014two orders invoiced on September 3, 2009 and two orders invoiced on October 3, 2009. <em>See </em>Compl. 15-16, 22-23 (invoices). But, review of the Contact List E-mail reveals only one entry for a verified order for Dyess Air Force Base. <em>See </em>Pl.'s App. 29-30 (Contact List E-mail). Unclear to the court is whether all of the invoices were generated from one verified order, or whether additional orders were verified\u2014beyond those listed in the Contact List E-mail\u2014which correspond to the additional invoices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b775-14\">.
