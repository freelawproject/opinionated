An agreed entry granting a change in the custody of the minor reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-4\">\u201cAt the mutual request and by mutual consent of the plaintiff and defendant, the care, custody and control of Sally A. Hill, the minor child of the parties, is hereby confided to the defendant, Kyle A. Hill, until further order of this court, for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-5\">\u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>1. The said minor has been residing with the defendant by mutual agreement of the parties since May, 1972, said defendant having been the sole support of said minor child since that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-6\">\u201c2. Due to a change in circumstances, the plaintiff is unable to provide for the care, custody and support of said minor child, and it would be to the best interests of the child to award her care, custody and control to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-7\">\u201c3. Defendant was previously awarded care custody and control of the other minor child of the parties, and has properly provided for said child since the date of the decree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-8\">\u201c4. Defendant is not in arrears as to any payment for the support of Sally A. Hill as previously ordered by this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-9\">\u201cWherefore, it is ordered that effective immediately the said defendant, Kyle A. Hill, is awarded custody of Sally A. Hill, and that the support payment of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per week which the defendant was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>viously ordered to pay to plaintiff for the support of Sally A. Hill shall be terminated effective immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-5\">\u201cIt is further ordered that plaintiff shall have the right to reasonable visitation with Sally A. Hill, and to the extent hereinabove provided, the decree heretofore entered in this case is hereby modified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Subsquently, the defendant, on February 27, 1973, filed a \u201cMotion to modify decree as to support of minor children\u201d so as to provide a reasonable amount of weekly payments for such support from plaintiff for the reason that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s financial condition justifies the need of additional support for the minor children, and further, the plaintiff is employed and earning a substantial amount of money and is financially able to make weekly payments for the support of the minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">On March 16, 1973, a referee conducted a hearing wherein certain stipulations were entered into between the parties, as follows: that if the plaintiff were to testify \u2018 \u2018 she would testify she is not married, makes approximately $9,-600.00 a year, gross, of that, take-home is approximately $7,500.00 a year, that the custody of both of the minor children is with the father.\u201d That if the defendant were to testify he would testify as follows: [H]e takes home approximately $780.00 a month, and support for the children is $520.00 a month. He has other expenses on top of that for his own living expenses, but that is not part of the actual expenses of the children it is $520.00 a month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">The referee granted defendant\u2019s motion and ordered \u201cthat the plaintiff shall pay to the defendant as support for two minor children the sum of $15.00 per week per child commencing on the nineteenth day of March 1973 plus one percent poundage to the Bureau of Support.\u201d Subsequently, on plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the trial court affirmed the referee\u2019s decision ordering the plaintiff to pay support. It is from this order that plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s single assignment of error is: \u201cThe Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, erred in granting the motion of defendant-appellee to modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>decree as to support of minor children, which motion was granted by a referee of said court and affirmed upon reconsideration of the court itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">The two Ohio statutes pertinent to this case are R. C. 3103.03 and 3109.05. R. C. 3103.03 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">\u201cThe husband must support himself, his wife and his minor children out of his property or by his labor. If he is unable to do so, the wife must assist him so far as she is able. If he neglects to support his wife any other person in good faith may supply her with the necessaries for her support and recover the reasonable value thereof from the husband unless she abandons him without cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">R. C. 3109.05 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-6\">\u201cThe court may order either or both parents to support or help support their children and may make any just and reasonable order or decree permitting the parent who is deprived of the care, custody and control of the children to visit them at such time and under such conditions as the court may direct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Plaintiff contends that there seems to be two different statutes in regard to child support in Ohio and that it must be presumed that each has meaning even though the statutes seem to be in conflict. We would agree -with this statement although for different reasons than that advanced by plaintiff. The two cases cited by plaintiff, <em>Kintner </em>v. <em>Kintner </em>(1946), 78 Ohio App. 324, and <em>Klump </em>v. <em>Klump </em>(1954), 96 Ohio App. 93, both have reference to R. C. 3103.03 and its predecessor sections. That section makes specific reference to \u201chusband and wife\u201d whereas R. C. 3109.05 makes no reference to \u201chusband and wife\u201d but rather to \u201cparents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">In other words, R. C. 3103.03 refers to a husband and wife living together and the duty of the husband to support his \"wife and his minor children. On the other hand it is clear that R. C. 3109.05 does not refer to a husband and wife living together but, rather, to parents who are separated or divorced. R. C. 3109.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-8\">\u201cWhen husband and wife are living separate and apart from each other, or are divorced, and the question as to the care, custody, and control of their offspring is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>brought before a court of competent jurisdiction, they shall stand upon an equality as to the care, custody and control of such offspring, so far as parenthood is involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Two sections later, in R. C. 3109.05, the court refers to \u201ceither or both parents\u201d which we find refers to husband and wife living separate and apart and which grants the court the authority to \u201c* * * order either or both parents to support or help support their children * # *\u201d Avithout distinction as to whether the parent be a husband or a wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">In further support of this finding it must be pointed out that the plaintiff and the defendant herein are no longer husband and wife, having been divorced, but are still parents. Therefore, as between the plaintiff and defendant herein, R. C. 3103.03 no longer applies but R. C. 3109.05 is still applicable. Plaintiff\u2019s assignment of error is not well tallen and we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court. The assignment of error is overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b23-8\">Reilly and Wendt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b23-9\">Strausbaugh and Reilly, JJ., of the Tenth Appellate District, and Wendt, J., of the Court of Common Pleas, sitting by designation in the First Appellate District.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b23-10\">Wendt, J., retired, assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Constitution.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
