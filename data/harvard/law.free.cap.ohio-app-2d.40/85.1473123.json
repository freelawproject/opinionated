Such cigarettes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>had been given to the jailer by the defendant for the purpose of being delivered to the cell of another man who had been charged, and jailed, for the same crime of which the defendant had been charged and jailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The rather confusing communication was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Make up a name or \u25a0 something and then you \u2019ll be a supect [sic] of being with the other guy you dig and I\u2019ll be out, and they will lower your bond so that you can get out so stick to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\"TT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cRed it will work if you stick to what your [sic] going to say. So just tell him you can reconize [sic] the dude if you see him again. So remember you made the big swich [sic] on guns. Rap later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\"TT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">Tare [sic] up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The defendant\u2019s basic argument in support of his assignment of error is that the defendant was, by the trial court\u2019s admission of such note, compelled to. be a witness against himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Further, the defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s communication, as the communication in <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeMarch </em>(1973), 360 F. Supp. 2d 132, is a private communication and must be suppressed under the Fifth Amendment. A communication is no less private even though it is to be read by others, is known to others, and is apparently accessible to others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">The defendant also relies heavily upon the theory that the possession here was still constructively within the defendant, and that only limited and temporary possession of the note had been given to the jailer. In this regard, the defendant relies upon <em>Couch </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973), 409 U. S. 322, wherein it was stated, at page 333:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">\u201cWe do indeed believe that actual possession of documents bears the most significant relationship to the Fifth Amendment protections against governmental compulsions upon the individual acoused of crime. Yet situations may well arise where constructive possession is so clear or the relinquishment of possession is so temporary and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>significant as to leave the personal compulsions upon the accused substantially intact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The defendant does not challenge the right of the guard to search the cigarette package, and he admits that such note was in plain view. The defendant only challenges the state\u2019s use of such note as evidence in the defendant\u2019s trial in that it would be self-incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It is interesting that both the defendant and the state rely upon the principle of law pronounced in the case of <em>Couch </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>We feel, however, that the holding in <em>Couch </em>would support the position of the state in that such holding would not prevent the use of the communication in question in the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>Couch </em>emphasizes that the Fifth Amendment privilege is a personal privilege which adheres basically to the person and not to the information which may incriminate him; further, that a party is privileged from producing the evidence but not from its production \u2014 citing <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1913), 228 U. S. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Couch, </em>held that income information and business materials, sent by the defendant to her accountant, were not privileged from subpoena and use in a proceeding by the Internal Revenue Service, in that the defendant had released the papers and therefore such could no longer be considered to be private papers which would be afforded the protection of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The court, in noting that the possession of the personal material was a crucial consideration, stated, at page 333:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ6\">\u201cWe do indeed believe that actual possession of documents bears the most significant relationship to Fifth Amendment protection against governmental compulsions upon the individual accused of crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">However, the court recognized that there would be situations where actual possession might not be necessarv for the constitutional protection to be afforded. Accordingly, we find the following at page 333 of the decision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">\u201cYet situations may well arise where constructive possession is so clear or the relinquishment of possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>is so temporary and insignificant as to leave the personal compulsions upon the accused substantially intact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The court set forth, as an example, an owner of records storing such in a locked file within another\u2019s building, as in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guterma </em>(C. A. 5, 1959), 272 F. 2d 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The court, in <em>Couch, </em>found such not to be the case before that court and, in a like manner, we do not find such to be the case before this court. Here, there is no fleeting divestment of possession of the note in question. It is true that it was given to the jailer only for a specific purpose\u2014 i. e., delivery to another prisoner \u2014 and, in that sense, it might be conceded that such was a fleeting relinquishment of possession. However, the possession of the note was, for all general purposes, relinquished, for all time, to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We therefore hold that, applying the legal principle of <em>Couch, </em>the note released by this defendant need not be afforded the Fifth Amendment protection, and the use of such note by the state denied no constitutional right of this defendant. Similar to the situation in <em>Couch, </em>\u201cin the case before us the ingredient of personal compulsion against an accused is lacking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In any event, a thorough reading of the note leads us to the conclusion that, even though there was error, such would be harmless, in that the text of such note would, in our view, neither prove, nor materially assist in the proof of, the elements of the crime alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">For all of the foregoing, the assignment of error is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-11\">Whiteside and Reilly, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
