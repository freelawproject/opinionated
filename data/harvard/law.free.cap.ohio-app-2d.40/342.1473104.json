The record shows that defendant, the appellant herein, was charged with malicious destruction of property, to wit: Throwing a beer bottle through the kitchen window of property belonging to Charles Puckett, 1280 Greenleaf Road. The transcript reflects a running neighborhood quarrel involving defendant, the prosecuting witness, and their respective families. This, of course, presents vexing problems for all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Charles Puckett testified that a beer bottle was thrown through his window at approximately 1.1:20 p. m., September 11, 1973, and that, two days later, defendant came into his driveway and said he \u201cdid it.\u201d Apparently this occurred after Puckett fired a shotgun into the air. Subsequently, Mrs. Betty Puckett testified that when she and her husband were in the kitchen, defendant said \u201cYou think that beer bottle was bad I throwed through your window the other night, the next time I\u2019m really going to tear your house up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">This testimony was not actually corroborated by other witnesses. In fact, it was refuted by defendants\u2019 mother. There was testimony from other neighbors concerning the street conversation September 13th, but it is somewhat conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">At the close of the evidence, the court found defendant guilty; whereupon, this appeal was perfected. Defendant advances two assignments of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">1. \u201cIn a criminal case of malicious destruction of property where the only evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt are the uncorroborated statements of the prosecuting witnesses that the accused admitted his guilt to them; and where the accused denies his guilt and the making of the alleged ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>mission, it is error for the trial court to overrule a motion to dismiss the charges at the conclusion of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">2. \u201cIn a criminal case where the evidence is such to convince the court that the Defendant should be found not guilty, it is error for the trial court to then find the Defendant guilty based upon Defendant\u2019s body motion and facial expressions during the testimony of the prosecuting witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The first assignment of error is not well taken. There was sufficient evidence to support the finding of the trial court. The determination of disputed facts and weight of the evidence is, of course, the trial court\u2019s province. This court cannot properly simply substitute its judgment for that of the trier of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The record indicates that a <em>prima facie </em>case was made, the standard being whether, construing the evidence more strongly in favor of the state, reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to defendant\u2019s guilt. Applying this test, the record does not disclose that the trial court lost its way without sufficient evidence to support its judgment. (3 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 820, Appellate Review, Section 821.) Therefore, defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, however, is well taken. We respectfully note the trial court\u2019s statement and the response to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\u201cThe Court: I believe that the evidence has shown fairly clearly that there is a neighborhood dispute, and those are the worst kind we get around here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\u201cI am going to enter a finding of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">\u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, with the evidence that I have heard, I would enter a finding of not guilty except that during the course of this trial and particularly during the testimony of Mr. Puckett, I notice that Mr. May was doing quite a bit of head nodding and agreement and disagreement with various things that Mr. Puckett said during the course of his testimony. And I was particularly impressed by Mr. May\u2019s nodding of the head and agreement and his facial expression at the time Mr, Puck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ett testified as to Mr. May\u2019s statements on the evening of the 14th at the time there was a shooting of the shotgun when he \u2014 when Mr. Puckett testified that Mr. May had said that he had thrown the bottle through the \"window. At that time Mr. May nodded his head \u2018yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u201cMr. Heltzel: Is the Court finished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cMr. Heltzel: Do I understand the Court to say that from the evidence the Court would have to find not guilty but from the interpretation of the defendant\u2019s demeanor or his mannerism in court, the Court would find him guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cThe Court: What I am saying is Mr. May substantiated Mr. Puckett\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cMr. Heltzel: Would the Court agree with me the Court must obey Mr. May\u2019s body motion and inflection, so forth, to arrive at this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">We recognize the endeavor of this very able trial judge to consider all relevant factors in making a decision. The trial court, however, determines the credibility of witnesses while they are being interrogated upon direct or cross-examination. This may include a consideration of their demeanor, candor or lack of it, responses, reasonability, or other tests within the common experience of mankind. The judgment of the trial court must be based upon the evidence actually adduced from the witness stand, from exhibits admitted during trial, or from any stipulations agreed' upon by council, It cannot be based upon mannerisms, expressions, or actions of persons in the courtroom not testifying under oath. Therefore, defendant\u2019s second assignment of error must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-14\">Troop, P.
