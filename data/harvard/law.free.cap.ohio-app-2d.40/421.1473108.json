Suit was brought by appellee as plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tiff below based on a contract between the United States Civil Service Commission and the Blue Cross Association and National Association of Blue Shield Plans. The Blue Cross Association and National Association of Blue Shield Plans executed the contract which provides certain benefits for Federal employees enrolled in the Plan. Defendant Health Care Mutual Association is the underwriter of the \u201cSupplemental Benefits\u201d portion of this plan. Plaintiff was enrolled in the Plan and his daughter, Patricia, was covered by its provisions when the activities giving rise to this suit arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Appellee, in his complaint, claimed that $36,000 was due him under the \u201cSupplemental Benefits\u201d clause of the policy. This sum represented the expenses which would have resulted if plaintiff\u2019s daughter, Patricia, had spent three years in Devereux Foundation of Devon, Pennsylvania, a nonprofit institution suited to the treatment of nervous and mental disorders in children. The record discloses that Patricia actually spent twelve months at this institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Appellants, Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio and Health Care Mutual Association, both filed answers denying liability under any contract or insurance policy. Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio additionally denied that it had any contract with the plaintiff, and accordingly, prayed that it be dismissed. Upon trial before the court, verdict and judgment was entered in favor of appellee against both defendants in the amount of $12,000, the cost of one year\u2019s enrollment at Devereux Foundation at $1,000 per month. Motion for New Trial was overruled. Defendants\u2019 motion for separate findings of fact and conclusions of law was granted. Defendants and plaintiff both filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, but the record fails to disclose that any such findings and conclusions have been journalized by the trial court. Defendant Health Care Mutual Association appeals, assigning six errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">1. The court erred in ignoring the specific requirement set forth in the brochures that, to obtain benefits, the subscriber must submit itemized bills from the suppliers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>services and in finding that a blanket all-inclusiye charge of $1,000.00 per month with no itemization of services constituted an \u201citemized bill\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">2. The court erred in finding Devereux to be a hospital as defined in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">3. The court erred in disregarding the contractual limitations on benefits provided and the exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">4. The judgment is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">5. The court erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Rubin over objection by defendants and in not strieking such testimony on motion of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">6. The judgment is not sustained by the evidence and is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Defendant Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio also appeals, joining in the errors assigned by Health Care Mutual Association and also assigning an additional error which is disposed of below following the discussion of the six mutual assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Assignments of error numbers 1, 2 and 3 all involve the question of whether the trial court correctly interpreted and applied various coverage provisions of appellee\u2019s insurance policy. Because the various coverage provisions of this policy are interdependent these assignments will be disposed of together.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">The parties have stipulated that Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits D, E and F indicate the benefits available under the insurance policy and the procedure for obtaining these benefits (Tr. 20). These three exhibits are practically identical brochures issued in compliance with Federal law. The brochures set forth, in summary form, the services and benefits available to employees and their family members covered by the Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">The Plan offers Basic and Supplemental Benefits. Basic Benefits are not provided for services rendered in nonmember hospitals which are primarily a place for the treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>inent of nervous or mental disorders, but Supplemental Benefits are provided for covered services received in such institutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Devereux is not a \u201cmember hospital\u201d under the Plan because it does not have the required agreement with Blue Cross.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, if the charges incurred by plaintiff for the treatment of his daughter\u2019s emotional problems at Devereux are covered at all under the Plan, these charges must be covered under the Supplemental Benefits rather than the Basic Benefits portion of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Supplemental Benefits cover the \u201c... usual, customary and reasonable charges for medically necessary covered services and supplies in or out of a hospital prescribed or ordered by a physician. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those particular services and supplies which are \u201ccovered\u201d are listed in the Plan,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as are specific exclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The trial court awarded the plaintiff $12,000, the full charge for Patricia\u2019s one-year stay at Devereux, even though Devereux provided Patricia with a full year of college preparatory education for which she received credit in English, History, Biology, Geometry, Spanish and Physical Education. The expense for this education is not listed as a covered service under the Supplemental Benefits portion of the Plan. In fact, educational therapy is specifically excluded from coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Some of the services provided Patricia at Devereux are, arguably, covered by the Plan. A clause of particular importance reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\"><em>For nervous and mental disorders </em>\u2014 In addition to other services and supplies covered by Basic or Supplemental Benefits, the following are covered under Supplemental Benefits <em>when performed at the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00ae Day-night hospital care</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00ae Group therapy</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u2022 Collateral visits with members of the patient\u2019s immediate family</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u2022 Services of a member of a \u201cmental health team\u201d (i. e. physician, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, psychiatric social worker).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Patricia was provided with group therapy and the services of a member of a \u201cmental health team\u201d once per week while she stayed at Devereux.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">The Plan provides a solution for the problem presented when an institution such as Devereux provides an insured with some services which are covered and some which are not. The section of the Plan titled \u201cHow to Obtain Benefits \u2014 Claims for Supplemental Benefits\u201d clearly states \u201cItemized bills are necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This section goes on to state: \u201cItemized bills must show name and address of provider of services, name of patient, date of service, type of service, and charge for each service.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No such itemized bill was ever filed by the plaintiff, as Devereux claimed that the $1,000 per month represented an indivisible charge for the \u201ctotal concept\u201d or \u201cmilieu\u201d theory on which Devereux is based. The essential concept of \u201cmilieu therapy\u201d is that <em>everything </em>that happens to the patient has a considerable psychological impact (Tr. 200). This court passes no judgment upon the validity or effectiveness of \u201cmilieu therapy.\u201d But, because the Plan clearly covers only certain enumerated services and supplies, an award of the full charge for \u201cmilieu therapy\u201d amounts to an impermissible judicial extension of an insurance contract beyond the limits clearly established by the policy. Courts are bound by the unambiguous terms of an insurance contract and cannot enlarge or extend the contract by implication so as to embrace an object distinct from that originally contemplated by the parties. <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tomanski </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 222, 226; <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 212, 216; <em>National Life and Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 13, 22; <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Harzell Bros. Co. </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 566, 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">A problem related to the proper interpretation of the Plan is raised by appellants\u2019 complaint that they made timely requests for specific findings of fact separate from conclusions of law and that the trial court did not comply as required in Rule 52 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. However, the trial court did compose a Memorandum of Opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rule 52 of the Civil Rules states, in part: \u201cAn opinion or memorandum of decision filed in the action prior to judgment entry and containing findings of fact and conclusions of law stated separately shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this rule. ...\u201d The Memorandum of Opinion will therefore be treated as containing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact found separately from conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">One specific finding by the trial court was that the plaintiff appellee fulfilled the requirements of the Plan calling for an itemized bill. This conclusion is premised on the finding that the \u201ctype of service\u201d is sufficiently itemized by listing \u201cmilieu therapy.\u201d For the reasons stated above, this conclusion is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">A second specific finding in the trial court\u2019s Memorandum of Opinion is that Devereux Foundation, Devon, Pennsylvania, is a \u201cnonmember hospital\u201d as that term is defined in the Plan. Appellants assail this finding in their second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The Plan defines \u201cnonmember hospital\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\"><em>Nonmember hospital </em>is an institution other than a \u2022member hospital which, for compensation from its patients and of an inpatient basis, is engaged primarily in provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ing diagnostic and therapeutic facilities for the surgical or medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured and sick persons by-or under the supervision of a staff of licensed doctors of medicine (M. D.) or licensed doctors of osteopathy (D. 0.) and which continuously provides 24-diour-a-day registered graduate nursing service; and which is not, other than incidentally, (1) an extended care facility; a nursing home; a place for\u2019 rest, the aged, drug addicts, alcoholics; (2) a custodial or domiciliary institution which has as its primary purpose -the furnishing of food, shelter, training, or nonmedical personal services; or (3) for Basic Benefits, a place for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis or nervous or mental disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">College infirmaries are considered as nonmember hospitals. Benefits for the per diem rate charge will be provided for services in U. S. Public Health Service hospitals and Armed Forces hospitals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The crucial question is whether Devereux, in terms of the services provided Patricia was, other than incidentally, a \u201cdomiciliary institution which [had] as its primary purpose the furnishing of food, shelter, training, or nonmedical personal services.\u201d The meaning of this clause is clarified by the specific exclusion from coverage of charges incurred for \u201cSpeech therapy, occupational therapy, educational therapy, or other forms of nonmedical self-care, or self-help training.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These two clauses, read together, clearly reveal that a domiciliary institution which provides educational training is not a hospital under the Plan unless such educational training is merely incidental to the primary purpose of the institution. The record demonstrates that the education offered Patricia at Devereux was not merely incidental to the primary purpose of her stay at the institution. For example: Patricia was placed in an academically oriented dormitory (Tr. 98); she was therefore provided ordinary high school classes on a daily basis (Tr. 99); she attended five, 45-minute long classes a day; she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>was graded in her subjects, and passed them all (Tr. 150); she was therefore qualified to pass on to the eleventh grade at a regular school (Tr. 151).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We consequently conclude that Devereux did not offer hospital services to Patricia Drumm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The fact that Devereux did not offer hospital services to Patricia does not necessarily mean that appellant is precluded from any benefits under the Plan. Certain Supplemental Benefits are available for services and supplies provided out of a hospital. However, appellee\u2019s failure to provide an itemized bill prevents this court from sustaining any portion of the $12,000 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In assignment of error No. 4 appellants claim that the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding appellee $12,000, the full amount of Devereux\u2019s charges, is excessive. We agree. The Plan clearly limits Supplemental Benefits to 80 per cent, under the High Option,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the usual, customary and reasonable charges for covered services and supplies in excess of the deductible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, even if all of the services provided by Devereux were covered by the Plan, plaintiff\u2019s maximum recovery should have been 80 per cent of $12,000 or $9,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">For assignment of error No. 5 appellants claim that the trial court erred m admitting the testimony of Dr. Rubin. Dr. Rubin is a clinical psychologist who has worked in the Cleveland, Ohio area since 1957. He testified that the cost of psychotherapy and hospitalization supplied Patricia was $650 per month (Tr. 185). On cross-examination, Dr. Rubin admitted that he had no first hand experience with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Devereux; that he had never been to Devereux; that he. knew nothing of the Devereux cost breakdown in terms of how much of the fee charged was due to psychiatric care and how much was due to other things; that he had never seen Patricia Drumm and knew nothing about her from personal knowledge. Dr. Rubin further testified that he had been familiar with the name \u201cDevereux Foundation\u201d for 20 years; that he acquired this familiarity through courses' in child psychology, through advertisements in psychology journals, at psychology conventions where Devereux Schools had information booths, and through literature provided by Devereux.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Because Dr. Rubin was not personally acquainted with the Devereux Schools, or the services rendered Patricia at Devereux, he was incompetent to testify as to the cost of services supplied by Devereux to Patricia, unless his testimony was given in response to a proper hypothetical question based upon other facts in evidence. <em>Kraner </em>v. <em>Coastal Tank Lines, Inc. </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 59; <em>Burens </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 549. An expert may not base his opinion upon the hearsay statements of-others. <em>Consumano </em>v. <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. </em>(1967), 9 Ohio App. 2d 105, 113. Dr. Rubin testified that he based his opinion partially on information provided him by counsel, outside of the courtroom (Tr. 181, 182). Consequently, because Dr. Rubin\u2019s opinion was not based upon either his personal knowledge or other evidence in the record, his testimony should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">This is not a case like <em>Aetna Life </em>v. <em>Hare </em>(Ala. 1972), 256 So. 2d 904, where a psychiatrist with no personal knowledge of Devereux was permitted to testify as to the <em>reasonableness </em>of charges for treatment at this facility. Mr. Kraig, attorney for plaintiff appellee, explained that he offered Dr. Rubin\u2019s testimony as a substitute for an itemized bill because Devereux would not \u201cbreak down\u201d their fee (Tr. 184). Dr. Rubin was admittedly incompetent to testify as to the cost breakdown of Devereux\u2019s fees (Tr. 200). Nor can the rule of \u201cMultiple Admissibility\u201d be invoked to save Dr. Rubin\u2019s testimony under the theory that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>his testimony is admissible as evidence of the reasonableness of Devereux\u2019s charges. Dr. Rubin testified as to actual charges, not the reasonableness of charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In a related assignment of error, appellant Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio separately asserts that portions of the testimony of David Hunt, Assistant Secretary and Assistant Treasurer of Devereux Foundation were erroneously admitted to the prejudice of the appellants. Specifically, Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio objects to Mr. Hunt\u2019s testimony to the effect that the <em>reasonable </em>charges for psychiatric consultation in \u201cthis community\u201d [presumably the Devon, Pennsylvania area] were about $30 to $35 per session. Appellant claims that this testimony was inadmissible for two reasons: (1) Mr. Hunt was incompetent to give such testimony; (2) the testimony was irrelevant because it pertained to \u201cprivate practice\u201d rates while Devereux\u2019s psychiatrists were on a salary. Mr. Hunt was competent to testify because he was personally aware of some of the rates in the community (Tr. 151). Mr. Hunt\u2019s testimony was relevant because, under the Plan, each subscriber is entitled to Supplemental Benefits for the usual, customary and <em>reasonable </em>charges for covered services. The trial court committed no error in accepting, for what it was worth, this testimony from Mr. Hunt. In so holding, we do not conclude that Mr. Hunt\u2019s testimony in any way meets the Plan\u2019s requirements for an itemized bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In assignment of error No. 6 appellants assert that the judgment is not sustained by the evidence and is contrary to law. This assignment is well taken because we have now ruled that:</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">(1) Devereux did not provide \u201chospital\u201d services to Patricia Drumm.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">(2) Appellee is not entitled to any Basic Benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">(3) At most, only some of the services provided Patricia are covered by Supplemental Benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">(4) Appellee\u2019s failure to introduce into evidence an itemized bill or any other evidence of the type of services offered Patricia with Devereux\u2019s corresponding charge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>these services prevents any partial recovery of Deverenx\u2019s fee under Supplemental Benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">(5) The mere listing of \u201cmilieu therapy\u201d as the type of service and $12,000, Devereux\u2019s full fee as the corresponding charge, may not be construed as an \u201citemized bill\u201d under the Plan. Such an interpretation of the Plan would amount to an impermissible judicial extension of an insurance contract beyond the limits contemplated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">(6) Dr. Rubin\u2019s testimony is inadmissible as a substitute for an itemized bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">(7) David Hunt\u2019s testimony, though admissible, contains no information which may substitute for an itemized bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio additionally asserts that its motion for dismissal and final judgment in its favor made at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case was erroneously denied. We agree with this assertion, and accordingly grant the motion for dismissal and find judgment in favor of Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Appellee\u2019s claim is based solely on \u201cSupplemental Benefits.\u201d The record contains uncontradicated testimony that appellant Health Care Mutual Association underwrites the Supplemental Benefits while Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio is involved only with Basic Benefits and has no connection of any kind with Supplemental Benefits (Tr. 209-10). In view of this state of the record, the trial court erred in granting judgment against both appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The judgment of the trial court is accordingly reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-12\">Krenzler, P.
