Bnrman was admitted to probate on February 14, 1972. On June 22, 1972, plaintiffs-appellants filed a will contest action in Common Pleas Court pursuant to R. C. 2741.01, <em>et seq. </em>On September 13, 1972, defendantappellee, Einar Carlson, executor, filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to join a necessary party to the will contest action within six months of the will\u2019s admission to probate, contrary to the provision of R. C. 2741.02.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The record contains a photostatic copy of the will, attached to defendant\u2019s motion as Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d which shows that Byron J. Burman, the testatrix\u2019 nephew, is named as a residuary legatee. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, however, does not name Byron J. Burman as a party. Following the filing of defendant\u2019s September 13th motion to dismiss, plaintiffs on October 25, 1972, filed a motion for leave to join new party defendant pursuant to Civ. R. 21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court granted defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the action on November 1, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Plaintiffs appealed that action on December 1, 1972, and this court in a previous, unreported ruling reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. Court of Appeals, Eighth Appellate District, No. 32376, August 13, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The record shows that on remand defendant Einar Carlson again moved to dismiss on August 15, 1973, which motion wTas granted by the court on November 23, 1973. On December 13, 1973, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal and now assign as error the trial court\u2019s granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on November 23, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Appellants concede that Byron J. Bnrman was named in the will as a legatee, was a necessary party to the action pursuant to R. C. 2741.02, but was neither named as a party-defendant in the complaint nor joined within six months of probate of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The record reflects that plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 motion for leave to join a new party-defendant was filed after the six-month limitation of R. C. 2741.09.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants now state, and correctly so, that the \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>[r] efusal to permit such joinder has necessarily resulted in dismissal of the complaint for failure to comply with Section 2741.02 of the Revised Code, making all legatees necessary parties to a will contest action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellants maintain that the old \u201cunited in interest\u201d doctrine as applied in will contest actions and liberal amendment and joinder under the recently adopted Civil Rules of Procedure militate in their favot and mandate a reversal of the dismissal below.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The application of the \u201cunited in interest\u201d doctrine in will contest actions is derived from <em>Draher </em>v. <em>Walters </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 92, which held that service upon one of the legatee-devisee defendants is to be deemed commencement of the action as to each of the defendants of that class, and also as to the executor. Actual service could thereafter be made on all the defendants of that class. <em>Id. </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Appellee contends that <em>Draher </em>is distinguishable on the facts and that the plaintiffs-appellants have not brought themselves within the purview of the <em>Drdher </em>case. In <em>Draher </em>all necessary parties were named in the petition as defendants, but the Sheriff failed to obtain service of process on all said parties. In the instant case a residuary legatee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>was simply not named as a party within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">Further, the \u201cunited in interest\u201d doctrine in will contest actions appears to have been completely overruled, first by <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 177, 180-181, which required that the executor specifically be made a party and served, and later by <em>Gravier </em>v. <em>Gluth </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 232, 239-240, and <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Zanesville </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 211, 214-215, which required that all necessary parties under the statute (R. C. 2741.02) must be named and made parties within the six-month limitation period (R. C. 2741.09).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">That the Supreme Court of Ohio has completely rejected the <em>Draher </em>\u201cunited in interest\u201d doctrine was made clear recently when the Court refused \u201cto determine whether the rule of <em>Draher </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>130 Ohio St. 92, has been revitalized. This determination must await a case in which the question necessarily presents itself.\u201d <em>Hecker </em>v. <em>Schuler </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 58, 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Appellants further rely on the case of <em>Beverly </em>v. <em>Beverly </em>(Erie Co., 1973), 33 Ohio App. 2d 199, for their proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cR. C. 2741.02 is a remedial statute and the proceedings thereunder are to be liberally construed, and no person should be denied the assertion of a cause of action on captious or purely technical grounds.\u201d <em>Beverly, </em>paragraph 2 of the syllabus, citing and following <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Fenner </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 233.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Appellants maintain that the <em>Beverly </em>decision and earlier cases that they have cited show a clear trend in Ohio law favoring their position that the failure to strictly comply with R. C. 2741.02 and 2741.09 should not terminate their cause of action for, under the present civil rules, \u201camendments to pleadings and joinder of new parties are to be freely permitted in the interest of justice. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">We cannot agree with appellants\u2019 position. First, the liberalization of procedure under will contest actions such that no person should be denied its cause of action on \u201ccaptious or purely technical grounds\u201d has, in each reported ease, been clearly limited to a similar and rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>specialized situation, where a defendant is named and served in his individual capacity but not in some other specific legal relationship to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">For example, in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Fenner </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 233, a defendant was named in the body of the petition as the executor of the estate but by virtue of the caption he was only served in an individual capacity. The Supreme Court held that even though this defendant\u2019s title as executor was omitted in the petition, the plaintiff should not be denied its cause of action, <em>i. e., </em>its \u201cday in court,\u201d on captious or purely technical grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 235-236.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Again, a similar situation was resolved in <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Hirsch </em>(Franklin Co., 1972), 32 Ohio App. 2d 200, by the holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cA will contest action, otherwise rightly brought within the meaning of R. C. 2741.09, will not fail under R. C. 2741.02 for the sole reason that persons named testamentary trustees in the will, but who have not been appointed to such capacity within the period of six months following probate, are not joined as parties in that capacity, where such persons are parties in their capacity of co-executors, having been so named in the will and appointed by the probate court, and where all the beneficiaries of the testamentary trust have been timely made parties to the action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">And finally in <em>Beverly, supra, </em>one service of summons was made, within the time limitation of R. C. 2741.09, upon a defendant occupying the positions of surviving spouse, devisee, and executrix which did not designate these three specific legal relationships between the defendant and the estate. These various capacities of the defendant, however, were clearly set out in the body of the complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action after the lower court had granted leave to amend, pursuant to Civil Rule 15. Referring to Sarah Beverly, the defendant in question who occupied the three specific relationships under the will, the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201cIt would be captious and purely technical to say that she, as an individual, did have notice, was properly served but, as an executrix, was uninformed. She was also an heir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>at law. Technically, we conld be ridiculous and require that three separate summons and three separate copies of the complaint be served upon her, one in her role as an executrix, one in her role as an heir, and one in her role as a devisee or legatee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201c* * * Sarah Beverly, executrix, knew or should have known that, but for the mistake in not identifying her as executrix in the original caption, the action would have been brought against Sarah Beverly in her role as an individual and also in her role as executrix.\u201d 33 Ohio App. 2d at 214.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Moreover, the <em>Beverly </em>court did not, as appellants in the present case suggest, consider it \u201cnecessary to determine whether the rule of <em>Draher </em>v. <em>Walters, supra, </em>wherein the \u2018unity-of-interest\u2019 theory was advanced, has been revitalized, as intimated by the court in <em>Hecker, supra.\u201d </em>33 Ohio App. 2d at 215. The conclusion that the \u201cunited in interest\u201d doctrine has been completely overruled and, contrary to appellants\u2019 argument, has not been reinstated through the civil rules is supported by the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cThe \u2018united in interest\u2019 doctrine was predicated upon an interpretation of Gr. C. 11230 (later R. C. 2305.17). R. C. 2305.17 was amended in 1965 (131 Ohio Laws 646) and the language upon which the \u2018united in interest\u2019 doctrine was predicated was deleted from the section. The civil rules contain no provision similar to that formerly contained in R. C. 2305.17 upon which the \u2018united in interest\u2019 doctrine was predicated. Accordingly, it is doubtful that the \u2018united in interest\u2019 doctrine, as such, is still a viable doctrine.\u201d <em>Hirsch, supra, </em>at 209. <em>Cf. Collins </em>v. <em>Nurre </em>(Hamilton Co., 1969), 20 Ohio App. 2d 53, 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In further answering appellants\u2019 argument that their action was improperly dismissed because the trial court failed to recognize the policy of liberal amendment and joinder under the civil rules, we note that Chapter 2741 of the Revised Code is designated as a Special Remedy within Title XXVII. The will contest action under R. C. 2741.01, <em>et seg., </em>is clearly a special statutory proceeding. \u25a0 Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>more, the provisions of R. C. 2741.02 and 2741.09 have consistently been held by the clearest and best authority to be jurisdictional and mandatory. <em>See Fletcher, supra, </em>at 215. <em>See also Porter, supra, </em>at 235; <em>Beverly, supra, </em>paragraphs 1, 5 and 6 of the syllabus; <em>Collins, supra, </em>at 53-54. Appellants in the present action concede that a residuary legatee in the will was neither named anywhere in their complaint nor served within the six-month limitation period or at any time thereafter. Appellants argue that liberalized procedure under the civil rules should allow them to now correct this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Civil Rule 1(C) sets forth the following exception to the applicability of the rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201c(C) <em>Exceptions. </em>These rules, to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable, shall not apply to procedure ... (7) in all other special statutory proceedings; . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Civil Rule 82, moreover, states the following general provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cThese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of this state. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Under the present circumstances, where appellants have allowed the six-month limitation period of R. C. 2741.-09 to lapse without having named a legatee under the will and necessary party under R. C. 2741.02 in any manner in their complaint, it would be an unwarranted extension of jurisdiction to now permit amendment or joinder under the civil rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Appellants\u2019 situation in the instant case was aptly described by Chief Justice Weygandt when he referred to the <em>Gravier </em>case in the <em>Fletcher </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201cIn that case as in the instant one, \u2018there was a defect in parties during the entire six-months limitation period.\u2019 In that case as in this, \u2018the duty of the plaintiffs was to include in their action all the parties required by the statute within the six-month limitation, there as here, \u2018this was not done, and the Court of Common Pleas correctly determined it had no jurisdiction. \u2019 \u2019 \u20193 <em>Fletcher, supra, </em>at 214.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">The civil rules have not changed procedure in will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u25a0contest actions to the extent appellants suggest. After the \u2022statutory limitation period has lapsed, any civil rule that would operate to allow the plaintiff in a will contest action to add a necessary party designated under statute, would be, by its nature, clearly inapplicable as it would operate to extend the jurisdiction of the courts in this special statutory proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">We, therefore, are of the opinion that the court below \u25a0is without jurisdiction to try this will contest action and properly dismissed the same on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is correct and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-6\">Silbert, C. J., and Jackson, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> R.
