The indictment in this case charges this defendant with a \u201cfelony\u201d murder in the first degree (While perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a robbery.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The transcript of the docket and journal entries discloses that the indictment in 1418A.was filed on October 12, 1972. The \u201c03\u201d in 543B indicates that the indictment in that case was filed in March, 1972. On the facts there is no dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">There is no transcript of proceedings in this case. We feel, however, that we may accept the facts set forth in the trial court\u2019s \u201cDecision and Entry\u201d of May 30, 1973, as a finding of facts. These disclose that the appellee (the defendant in 543B) was indicted, tried and convicted of \u201cpremeditated\u201d murder in the first degree; that the indictments in the two cases were filed \u201capproximately seven months apart\u201d; that case number 1418A was pending when 543B was tried.;-that the same victim.was involved, in both charges; that \u201ca motion to elect\u201d was timely filed by the defendant and that the record is silent as to any ruling. The trial court then presumed that the state \u201cby proceeding bn the earlier case \u2018elected.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Parenthetically, we should observe that counsel for the appellee, at page 2 of his brief, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">\u201cQn October 20, 1972, the State filed a motion to consolidate the two indictments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">\u201cOn October 30, 1972, the appellee filed a motion in both cases to. require the State to elect as to which indictment. the State intended to proc\u00e9ed upon. - \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">... .\u201c The motion to consolidate was overruled by the trial court. The motion to elect was overruled and the State was ordered to trial on the first indictment. .*\u25a0**\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">Counsel, for the. appellant agree with'.these-statements; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The transcript of the docket and journal entries does not disclose that the trial court\u2019s orders were journalized. Obviously they should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In their first assignment of error, counsel for the appellant contend that the trial court erred in quashing the indictment on the authority of R. C. 2941.32. This section is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">\u201cIf two or more indictments or informations are pending against the same defendant <em>for the same criminal act, </em>the prosecuting attorney must elect upon which he will proceed, and upon trial being had upon one of them, the remaining indictments or information shall be quashed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">It is obvious that the application of this statute turns upon the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe same criminal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">R. C. 2901.01 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">\u201cNo person shall purposely, and either of deliberate and premeditated malice, <em>or </em>by means of poison, <em>or </em>in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate rape, arson, robbery, or burglary, kill another.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in that statute appears to make it clear that different sets of essential elements constitute different offenses even though the victim is the same person. This was the conclusion reached and position taken by the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 390, in the first paragraph of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-10\">\u201c1. The killing of another purposely and in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a robbery and the killing of the same person purposely and of deliberate and premeditated malice are <em>separate and distinct offenses </em>of first degree murder and, under Section 2901.01, Revised Code, may properly be charged in separate counts of an indictment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The court explained as follows, at page 394:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-12\">\u201cMurder committed in the perpetration of a robbery and murder committed with deliberate and premeditated malice are <em>not one and the same offense, </em>even <em>though the victim is one and the same person. </em>The test to be applied here is: Ar\u00e9 the facts necessary to secure a conviction un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>der one count of the indictment sufficient to secure a conviction under the other count. If the facts which would support a conviction under one count would not necessarily support a conviction under the other count, then the <em>offenses charged are separate and distinct crimes, although the offenses charged may have been committed by the same act or acts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">There, the distinction is clearly made between \u201coffense\u201d and \u201cact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It must also be remembered that an indictment, to be sufficient, must allege <em>inter alia </em>an offense. R. C. 2941.03 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cAn indictment or information is sufficient if it can be understood therefrom:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\n<em>66* * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">\u201c(D) That an offense was committed at some place Avithin the jurisdiction of the court * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The charge in an indictment or in a count of an indictment is an \u201coffense\u201d if properly alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The provisions of R. C. 2941.04 are also helpful. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">\u201cAn indictment or information may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, or different statements of the same offense, or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts, and if two or more indictments or informations are filed in such cases the court may order them to be consolidated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">\u201cThe prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses or counts set forth in the indictment or information, but the defendant may be convicted of any, number of the offenses charged, and each offense upon which the defendant is convicted must be stated in the verdict. The court in the interest of justice and for good cause shown, may order different offenses or counts set forth in the indictment or information tried separately or divided into two or more groups and each of said groups tried separately. A verdict of acquittal of one or more counts is not an acquittal of any other count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>One of the pertinent provisions of this statute is that which demonstrates that the Legislature considered (and did not prohibit) that different offenses arising out- of the same criminal act may be charged in different indictments and that if such be the case \u201cthe court <em>may </em>order them to be consolidated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">This procedure is in line' with the decision in <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Sacks </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 456. At page 457, we find the following language with reference to' the meaning of B. C. 2941.32:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cThe petitioner is confused as to the meaning of-this section which relates to two indictments for an <em>identical crime arising out of the same criminal act. The purpose of this section is to prevent multiple prosecutions of an accused </em>for the identical offense growing out of the same criminal act. * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The defendant, in this appeal, is <em>not </em>being prosecuted for the'\u201cidentical offense\u201d as that in'case number 543B. The offenses may have grown out of the same criminal act but, as the court held in <em>Ferguson, </em>they \u201care separate and distinct offenses of first degree murder.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Strozier </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 62:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The trial judge, in his opinion, makes the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cThe Prosecutor is maintaining that there are'two independent \u2018criminal acts.\u2019 One being \u2018Premeditation\u2019 and the second the \u2018Felony\u2019 aspects. It is the opinion of this court that the \u2018criminal act\u2019 upon which the actions are predicated is the First Degree Murder. It is further the opinion of the Court that the \u2018criminal act\u2019 charge' [sic] in Case No. 72CB-03-543(B) is the same \u2018criminal act\u2019 charged in case No. 72CB-10-1418(A). We, therefore, find that it was mandatory for the Prosecutor, under the statute, to elect which case he intended to try, or to have indicted jointly. Hence, the Court feels that the statute makes- it mandatory that the Court quash the \u2018remaining\u2019 indictment which, of course, is Case No. 72CB-10-1418(A).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">For-the reasons-already giveii, we do not agree with this finding and conclusion. The first assignment of \u201cerror is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The trial court also appears to find that to put the defendant to trial under 1418A would he to place him in double jeopardy. Counsel for appellant assign this as the court\u2019s second error.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">The applicable provision of the Constitution of the United States is found in the Fifth Amendment and is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201c* <em>* </em>* [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In commenting on this clause, in <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson </em>(1970), 397 U. S. 436, Justice Brennan said, at page 450:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cThis guarantee is expressed as a prohibition against multiple prosecutions for the \u2018same offense.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Obviously, we agree with this statement. It must be observed that Justice Brennan and the Fifth Amendment refer to the \u201csame offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">To the same effect is Section 10, Article I of the Constitution of Ohio. It provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">\u201cNo person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">In construing this section, the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose </em>(1914), 89 Ohio St. 383, stated, at page 386:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">\u2022 \u201cThe words \u2018same offense\u2019 mean same offense, not the same transaction, not the same acts, not the same circumstances or same situation. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">At page 387, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-13\">\u201cWe hold that there is nothing here for this court to construe. Where there is no doubt, no ambiguity, no uncertainty as to the meaning of the language employed by the constitution-makers, there is clearly neither right nor authority for the court to assume to interpret that which needs no interpretation and to construe that which needs no construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">These statements are as true and correct now as they were then. There is still nothing to interpret or construe.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">The trial of this defendant on the charge in 1418A would not constitute placing the defendant in double jeopardy for the same offense. The second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">In their third assignment of error, counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>state appear to contend that the trial court erred in sustaining the motion to quash the indictment for the reason that the defendant waived any right that he had to have all charges against him joined \u201cin a single prosecution\u201d by objecting to the state\u2019s motion to consolidate the trials ou both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We are of the opinion that there is nothing before this court upon which a decision can be reached either on the question as to whether the defendant had a <em>right </em>to have <em>all charges </em>joined \u201cin a single prosecution\u201d or, if he did, whether he waived that right. Therefore, we consider this assignment as not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For the reasons given, it is the opinion of the court that the judgment of the court of common pleas be reversed and that this case be remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-7\">Troop, P. J., and Whiteside, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b74-8\">Cessaman, J., retired, of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County, sitting by assignment in the Court of Appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
