Because parties are interwoven and the issues in both cases are identical, we shall treat them as one case for the purpose of this opinion. Hereafter, the Hausmann <em>&amp; </em>Johnson, Dibenedetto/'Viseonsi group, who were jointly involved as plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>tiffs in the proceedings below, will be called the \u201cappellees\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and the City of Berea and its officials, who were defendants in the court below and appellants in this court, will be called collectively the \u201cappellants\u201d. Case No. 32590 was appealed to the Court of Common Pleas after running the course of administrative procedure in the City of Berea, including an appeal to the Board of Zoning and Building Code Appeals, resulting in the denial of a permit application sought for the construction of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. The second case, No. 32591, reached Common Pleas Court by way of a complaint for declaratory judgment and equitable relief. The appellees were successful in the court below. The court ordered the issuance of a building permit in accordance with the appellees \u2019 application and found for them in the declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">In the trial court in Case No. 902,329 the parties stipulated an \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts.\u201d This stipulation together with the pleadings and attachments provided the record for the Common Pleas Court\u2019s review of the appeal from the Board of Zoning and Building Code Appeals. An identical stipulation of facts, the pleadings and attachments were the basis for the court\u2019s decision on the complaint for declaratory judgment in Case No. 902,330.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The two cases are now before this court to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>trial court\u2019s actions on the administrative appeal and on the motion for declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Appellant assigns two errors. We set them out verbatim :</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. 1:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\"><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2018 The Court in Finding for the Plaintiff on the Declaratory Judgment Action Based on the Stipulation of Pacts, Erred Said Ruling by the Court Being Contrary to Law [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. 2:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">\u201cThe Court Erred as a Matter of Law in Reversing the Decision of the Building Commissioner et al and Ordering Permit to be Issued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Behind these assignments of error lies one issue, and that is, whether a rezoning ordinance can be limited constitutionally by an agreement providing that any petition for a <em>rezoning </em>must be accompanied by the petitioner\u2019s consent <em>to the </em>proposition that if the property is not used within twelve months in the manner the rezoning allows, it immediately reverts to its former more restrictive use category. The source of the claimed reversionary \u201cagreement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>in the present case is another ordinance<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in force for more than twenty years before the<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rezoning now in issue took place (see Agreed Statement of Facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In Ohio, municipal zoning is an aspect of both local self-government and legislatively granted police power, <em>Pritz </em>v. <em>Messer </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 628, 637-638. Municipal authority to zone stems from the Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">\u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">and from the statutes, <em>Pritz </em>v. <em>Messer, id. </em>637. Statutory implementation of zoning authority in non-charter cities is delineated in Ohio Revised Code, Sections 713.01-713.13, as amended, cf. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Roseman </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 447, 450; <em>Wintersville </em>v. <em>Sales Co. </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 148, 152. Those sections also regulate zoning authority in ehar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ter cities when \u201cthe charter does not specifically set forth the procedure to be followed in enacting zoning ordinances.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Kling, </em>v. <em>Nielson </em>(1957), 103 Ohio App. 60, 62. The Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3, which extends the power of local self-government and local police regulation to municipalities, does not limit Sections 713.01-713.13. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1960), 113 Ohio App. 370, 373-374. However, a municipality may, by charter provision, enlarge the local police power, without limitation from the statutory sections,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Bauman </em>v. <em>State, ex rel. Underwood </em>(1930), 122 Ohio St. 269.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Berea, Ohio, is a charter city. Its charter does set the procedures for enacting zoning ordinances (Berea Charter, Section X) and the council has legislated' extensive zoning, including the reversionary ordinance (see footnote 3, <em>supra)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>so crucial in this case. Because the parties mate no point of the lack of a specific agreement nor raise any issue about a council minute recording one, as the reversionary ordinance requires, we pass this point and treat the ordinance as though it effected an agreement and reach the more vital issue in the case, i. e., whether such agreements are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Appellees Spartico Dibenedetto and D. A. Viseonsi Company own real estate on the north side of Bagley Noad in the City of Berea, Ohio. The area which the property occupies and <em>no more </em>was rezoned from residential to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>mercial on the owner\u2019s application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the denial of appellees\u2019 application for a building permit went through the procedural steps necessary to exhaust the administrative remedies. These were without success and the case was appealed to Common Pleas Court where it became coupled with a complaint for declaratory judgment as described at the beginning of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The appellants contend that the reversionary clause in Ordinance No. 627, Section XXV, is a matter of substantive law well within the constitutional zoning power of municipal eorporations.They purport to find one instructive analogy in the concept of the \u201cconditional permit variance\u201d and another in the variance with conditions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellee rejects these arguments contending that conditional rezoning authorizes automatic repeal of the rezoning <em>ordinance </em>and reenactment of the <em>status quo ante </em>in disregard of procedure required bv law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The Ohio Constitution and implementing statutes which have a relevance to zoning do not reach, either in specific terms or by necessary implication, the question of rezoning with reversionary conditions. And our researches have turned up no Ohio case, and none has been called to our attention by the parties, which has ever determined the validity of a reversionary agreement attached to a successful petition for rezoning.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u201d However, other states have had occasion to examine the question and there is authority with impressive logic holding that such contractual conditions are not enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In some cases it is said that a reversionary contract between a city and landowners involves an abuse of zoning power rendering the contract <em>ultra vires, </em>illegal, and void and all proceedings to enforce it are <em>coram non judice. </em>This conclusion rests on the theory that a contract controlling the exercise of municipal legislative power is against public policy. Contracts \u201chave no place in a zoning plan\u201d and agreements \u201cbetween a municipal authority and a property owner\u201d should not be a factor either \u201cin the enactment or enforcement of zoning regulations\u201d, <em>Houston Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>Automotive Product C. Assn. </em>(S. Ct., New Jersey, 1952), 87 A. 2d 319, 322.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Oury </em>v. <em>Greany </em>(S. Ct., Rhode Island, 1970), 267 A. 2d 700, 702, conditional zoning was held to be zoning \u201cwithout regard to the public health, safety and welfare, concern for which is basic to that comprehensiveness contemplated in the enabling act\" <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition to these considerations it has been held that zoning based solely on collateral promises improperly leaves restrictions in a particular zone to extrinsic evidence, <em>Baylis </em>v. <em>City of Baltimore </em>(Ct. of App., Md., 1959), 148 A. 2d 429, 433.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Authorities which reach identical conclusions are not always uniform in their reasons for holding invalid a rezoning conditioned upon the property owner fulfilling an agreement between the municipality and him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A variety of explanations are conveniently catalogued in <em>Cederberg </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(Ill. App., 1972, rehearing denied 1973), 291 N. E. 2d 249, 251:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>. . While no single basis for the rule against such zoning practices emerges from the cases cited, among the courts\u2019 reasons are that by entering into agreement with the property owner, the zoning authority might use the zoning power to further private interests in violation of public policy; that such rezoning is a deviation from a basic zoning plan resulting in nonuniform application of the zoning law and inconsistencies within a zoning classification ; that when the actual zoning requirements in force are determined by reference to evidence extrinsic to the zoning ordinances, the zoning law is rendered vague.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Granting that the legislative decision of a governing-authority has a presumption of validity, the reasons listed are persuasive ones for overcoming the presumption and finding the restrictions and reversion which the appellants attempted to enforce in this case invalid. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The parties here have made no point of either the presence or absence of a specific reversionary agreement between Appellant Berea and the appellees. We do not assay the legal consequences, if any, of the absence of such a contract. We have assumed a reversionary agreement was effected here by operation of law. Our disposition embraces the broad proposition that reversionary agreements attempting to condition zoning by contract, however derived, are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The appellants did not brief the issue of the validity of a moratorium resolution of the City of Berea and abandoned their reliance on the moratorium during oral argument. For this reason it is unnecessary to consider any phase of the assignments of error centering on that resolution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-9\">Corrigan and Manos, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> For clarity at some places in the text of the opinion, it will be necessary to refer to the \u201cappellee\u201d plus the proper name. In order that such identifications be complete it is noted here that Spartico Dibenedetto and D. A. Visconsi are the owners of real estate which was rezoned by the City of Berea to 2-B-l permitting retail businesses, including restaurants, Ordinance 1963-75. Franchise Realty Interstate Corporation, also an appellee, is alleged to be the holder of an option to purchase the rezoned real estate, and it is further alleged that Hausmann &amp; Johnson, Inc., are the agents of and general contractors for Franchise Realty Interstate Corp. (See Complaint, paragraphs 1 and' 3 in Case No. 902,330 in the Common Pleas Court. The answer admits the ownership allegation and denies the remaining part of paragraph 1 for lack of knowledge, admits the allegation in paragraph 3 describing the location of the property, and denies rezoning to Class 2-B-l. However, the rezoning is conceded as part of an agreed statement of facts between counsel. The agency of Hausmann &amp; Johnson, Inc., \u201cacting for the appellants\u201d in seeking permission for construction of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant is also admitted.)-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\"> We have indicated in the text that Case No. 32590 in this court is the appeal from the decision in favor of appellees (in Common Pleas Case No. 902,329) involving an appeal to Common Pleas Court from the Board of Zoning and Building Code Appeals of the City of Berea and that Case No. 32591 in this court is the appeal from a finding for appellees in their action for declaratory relief. The latter case was No. 902,330 in Common Pleas Court. Appellants argued that the appeal of the action of the Board of Zoning and Building Code Appeals could not be considered either in the Common Pleas Court or here for lack of a record. This argument proceeds from the premise that a secretary\u2019s report of unsworn proceedings before the Board of Zoning and Building Code Appeals is not a record. See <em>Arcaro Bros. Builders Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals </em>(1966), 7 Ohio St. 2d 32; <em>Doelker </em>v. <em>Accountancy Bd. </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 76; <em>Capello </em>v. <em>Mayfield Heights </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 1. Whatever the merits of this argument might be in the absence of the \u201cAgreed Statement of. Facts\u201d reached in this case, that agreement cures the omission both in the Court of Common Pleas and here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> Ordinance Number 627 \u2014 \u201cSection XXV.
