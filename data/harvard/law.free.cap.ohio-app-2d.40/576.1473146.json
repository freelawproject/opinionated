Plaintiff further prayed that the court issue a declaratory' judgment finding-that she was not responsible for the damages ea\u00fased in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The automobile accident occurred October 19,1972. The bureau of motor vehicles, under authority of R. C. 4509.177 ordered that her driver\u2019s license and registration be .suspended. The bureau did so after it determined that plain-1 tiff was at fault and was uninsured at the time. Plaintiff-appealed the order to the Court of Common Pleas. The decision of the Court of Common Pleas reads, in part, as follows: '\u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cThe court having considered this matter finds that the order of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and is in accordance- with law.' The court, therefore, will affirm the order of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in the case.\u201d.-,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Plaintiff did not appeal from that decision and judgment ; hence, it became final.' There is no prejudicial error in refusing to determine the issue of liability by means of a declaratory judgihent as requested'by plaintiff:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">, We believe that plaintiff may not substitute an action based upon a request for a declaratory judgment and an injunction for an appeal, especially after the judgment th'atpiaintiff is attaeldng became final long ago. She ' had her day in court. She made a choice and now she-must abide by it. \u25a0 .</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">We know of no case, , and can conceive of,no situation which would warrant the use of the Declaratory. Judgments^ Act as; a: method of appeal or- appellate review ,to obtain* an original declaration of rights between parties in matters solely appellate. <em>Howle </em>v. <em>Alabama State Milk Control Board </em>(Ala. 1956), 90 So. 2d. 752, 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">We believe that the answer to the question proponded is found in 26 Corpus Juris Secundum 93-94, Declaratory Judgments, Section 23, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cAn action under declaratory judgments acts will not lie to determine whether rights theretofore adjudicated have been properly decided, nor will it lie to determine the propriety of judgments in prior actions between the same parties. An action for a declaratory judgment cannot be used as a subterfuge for, or for the veiled purpose of, relitigating questions as to which a former judgment is conclusive. In the absence of an allegation of fraud in the procurement of a prior adjudication, or without showing that an application was made to vacate the prior judgment within the period allowed by a statute of limitations, a party who acquiesced in the procurement of such judgment cannot procure a declaratory judgment which would in effect disregard the prior judgment as being void. It has been held that, although a prior adjudication settles the matters then before the court, where the same conclusion is reached in subsequent litigation, it does no harm to declare the matters again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-3\">For the above reasons, we find no errors among those assigned and argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-5\">Stephenson, P.
