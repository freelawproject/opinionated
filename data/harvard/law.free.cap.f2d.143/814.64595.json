The jurisdiction is conceded and we may review and to the extent that the order of the Commission is affirmed we may give our own order commanding obedience to the terms of such order of the Commission, Federal Trade Commission Act, \u00a7 5(c), 52 Stat. 113, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">A. The first order complained of is to desist from advertising that Life Lite \u201caffords benefits to the skin or to the general health of the user comparable to those afforded by natural sunlight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-23\">The Commission\u2019s experts testified and its brief admits that Life Lite\u2019s rays produce in the fat-like sterols beneath the surface of the skin vitamin D which is carried through the body to the bones and aids if not cures rickets. So also do the sun\u2019s rays. A little over ten percent of Life Lite\u2019s rays are in the lower rays of the sun\u2019s spectrum. The remaining rays are below those of the sun. There is no testimony that the quantity of vitamin D produced by Life Lite is more or less than that of the sun\u2019s rays. Even in the restricted. use of the word \u201ccomparable\u201d as \u201cequal\u201d or \u201cnearly as good\u201d or \u201cworthy of comparison\u201d there is no evidence of untruth in the statement that the lamp \u201caffords benefits * * * to the general health of the user comparable to those afforded by natural sunlight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-24\">It is admitted that the lamp\u2019s rays are of some benefit to the skin. The CommisT sion\u2019s brief admits that Dr. Ayers, its principal expert, testified that the lamp iyas \u201cuseful in the treatment of several Skin diseases,\u201d but he said that its bactericidal action was limited to \u201cthat type of bacteria which is right at the very surface of the skin\u201d because \u201cmost of the rays of the light are filtered out by the Upper skin layers.\u201d Another of the Commission\u2019s experts) Dr. Moor, testified that the lamp was \u201cUseful chiefly for very superficial infections and * * * to produce irritation of the skin.\u201d Dr. Moor himself states the comparable effect on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the skin of the lamp\u2019s rays and those of the sun. In .this testimony \u201cstimulating\u201d and \u201cirritating\u201d are terms of the same meaning. The comparison seems favorable to the lamp\u2019s rays in the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-4\">\u201cQ. What is the difference in the effect from the shorter waves found in the cold quartz lamps as compared to .the effect of the rays of natural sunlight? A. Well, the shorter rays are much more irritating to the skin. They are factericidal, more bactericidal than sunlight. They do not have the same biological' effects as sunlight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-5\">\u201cQ. Now, in what conditions would you say that such rays, such ultra-violet rays, of 2540 angstrom units, such as are found primarily in this respondent\u2019s product, would be useful in the treatment of disease or body ailments? A. Useful chiefly for very superficial infections and if it is desirable to produce irritation of the skin, it can be used for that also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">\u201cQ. That is, you would say that it would have a bactericidal and stimulating\u2014 A. And stimulating effect on the skin, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">\u201cQ. That would be two different classifications of effect; is that correct? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">\"Q. And what bacteria would be affected by such a lamp? A. Well, practically any organism which is on the surface. There are a few bacteria which flourish in light, but most of the pathogenic organisms are killed by light if they are right on the surface, where they are not protected by any covering of pus or crusts on the surface.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Dr. Moor continues to show that the use of the lamp may be injurious if used on certain skin diseases. The effect of his testimony is that the lamp should be used in many situations only on medical advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">The question here is not whether the petitioner\u2019s past advertising has made improper comparisons of the lamp\u2019s rays with the sun\u2019s rays', but, assuming that offense, does it deprive the owner of the advertised product of making any comparison with the sun\u2019s rays \u2014 even though truthful. We think not. It. is not .the function of the Commission to inflict such a punishment upon the owner of such a product, with its admitted beneficept functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">The broad .terms of the order prevent any statement of even the admitted benefit to the skin or to the general health of the user of the lamp\u2019s rays comparable to natural sunlight. We.decline to order its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">B. The remaining items of the cease and desist order are more specific. Petitioner claims that there is no substantial evidence to support an order to cease and desist from representing \u201cthat said lamp \u25a0constitutes a cure or remedy or a competent or adequate treatment for * * * ringworm, athlete\u2019s foot, acne, eczema, psoriasis * * There is testimony by one or another of the physician experts sufficient to sustain the order that the. light would be of \u201cvery little value\u201d in treating ringworm; \u201cnot a proper means of treating athlete\u2019s foot;\" \u201cvery little value in the treatment of acne;\u201d that eczema was \u201csimply a symptom of a disease of the skin,\u201d that \u201cwithout finding out the underlying cause, it is perfectly futile to try to treat it,\u201d and while Life Lite might \u201cbe of some temporary value in eczema\u201d it would not \u201ceffect a cure,\u201d and of \u201cno value\u201d in treating psoriasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">C. Similarly there is testimony supporting the order not to advertise \u201cthat said lamp constitutes a cure or remedy for sores or ulcers, or that it constitutes a competent treatment therefor except insofar as it may stimulate the healing process in those cases in which the infection causing such condition is confined to the surface of the skin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">Dr. Ayres testified that he knew of no \u201cchronic skin condition which would be improved * * * or benefited\u201d by the lamp exc\u00e9pt to the extent that the lamp might have a \u201cstimulating effect, such as perhaps in the case of a chronic ulcer, but I doubt very much if the light by itself would be sufficient to bring about a cure in even such a condition.\u201d He also testified that it would \u201cVery definitely\u201d be \u201cnecessary to have the diagnosis of a physician\u201d before using petitioner\u2019s lamp in the treatment of sores and ulcers for the reason that, while the lamp \u201cmight be of some value in the treatment of certain chronic ulcers, by way of stimulating cicatrization,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * * one would have to know what the ulcer was caused by. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>You \u2019could have an ulcer due to syphilis and no amount of light would do it any good. Or you may have an ulcer due to cancer and the use of the light might even aggravate it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">D. Similarly with regard to advertising that the lamp \u201cpossesses any therapeutic value in the treatment of * * * bronchitis * * *\u201d Dr. Moor testified that bronchitis was \u201ccommonly caused by germs in the respiratory tract,\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that petitioner\u2019s lamp did not possess sufficient penetrating power to reach the source of the infection, and had \u201cno direct effect on bronchitis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">E. With regard to not advertising \u201cthat said lamp builds up in the body resistance to disease,\u201d the testimony of the Commission\u2019s experts that by irradiating (he body\u2019s sterols with the lamp\u2019s rays its resistance to rickets is increased if the di\u00e1ease is not cured. The Commission\u2019s order would prevent the telling of the truth about this valuable property of the lamp\u2019s rays and we decline to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">F. With regard to ceasing to advertise \u201cthat said lamp afford any stimulation to the tissues of the skin in excess of such stimulation as may result from its irritating effect,\u201d there is evidence that the stimulation of the lamp\u2019s rays may have a beneficial effect in certain diseases appearing in or through the skin and injurious in others, and that the stimulation is an irritation of the skin. We think this item of the order emphasizing the irritation is warranted and advisable to impress the user with the likely injury from irritating some diseases appearing on the skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">G. Regarding the prohibition against advertising that the lamp \u201cnormalizes the chemistry of the body, improves metabolism, or builds new tissues, except insofar as its use <em>may </em>result in the production of vitamin D,\u201d (emphasis supplied,) we agree that it should be modified as requested by the petitioner to read to prohibit the statement that the lamp \u201cnormalizes the chemistry of the body, improves metabolism, or builds new tissues, except insofar as such effects are related to the production of vitamin D resulting from the use of the lamp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">The testimony is that the rays do produce vitamin D in the chemistry of the body. There is no ground for the doubtful word <em>may </em>italicized in the order. Petitioner\u2019s experts describe the process and the Commission\u2019s expert Dr. Moor testified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-12\">\u201cQ. In your opinion, would you agree that the only definite benefits known to come from the use of ultra-violet rays would be the maintaining of the phosphorous and calcium of the body and inhibition of rickets? A. Really, that is the only well proven effect of ultra-violet radiation of the body. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-13\">\u201cQ. In your opinion, would that be the only proven benefit from such a device,\u2014 A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-14\">\u201cQ. \u2014of the respondent, as described to you in this case? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">We set aside the order of the Commission with respect to items described in sections A and E of this opinion without prejudice to the Commission\u2019s right to treat the proceeding as one submitted upon these items and subject to such order as the Commission may be advised to make. Cf. International Shoe Co. v. Commission, 280 U.S. 291, 297, SO S.Ct. 89, 74 L.Ed. 431. We decree the enforcement of the Commission\u2019s order with respect to items in sections B, C, D, F, and item G as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">Petition granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-20\"> Cicatrization is \u201cA healing process which leaves a scar or cicatrix.\u201d Dorland, the American Illustrated Medical Dictionary (18th ed. 1938; Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (14th rev. ed. 1939).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-20\"> My associates (Judges Denman and Stephens) speak of \u201cThe first order complained of,\u201d thus implying that two or more orders are under review.
