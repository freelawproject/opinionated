The only question is whether the oath was \u201cfraudulently made.\u201d We would be inclined to say no, if this were a case of first impression; as the bankrupt had no assets, the omission of the claims of his relatives could not have been designed to prefer them, and it is difficult to perceive any fraudulent purpose, either in those omissions or the failure to include the claim for taxes. Perhaps the omission of the insurance agent\u2019s claim shows a fraudulent purpose. But we need not consider that question. For we bow to the precedents which, in practical effect, have read the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d out of the statute by the use of the phrase, \u201can intentional untruth in a matter material to the issue which is itself material.\u201d In re Slocum, 2 Cir., 22 F.2d 282, 285; In re Zoffer, 2 Cir., 211 F. 936; In re Marshall, 2 Cir., 47 F.2d 209. Under those authorities it is enough that the false oath here was knowingly made.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiya\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
