The District Court, on conflicting evidence, adjudged that the grantor was of sound mind and the deed valid.</p>\n<p id=\"ALV\">A few minutes before the trial appellant\u2019s counsel learned that one of her witnesses, Marie Ryan, was ill and unable to testify. Expecting to produce this witness on the following day, counsel answered ready and went to trial; but Ryan, as it turned out, was not able to appear at any time during the trial. The court refused to grant a continuance for the purpose of taking her deposition. The question is whether this was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1\">Appellant told the court nothing about the nature of Ryan\u2019s probable testimony except that it would be \u201cvery important\u201d and would be \u201calong the line of. what Mollie testified to * * * and additional things.\u201d The testimony of the witness Mollie Maxwell had been along at least two divergent lines, one favorable and one unfavorable to the grantor\u2019s sanity. She had testified to eccentricities, some of them gross, on the part of the grantor, who was her employer. She had also testified: \u201cI can\u2019t say that she was crazy, but her mind was bad. If she had been crazy I wouldn\u2019t have been working for her; but her mind was bad, very bad.\u201d The court found as facts that the grantor \u201ceschewed baths\u201d and had \u201ccertain eccentricities.\u201d Ryan\u2019s cumulative testimony, and likewise the \u201cadditional things\u201d which counsel had in mind but did not disclose, might or might not have been important. If they would in fact have been important, counsel should have made this clear by a definite offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"AcC\">On the other hand, a judge is no mere umpire. '\u201cIt is the recognized function of a trial judge to see that facts are clearly and fully developed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He necessarily has a wide discretion in the matter. We think it would have been better practice for the court either to satisfy itself, by questioning counsel, that Ryan\u2019s testimony would not affect the result of the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>or to grant a brief continuance so that appellant might take her deposition. But we are not prepared to rule that the court\u2019s failure to do either of these things was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ALj\"> Cf.
