This order denied a previously en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tered order discharging the debtor, who had been adjudged bankrupt, from his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The bankrupt, John Zidek, Jr., filed a petition in bankruptcy in the U. S. District Court, January 7, 1924, and on the 11th of that month was adjudged a bankrupt. In June of that year, he filed a petition for discharge, and on March 26, 1928, an order of discharge was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Appellant has since instituted various proceedings for the purpose of revoking and setting aside said order of discharge. One of his petitions was referred to a special master in 1929, and a hearing was had, and a report was filed, which was approved by the District Court. That order refused to vacate the order of discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">It appears to us from an examination of the record, which disclosed the foregoing facts, that the appeal herein is wholly without merit and is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Judgment of District Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
