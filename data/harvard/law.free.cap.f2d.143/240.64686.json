Indeed, he does not ask us to unravel what was then done; on the contrary, as we understand it, he rests his case upon his change of name at the time of his naturalization, when apparently by order of the court he became no longer \u201cMumm von Schwarzenstein,\u201d but merely \u201cMumm.\u201d The record does not explicitly show that his name was then changed in that way; but we so read his affidavit, and it seems to be an evitable inference from his argument. He complains that, having now become \u201cMumm,\u201d the decree operates to forbid all use of the only name by which he is, or lawfully can be, known. This, he says, the law will not do.; for, although courts will often limit the use o.f one\u2019s surname by imposing upon-it suffixes, apd the like, they never absolutely forbid it. Donnell v. Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co., 208 U.S. 267, 28 S.Ct. 288, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>52 L.Ed. 481; Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co. v. Hall's Safe Co., 208 U.S. 554, 28 S.Ct. 350, 52 L.Ed. 616; Waterman Co. v. Modern Pen Co., 235 U.S. 88, 35 S.Ct. 91, 59 L.Ed. 42; John T. Lloyd Laboratories, Inc., v. Lloyd Bros. Pharmacists Inc., 6 Cir., 131 F.2d 703, 707. We will assume for argument the correctness of this position, if Mumra\u2019s name had originally been \u201cMumm\u201d; but it was ncc, and, furthermore, when he was naturalized, he did not have to drop \u201cvon Schwarzenstein.\u201d It is true that \u201cvon Schwarzenstein\u201d had originally been a \u201chereditary title,\u201d and possibly also an \u201corder of nobility,\u201d both of which Mumm would have been compelled to renounce, had he still possessed them. \u00a7 735(c), Title 8 U.S.C.A. But Judge Woolsey found (Finding 13) that the constitution of the Weimar Republic (\u201cProvision 109\u201d) had abolished \u201cpublic privileges, or disadvantages of birth, or status\u201d and that \u201cmarks of nobility are considered only as part of the name.\u201d Again (Finding 62), that any distinction \u201cbetween the family name and the so-called \u2018mark of nobility\u2019 * * * was obliterated by the provisions of the Weimar Constitution,\u201d and that the German name of the Mumm family was \u201cMumm von Schwarzenstein.\u201d We do not imply that the renunciation of a \u201chereditary title\u201d or an \u201corder of nobility\u201d must inevitably involve the abandonment of the name by which an alien has been known. There are of course thousands of persons in this country who have family names, beginning \u201cvon,\u201d \u201cvan,\u201d \u201cde\u201d or \u201cdi\u201d; and many of these originated as \u201chereditary titles.\u201d An English peer would have to renounce his title to be naturalized, but if he went in the peerage by his family stirname, he would not have to adopt another. To renounce the \u201ctitle,\u201d or the \u201corder,\u201d it can scarcely be necessary always to renounce the name which went with it. Be that as it may, Mumm had no \u201ctitle\u201d or \u201corder\u201d to renounce, and, as we have said, he was free to keep \u201cvon Schwarzenstein\u201d as part of his name, if he had wished.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"> Those considerations which have at times moved courts to refuse altogether to prohibit all use of a family surname, and to limit relief to circumscribing it, do not extend to adopted names. No one chooses the name which his parents give him; it is imposed upon him willy-nilly; and before he has had any chance to change it, those associations which identify him have clustered about it. To prevent all use of it is to take away his identity; without it he cannot make known who he is to those who may wish to deal with him; and that is so grievous an injury that courts will avoid imposing it, if they possibly can. But when one abandons his family name, and chooses another for his convenience, it is reasonable to charge him with whatever prejudice to others that may cause; certainly when, as here, he knows what that prejudice will be. England v. New York Pub. Co., 8 Daly, N.Y., 375, is not relevant, for Leslie, the father had actually induced Leslie, the son, to adopt the name; but Pinet v. Maison Pinet, 1898, 1 Ch. 179, decides the point directly. And indeed, it would end all protection to trade names, if all one had to do in order to pirate them, was to change one\u2019s own name to that of one\u2019s intended victim, or to one near enough to his to be no more than a deceptive variant.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
