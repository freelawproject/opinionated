We are not concerned with an impeachment of the jury\u2019s verdict, nor with the mechanics by which the verdict was reached, but only with the propriety of an instruction by the Court. Quotient verdicts have been generally denominated \u201cgambling verdicts\u201d and this is an improper method to be used by jurors in arriving at a verdict. The instruction given in the present case constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
