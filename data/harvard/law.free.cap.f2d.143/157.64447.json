The income was to be divided between his widow and his sons. After the widow\u2019s death the income was to be paid to the sons for twenty-one years and the trust was then to terminate. Each son was given unrestricted power to appoint his share by will. On failure of a son to appoint, his share was to go to his issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AlF9\">The widow of Arthur Jeffrey Parsons died in 1934 and their son Jeffrey Parsons in <em>1942. </em>Jeffrey undertook in his will to exercise his power of appointment under his father\u2019s will. He provided for the creation of a trust which was to include the interests covered by the power. The income of this trust was to be divided between his widow and his three daughters. The widow was to have three-quarters of the income unless she remarried. Upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>death of the widow, the income was to be paid to the daughters until they reached the age of twenty-five. There were other contingent provisions which we need not notice in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Appellees, the executors and trustees under the will of Arthur Jeffrey Parsons, asked the court for instructions on the question, among others, whether Jeffrey Parsons had validly exercised his power of appointment. The court held that his attempted exercise of the power was void because it violated the rule against perpetuities and restraints on alienation, and that his share of his father\u2019s estate should therefore be distributed to his daughters in accordance with his father\u2019s will. This appeal is brought by the executors and trustees under the will of Jeffrey Parsons and by possible beneficiaries under that will.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The District Court rightly computed the period of \u201clives in being and twenty-one years thereafter,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during which the absolute power of alienation may be suspended, from the death of the donor of the power of appointment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jeffrey\u2019s widow was a \u201clife in being\u201d when the donor, Arthur Jeffrey Parsons, died. But Jeffrey\u2019s attempted exercise of his power of appointment was invalid because his daughters were not to take their shares outright until they reached the age of twenty-five and this might be more than twenty-one years after his widow\u2019s death. It is true that facts which exist at the death of the donee may be considered in determining whether absolute ownership is to vest during lives in being, plus twenty-one years, from the death of the donor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> . But that principle does not save the appointment in this case, for Jeffrey\u2019s youngest daughter, born in 1940, would not have reached the age of twenty-five and taken her share within twenty-one years of her mother\u2019s death if her mother had died before 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> Since Jeffrey had no power to appoint otherwise than by will, his attempt to \u201cassign\u201d a part of his interest by a contract was clearly invalid. The re\u2018maining question is whether the life interest of Jeffrey\u2019s widow in the trust fund can be separated from the other provisions of his will and thereby validated. We agree with the District Court that the interests which the will attempted to create were too intimately connected to be severable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We cannot say that Jeffrey would have given his widow the interest which he undertook to give her if he had known that the provision which he undertook to make for his daughters would be held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"> D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 45 \u2014 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\"> Minot v.
