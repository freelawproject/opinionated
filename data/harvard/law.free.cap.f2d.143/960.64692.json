In this proceeding the petitioner, who is the owner of 9,000 shares of common stock of Electric Bond &amp; Share Company, was granted the privilege of limited participation pursuant to the Commission\u2019s rules. On May 19, 1944 this privilege was revoked by the trial examiner. Mr. Okin appealed forthwith to the Commission and on May 23d it made the three \u201corders\u201d in question. They are in the form of letters addressed to Okin in reply to letters written by him to the Commission. They deny a motion that the Commission overrule the trial examiner\u2019s revocation of Okin\u2019s privilege of limited participation; a motion that the hearing in progress before the trial examiner be continued for one week from May 22d; and a motion that the trial examiner be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">The \u201corders\u201d challenged by Okin\u2019s petition are interlocutory. This is obviously so as to the refusals to remove the trial examiner and to grant a continuance of the hearing. Only final orders of the Commission are subject to review. Jones v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2 Cir., 79 F.2d 617, 619; cf. Federal Power Commission v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 304 U.S. 375, 385, 58 S.Ct. 963, 82 L Ed. 1408. Refusal to overrule the revocation of Okin\u2019s limited participation is likewise not reviewable. Whether a person shall be permitted to participate in the proceedings \u201cin the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers\u201d is discretionary with the Commission. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79s; Rule XVII(g) of the Commission\u2019s Rules; cf. Alston Coal Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 10 Cir., 137 F.2d 740, 742. Refusal of such participation is like an order denying intervention in an action where intervention is not a matter of right. Such an order is not appealable. City of New York v. Consolidated Gas Co., 253 U.S. 219, 40 S.Ct. 511, 64 L.Ed. 870; United States v. California Co-op. Canneries, 279 U.S. 553, 556, 49 S.Ct. 423, 73 L.Ed. 838. Since the challenged orders are not subject to review, we have no power to stay them under section 24(b). 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79x(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">Petitioner\u2019s motion is denied; respondent\u2019s motion is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
