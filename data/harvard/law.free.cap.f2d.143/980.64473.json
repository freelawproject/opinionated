R. Fanselow (No. 2,257,373, issued September 30, 1941) for interference purposes, is for a method and apparatus for coating sheet material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-26\">It will be observed that appellants\u2019 reissue application was filed more than one and one-half years after their patent issued, and approximately ten months after the issuance of the Fanselow patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-27\">The claim reads: \u201c10. The method of coating a sheet which comprises maintaining a difference of pressure on opposite sides of a barrier having a slot therein, propelling a web, having less thickness than the width of the slot through said slot from the zone of inferior pressure into the zone of superior pressure, maintaining one surface of said web in contact with said barrier at one side of said slot so as to prevent transverse vibratory movement of said web as it passes through said slot, and applying liquid coating material to the other surface of said web prior to its passage through said slot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-29\">The references are: Lebel, 1,980,923, Nov. 13, 1934; MacDonald, 2,135,406, Nov. 1, 1938; Terry, 2,139,628, Dec. 6, 1938; Fanselow, 2,257,373, Sept. 30, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-31\">Appellants disclose in their reissue application a process and an apparatus for coating a moving web of sheet material. In their process, the web of sheet material is first passed between two rollers, one of which applies a coating composition to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>side of the material. The web of sheet material passes from those two rollers between two other rollers which are spaced apart and around one of the two latter rollers, which is referred to as a \u201csupporting roller,\u201d with the uncoated side of the web contacting the supporting roller. The Toller opposite the supporting roller moves in a direction counter to that of the moving web. The roller opposite the supporting roller is a substantial part of a housing \u25a0which forms an air chamber in which air is maintained under pressure. Forming a portion of the top of the hotising is a '\u201cconvexly curved lip portion * * * [or .shield] which is spaced from the surface of the roller\u201d which forms a part of the housing \u201cto provide an air outlet [or slot] from\u201d the air chamber. The air from the air chamber is forced downwardly \u25a0through the slot into the space between the two rollers and onto the composition coating on the web of sheet material in a direction counter to that of the moving web of sheet material. The purpose of bringing the coated side of the web into contact with the air moving in a direction counter to that in which the web is moving is to smooth the freshly applied layer of composition coating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">It was the contention of counsel for appellants before the tribunals of the Patent Office, and it is their contention here, that the space between the rollers last referred to is the slot called for in the claim, and that as the air is forced downwardly over the coating material, the process defined in appellants\u2019 reissue application conforms to the first part of the rejected claim, that is, \u201cmaintaining a difference of pressure \u25a0on opposite sides of a barrier having a slot therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">In other words, as we understand counsel for appellants, it is their contention that the barrier referred to in appellants\u2019 application consists not only of the air chamber, but also the supporting roller.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">The patent to Fanselow, in which the appealed claim originated, discloses a sheet-coating process and an apparatus therefor. In the patentee\u2019s process a web of sheet material is also coated on one side. The coated material, with the coated side exposed, passes around a roller which forms a part of the wall of a vacuum chamber. The top of the vacuum chamber includes a shoe member which is spaced from the roller to form a slot through which the coated sheet of material passes. As the web of sheet material passes through the slot, the air from the zone of superior pressure (atmospheric pressure) immediately above the shoe of the vacuum chamber rushes into the zone of inferior pressure (the vacuum chamber) and passes over the coating on the web of sheet material in a direction counter to that in which the material is moving, thereby smoothing the coating material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">The tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that appellants could not make claim 10 because they did not disclose in their application a method of coating a web of sheet material by \u201cmaintaining a difference of pressure on opposite sides of a barrier having a slot therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">It is obvious from appellants\u2019 disclosure that the only slot in a barrier which conforms to the slot in the Fanselow patent is the space between the curved shield portion which forms a part of the top portion of the pressure chamber and the roller which also forms a part of the chamber. Obviously, appellants\u2019 method would not be operative if that slot was to be considered as the one referred to in the claim. The space between the supporting roller and the roller which forms a part of the pressure chamber in appellants\u2019 disclosure is not a slot in a barrier as that term is used in claim 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">Counsel for appellants take exception to the statement in the board\u2019s original decision that \u201cthe only element of applicants\u2019 apparatus that could be called a \u2018barrier\u2019 is element C [the air pressure chamber] in which case the paper web obviously does not go through the slot in the barrier,\u201d and state that just the opposite is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">We quote from appellants\u2019 application where it is stated that \u201cthe web is conducted past an air-stream directed through a narrow path or channel <em>bounded on one side by the moving web </em>[which is carried by the supporting roller] <em>and on the other side by a confining member\u201d </em>which obviously is the air pressure chamber. (Italics not quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">We are of opinion that appellants do not disclose in their- application a barrier having a slot therein through which a web of sheet material is passed, as called for by claim 10, and that appellants are not entitled to make that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>For the reasons stated, it is unnecessary that we consider the other references of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
