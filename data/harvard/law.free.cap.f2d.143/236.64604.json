The complaint alleged that the appellee, Porto Rico Railway Light &amp; Power Co., was engaged in the production, distribution and sale of electric power and energy used by plants in the production of goods for interstate commerce, and that appellant was employed by appellee as chauffeur to its general manager to drive him to conferences, hearings, inspections of plants and to deliver documents and run errands for the manager and that such work was \u201cnecessary and indispensable for the regular and uninterrupted production, distribution and sale of electric energy\u201d used for the production of goods for interstate commerce. In dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, the lower court cited and relied on A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 1942, 316 U.S. 517, 62 S.Ct. 1116, 86 L.Ed. 1638, and McLeod v. Threlkeld, 1943, 319 U.S. 491, 63 S.Ct. 1248, 87 L.Ed. 1538.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">Section 6 of the Act provides that an employer must pay prescribed minimum wages \u201cto each of his employees who is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d and \u00a7 7 requires overtime compensation for such employees. The applicable provision here is \u201cengaged in the production of goods for commerce\u201d not \u201cengaged in comerce.\u201d As defined in \u00a7 3(j) \u201can employee shall be deemed to have been engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed in * * * any process or occupation necessary to the production thereof, in any Stale.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McLeod v. Threlkeld, supra, on the other hand, was concerned with the phrase \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d and should not have been relied upon by the trial court. \u201cMcLeod was not engaged in the production of goods for commerce. His duties as cook and caretaker for maintenance-of-way men on a railroad lie completely outside that clause. Our question is whether he was \u2018engaged in commerce.\u2019 \u201d 319 U.S. at page 493, 63 S.Ct. at page 1250, 87 L.Ed. 1538. As pointed out in the dissenting opinion, \u201cIf the applicable provision were \u2018engaged in the production of goods for commerce\u2019 instead of \u2018engaged in commerce\u2019, our decisions make it clear that employees such as the janitor and the shop tender and probably petitioner would be within the Act\u201d. 319 U.S. at page 501, 63 S.Ct. at page 1253, 87 L.Ed. 1538. The coverage of the clause \u201cengaged in the production of goods for commerce\u201d is thus broader than that of \u201cengaged in commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>We think it clear that some of the employees of appellee are covered by the Act. In-A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v.-Walling, supra, the Supreme Court held within the Act the electrician of a loft building, who maintained the- system which furnished the tenants with light and power to manufacture goods for interstate commerce. The court said, \u201cwithout light and heat and power the tenants could not engage, as they do, in the production of goods for interstate commerce. The maintenance of a safe, habitable building is indispensable to that activity.\u201d 316 U.S. at page 524, 62 S. Ct. at page 1120, 86 L.Ed. 1638. Porters and watchmen for the building were also held within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In holding within the Act a night watchman for a manufacturing plant which shipped a substantial portion of its products in interstate commerce, the Supreme Court said that the fact that the man \u201chad no other duties to perform in addition to his regular duties as a night watchman; that he engaged in no manual activities connected with production; that he was not specially employed to protect goods assembled for manufacture or awaiting shipment in interstate commerce; and that no goods were manufactured during the hours he was on guard\u201d could not support-the conclusion of the Mississippi Supreme Court, 194 Miss. 573, 11 So.2d 912, that the watchman was not \u201cnecessary to the production [of goods].\u201d Walton v. Southern Package Corporation, 1944, 320 U.S. 540, 542, 64 S.Ct. 320, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Since the criterion of whether the work of a particular employee is so closely connected with the process of production for commerce as to make his occupation \u201cnecessary to the production of goods for commerce\u201d is one of degree (A. B. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra, 316 U.S. at page 526, 62 S.Ct. at page 1121, 86 L.Ed. 1638), it is necessary in a borderline case such as this one that the court have before it detailed pertinent facts as' to the employer\u2019s business and the employee\u2019s duties before deciding the question of coverage. As was pointed out by the Eighth Circuit: \u201cUnder the Fair Labor Standards Act * * * a complaint ought not to be dismissed for informality or insufficiency of statement, unless it appears to a certainty that, under any state of facts which may be proved in support of the asserted claim, no basic right of action can possibly exist. * * * \u201d Stratton v. Farmers Produce Co., 8 Cir., 1943, 134 F. 2d 825, 827. Musteen v. Johnson, 8 Cir., 1943, 133 F.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause is remanded, with directions to reinstate the complaint, and for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-16\"> \u201cSec. 3.
