He then sued the Secretary in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment, a writ directing the Secretary to show cause, and an order directing him to execute and deliver leases for the lands described in his applications. Appellee\u2019s motion for a summary judgment was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"AInE\">The court rested its rejection of the prayer for coercive relief upon the decision of the Supreme Court in United States ex rel. McLennan v. Wilbur<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and upon the decision of this court in Dunn v. Ickes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It rejected the prayer for declaratory relief Upon the authority of our decision in Doehler Metal Furniture Co., Inc. v. Warren.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant contends that these cases are not conclusive, on the theory that (1) the McLennan case was \u201cbased not upon the law but upon an overproduction of oil and an assertion by the court that the Secretary of the Interior was acting in the public interest in conserving the oil lands,\u201d and further, that a subsequent amendment to Section 13 of the Mineral Leasing Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> deprived appellee of any dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>cretion in the granting of leases; (2) the Dunn case is not in point for there the land in dispute had been already patented, was not open for leasing and the applicant was not entitled to a lease; (3) the Doehler case is not in point because appellee does not possess the discretion which he claims under the Act. We agree with the District Court that these cases are controlling and that appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The considerations of public policy which must be balanced in determining whether and when the public bounty shall be dispensed, with respect to public lands and minerals,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are just as important today as they were when the McLennan- case was decided and require today, as much as then, the exercise of discretion by the Secretary. It was not the intention of Congress, in amending the earlier Act, to deprive the Secretary of discretion, except as concerned a very limited group of applications filed ninety days prior to the effective date of the amendment (August 21, 1935); in other words, two years prior to appiellant\u2019s applications. The argument now made by appellant in this respect was rejected in the case of United States ex rel. Roughton v. Ickes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> upon which our later decision in Dunn v. Ickes was bottomed. No useful purpose would be served by elaborating, again, the frequently stated rule that the discretion of an executive officer cannot be controlled by judicial coercion ;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> especially where it involves the disposition of public lands.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">Appellant\u2019s incorrect assumption that the Secretary lacked discretion in the premises constitutes, also, the unstable foundation of his prayer for declaratory relief; which falls, therefore, along with his prayer for coercive relief. Lacking jurisdiction of his suit for direct relief, the court did not acquire jurisdiction, by virtue of the declaratory judgment statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to give, indirectly, relief which it could not give dire.ctly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">It is not necessary, in view of our decision upon the foregoing points, to consider appellant\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"AV-V\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Axg\"> 283 U.S. 414, 51 S.Ct. 502, 75 L.Ed. 1148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AAvJ\"> 72 App.D.C. 325, 115 F.2d 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AAd\"> 76 U.S.App. 60, 129 F.2d 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Aaj\"> 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 221 note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> Ickes v.
