In 1915 plaintiff first registered \u201cHorlick\u2019s,\u201d the word appearing in outlined block letters printed in an arc, for \u201cprepared milk products, food products containing extract of malt, barley and wheat flour and dry extract of malt,\u201d and has since renewed it. In 1940, defendant registered the word \u201cHorlick\u201d in solid block letters printed in a straight line, as a trade-mark for \u201cdog, cat, horse, and cattle foods,\u201d and also \u201cHorlick of Horlicksville\u201d for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-19\">Horlick is defendant\u2019s family name, and also the family name of the founder of plaintiff\u2019s business. Both defendant and his ancestors resided at Horlicksville, located in Racine County a short distance beyond the present city limits of Racine; and plaintiff has for many years abbreviated its name and address to \u201cHorlick\u2014 Racine, U.S.A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">Defendant placed on the market a product in pellet form called \u201cHorlick Dog Food.\u201d The package was about 7%\" high by 6\" wide and had a depth of less than 2\u201d. The word \u201cHorlick,\u201d printed in a straight line in red block letters 1%\" high, outlined in black, appeared prominently on both the front and reverse sides of the package. A drawing of a dog appeared thereunder, which drawing was 3J\u00bf\u00a1\" in height. Underneath the dog\u2019s head appeared the words, \u201cDog Food,\u201d on separate lines in letters 1\" high. At the very bottom appeared the line, \u201cManufactured by Horlick of Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d none of the letters of which exceed %\" in height. On the top and bottom flaps of the package, the word \u201cHorlick\u201d appeared in red block letters of the same size and style as on the front and reverse sides of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-21\">Plaintiff sells its malted milk in packages and bottles of different sizes and shapes. Its package most nearly the size of defendant\u2019s package is 9\" in height, each of the four sides of which are 6\" in width. On the front and reverse sides, printed in an arc in white letters on a dark blue background, appear: Horlick\u2019s (1\" block letters), The Original (small red letters), Malted Milk (%\" block letters), and a drawing of three cows is immediately below. \u201cThe Great American Food Drink for All Ages\u201d is printed in blue letters on the next two lines. At the bottom the words, \u201cManufactured by Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk Corporation, Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d are printed over the word \u201cHorlick\u2019s\u201d appearing in red script in a slanting line.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-23\">There was no direct competition between defendant\u2019s business and plaintiff\u2019s business, and no one purchased Horlick Dog Food believing that it was malted milk or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>food for human consumption. The only-similarity between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s packages was the name \u201cHorlick\u2019s\u201d and \u201cHorlick,\u201d the printing of which was even in a different style, size and color. In spite of this, purchasers familiar with Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk, upon seeing the defendant\u2019s package, concluded that defendant\u2019s dog food was manufactured and sold by the plaintiff. Many witnesses testified that they thought defendant\u2019s product was made by the plaintiff. (For a slightly more detailed statement of the facts, see 50 F. Supp. 417.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Because he found that the two things principally contributing to this reaction were the uncommon name \u201cHorlick\" known widely in connection with malted milk and the phrase \u201cHorlick of Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d the District Court entered a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">(a) Using the name \u201cHorlick\u201d on his packages or in any manner in connection with the manufacture and sale of dog food without using in association therewith some other word or words which shall distinguish his product from plaintiff\u2019s product, which word or words shall be printed in type of [at] least one-half the size of the type used in printing the name \u201cHorlick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">(b) Using the phrase \u201cManufactured by Horlick of Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d without using in connection therewith the initials, word or words as set forth in (a) above.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Feeling that the District Court did not grant it the full relief to which it is entitled, plaintiff appeals from that portion of the decree permitting defendant (1) to use the name \u201cHorlick\u201d as a brand-name or designation for his product, and (2) to use in connection with the name \u201cHorlick\u201d in indicating the manufacturer some distinguishing word or words displayed in type only half the size of the name \u201cHorlick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant should be required to label his product \u201cXYZ Dog Food,\u201d and to state thereon \u201cManufactured by Charles Horlick, Racine, Wisconsin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Plaintiff contends that if the name \u201cCharles Horlick\u201d is used, defendant will infringe plaintiff\u2019s registered trade-mark, \u201cHorlick\u2019s.\u201d The trade-mark statute, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96, prohibits another person from affixing a colorably imitative trademark to \u201c * * * merchandise of substantially the same descriptive properties * * The District Court concluded that malted milk powder intended for human consumption and pellets intended for dog food were not merchandise of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">Plaintiff makes two arguments for its view that the products here in question are of substantially the same descriptive properties. The first argument is that the products are both animal foods since man is an animal, and since they are both species of the same genus or class, they must necessarily be within the terms of the statute. Thus, quoting from plaintiff\u2019s brief, \u201cIf Horlick\u2019s suggests milk or malted milk, well, dogs eat or drink milk when they can get it, and puppies certainly do.\u201d Plaintiff points further to the letters which it has received from the public reporting the satisfactory results from feeding Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk to their dogs, cats, and other animals. Moreover, Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk contains malt and milk and Horlick Dog Food contains malt flour and dried skim milk. Notwithstanding these points of similarity, there is a clear, rational, and obvious distinction between the two products which leads us to conclude that they are not different species of the same class, but rather two different classes. The mere fact that they contain common ingredients does not make them of the same class. The evidence shows that the products of the two parties appeal to entirely different markets. Plaintiff\u2019s products are advertised exclusively for human beings, while defendant makes a food exclusively for dogs. The Commissioner of Patents, upon hearing an appeal from the Examiner of Interferences, involving the opposition of the manufacturer of \u201cHexite\u201d used on dog, poultry and other animal foods to the registration of the word \u201cHexies\u201d for use on crackers for human consumption, concluded that they were not goods of the same descriptive properties. Kellogg Company v. Bremner Bros., 515 Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office 837, 45 U. S. P. Q. 446. Based on physical properties, then, the goods are not of the same class, so as. to be within the terms off the statute. Cf. Time, Inc. v. Viobin Corp., D.C., 40 F.Supp. 249, 250, 251, affirmed 7 Cir. 128 F.2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">Plaintiff\u2019s second argument is that there is statutory infringement because defendant\u2019s use of \u201cHorlick\u201d indicates that plaintiff makes it, and the goods are, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fore, of the same descriptive properties. In other words, plaintiff argues that the statute should be interpreted to mean that the goods are of the same descriptive properties whenever a common mark suggests a common origin. It would unduly prolong this opinion to discuss the cases adhering to this view, and would serve no useful purpose inasmuch as this court gave thorough consideration to substantially the same question in Philco Corporation v. Phillips Mfg. Co, 7 Cir, 133 F.2d 663, 148 A.L.R. 125. We concluded there that by enacting \u00a7 16 of the Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96, Congress intended federal courts to enjoin the use of a similar trade-mark only on goods which competed fairly directly with the plaintiff\u2019s goods. Here, plaintiff\u2019s malted milk for humans is not similar enough to defendant\u2019s dog food to bring this case within the statute, for the products are too far from being directly competitive. Cf. Beech-Nut Packing Co. v. P. Lorillard Co, 3 Cir, 7 F.2d 967. The outer limit of protection was reached in California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Windsor Beverages, 7 Cir, 118 F.2d 149, and monopoly arising from trade-mark will not be pushed farther into the realm of non-competing products in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The further and conclusive answer to this argument is, that when defendant\u2019s packages and labels have been amended in conformance with the District Court\u2019s decree, with the modifications hereinafter suggested, the source of defendant\u2019s product will be so clear that anyone who still would be confused would be careless to a degree that the law has no duty to protect. Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, Inc, 7 Cir, 134 F.2d 429. Much of the force of plaintiff\u2019s argument is vitiated by the fact that it argues from a false premise, i. e, it assumes that defendant may label his packages \u201cHorlick,\u201d when in truth and in fact the decree requires defendant to use words differentiating his product from plaintiff\u2019s. True, the manner and mode of such differentiation is not specified as clearly as it might be, but as we interpret the decree, it is affirmatively required. For purposes of brevity, the method of distinguishing the two products will be considered at the close of a discussion of the unfair competition aspect of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The District Court found that although defendant had not been guilty of actual fraudulent intent to pass off his goods as those made by the plaintiff, he had engaged in unfair competition. Hence the court entered the decree here in question. Defendant has not filed a cross-appeal, and does not contend that the decree is wrong in restraining him to the extent that it does. Instead, defendant seeks only to uphold his right to use his name in the manner found permissible by the District Court. Since that court expressly found that there was no confusion in products, the issue is narrowed to whether the decree is adequate to prevent confusion of source. Since this is the major issue in this case, the intermingled claims of trade-mark infringement and unfair competition may be considered together. Plaintiff argues from both, and it has often been said that the former is but a branch of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Plaintiff contends that defendant should be prohibited from making use of the name \u201cHorlick\u201d to designate his product. We cannot agree, because the Supreme Court has ruled that a man may use his own name reasonably and honestly for a legitimate purpose in his own business, Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict, 198 U.S. 118, 25 S.Ct. 609, 49 L.Ed. 972; Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Company v. Hall\u2019s Safe Company, 208 U. S. 554, 28 S.Ct. 350, 52 L.Ed. 616, and that the first user, in choosing a family name for his business, assumes the risk of others of the same name using such name fairly in their own business, Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer, 139 U.S. 540, 11 S.Ct. 625, 35 L.Ed. 247. Nor has L. E. Waterman Co. v. Modern Pen Co., 235 U.S. 88, 35 S.Ct. 91, 59 L.Ed. 142, abrogated the rules so laid down. On the contrary, it emphasizes the principle that in cases concerned with a person\u2019s use of his own surname, the power of the court is properly directed towards the correcting of an abuse of the right to use a personal name rather than the denial of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Absolute restraint of the defendant from using his own name in certain ways may be necessary to prevent confusion in some instances where there is bad faith, Vick Medicine Co. v. Vick Chemical Co., 5 Cir., 11 F.2d 33; De Nobili Cigar Co. v. Nobile Cigar Co., 1 Cir., 56 F.2d 324, for the reason that a man may not use it for the purpose of stealing the good will of another\u2019s business. But defendant did not deliberately intend to steal anything in the case at bar. He made use of his own name in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>faith, thinking the ways in which he used it were honesf and fair. There was no deception or misrepresentation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"> In the cases plaintiff cites,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the products were in direct competition, whereas here they are not. The secondary meaning which plaintiff\u2019s name had achieved related to malted .milk, not dog food. Moreover, the marks here are not identical. As modified by the decree of the District Court, they are different. Even as unmodified, plaintiff\u2019s name is in the possessive whereas defendant\u2019s is in the nominative, and such a small difference is not wholly without significance. Cf. Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk Corporation v. Horlick\u2019s Inc., 9 Cir., 59 F.2d 13. Plaintiff\u2019s name is printed in an arc, whereas defendant\u2019s is printed in a straight line. In plaintiff\u2019s authorities,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there was often substantial similarity of one or more of the following features of the mark: style, shape, size, format, color; whereas here there is no such similarity between plaintiff\u2019s mark and defendant\u2019s mark. Defendant uses a large cut of a dog on its label, whereas plaintiff uses three small cows. Such differences may properly be considered as bearing upon the likelihood of confusion after defendant\u2019s mark has been amended in conformance- with the decree which will be entered. Kellogg Company v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Furthermore, the interest plaintiff asks us to protect is very largely speculative, contingent, and future, because plaintiff is not in the business of making dog food and there is no showing that it ever will be. Thus plaintiff is trying to preempt the name Horlick in many of its possible permutations and combinations in a market which it may never choose to exploit. It has been said that advertising is a -very special kind of magic, but courts must beware of being bewitched into granting a monopoly covering all businesses upon the theory that the advertiser has \u201cproperty\u201d in the name per'se. The underlying principle, that the first user of a surname used as a trade-mark or trade-name will be protected from-a newcomer who diverts business from the first user by misleading customers who mean to deal with him, must not be obscured. Hence stricter limitation upon the use of a surname is required if the newcomer\u2019s products are directly competitive than when they are not. S. C. Johnson &amp; Son v. Johnson, 2 . Cir., 116 F.2d 427. Plaintiff has not shown that in order to hold or develop its present business it must preserve its identity in the dog food market, and so cannot rely upon its interest in possible Expansion of business into that market as ground for absolutely prohibiting defendant from using his own name, which resembles plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, in the dog food market.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">The obligation resting upon defendant in using his name is not to insure that every purchaser will know that he is the maker, but to use every reasonable means to prevent confusion. Kellogg Company v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 121, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73. Because of all the dissimilarities noted above, and because the decree requires defendant to distinguish his product from plaintiff\u2019s product, we are not persuaded that plaintiff should have the extremely broad decree it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">We conclude that defendant may use his name as a designation for his product. But in order to carry out the District Court\u2019s suggestion (50 F.Supp. 417, 419) that \u201cIf the defendant exercised the reasonable care required, he would have used his own name and address, such as \u2018Manufactured by Charles Horlick, Horlicksville, Racine, R. F. D., Wisconsin\u2019, \u201d and further to eliminate the possibility that purchasers will think defendant\u2019s product is made by plaintiff, the decree will be modified by enjoining the defendant from using the name \u201cHorlick\u201d on his packages and labels except in combination with his first name, \u201cCharles\u201d, in type equally large and conspicuous, and from using the phrase \u201cManufactured by Horlick of Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin.\u201d He shall substitute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>lieu of the last phrase the words, \u201cManufactured by Charles Horlick, Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin.\u201d The words, \u201cManufactured by Charles Horlick, Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d will appear in letters one-half the size of the printing used in the phrase \u201cCharles Horlick\u201d on the face of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">When the modifications herein suggested are carried out, there will be no poaching on the commercial magnetism of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 205, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed 1381, and defendant\u2019s use of his name will be wholly honest, and hence permissible. See Annotation in 47 A.L.R. 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The decree of the District Court will be modified in accordance with this opinion, and as modified it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> Thaddeus Davids Co. v.

The defendant recited at the bottom of his packages in small type, \u201cMANUFACTURED BY HORLICK OF HORLICKSVILLE RACINE, WISCONSIN.\u201d In the same position on the plaintiff\u2019s packages was printed, \u201cMANUFACTURED BY HORLICK\u2019S MALTED MILK CORPORATION, RACINE, WIS., U. S. A.\u201d Across this printing was a large facsimile signature in red ink, \u201cHorlick\u2019s.\u201d By the majority opinion the defendant is required to substitute on the bottom of his packages in lieu of the words above quoted the following: \u201cManufactured by Charles Horlick, Horlicksville, Racine, Wisconsin,\u201d this to appear in letters one-half the size of the printing used in the words \u201cCharles Horlick\u201d on the face of the packages. These are the impositions placed by the majority upon the defendant, although he had committed no wrongful act. He did nothing which he did not have an unquestioned legal right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The plaintiff sued for infringement of its trade-mark. The majority opinion denies such infringement, since the products were not of the same descriptive properties. The plaintiff also sued for unfair competition. The majority opinion states that the defendant had a right to use his own family name in marketing the dog food which he manufactured, so long as he engaged in no deceptive or fraudulent practices. In treating the unfair competition phase of the case, the majority opinion holds that since the products were not in competition the secondary meaning attached to the plaintiff\u2019s name had no application. The majority says that the \u201cproducts * * * appeal to entirely different markets\u201d; that there is \u201cno confusion in products\u201d; that \u201ca man may use his own name reasonably and honestly for a legitimate purpose in his own business\u201d; that the \u201cdefendant did not deliberately intend to steal anything in the case at bar. He made use of his own name in good faith, thinking the ways in which he used it were honest and fair. There was no deception or misrepresentation here.\u201d Indeed, it was the plaintiff who seemed to be the performer of sharp practices and the pirate in the piece. As the majority says, \u201cthe interest plaintiff asks us to protect is very largely speculative, contingent, and future, because plaintiff is not in the business of making dog food and there is no showing that it ever will be. Thus plaintiff is trying to preempt the name Horlick in many of its possible permutations and combinations in a market which it may never choose to exploit.\u201d There was no similarity in the packages. They were no more alike than a dog is like a cow.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Thus, the majority absolves the innocent defendant from all wrongdoing but nontheless imposes certain duties upon him in order to lessen any confusion which might arise in the public\u2019s mind over who manufactures dog food and who manufactures malted milk. As if that made any differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ence. If there is any likelihood of such confusion, it grows out of the situation and not out of any wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant. The defendant is as blameless as the plaintiff. Why should the defendant be required to assume the entire burden of clearing up confusion which no wrongful conduct of his created? The only thing the defendant has done is to use his own name in marketing a non-competitive product, without fraud or deception. Surely courts of equity should not undertake the task of enjoining mere confusion, unconnected with any wrongful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In Brown Chemical Company v. Meyer, 139 U.S. 540, 544, 11 S.Ct. 625, 627, 35 L.Ed. 247, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cA man\u2019s name is his own property, and he has the same right to its use and enjoyment as he has to that of any other species of property. If such use be a reasonable, honest, and fair exercise of such right, he is no more liable for the incidental damage he may do a rival in trade than he would be for injury to his neighbor\u2019s property by the smoke issuing from his chimney, or the fall of his neighbor\u2019s house by reason of necessary excavations upon his own land. These and similar instances are cases of damnum absque injuria.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict, 198 U.S. 118, 140, 25 S.Ct. 609, 614, 49 L.Ed. 972, speaking of the right of one to use his own name, the court said: \u201cHaving the right to that use, courts will not interfere where the only confusion, if any, results from a similarity of the names, and not from the manner of the use. The essence of the wrong in unfair competition consists in the sale of goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another; and if defendant so conducts its business as not to palm off its goods as those of complainant, the action fails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In Canal Company v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 327, 20 L.Ed. 581, the Court said: \u201cPurchasers may be mistaken, but they are not deceived by false representations, and equity will not enjoin against telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In the light of these clear expressions of the Supreme Court, I cannot see how the plaintiff was entitled to any relief, let alone the additional relief which the majority opinion gives it. I would affirm the District Court, since the defendant filed no cross-appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
