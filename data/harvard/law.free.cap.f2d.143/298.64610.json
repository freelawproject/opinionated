HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">This case comes up upon an appeal from a judgment of conviction, entered upon a plea of guilty to counts one, three and four of an indictment for violation of the \u201cTrading With The Enemy Act.\u201d \u00a7 3(a) and \u00a7 16 of 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix. The substance of count one is as follows: Leiner, the accused, \u201con the 22nd day of June, 1942 * * * did trade with another person with reasonable cause to believe that such other person was an enemy of the United States\u201d in that he \u201cdid receive property, to wit, currency in the sum of $50. for the purpose of changing the same from Edward John Kerling with reasonable cause to believe that the said Edward John Kerling was an agent of the Government of the German Reich,\u201d with which the United States was then at war. The third count was exactly like the first, except that it laid a second transaction with Kernng on the twenty-third day of June; the fourth count was also like the first, except that it laid a transaction on June 23rd with one Hedwig Engcmann, whom Leiner had reasonable cause to believe was \u201cconducting and taking part in said trade on behalf of\u201d Kerling. Upon this appeal the points raised are; first that the acts alleged were not a crime under \u00a7 3(a) of the \u201cTrading With The Enemy Act\u201d; second, that the indictment did not allege that Kerling was in fact an agent of the Reich, but only that Leiner had reasonable cause to believe so; and third, that the statute was unconstitutional because it was too vague. At the outset\u00bb we may dispose of the last objection merely by reference to Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 377, 378, 33 S.Ct. 780, 57 L.Ed. 1232; Gorin v. United States, 312 U.S. 19, 27, 28, 61 S.Ct. 429, 85 L.Ed. 488; United States v. Ragen, 314 U.S. 513, 523, 62 S.Ct. 374, 86 L.Ed. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Section 3(a) of the act makes unlawful \u2014 among other things \u2014 \u201ctrade * * with * * * any * * * person, with knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that such * * * person is an enemy\u201d: \u00a7 16 sets the penalties. Section 2 of the act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix \u00a7 2, defines an \u201cenemy\u201d as including an \u201cagent\u201d of \u201cthe government of any nation with which the United States is at war\u201d ; and \u201ctrade\u201d as including to \u201cexchange * * * transfer * * * or receive any form of property,\u201d and as including also \u201cto have any form of * * * commercial communication or intercourse with.\u201d If \u00a7 3(a) was in force, as it was unless the President had licensed the transactions charged in the indictment (which he had authority to do), they were crimes, and the judgment was correct. Thus, the appeal turns upon whether the President had granted such a license, and that depends upon a mass of complicated verbiage, not altogether consistent. Section 5(b) (1) (B) of the act, as amended on December 18, 1941, 50 U.S. C.A.Appendix \u00a7 5(b) (1) (B), gave the President power, among other things, to \u201cprohibit, any * * * transfer * * * or dealing in * * * any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.\u201d On April 10, 1940, the President issued what is known as the \u201cFreezing Order,\u201d (Executive Order No. 8389, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 95 note), by which he prohibited \u2014 except as the Secretary of the Treasury should otherwise authorize\u2014 many transactions, but among them were not those charged in the indictment. Such transactions neither the President nor any delegate of his, ever did prohibit, although the language just quoted from \u00a7 5(b) (1) (B) would have made them unlawful, had he done so. On February 12, 1942, the President delegated to the Secretary all his powers under \u00a7 3(a) and \u00a7 5(b) ; and, although he revoked this order on March 11, 1942, and conferred the same powers upon the Alien Property Custodian, that official in his turn retransferred them back for the time being to the Secretary on March 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">So matters stood on March 18, 1942, when the Secretary of the Treasury promulgated \u201cGeneral Ruling No. 11,\u201d in four sections. Section one provided generally that \u201cno license * * * shall be deemed to authorize any transaction which * * involves any trade or communication with an enemy national.\u201d Section two defined, among other terms, the meaning of \u201ctrade or communication\u201d \u2014 \u00a7 2(d) \u2014 ; section three is irrelevant here; and section four declared that \u201cany transaction prohibited by section 3(a) * * * is licensed thereunder unless such transaction is prohibited pursuant to section 5(b) * * * and not licensed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\u201d This section concluded by a reference to a general license issued by the President on December 13, 1941, which covered \u201cany transaction * * * prohibited by section 3(a) * * * provided * * * that such transaction is authorized by the Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>retary * * * pursuant to Executive Order No. 8389\u201d \u2014 the \u201cFreezing Order.\u201d 'This license did not cover the transactions .at bar, because they were not within the \u201cFreezing Order\u201d ; the Secretary could not have \u201cauthorized\u201d them \u201cpursuant <em>to\u201d </em>that \u25a0order, and never tried to. Thus, they continued to be forbidden by \u00a7 3(a) of the act, unless they were licensed by \u00a7 4 of the General Ruling itself. The Ruling prohibited nothing; \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2 merely invalidated some kinds of existing or future licenses (\u201cNo license * * * shall be deemed to authorize\u201d etc.) ; and \u00a7 4 affirmatively licensed all violations of \u00a7 3(a) of the act with the exception already noted of transactions prohibited \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 5(b)\u201d of the act. Since, as we have seen, the only transactions ever prohibited \u201cpursuant to\u201d that section, were those covered by the \u201cFreezing Order,\u201d and since the \u201cFreezing Order\u201d did not prohibit those charged in the indictment, there can be no question that, if \u00a7 4 of the Ruling be read alone, the indictment did not charge any crime. But that section cannot be read alone. Section 2(d) defined \u201ctrade\u201d so as to include any \u201ctaking,\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d so as to include \u201ccurrency,\u201d (subdivision ii) ; and \u00a7 1 so interpreted, therefore enacted that no license should \u201cbe deemed to authorize any transaction which * * * involves\u201d \u201ctaking * * * currency\u201d from an enemy national. As we have seen, \u00a7 3(a) forbad such a transaction unless licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Thus we have a square conflict between \u00a7 4 of the Ruling and \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2(d) : \u00a7 1 denied any license- to the transaction charged in the indictment; \u00a7 4 granted one. The predominant intent is nevertheless apparent. Section 5(b) of the act was not confined to a time of war; it included also <em>d </em>\u201cperiod of national emergency,\u201d and the transactions which it covered were not confined to transactions with enemies; it gave the President power to impound the credits and money of all aliens \u2014 neutral as well as enemy \u2014 and to prevent their transfer; and that was the purpose of the \u201cFreezing Order.\u201d But when \u00a7 3(a) came into effect, -flagrante bello, all transactions with enemies which were within the \u201cFreezing Order,\u201d fell under an added ban, and the order of December 13, 1941, was to give the Secretary of the Treasury the same power to license them which he had had under the \u201cFreezing Order\u201d; while all those which- were within \u00a7 3(a), but not within the \u201cFreezing Order,'\u201d remained unlicensed. The reference in \u00a7 4 of the Ruling to the order of December 13, 1941, itself goes far to show the limited purpose of the .section as a whole. But there is more. As \u00a7 4 reads, it licenses, as we have said, every violation of \u00a7 3(a) which is not also a violation of the \u201cFreezing Order.\u201d Now, while it is true that \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Ruling include more than what \u00a7 3(a) of the act forbids, nevertheless \u00a7 3(a) is the only section that unconditionally prohibits any \u201ctrading\u201d whatever; and the very name of the act shows that trading with the enemy was its chief concern. On this account alone it is highly improbable that the Secretary intended to license all trading with the enemy except such as the \u201cFreezing Order\u201d prohibited, for that order only touched such transactions as it was thought fitting to deny to neutrals \u2014 there being indeed only neutrals, when it was promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Moreover, so to construe \u00a7 4 would raise insuperable textual difficulties; it would delete the whole of \u00a7 2(d) (ii), except so far as \u00a7 2(d) (ii) coincided with the \u201cFreezing Order\u201d; and it did not coincide at all. The \u201cFreezing Order\u201d covered only \u2014(A and B) \u2014 transfers or payments between banks \u2014 (C)\u2014\u201ctransactions in foreign exchange\u201d \u2014 (D)\u2014the withdrawal of \u201cearmarking\u201d of bullion, currency and the like \u2014 and\u2014(E)\u2014the transfer of stocks and bonds. It was utterly inadequate for the protection of a nation at mortal grips with what then appeared to be the two strongest military powers. On the other hand, \u00a7 2(d) (ii) was cast in adequate terms for just that end; it included every kind of property, and was plainly intended to deny all licenses under \u00a7 3(a) of the act, except as they fell within the \u201cFreezing Order.\u201d For these reasons it seems to us plain that \u00a7 4 of the Ruling meant no more than to remove from the sweeping abolition of all licenses of \u00a7 1, those which the Secretary of the Treasury might issue pursuant to the \u201cFreezing Order.\u201d While indeed that does violence to its terms, it is the only interpretation which avoids making the Ruling as a whole absurd. Moreover, as we have said, it falls in with the mention in \u00a7 4 itself of the order of December 13, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">There remains the question whether the indictment should have charged that Kerling was in fact an \u201cagent\u201d of the German Reich; and not merely that Leiner- thought him to be so. We agree that Congress did not mean to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>make it a crime to trade with a person, not in fact an \u201cenemy,\u201d even though the accused had cause to believe that he was; the statute was aimed at protecting the nation, not at punishing persons, however ill-disposed, who did it no harm. And, indeed, the earlier part of \u00a7 3(a) itself presupposes that the person traded with shall be in fact an enemy; the license is described as \u201cgranted to such person, or to the enemy.\u201d The indictment was therefore faulty. Nevertheless, the purport of the charge was plain enough; it would be silly to suppose that the accused could he misled in his defense because he thought that the prosecution did not mean to charge that Kerling was in fact an \u201cagent\u201d of the Reich. The objection falls within \u00a7 556 of Title 18, U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
