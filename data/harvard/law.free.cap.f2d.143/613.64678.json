Q. 238, reversing the decision, of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences in a trade-mark opposition proceeding.'</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">House-Hold-Pac Corporation, appellee \u2018here, filed an application for the registration, under the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq., of a mark which is described in the decision of the- commissioner as follows:. \u201cThe mark of the application is a composite mark quit\u00e9 elaborate and distinctive in 'design and includes a circular display of the words \u2018The Insured Drink\u2019 on a wide circular band surrounding a large letter \u2018H\u2019 on \u00e1 circular black background, and below this display are the words \u2018House-Hold-Pac\u2019 on a shaded background on which the words \u2018Nationally Advertised\u2019 also -appear, this background being oval- in shape and embracing the lower \u25a0half of the upper circular display. The word \u2018Drink\u2019 and the expressions \u2018Nationally , Advertised\u2019 and \u2018House-Hold-Pac\u2019 arc \u25a0disclaimed.?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ANdY\">Nqhi .Corporation, appellant 'here, opposed appellee\u2019s application, basing its opposition upon its prior use and registration under the 1905 act of the notation \u201cParT-Pak,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">The goods of the respective parties are identical in character,-being nonalcoholic beverages Sold as soft drinks, and syrups and extracts for'making same.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">Appellant\u2019s mark was registered November 24, 1936, and there is no question of it having used the mark prior to any date of \u2018 use claimed by appellee for its mark. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b670-16\">So, in- the. final analysis, the question for determination is whether or not, the mark of appellee so closely resembles the mark of appellant that its use on identical goods would be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-17\">The difference in the conclusions of the tribunals of the Patent Office ; seems to have been predicated largely upon' their respective ideas as to how the goods would normally, be known and ordered by purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-18\">Both the Examiner of Interferences and the commissioner apparently agreed that the terms \u201cPar-T-Pak\u201d and \u201cHouse-HoldPac\u201d are similar in significance, the former (after expressing the view that \u201cHouseHold-Pac,\u201d although disclaimed as descriptive, \u201cis not of such nature as to be without trade-mark significance and that this term constitutes the dominant portion of the mark\u201d) saying: \u201cLikewise the examiner is of the opinion that these terms are very similar in significance. Both terms would seem to indicate that the goods are put up in such type of containers and in such quantities that there is enough for a group of <em>persons; </em>in the case of the op-poser, a party, and in the case of the applicant, a household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-19\">Upon this matter the commissioner said: \u201cI join in the consensus of opinion that the expression \u2018House-Hold-Pac\u2019 in applicant\u2019s mark indicates to purchasers and the public the quantity of soft drink in the container to which the mark is applied $ * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-20\">It was the opinion of the Examiner of Interferences that very few purchasers would call for goods by the name of \u201cH\u201d drink but \u201crather would purchase the goods under the name of \u2018House-Hold-Pac\u2019.\u201d The commissioner expressed the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that \u201cpurchasers desiring to obtain the goods of applicant [appellee here] in particular by referring to applicant\u2019s trademark verbally would ask for the drink with the trade-mark which has a big \u2018H\u2019 in a circle,\u201d and he regarded that feature as having \u201cconsiderably, more trade-mark significance in applicant\u2019s mark than the expression \u2018House-Hold-Pac\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We are not disposed to speculate at any great length upon the question of how appellee\u2019s goods may be called for by purchasers, but we may say that we doubt whether customers wanting a soft drink would order it by the long and somewhat involved designation stated by the commissioner. Our surmise is that most probably the customers would call for either a House-Hold-Pac or a big H. In view of the general knowledge (of which we may take judicial notice) as to how soft drinks are called for, it seems a fair surmise that the purchasers of goods such as are here involved would be disposed to shorten the terms as much as possible. It, would not surprise us to learn that a large number of customers would merely say to the soft drink dispenser, \u201cGive me a pac,\u201d and would not distinguish \u201cpac\u201d from \u201cpak\u201d by spelling the word. Those thirsty for soft drinks very frequently take the \u201cshortest cut\u201d possible in ordering the drink they want.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The commissioner correctly stated: \u201cThe goods are inexpensive, are consumed in use and frequently are purchased by verbal order and without great discrimination and care as to their precise source of origin or as to the precise composition of the trade-mark that is applied thereto. There is more likelihood of confusion with goods of this kind than with goods that are purchased with more discrimination and care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Appellee\u2019s arrangement of \u201cHouse-HoldPac\u201d in the mark it seeks to register is hyphenated in the same manner as appellant\u2019s mark and both are three syllable notations having, in our opinion (as was held below), much the same significance. The last words in each have the same sound when pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> We are unable to escape the conclusion reached by the Examiner of Interferences that the notation \u201cHouse-HoldPac,\u201d although disclaimed, has, and was intended by appellee to have; a trade-mark significance. It will be observed that the commissioner did not, hold to the contrary, but merely expressed the view that the feature of the big \u201cH\u201d in a circle has considerably more significance than the controverted notation. It seems to us that if the notation has any trade-mark significance that fact must be taken into consideration in determining the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">It appears that in 1940 appellee obtained registration of the notation standing alone and somewhat fancifully arranged, under the Act of March 19, 1920, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 121 et seq., for use on the same kind of goods here named, and this fact was regarded by the Examiner of Interferences as an indication that appellee itself regarded it as having trade-mark significance. The commissioner made no reference to that registration in his decision but in its brief before, us appellee has cited it, for just what purpose we are unable to determine. It certainly does not aid its case in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Appellee\u2019s application states that its mark is \u201capplied or affixed to the goods, or to the packages containing the same.\u201d In our opinion, when affixed to packages containing a number of bottles of soft drinks, the notation \u201cHouse-Hold-Pac\u201d would be descriptive, but when applied to the individual bottles it would not be descriptive of the contents of same but would have a distinctive trade-mark significance in that it would indicate origin, and, by reason of its resemblance to \u201cParT-Pak,\u201d purchasers would be likely to attribute such origin to appellant. So far as the notation has trade-mark significance, the fact that it is disclaimed is of no importance, because the disclaimer does nqft prevent the likelihood of confusion. See Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Manufacturing Co., 58 F.2d 457, 19 C.C.P.A.,Patents, 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In view of the similarity in the meaning attaching to the terms, and the resemblances which have been pointed out, it is our conclusion that confusion in trade would probably result from appellee\u2019s use of the mark on the goods described, and that the notice of opposition should have been sustained and the registration denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">As a newcomer in the field any doubt should be resolved against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">The decision of the commissioner is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">\u2022Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
