The Curb\u2019s application asserted that the portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>United States lying east of the Mississippi River constituted its \u201cvicinity\u201d as to the Kentucky <em>4% </em>bonds. NASD contended that that vicinity should be restricted to an extent which we will point out hereafter. Notice was given and a hearing was had before a trial examiner who filed advisory findings which need not be set out here. Exceptions were filed to these findings and argument was had before the Commission. After a review of the record the Commission found<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201c * * * there exists in the vicinity of the Curb Exchange sufficiently widespread public distribution of the bonds and sufficient public trading activity therein to render the extension of unlisted trading privileges on the Curb to the bonds necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Pursuant to the provisions of Section 25(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78y(a) NASD petitioned this court to review the Commission\u2019s order and to set it aside insofar as it approves the Curb\u2019s application to extend unlisted trading privileges to the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The petitioner asserts first that the Commission erred in defining the \u201cvicinity\u201d of the Curb Exchange. Direct evidence of the vicinity or area in which investors regard the Curb as a market being unavailable, the Curb, as it had done in many other cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> introduced evidence showing the location of offices of Curb members and the maintenance of Curb ticker service in certain localities. Assuming, as we must, that trading courses through those channels which are the most open to it, the Commission\u2019s inference that offices of Curb members would not be maintained and that facilities would not exist in localities which do not supply business for the exchange, is a fair one. Conversely, the inference that there is some business where offices and facilities exist, is a supportable one. The Commission also received evidence as to the number of persons to whom the bonds had been distributed originally, the amount of bonds so distributed and the localities of the distributees by States. We shall not review specifically the evidence which was before the Commission. It is sufficient to state that the Commission reached the conclusion that the vicinity of the Curb should include for the purpose of the application which we are discussing, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The petitioner had insisted that the vicinity must be limited either to New York City, to an area within one hour\u2019s commuting distance of New York City, or to a territory enclosed by lines midway between New York City and Philadelphia and New York City and Boston, Philadelphia and Boston being those cities nearest to New York City in which there are securities exchanges extending unlisted trading privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">What is the \u201cvicinity\u201d of the Curb? The word certainly is not one of art. It is capable of a broad or narrow construction, depending upon the object to which it is to be related. For example, New Jersey and Delaware both may be said to be in the vicinity of Pennsylvania. On the other hand the vicinity of City Hall Square, Philadelphia, would not take one to the suburbs of Philadelphia. The word is not defined in the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>elude, therefore, that Congress intended a practical test. The <em>Commission </em>invariably lias endeavored to apply such a test.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"> There have been many decisions by the Commission as to what constitutes the vicinity of the Curb in respect to extending unlisted trading privileges to securities. In the Matter of Applications by the New York Curb Exchange for Unlisted Trading Privileges, 3 SEC 81, 83, the Curb had insisted that its vicinity included the whole of the United States. The Commission stated that \u201cCongress must have had in mind something more than the mere circulation of information [concerning securities to possible customers] or it would have chosen a more appropriate word than \u2018vicinity\u2019. Rather, we interpret \u2018vicinity\u2019 to mean the particular geographical section or sections in which a particular exchange ranks as the, or one of the, national exchanges to which investors would look for an exchange market in the securities for which unlisted trading is sought.\u201d It will be noted that emphasis was laid on the relation of the securities for which unlisted trading privileges are sought to the applicant exchange as well as upon the geographical section or sections in which that exchange could be considered to rank as one of the national exchanges. Obviously the Commission considered that one of the essential elements to be employed in determining the vicinity of the exchange is the nature of the security for which unlisted trading privileges are sought, and the extent and kind of the public holdings in it. The vicinity, therefore, of a particular exchange may vary with the distribution and other factors relating to a particular security. It seems to us that the Commission itself clearly has recognized this fact in numerous decisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In respect to applications made by the New York Curb Exchange the Commission has allowed to it different and varying vicinities depending upon the securities involved, their distribution and other factors relating to them as well as to the facilities possessed by the exchange itself, such as members\u2019 offices and ticker services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These vicinities have varied from that allowed the Curb in the instant case. In Applications by <em>the </em>San Francisco Curb Exchange, 2 SEC 653, in note 6 at p. 657, the Commission commented upon this conception of varying vicinity and expressly disapproved it. The Commission stated, \u201cIt is true that the concept of the .vicinity of an exchange is a flexible one, the limits of which may differ under different circumstances. But under Section 12(f), we must first determine the vicinity of the exchange and then consider whether distribution of the security within that vicinity is sufficient. The vicinity of the exchange thus constitutes the area within which the distribution of the security must be sufficient. It would reverse the plain meaning of Section 12(f) to hold that the area within which the distribution of the security is deemed to be sufficient constitutes or largely determines the vicinity of the exchange, although conceivably in some cases it might he relevant to such a determination.\u201d The position of the Commission is ambiguous for it seems to us that in determining vicinity the Commission has of necessity considered the nature of the security, its distribution and other factors which must be distinguished from simple geographical area. That the'Commission has weighed these factors is demonstrated by the fact, as we have said, the vicinity of the Curb has been held by the Commission to vary with the security. See notes 7 and 8 supra. If an exchange\u2019s vicinity depended solely <em>on </em>geographical considerations it could not vary. We think that it is not a constant and that an exchange\u2019s vicinity must vary with the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">We can conceive, of course, of circumstances in which a most widespread distribution of a security might not aid an exchange in establishing a vicinity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>respect to an application for extending unlisted trading privileges to that security. For example, there might be a very extensive distribution of a given security in an area in which the Curb had neither members or facilities. Such an area could not be considered to be in the vicinity of the Curb. On the other hand if Curb facilities are present in a given locality, the extent of the distribution and nature of the holdings of a certain security in that locality must be deemed to be relevant in determining vicinity. We conclude that this is what the Commission had in mind when it made use of the words last quoted. The Commission must consider the circumstances attendant upon each application made to it and decide it on the particular facts inhering in each case. Vicinity, a word indefinite in meaning, was not intended by Congress to fasten to an exchange a fixed area as a vicinity without regard to the nature or distribution of the security for which unlisted trading privileges are sought. On the contrary, Congress intended to cause the Commission to approve the extension of unlisted trading privileges to a security when the applicant exchange can demonstrate its ability to support an adequate market in that security and the extension of the privilege is required in the public interest or for public protection. Vicinity may furnish a movable feast. We conclude therefore that the definition employed by the Commission in the Matter of Applications by the New York Curb Exchange, 3 SEC at p. 85, hereinbefore quoted, is a sound and legal definition. The Commission has applied its substance in the case at bar. .</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We think that the Commission could have included in the vicinity of the Curb as to the Kentucky <em>4% </em>bonds a wider area than it did but there is substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that there is sufficient public distribution and sufficient public trading in the area defined by the Commission to constitute it the Curb\u2019s vicinity. It appears also that it is necessary to extend unlisted trading privileges in the bonds to the Curb in the public interest and for public protection. The Commission\u2019s finding in this respect finds adequate support in the very nature of the securities. They are public utility bonds of the kind which the ordinary purchaser expects to be able to buy or sell on a national exchange. The granting of the unlisted trading privilege will subject trading in the bonds to the supervision of the Curb and to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act insofar as exchange trading is concerned. Investors will\u2019 still be able to avail themselves of the over-the-counter market. The extension of unlisted trading privileges will provide an additional public market with facilities for quick trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The petitioner has laid emphasis upon the provisions of Section 12(f) that no application shall be approved unless the applicant exchange shall establish to the satisfaction of the Commission the existence of the conditions prescribed by the Act. But, giving fullest scope to the intent of Congress as to the burden of proof which must be sustained by an applicant, we conclude that the Curb has met and carried that burden. The phrase \u201cestablish to the satisfaction of the Commission\u201d does not mean that the Commission may either capriciously extend the unlisted trading privilege to a security upon the application of an exchange or whimsically withhold it. Such would constitute a breach of the Commission\u2019s discretion. What the statute requires is that the applicant exchange shall present substantial evidence to the Commission of the existence of the conditioris prescribed by the Section and if such evidence is presented to it the Commission must extend the privilege. We think that it is clear that the Curb has met the burden prescribed by the Section and that the Commission committed no error of law in so regarding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The order of the Commission insofar as it relates to the application for the extension of unlisted trading privileges to the Kentucky 4% bonds is affirmed. The petition for review is dismissed insofar as it relates to the application in respect to the First Mortgage Bonds of Central Power and Light Company for all questions relating to the latter application have become moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> Two securities issued by Kentucky Utilities Company were involved originally in this case. These were respectively, First Mortgage Bonds, 4% Series, due January 1, 1970, hereinafter referred to as \u201cKentucky 4% bonds,\u201d and 4%% Sinking Fmid Mortgage Bonds, due February 1, 1955, hereinafter referred to as \u201cKentucky 4%% bonds.\u201d The Commission by its order of July 3, 1943, reviewed in this opinion, approved the Curb\u2019s application for permission to extend unlisted trading privileges to the Kentucky 4% bonds and denied the Curb\u2019s application to the Kentucky 4%% bonds. The Curb has not filed a petition to review the latter part of the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">A security issued by Central Power and Light Company, First Mortgage Bonds, Series A, <em>3%%, </em>due August 1, 1969, was the subject of a sej)arato but similar application by the New York Curb Exchange. These bonds have been redeemed and therefore the controversy with respect to them has become moot. We do not consider that controversy to have been of sufficient public importance to bring the issues presented within the ruling of such decisions as Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 219 U.S. 498, 514, 516, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310, or Boise City Irrigation &amp; Land Co. v. Clark, 9 Cir., 131 F.415, 418, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">In the ease at bar, therefore, we are concerned only with the application relating to the Kentucky <em>4% </em>bonds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-15\"> The pertinent provisions of Section 12(f) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78Z(f) are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">Section 12.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-17\">\u201c(f) * * * any national securities exchange, upon application to and approval of such application by the Commission and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_V\"><em>(3) </em>may extend unlisted trading privileges to any security in respect of which there is available from a registration statement and periodic reports or other data filed pursuant to rules or regulations prescribed by the Commission under this title or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, information substantially equivalent to that available pursuant to rules or regulations of the Commission in respect of a security duly listed and registered on a national securities exchange, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ5\">\u201cNo application pursuant to this subsection shall be approved unless the Commission finds that the continuation or extension of unlisted trading privileges pursuant to such application is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investor\u2019s. <em>* * * </em>No application to extend unlisted trading privileges to any security pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of this subsection shall be approved unless the applicant exchange shall establish to the satisfaction of the Commission that there exists in the vicinity of such exchange sufficiently widespread public distribution of such security and sufficient public trading activity therein to render the extension of unlisted trading privileges on such exchange thereto necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. * * <em>* \u201d</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AvC\"> At t\u00edre time that National Association of Security Dealers, Inc.
