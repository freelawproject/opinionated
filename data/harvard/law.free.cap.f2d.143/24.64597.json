D.C.Code 1940, \u00a7 16 \u2014 403. The judgment was clearly right. The facts involved are substantially the same as in Parks v. Parks, 73 App.D.C. 93, 116 F.2d 556. It is immaterial that in the present case the wife had previously obtained a limited divorce or separation, with maintenance, in New York, whereas in the Parks case she had done so in the District of Columbia. It is also immaterial that the wife in this case had obtained her limited divorce on the ground, among others, of cruelty which made it \u201cunsafe and improper\u201d for her to cohabit with her husband, whereas in the Parks case the wife\u2019s limited divorce had been granted on the ground of desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-23\">Appellant contends that the award of alimony requires clarification. The court ordered appellee to pay appellant $30 on the 6th and 21st days of each month until the court\u2019s further order. The meaning of this is clear, although the court stated that payments would \u201capply\u201d on the previous New York judgment for maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
