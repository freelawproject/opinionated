We adhere to our ruling in Patty v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 717, i.e., that, under \u00a7 115(g), [26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 385], redeemed shares are the equivalent of dividends if and only if the shares were not issued for genuine business purposes. The Tax Court has found that here the shares were not so issued, and we agree. In any event, this is the kind of case which comes within Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239; see Wilmington Trust Co. v. Helvering, 316 U.S. 164, 168, 62 S.Ct. 984, 86 L.Ed. 1352; Fuld v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 465, 467. We also agree with the Tax Court that distributions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>which are the equivalent of dividends under \u00a7 115(g) are \u201cdividends\u201d within \u00a7\u00a7 143 and 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"> 2. We need not consider whether Parker v. United States, <em>7 </em>Cir., 88 F.2d 9\u00d37 is correct. For, even assuming arguendo that <em>it is, </em>taxpayer here must lose. The Tax Court correctly held that there was no presumption that any of the transferees of the shares distributed to stockholders were purchasers for value; that, if the Parker rule is valid, petitioner had the burden of proof on that issue; and that petitioner had not discharged that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
