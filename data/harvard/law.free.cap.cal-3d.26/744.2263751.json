We pointed out in this regard that a named defendant who has been so selected for suit has a right to pursue his own equitable indemnity action against an additional unnamed tortfeasor to obtain indemnity for any liability that should properly be borne by such additional tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">In the instant case, the plaintiff, injured in an automobile accident on a public highway, instituted the underlying action against a number of individuals but did not file a timely claim against the State of California (state) under the provisions of the California Tort Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 810 et seq.) and did not join the state as a defendant in the action. Several of the named defendants thereafter filed an equitable indemnity action against the state, pursuant to a cross-complaint, alleging that the state\u2019s negligence in blocking several lanes of the highway proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and asserting that if they were held liable for such injury the state was obligated to indemnify them for at least a portion of the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">The state demurred to the defendants\u2019 cross-complaint, maintaining that the equitable indemnity action was barred by the tort claims act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The state asserted that because the plaintiff had failed to file a timely claim within 100 days of the accident and thus could not himself pursue his action against the state, the defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity action against the state should likewise be precluded. The trial court overruled the state\u2019s demurrer, and the state then filed the instant writ proceeding to challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In light of the controlling statutory provisions and the well-established principles relating to the accrual of defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity action, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision. As we shall explain, the governing authorities, both in California and throughout the country, uniformly hold that a tort defendant\u2019s equitable indemnity action is separate and distinct from the plaintiff\u2019s tort action. The indemnity action, unlike the plaintiff\u2019s claim, does not accrue for statute of limitations purposes when the original accident occurs, but instead accrues at the time that the tort defendant pays a judgment or settlement as to which he is entitled to indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Moreover, the controlling precedents also teach that a tort defendant does not lose his right to seek equitable indemnity from another tortfeasor simply because the original plaintiff\u2019s action against the additional defendant may be barred by the statute of limitations. The defendant\u2019s equitable indemnity action is independent of the plaintiff\u2019s action and a defendant is entitled to pursue his own indemnity action so long as the statute of limitations on that action has not expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Finally, the authorities establish that the above principles apply fully to equitable indemnity actions against government entities. In particular, cases throughout the country hold that the time for filing a claim for equitable indemnity does not expire until after the defendant\u2019s equitable indemnity action accrues. Such an action faces no bar simply because the plaintiff cannot pursue an action against the governmental entity because of his own failure to file a timely claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Although the state suggests that this court\u2019s decision in <em>American Motorcycle </em>worked a fundamental alteration in these established principles, we shall explain that nothing in the <em>American Motorcycle </em>decision supports the state\u2019s assertion, and that recent cases from other jurisdictions which have adopted similar doctrines of comparative or partial equitable indemnity clearly refute the state\u2019s argument. Accordingly, we conclude that the requested writ should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>1. <em>The facts and proceedings below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On December 16, 1973, while driving in his automobile, Jack Peters was injured in a three-car accident on the Ventura Freeway, a public highway owned and maintained by the State of California. On October 23, 1974, more than ten months after the accident, Peters filed the underlying personal injury action against Art Frost, Martin Josephson and Roy and Elaine Hunter, the owners and operators of the other two vehicles; Peters had not, however, filed a claim with the state within 100 days of the accident and did not join the state as a defendant in the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In April 1978, prior to trial in the underlying action and shortly after this court\u2019s decision in <em>American Motorcycle, </em>defendants Frost and Josephson filed a cross-complaint for equitable indemnity against the state, alleging that the state had failed to block adequately two lanes of traffic on the Ventura Freeway or to provide appropriate warnings of the blocked area, and maintaining that the state\u2019s negligence had created a dangerous condition of public property which proximately caused plaintiffs injuries. In light of these facts, defendants asserted that in the event they were held liable for plaintiffs injuries, they were entitled to recover at least a portion of such damages from the state under the equitable indemnity principles enunciated in <em>American Motorcycle. </em>Shortly, thereafter, defendants Roy and Elaine Hunter filed a motion for leave to file a similar equitable indemnity cross-complaint against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The state demurred to the Frost-Josephson cross-complaint, and filed an opposition to the Hunters\u2019 motion, contending that since the plaintiffs own personal injury action against the state was barred by the tort claims act, the defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions should similarly be barred. The trial court rejected the state\u2019s argument, and, by separate orders, overruled the demurrer to the Frost-Josephson cross-complaint and granted the Hunters\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The state then filed the instant petition for writ of prohibition and/or mandate, challenging the trial court\u2019s orders as arbitrary and in excess of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. After the Court of Appeal had initially denied the petition without opinion, we issued an alternative writ returnable before the Court of Appeal in light of the general importance of the issue presented. Thereafter, because of a divergence of views among the Courts of Appeal on this question, we granted a hearing in this case to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">2.  <em>Under Government Code sections 911.2 and 901, the time for filing a claim does not expire until at least 100 days after the claimant\u2019s cause of action accrues for statute of limitations purposes. Because defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions have not yet accrued for statute of limitations purposes, the cross-complaints are not barred by the statutory claims provision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Because the state contends primarily that defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions against it are barred by the expiration of the period for filing a claim under the tort claims act, we begin our analysis by examining the language of the controlling statutory provisions. Section 911.2 of the Government Code provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] claim relating to a cause of action... for injury to person or personal property ...shall be presented.. .not later than the 100th day <em>after the accrual of the cause of action </em>[and a] claim relating to any other cause of action shall be presented. . .not later than one year <em>after the accrual of the cause of action.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Although there may be some question as to which category of section 911.2 a claim for equitable indemnity arising out of a governmental entity\u2019s tortious activity falls, that issue is not relevant in the instant case for the statute clearly provides that with respect to <em>both </em>categories, the time for filing a claim does not expire until at least 100 days after the date of the accrual of the claimant\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Government Code section 901, in turn, specifies the relevant \u201cdate of accrual\u201d for the purpose of the governmental claims provisions. Section 901 provides: \u201cFor the purpose of computing the time limits prescribed by Sections <em>911.2, </em>911.4, 912, and 945.6, <em>the date of the accrual of a cause of action to which a claim relates is the date upon which the cause of action would be deemed to have accrued within the meaning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>of the statute of limitations </em>which would be applicable thereto if there were no requirement that a claim be presented to and acted upon by the public entity before an action could be commenced thereon.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, the relevant question in this case turns on when the defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions would be deemed to accrue for purposes of the statute of limitations \u201cif the action were between private litigants.\u201d (Van Alstyne, Cal. Government Tort Liability (Cont.Ed.Bar 1964) \u00a7 8.27, pp. 385-386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Past California cases provide a clear and unambiguous answer to this question. Just two years ago, in <em>E. L. White, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 506 [146 Cal.Rptr. 614, 579 P.2d 505], our court noted that \u201c[i]t is well settled that a cause of action for implied indemnity does not accrue or come into existence <em>until the indemnitee </em>[i.e., the initial defendant] <em>has suffered actual loss through payment. (Sunset-Sternau Food Co. </em>v. <em>Bonzi </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 834, 843 [36 Cal.Rptr. 741, 389 P.2d 133]; <em>Card Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Ledbetter </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 472, 480 [94 Cal.Rptr. 570].)\u201d (Italics added.) Numerous additional California authorities, moreover, uniformly confirm \u201cthe rule that the period of limitations on the [equitable] indemnity claim begins when the claimant settles with the injured party.\u201d <em>(Aerojet General Corp. </em>v. <em>D. Zelinsky &amp; Sons </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 604, 612-613 [57 Cal.Rptr. 701]; see, e.g., <em>Vegetable Oil Products Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 252, 257 [28 Cal.Rptr. 555]; <em>De La Forest </em>v. <em>Yandle </em>(1959) 171 Cal.App.2d 59, 62 [340 P.2d 52].) In the <em>Vegetable Oil </em>case, the Court of Appeal briefly explained the rationale of the settled rule: \u201cIf it were the law that the statute of limitations starts to run when the bodily injury occurs, the indemnitee\u2019s remedy would be most unsatisfactory. Until the amount of the damages was determined by a judgment or a compromise with the injured party, the indemnitor would have no way of either measuring or discharging his duty to his indemnitee. The only workable approach is that applied in the <em>De La Forest </em>case\u2014that the period of limitations starts to run from payment.\u201d (213 Cal.App.2d at p. 257.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Indeed, a recent annotation of cases throughout the country demonstrates that the rule as to the accrual of a cause of action for equitable indemnity established by the California cases prevails throughout the. United States. As the annotation states: \u201c[T]he generally recognized rule... is that a claim for indemnity based on tort does not accrue, and the statute of limitations does not start to run thereon, at the time of the commission of the tort, or the time the injury was inflicted.... The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>claim accrues at the time the indemnity claimant suffers loss or damage, that is, at the time of payment of the underlying claim, payment of a judgment thereon, or payment of a settlement thereof by the party seeking indemnity.\u201d (Annot., When Statute of Limitations Commences to Run Against Claim for Contribution or Indemnity Based on Tort (1974) 57 A.L.R.3d 867, 881-884 (fns. omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Furthermore, in recognizing that a tort defendant\u2019s claim for equitable indemnity is separate and distinct from the injured party\u2019s claim against the additional defendant for statute of limitations purposes, the cases explicitly hold that a tort defendant does not lose his own independent right to seek such recovery simply because the injured party is barred from pursuing its separate claim against the additional defendant by the applicable statute of limitations. (See, e.g., <em>Sunset-Sternau Food Co. </em>v. <em>Bonzi, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 834, 843; <em>Vegetable Oil Products Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 252, 257; <em>De La Forest </em>v. <em>Yandle, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.2d 59, 62. See generally Annot., <em>supra, </em>57 A.L.R.3d 867; Annot. (1949) 8 A.L.R.2d 8, 139 (\u201cwhere the original defendant alleges facts showing that the additional defendant is liable over to him. .. the fact that the statute of limitations will bar the plaintiff from a direct recovery against the additional defendant has no effect on the defendant\u2019s right to enforce his claim of contribution or indemnity, since the cause of action owned by the plaintiff is distinct from the cause of action arising out of the duty of the additional defendant to indemnify the defendant\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Thus, the cases establish that if the state were a private party (1) the defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions against the state would not be precluded simply because the plaintiff\u2019s action against the state was barred by the statute of limitations, and (2) the defendants\u2019 indemnity actions would not be deemed to accrue for statute of limitations purposes until such defendants had suffered an actual loss through payment of a settlement or judgment, an event that, in the instant case, has not yet occurred. Since, as we have seen, sections 911.2 and 901 explicitly provide that the time for filing a claim under the governmental claim provisions does not expire until at least 100 days after the claimant\u2019s cause of action accrues for statute of limitations purposes, it follows that defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions in this case are not barred despite the fact that the claim filing period has expired with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s separate action against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>A host of cases arising under governmental tort claims statutes throughout the country confirm this conclusion. In <em>Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(7th Cir. 1955) 220 F.2d 939, for example, a defendant who had incurred liability to an accident victim instituted an action for indemnity against the United States more than four and one-half years after the underlying accident but within two years after settling the claim of the accident victim. The government, relying on a section of the Federal Tort Claims Act which provided that \u201c[a] tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless such action is begun within two years after such claim accrues. ...\u201d (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b)), argued that the implied indemnity action was barred because it was begun more than two years after the accident, at a time when the injured victim could no longer sue the United States. The government maintained, as the state does in the instant case, that Congress had intentionally fixed a short limitations period so that the government might be afforded an opportunity to investigate promptly the claims against it, and thus that the period of limitation of the claims act should run from the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The court in the <em>Chicago, Rock Island </em>case, however, rejected the government\u2019s argument, explaining: \u201cCongress fixed the date when the limitation period commences to run as the time \u2018such claim accrues.\u2019 It is plain, of course, that no claim accrued to the [indemnitee] against the government prior to the date when the former made payment to [the injured party.] The government\u2019s contention on this point, if sustained, would mean that a suit under the Tort Claims Act could be barred before it came into existence. Such an application of the limitation provisions would produce an incongruity which we think should not be made.\u201d (220 F.2d at p. 942.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The decision in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Przbylski </em>(1973) 83 Wn.2d 118 [516 P.2d 207] is similarly directly in point. In <em>Thomas, </em>as in the instant case, a plaintiff injured in an accident brought suit against a nongovernmental defendant more than 120 days (the relevant time period of the Washington claim statute) after the accident and did not join any governmental defendant. The named defendant then filed a third party claim against a municipality, alleging that it was entitled to indemnification or contribution from the city because of the city\u2019s failure to provide adequate lighting or safe crosswalks. The municipality argued that the defendant\u2019s implied indemnity action was barred because no claim had been filed with the city within 120 days <em>of the accident, </em>but the Washington Supreme Court rejected the city\u2019s position and held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>that, with respect to the defendant\u2019s indemnity action, the claim statutes did not begin to run until the indemnity action accrued, i.e., \u201cuntil the defendant has made payment to plaintiff or had a judgment rendered against him.\u201d (516 P.2d at p. 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Indeed, a review of the cases from other jurisdictions reveals that courts throughout the country have concluded with virtual unanimity that a tort defendant\u2019s indemnity action against a governmental entity is separate and distinct from the injured plaintiff\u2019s action against the governmental entity and is not barred by a failure to file a timely claim measured from the time of the accident. (See, e.g., <em>Valstrey Serv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Elections </em>(1957) 2 N.Y.2d 413 [161 N.Y.S.2d 52, 54, 141 N.E.2d 565, 566]; <em>Hennington </em>v. <em>Valuch </em>(1963) 19 Wis.2d 260 [120 N.W.2d 44, 45-46]; <em>Royal Car Wash Co. </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Council of W. </em>(Del.Super.Ct. 1968) 240 A.2d 144, 145-146; <em>Roehrig </em>v. <em>City of Louisville </em>(Ky. 1970) 454 S.W.2d 703, 704-705; <em>Cotham </em>v. <em>Board of County Commissioners </em>(1971) 260 Md. 556 [273 A.2d 115, 120-121]; <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(Iowa 1973) 209 N.W.2d 64, 65-68; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Denver </em>(1973) 181 Colo. 218 [508 P.2d 1254, 1256]; <em>Keleket X-Ray Corp. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1960) 275 F.2d 167, 168-169; <em>Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Puerto Rico Water Resources Auth. </em>(1st Cir. 1968) 396 F.2d 421, 423-424; <em>United States Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(5th Cir. 1972) 470 F.2d 487, 489; <em>Globig </em>v. <em>Greene &amp; Gust Co. </em>(E.D.Wis. 1960) 184 F.Supp. 530, 532-533; <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Dietz </em>(D. Hawaii 1968) 283 F.Supp. 854, 856-857; <em>Waldinger Co. </em>v. <em>P &amp; Z Co., Inc. </em>(D.Neb. 1976) 414 F.Supp. 59, 60-61.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Although it did not involve an equitable indemnity action, the case of <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 418 [109 Cal.Rptr. 53] demonstrates the applicability of the reasoning of the out-of-state authorities to the California Tort Claims Act. In <em>Allstate, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>an insurer which had paid for an accident victim\u2019s injuries pursuant to an uninsured motorist provision of its policy and had thereby succeeded to the accident victim\u2019s rights, brought a subrogation action against the county alleging that the county was liable for the victim\u2019s injuries. The county resisted the action, maintaining, as does the state in the instant case, that the insurer\u2019s action was barred under the tort claim act because a claim had not been filed with the county within 100 days of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The <em>Allstate </em>court rejected the county\u2019s contention and held that the insurer\u2019s action was not barred by the claims statute. In reaching this conclusion, the court pointed out that under an applicable statutory provision the statute of limitations on the insurer\u2019s subrogation action did not begin to run from the date of the injured person\u2019s accident, but rather ran from the date that the insurer made payment to the victim. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.2, subd. (g);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Harmon </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 758, 761-763 [72 Cal.Rptr. 352].) In light of Government Code sections 911.2 and 901, the tort claim provisions discussed above, the <em>Allstate </em>court concluded that the insurer\u2019s time for filing a claim did not expire until after the insurer\u2019s cause of action had accrued. Since, as we have seen, the California authorities clearly establish that a tort defendant\u2019s action for equitable indemnity, like the insurer\u2019s statutory cause of action at issue in Allstate, does not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until the time of payment, the <em>Allstate </em>decision directly refutes the state\u2019s contention that the defendants\u2019 indemnity actions in the present case are barred because no claim was filed within 100 days of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">3. <em>This court\u2019s recent decision in American Motorcycle </em>v. <em>Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578 did not alter the well-established rule as to the accrual of a cause of action for equitable indemnity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The state acknowledges that numerous cases hold that an action for equitable indemnity is separate and distinct from the underlying tort action and that \u201ca cause of action for implied indemnity does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>accrue.. .until the indemnitee has suffered actual loss through payment.\u201d <em>(E. L. White, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 497, 506.) The state nevertheless seeks to avoid the obvious relevance of these principles to the claim-filing period presented by sections 911.2 and 901 by suggesting that the established rule does not apply to an equitable indemnity action for \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201ccomparative\u201d equitable indemnity maintained pursuant to this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>American Motorcycle. </em>The state argues, in this regard, (1) that the decision in <em>American Motorcycle </em>established an entirely new cause of action that is theoretically distinct from the traditional, all-or-nothing equitable indemnity action and (2) that <em>American Motorcycle </em>indicates that the accrual date of its \u201cnew\u201d indemnity action differs from the accrual date of a <em>pre-American Motorcycle </em>equitable indemnity action. As we explain, the state is in error on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">To begin with, the <em>American Motorcycle </em>decision clearly reveals that this court did not purport to create a wholly new equitable indemnity action resting on a different theoretical basis than the <em>pre-American Motorcycle </em>equitable indemnity doctrine. Instead, we simply recognized in <em>American Motorcycle </em>that \u201c[although California cases have steadfastly maintained that the [equitable indemnity] doctrine is founded on \u2018equitable considerations\u2019..., the all-or-nothing aspect of the doctrine has precluded courts from reaching a just solution in the great majority of cases in which equity and fairness call for an apportionment of loss between the wrongdoers in proportion to their relative culpability, rather than the imposition of the entire loss upon one or the other tortfeasor.\u201d (20 Cal.3d at p. 595.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Noting that a recent decision of the New York Court of Appeals, <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Company </em>(1972) 30 N.Y.2d 143 [331 N.Y.S.2d 382, 282 N.E.2d 288] had demonstrated that \u201cthe common law was capable of <em>evolving </em>the equitable indemnity doctrine into a rule which would permit the equitable sharing of loss between multiple tortfeasors\u201d (italics added and omitted) <em>(id., </em>at p. 597), we concluded that in order to bring the California equitable indemnity doctrine into line with its historical and theoretical foundations \u201cthe current equitable indemnity rule should be modified to permit a concurrent tortfeasor to obtain partial indemnity from other concurrent tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 598.) Thus, <em>American Motorcycle </em>did not establish a new cause of action separate and distinct from the traditional equitable indemnity action, but simply modified the all-or-nothing aspect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>pre-American Motorcycle </em>doctrine to permit partial indemnification in appropriate cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Moreover, absolutely nothing in the language or reasoning of the <em>American Motorcycle </em>decision supports the state\u2019s further contention that <em>American Motorcycle </em>indicates that a cause of action seeking partial indemnity accrues <em>prior to </em>the indemnitee\u2019s actual loss through payment of a judgment debt. Although the question of the accrual date of the defendant\u2019s equitable indemnity claim was not directly presented in <em>American Motorcycle, </em>we note that if the decision had intended to alter the traditional accrual date of an equitable indemnity action our opinion would have at least adverted to such a change. Nothing in the opinion indicates any such modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Furthermore, the fact that <em>American Motorcycle </em>permits an apportionment or sharing of liability among joint tortfeasors, rather than a total shifting of liability from one to another, does not rationally support a conclusion that the decision altered the date of accrual of the equitable indemnity cause of action. In actions for contribution, which have always involved a <em>sharing </em>of liability, courts have uniformly followed the same rule as to the accrual of the cause of action as has been followed with respect to equitable indemnification. Thus, the authorities hold that a tort defendant\u2019s action for contribution accrues for statute of limitations purposes when he has paid out more than his share of the damages, and not when the plaintiff\u2019s tort injury occurs. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 875, subd. (c); <em>Augustus </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 270, 271-272 [14 Cal.Rptr. 641, 363 P.2d 873]. See generally Annot., <em>supra, </em>57 A.L.R.3d 867, 875-881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Indeed, a series of recent New York decisions, arising in the wake of the <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Company </em>decision relied on by this court in <em>American Motorcycle, </em>directly refutes the state\u2019s contention that an equitable indemnity action seeking partial indemnification accrues at a different point in time than a traditional equitable indemnification action. (See, e.g., <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Long Island Lighting Co. </em>(1977) 59 App. Div.2d 523 [397 N.Y.S.2d 104, 105]; <em>Relyea </em>v. <em>State </em>(1977) 59 App.Div.2d 364 [399 N.Y.S.2d 710, 711]; <em>Bay Ridge Air Rights, Inc. </em>v. <em>State </em>(1977) 57 App.Div.2d <em>237 </em>[394 N.Y.S.2d 464, 465]; <em>Gates-Chili Central School Dist. </em>v. <em>State </em>(1976) 55 App.Div.2d 44 [389 N.Y.S.2d 716, 718]. See also <em>United States Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>470 F.2d 487 (action for \u201ccontribution or indemnity, in whole or in part\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The <em>Gates-Chili </em>decision, involving a factual setting strikingly similar to the instant case, illustrates the point. In <em>Gates-Chili, </em>a person injured in a car accident sought recovery from the initial defendant. Subsequently, the defendant, pursuant to the <em>Dole </em>decision, sought partial indemnity from the state; as in the present case, the defendant\u2019s partial indemnity claim rested on the state\u2019s alleged failure properly to maintain the highway where the accident occurred. The state in <em>Gates-Chili </em>contended that the defendant\u2019s partial indemnity action was barred because a claim had not been filed within six months <em>of the accident </em>pursuant to the relevant claims statute. The New York court rejected the state\u2019s argument, declaring; \u201cSince a claim for <em>Dole </em>contribution is essentially similar to one for indemnification, the accrual date principles in actions for indemnity should be applied . . .. \u201d (389 N.Y.S.2d at p. 718.) Because the claim in that case had been filed within six months of the date that the defendant had settled the victim\u2019s action, the <em>Gates-Chili </em>court concluded that the indemnity action was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In maintaining that an action for partial indemnity under <em>American Motorcycle, </em>unlike a traditional equitable indemnity action, accrues <em>prior </em>to the defendant\u2019s settlement or payment of an adverse judgment, the state apparently relies on the fact that the defendant in <em>American Motorcycle </em>was permitted to pursue his indemnity action through a cross-complaint for declaratory relief before he had sustained any actual loss. As the opinion in <em>American Motorcycle </em>makes clear, however, this aspect of the decision in no way distinguishes an action for partial indemnity from a traditional, all-or-nothing equitable indemnity action; on the contrary, <em>American Motorcycle </em>recognized the propriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>of such a declaratory cross-complaint <em>precisely because </em>such a procedure was available with respect to a traditional equitable indemnity action. (See 20 Cal.3d at pp. 604-607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">As we explained in <em>American Motorcycle, </em>as early as 1962\u201416 years before our modification of the equitable indemnity doctrine in order to permit partial or comparative indemnification\u2014our court had held in <em>Roylance </em>v. <em>Doelger </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 255 [19 Cal.Rptr. 7, 368 P.2d 535] that a tort defendant \u201ccould file a cross-complaint against a previously unnamed party when the defendant properly alleged that he would be entitled to indemnity from such party should the plaintiff prevail on the original complaint.\u201d (20 Cal.3d at p. 605.) Moreover, as we also pointed out in <em>American Motorcycle, </em>in 1972 the Legislature specifically codified the <em>Roylance </em>rule in section 428.10 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure; these statutory provisions permit a third party action to be asserted by cross-complaint by a defendant claiming \u201cthe right to recover <em>all or part </em>of any amount for which he may be held liable\u201d on the original complaint. (Italics added.) (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 428.70.) It was under the authority of <em>Roylance </em>and these statutory provisions\u2014which clearly draw no distinction between equitable indemnity actions seeking total indemnity and equitable actions seeking partial indemnity\u2014that we concluded in <em>American Motorcycle </em>that a tort defendant may file a declaratory cross-complaint for indemnity in the original action.  Consequently, this aspect of the <em>American Motorcycle </em>decision does not support the state\u2019s argument that the date of accrual of an equitable indemnity action under <em>American Motorcycle </em>differs from the date of accrual of a <em>pre-American Motorcycle </em>equitable indemnity claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Furthermore, as this court noted in <em>E. L. White, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 497, 506, the fact that a defendant is permitted under a third party procedure to bring a declaratory cross-complaint in the original tort action does not alter the general rule that, for statute of limitations purposes, the defendant\u2019s indemnity action does not accrue until he has suffered actual loss through payment. (See also <em>Vegetable Oil Products Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 252, 257.) Once again, in this respect California law conforms with the general rule throughout the United States. As the comprehensive annotation cited earlier indicates: \u201c[I]n jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>[like California] which by third party procedure allow a defendant in an action to bring into such action a third party defendant claimed to be liable over to him if the plaintiff recovers judgment against him, <em>such right to sue on a possible cause of action does not alter the rule that the statute of limitations starts to run only when the cause of action has accrued, that is, after the possibility has been resolved in favor of the third-party </em>plaintiff(Italics added; fn. omitted.) (Annot., <em>supra, </em>57 A.L.R.3d 867, 873; and see cases discussed <em>id., </em>at pp. 912-921.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Accordingly, the governing authorities support the conclusion that the defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions against the state have not yet accrued for purposes of the statute of limitations. Since Government Code sections 911.2 and 901 specifically link the time for filing a claim to the accrual of the claimant\u2019s cause of action for purposes of the statute of limitations, the trial court properly determined that such actions are not barred by the expiration of the claim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">4.  <em>The trial court\u2019s ruling does not thwart the purposes of the California Tort Claims Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Although, as we have seen, the statutory provisions of the Tort Claims Act and established principles as to the accrual of a cause of action for equitable indemnity clearly support the trial court\u2019s ruling in this case, the state argues that a contrary conclusion is nonetheless compelled to serve the \u201cpurposes\u201d of the Tort Claims Act. The state argues in this regard that the trial court\u2019s action improperly deprives the state of the protection afforded by the act\u2019s short claims filing period and permits an injured plaintiff who has failed to file a timely claim to \u201cindirectly\u201d circumvent the claim statute\u2019s requirements. As we explain, neither of these arguments can withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">First, the state\u2019s characterization of the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the Tort Claims Act rests on a less than accurate self-serving vision of the enactment. While unquestionably the act in part aims at affording a governmental entity prompt notice of the claims against it, sections 911.2 and 901 demonstrate that the draftsmen of the act also recognized the importance of affording claimants a fair opportunity to present their claims. The act implements this latter objective by providing that the time for filing a claim does not expire before the claimant\u2019s cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>against the governmental entity has accrued. The state\u2019s proposed interpretation would directly thwart this legislative mandate and would improperly deprive an entire class of claimants of a fair opportunity to protect their rights vis-\u00e1-vis governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Indeed, the state\u2019s assertion as to legislative purpose appears particularly untenable because as a practical matter the state\u2019s reading of the act would permit the injured plaintiff to forfeit a defendant\u2019s indemnity rights by simply delaying the filing of an action until after the claims period has run. As the Iowa Supreme Court stated in rejecting a similar contention as to legislative purpose: \u201c[W]e refuse to attribute to this legislation an intention to permit an injured claimant to elect which of two equally culpable tort-feasors shall bear the <em>whole </em>burden simply because one happens to be a governmental unit. ...\u201d <em>(Olsen </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>209 N.W.2d 64, 67; see, e.g., <em>Cotham </em>v. <em>Board of County Commissioners, supra, </em>273 A.2d 115, 120-121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Second, it is not true that a preservation of the defendant\u2019s indemnity rights in these circumstances is simply an \u201cindirect\u201d way to permit an injured plaintiff to avoid the effect of the claims statute. If a plaintiff fails to file a timely claim with a governmental entity, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy will be limited to an action against the nongovernmental defendant. If the nongovernmental defendant is found not liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, the plaintiff will recover nothing, even if the evidence at trial demonstrates that the governmental entity\u2019s conduct would have rendered it legally responsible for the damage. In such a case, the governmental entity will escape liability solely because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the claims statute. Similarly, because the governmental entity\u2019s liability flows only to the indemnitee, if the indemnitee is insolvent and thereby incurs no actual financial loss, the governmental entity will likewise escape responsibility. (Cf. <em>Sunset-Sternau Food Co. </em>v. <em>Bonzi, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 834, 841-842.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Moreover, in light of the traditional joint and several liability doctrine reiterated in <em>American Motorcycle, </em>when an injured plaintiff <em>is </em>successful in obtaining a judgment against the nongovernmental defendant, the state\u2019s proposed interpretation of the claims statute would not in any event prevent a plaintiff from obtaining full recovery despite his failure to comply with the claims statute. Consequently, to the extent that the state\u2019s argument relies on the theory that an injured plaintiff should not be permitted to escape the effect of its failure to file a timely claim, the theory fails; the state\u2019s interpretation would not visit its sanction upon the dilatory plaintiff at all, but would simply deprive the named tort defendant of his independent right to indemnity. (See, e.g., <em>Sunset-Sternau Food Co. </em>v. <em>Bonzi, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 842.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions are not barred by the expiration of the claim filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">5.  <em>Because defendants\u2019 cross-complaint was filed prior to the accrual of their cause of action for equitable indemnity, no prior claim was required.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Although it did not raise the issue in the trial court, the state argues in its petition for an extraordinary writ that even if, as we have held, the filing period for the claim has not expired with respect to defendants\u2019 equitable indemnity actions, the trial court nonetheless erred in permitting defendants to file cross-complaints embodying these actions without first having filed claims with the state. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 945.4.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Courts in other jurisdictions which have addressed similar contentions have uniformly concluded that when a tort defendant seeks indemnity from a governmental entity pursuant to a third party procedure, and thereby institutes his action <em>before the indemnity claim has actually </em>accrued, the defendant should not be required to file a claim. (See, e.g., <em>Valstrey Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Elections, supra, 2 </em>N.Y.2d 413 [161 N.Y.S.2d 52, 141 N.E.2d 565]; <em>Hennington </em>v. <em>Valuch, supra, </em>19 Wis.2d 260 [120 N.W.2d 44, 45-46]; <em>Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S. S. M. R. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Fond du Lac </em>(7th Cir. 1961) 297 F.2d 583, 586; <em>Waldinger Co. </em>v. <em>P. &amp; </em>Z. <em>Co., Inc., supra, </em>414 F.Supp. 59, 60-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">As these cases point out, in this context application of the claim filing requirement would, to a large extent, be either meaningless or superfluous. Because the tort defendant has as yet suffered no liability, he cannot reasonably inform the governmental entity of perhaps the most crucial information contemplated by the claims provisions, namely, the amount of the claim at issue. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 910, subds. (d), (f).) Furthermore, inasmuch as the shorter claims filing deadline is not applicable since the defendant\u2019s indemnity action has not yet accrued, the serving of a third party cross-complaint will provide the governmental entity with an equally prompt notice of the \u201cpotential claim\u201d as would a nonjudicial notice of claim. As the court pointed out in <em>Waldinger Co. </em>v. <em>P. &amp; Z. Co., Inc., supra, </em>414 F.Supp. at pages 60-61: \u201cThe political subdivision has notice of the claim when it is served with a third party complaint far in advance of the time of judgment when literal application of the statute would require notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that when an equitable indemnity action is pursued prior to the accrual of the cause of action through a third party cross-complaint, no prior claim need be filed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>6. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court properly overruled the state\u2019s demurrer to the Frost-Josephson cross-complaint and properly granted the Hunters leave to file a similar cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The alternative writ is discharged and a peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Bird, C.

By repudiating contribution in favor of a modified indemnity principle, this court allowed the pocketbook concerns of wrongdoers and their insurers to take priority over the concerns of innocent plaintiffs seeking speedy, effective relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Despite adoption of the new label, the court clearly indicated that traditional indemnity principles would <em>not </em>be applied to the new partial indemnity doctrine. Indeed, <em>American Motorcycle </em>itself departed from traditional indemnity principles in holding that the settlement procedures of the contribution statutes (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877) are to be \u201cpreserved as an integral part of the partial indemnity doctrine.\u201d (20 Cal.3d at pp. 603-604; <em>Gehman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 257 [158 Cal.Rptr. 62].) Under those procedures, a tortfeasor may not recover partial indemnity from another tortfeasor who has settled. Under traditional indemnity principles, by way of contrast, an agent who settles with the plaintiff can be held liable to indemnify the principal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 875, subd. (f); <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Technicolor Corp. </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 152, 155 [103 Cal.Rptr. 686].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Similarly in <em>American Motorcycle </em>this court stated that in accordance with Labor Code section 3864 a concurrently negligent employer will not be liable for partial indemnity to a tortfeasor liable to an injured employee. (20 Cal.3d 578, 607, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Most importantly, <em>American Motorcycle </em>held on the basis of Code of Civil Procedure section 428.10 that a defendant \u201cis generally authorized to file a cross-complaint against a concurrent tortfeasor for partial indemnity on a comparative fault basis.\u201d (20 Cal.3d at p. 607.) Under traditional indemnity doctrine, the defendant would be limited to seeking declaratory relief by cross-complaint\u2014the cause of action for direct recovery does not arise until after the indemnitee has suffered actual loss through payment. <em>(E. L. White, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Huntington Beach </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 506 [146 Cal.Rptr. 614, 579 P.2d 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\"><em>American Motorcycle </em>thus shows that we will not attempt to apply traditional indemnity doctrine to the cause of action for partial indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>nity when to do so would significantly impair or defeat sound legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Today the label of comparative or partial equitable indemnity is sought to be used to repudiate fundamental legislative policy. Concern for the pocketbook of the admitted wrongdoer does not justify violation of the legislative policies reflected by claims statutes and statutes of limitation. By adopting those statutes, the Legislature has shown that limitation periods are of sufficient importance to warrant barring meritorious but untimely actions by injured persons. There is no justification for elevating the pocketbook interest of a wrongdoer above that of the injured plaintiff or above that of the policy reflected by the claims and limitations statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u201cThe policy underlying the claims statutes is to afford prompt notice of claims to governmental entities. <em>(Myers </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 626 [86 Cal.Rptr. 198]; <em>Rowan </em>v. <em>City etc. of San Francisco </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 308 [53 Cal.Rptr. 88].) The courts and commentators have considered prompt notice important for several reasons: To allow (1) early investigation of the facts, (2) informed fiscal planning in light of prospective liabilities, (3) settlement of claims before initiation of costly civil litigation, and (4) avoidance of similarly caused future injuries and liabilities. (2 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1959) p. A-73; <em>Fredrichsen </em>v. <em>City of Lakewood </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 353, 359-360. . ..)\u201d <em>(Minsky </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 123-124 [113 Cal.Rptr. 102, 520 P.2d 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">It must be apparent that should a concurrent tortfeasor be permitted to delay filing claim against a public entity until he has been compelled to respond in a lawsuit, the policy underlying the claims statute will surely be frustrated. Not receiving the requisite statutory notice, the public entity has no reason to commence investigation of the facts surrounding the accident; it is unable to engage in informed fiscal planning to meet prospective liabilities\u2014a matter of increasing importance due to recent unprecedented fiscal reforms (see <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High School District </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]); it has no notice of a possibly dangerous condition for months or years after the accident\u2014in this case the state was not put on formal notice of its potential liability until nearly five years had passed\u2014and it is not afforded opportunity to effect early settlement of claims, thus avoiding costly litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Attempts to relate the commencement of the running of the 100-day period to some other event occurring later than the cause of action giving rise to a plaintiff\u2019s injuries are counter to the policy purposes of the Tort Claims Act. The public entity\u2019s liability, if any, is to be determined in its entirety by factual matters relating to the accident itself\u2014not to procedural steps thereafter taken by an injured party in seeking redress. It is the accident which the entity must be afforded an early opportunity to investigate, and it is the dangerous condition of its property, if any, at the site of the accident which the entity must be afforded an early opportunity to correct, if the policy of the Tort Claims Act is to be served. If we were to hold that a public entity may be inter-pleaded without the filing of a timely claim when measured against the time of the accident, the net effect would be to permit a plaintiff to recover a proportionate share of his loss from the entity, thus permitting to be done by indirection what the statute expressly forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The clear public policy embodied in the Tort Claims Act should not be frustrated and ignored in favor of a tortfeasor who traditionally could not complain because the victim of the tortious conduct elects to pursue less than all concurrent tortfeasors. Civil Code section 1714 declares \u201cthat \u2018[e]very one is responsible.. .for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill.. .. \u2019 A tortfeasor may not escape this responsibility simply because another act-\u2014either an \u2018innocent\u2019 occurrence such as an \u2018act of God\u2019 or other negligent conduct\u2014may also have been a cause of the injury.\u201d <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 578, 586.) \u201c[A] defendant has no equitable claim vis-a-vis an injured plaintiff to be relieved of liability for damage which he has proximately caused simply because some other tortfeasor\u2019s negligence may also have caused the same harm.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 589.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Although this court in <em>American Motorcycle </em>modified traditional rules to provide for partial indemnity based on comparative fault among concurrent tortfeasors, it did not purport either to create a cause of action where none otherwise existed, or to modify statutory claims procedures when a public entity is one of the tortfeasors. The relief judicially announced in <em>American Motorcycle </em>was thus deemed to be permissible in that case only because it was consistent with controlling statutory provisions. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 599-603.) We should hold that any judicially announced rule which would allow the presentation of a cause of action for damages against a public entity absent the filing of an administrative claim against the entity within the statutorily prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>period is impermissibly inconsistent with the Tort Claims Act. Whether a defendant should be afforded relief in these circumstances is clearly a legislative matter. In the words of Justice Feinberg, \u201cIn sum, we can find no reason in logic or in the statute to exempt an action for partial indemnity against a public entity from the claims procedure.\u201d <em>(Gehman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d 257, 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Similarly the policies underlying statutes of limitation will be substantially subverted by holding that the cause of action for partial indemnity arises not upon injury but upon payment. \u201c\u2018Statutes of limitation, like the equitable doctrine of laches, in their conclusive effects are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared. The theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Elling Corp. </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 353, 362 [142 Cal.Rptr. 696, 572 P.2d 755]; <em>Bollinger </em>v. <em>Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 399, 406-407 [154 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Permitting deferred accrual of the indemnity action will allow tortfeasors to avoid asserting causes of action against both public and private parties until after \u201cevidence is lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>It certainly is not unjust to require a defendant to assert his claims for partial indemnity within the statutory period after plaintiff\u2019s cause of action or injury occurs. The cross-defendants will then have the same opportunity to defend or to settle as does the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Given the substantial policies served by claims and limitation statutes, I must reject the majority\u2019s mechanical application of traditional indemnity principles. Those principles are based in part on a voluntary relationship between the tortfeasors\u2014a relationship ordinarily absent in partial indemnity cases. As pointed out above, this court in <em>American Motorcycle </em>departed from traditional indemnity principles in three respects\u2014settlement rules, workers\u2019 compensation and accrual of the cause of action for direct recovery\u2014in order to give effect to legislative policy. Similarly, giving effect to legislative policy rather than labels requires that the cause of action for partial indemnity accrue for claims and statute of limitations purposes at the time of injury to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>It is true that in a few cases, like the instant one, a defendant will not learn of the action against him until it is too late under claims and limitation statutes to proceed against another alleged tortfeasor who was not joined by plaintiff. However, this hardship should be viewed in the light of additional factors. If the plaintiff is free from negligence, the defendant is in the same position that he would have been under the contribution statutes prior to <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393], and <em>American Motorcycle. </em>If, on the other hand, plaintiff is contributorily negligent, he will recover less against a single defendant than he would have recovered had he prevailed against all defendants. Since plaintiffs recovery is determined by the relationship of his fault to that of all defendants, failure to join a defendant will always reduce his recovery. Defendants who are sued thus obtain a benefit from the negligent plaintiffs omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">I would issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent court (1) to vacate its orders overruling department\u2019s demurrer to \"Frost\u2019s cross-complaint and granting Hunter\u2019s motion for leave to cross-complain against department, (2) to sustain department\u2019s demurrer to Frost\u2019s cross-complaint, (3) to deny Hunter\u2019s motion for leave to cross-complain against department, and (4) to proceed in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied May 14, 1980. Clark, J., and Manuel, J., were of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
