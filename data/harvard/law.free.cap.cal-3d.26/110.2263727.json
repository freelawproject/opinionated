The dispute involves the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s appointment of a presiding justice of the Court of Appeal while the Governor was out of the state and the Governor\u2019s withdrawal of that appointment and substitution of his own appointee after his return to the state,  As hereafter developed, we conclude that the Lieutenant Governor has authority to exercise all gubernatorial powers of appointment while the Governor is physically absent from the state and that the Governor has authority to withdraw the appointment until the confirmation of appointment becomes effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Article V, section 10 of the Constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201c... The Lieutenant Governor shall act as Governor during the impeachment, absence from the State, or other temporary disability of the Governor or of a Governor-elect who fails to take office.\u201d The section also declares that this court shall have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions arising under this section,\u201d and confers exclusive standing to raise questions of temporary disability on \u201ca body provided by statute.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Legislation creating the Commission on the Governorship (Commission) as the body having such standing (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12070-12076) took effect concurrently with adoption of article V, section 10 on November 8, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The salient facts are undisputed: Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., left California for Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. on March 26, 1979, and returned on March 28, 1979, at 2:11 a.m., 40 hours later. On March 27, the executive assistant to Lieutenant Governor Mike Curb informed the Governor\u2019s secretary of the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s intention to appoint Judge Armand Arabian to the vacant presiding justiceship on the Court of Appeal. The executive assistant was advised that the Governor intended to appoint Justice Bernard S. Jefferson to .the vacancy and that Justice Jefferson\u2019s name had already been submitted to the State Bar for evaluation. On the same date, the Lieutenant Governor appointed Judge Arabian as Presiding Justice for the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division One. On March 28, the Governor withdrew the appointment of Judge Arabian previously submitted by the Lieutenant Governor and appointed Justice Jefferson to the vacancy and at the same time appointed Judge Arleigh M. Woods as Associate Justice to fill the vacancy created by appointment of Justice Jefferson as Presiding Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On May 7, 1979, Governor Brown and Justice Jefferson filed with this court a petition for writs of mandate and prohibition and for declaratory relief. Named respondents were Lieutenant Governor Curb, Judge Arabian, and the Commission on Judicial Appointments (the body with responsibility for confirming gubernatorial appointments of Court of Appeal justices).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Governor\u2019s petition prays that we direct the Commission on Judicial Appointments to act on the Jefferson appointment and that we declare that (1) no gubernatorial powers devolve on the Lieutenant Governor unless this court, on petition of the Commission, has first determined the existence of a temporary disability of the Governor, (2) the Arabian appointment is invalid because on March 27, the Governor \u201cwas not effectively \u2018absent from the state\u2019 within the meaning of article V, section 10, of the California Constitution,\u201d and (3) the Governor\u2019s withdrawal of the Arabian appointment prior to its confirmation was effective, leaving the Jefferson appointment the only one properly before the Commission on Judicial Appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>On May 21, 1979, the Commission filed a \u201cPetition for Determination of Questions under section 10 of Article V of the California Constitution.\u201d The Commission states the constitutional (art. V, \u00a7 10) and statutory authority for its petition (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12070 et seq.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> recites the controversy over the conflicting appointments to a single vacancy on the Court of Appeal, urges the importance of \u201cthe question of the power of the Lieutenant Governor to act as Governor during the physical absence of the Governor from the state,\u201d and prays that this court \u201cdetermine when the Governor is absent from the state within the meaning of Section 10 of article V of the California Constitution and, in so doing, set forth standards which may be applied to facts and circumstances which may foreseeably arise in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We deal first with our jurisdiction and the standing of petitioners to invoke it.  Our exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions arising under article V, section 10 is clear and unambiguous. The final sentence in the section states, however, that \u201c[standing to raise questions of vacancy or temporary disability is vested exclusively in a body provided by statute,\u201d namely, the Commission. As submitted to the Assembly by the Constitution Revision Commission, section 10 of article V provided for determining questions of vacancy and disability, but did not specify how or by whom the questions could be raised. The provision for exclusive standing in a statutory body was added to the draft on the floor of the Assembly (1 Assem. J. (1966 First Ex. Sess.) pp. 631, 705) at the request of the Office of the Governor, apparently for the purpose of forestalling frivolous or harassing attacks on the validity of gubernatorial actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">It is obvious that absence from the state is a temporary disability within the meaning of article V, section 10,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that any dispute as to the Governor\u2019s absence from the state is a matter with respect to which the Commission has exclusive standing before us. Once the question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>properly raised, however, nothing in the section\u2019s wording or aims prevents us from concurrently considering pleadings and arguments from interested persons on matters within the scope of the Commission\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">For purposes of establishing our present jurisdiction, therefore, we need not consider whether the questions raised by the Governor\u2019s petition concern \u201cvacancy or temporary disability,\u201d as to which the constitutional provision accords him no standing; the filing of the Commission\u2019s petition effects its standing to invoke our jurisdiction and permits us concurrently to consider the issues presented by the Governor\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Because our jurisdiction is exclusive it transcends the procedural limitations on appellate courts imposed by article VI, sections 10 and 11. Granting of relief, declaratory or otherwise, that ordinarily would be available only from trial courts may be appropriate here. We are not persuaded by the Commission\u2019s petition, however, that article V, section 10 calls on us to give advisory opinions. The petition alleges that \u201cthe question of the power of the Lieutenant Governor to act as Governor during the physical absence of the Governor from the state encompasses the entire spectrum of executive power\u201d and prays that in \u201cdetermin[ing] when the Governor is absent from the state within the meaning of [art. V, \u00a7 10]\u201d we \u201cset forth standards which may be applied to facts and circumstances which may foreseeably arise in the future.\u201d  It is well settled that rendering \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d is not a judicial duty imposed by article III, section 3, or article VI, sections 10 or 11 of the Constitution. <em>(Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 102, 119-120 [145 Cal.Rptr. 674, 577 P.2d 1014].)  Our \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions arising under\u201d article V, section 10 is subject to the same qualification. In this case the dispute concerning the Governor\u2019s disability due to absence involves a question that <em>has </em>arisen, and it is properly before us by petition of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We turn to the principal issue presented by the controversy, namely, the interpretation of the words \u201cabsence from the State.\u201d Preliminarily, we consider and reject the Governor\u2019s contention that under article V, section 10, his departure from the state can confer no gubernatorial power on the Lieutenant Governor without a prior petition to this court by the Commission, followed by this court\u2019s determination that the absence would constitute a temporary disability. It is argued that our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions arising under\u201d article V, section 10, makes us the only entity that can conclude authoritatively that the Governor is temporarily disabled by absence or other reason. The claimed prerequisite of a petition is based on the Commission\u2019s exclusive \u201c[standing to raise questions of vacancy or temporary disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We disagree. To require express judicial authorization before the Lieutenant Governor could act as Governor during the Governor\u2019s absence or other temporary disability would contravene the purpose of article V, section 10, to prevent gaps in the availability and continuity of the executive power. As explained in the discussion of our present jurisdiction, the Constitution charges us only with determining \u201cquestions\u201d of temporary disability, not with giving advisory opinions in the absence of dispute. The Lieutenant Governor\u2014like any public officer with executive duties\u2014must apply and, if necessary, interpret the law prescribing those duties as found in the Constitution, legislation, and authoritative decisions. Our role is to resolve controversies as to interpretation, not to dictate initial formulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The parties offer two possible interpretations of the words \u201cabsence from the State.\u201d The Governor proposes that the term \u201cabsence\u201d must be read as an \u201ceffective absence,\u201d an absence determined by the state\u2019s need at the time for the particular act by the official then physically present. The Lieutenant Governor, on the other hand, asserts that the term must be given its literal, common meaning of physical nonpresence. We conclude that constitutional and legislative history, contemporaneous interpretation and historical practice, and considerations of public policy, namely the need for certainty in effectuating executive decisions, support the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The words \u201cabsence from the state\u201d have remained unchanged in the California Constitution for 130 years despite several other changes in the pertinent clause. From 1849 to 1966, the Constitution provided that in case of the Governor\u2019s \u201cimpeachment\u201d or \u201cabsence from the State\u201d his duties \u201cdevolve upon\u201d the Lieutenant Governor \u201cuntil the disability shall cease.\u201d (Cal. Const, of 1849, art. V, \u00a7 17; Cal. Const, of 1879, art. V, \u00a7 16, with amendments of 1898, 1946 and 1948.) Present article V, section 10, adopted in 1966 and amended in 1974, similarly provides that the Lieutenant Governor \u201cshall act as Governor during the impeachment, absence from the State, or other temporary disability of the Governor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In 1966, during legislative discussion of the proposed amendment to article V, section 10, special counsel to the Constitution Revision Commission was asked the meaning of \u201cabsence from the state\u201d and its reference to \u201cdisability.\u201d Counsel\u2019s response indicated that \u201cabsence from the state\u201d meant physical absence in the literal sense; as to the use of the term \u201cdisability,\u201d he stated; \u201c. . . [T]he Commission felt that if the constitution should prohibit the Governor from acting then it should be classified as a disability. It is not an inability. The Governor could be someplace outside the state and be very capable of performing his duties by a long distance telephone. He would be legally disabled from doing so. Disability is more accurate.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Our attention has been called to no previous challenge in court to the proposition that the Governor\u2019s physical absence from California confers full gubernatorial power on a physically present Lieutenant Governor. The state government has functioned under this provision without any question that its language means what it plainly states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is argued that the word \u201cabsence\u201d should be interpreted to reflect modern conditions of travel and communication and that technology has eliminated in part the objections that drafters of the early Constitutions might have had to permitting the Governor to act from outside the state or to permitting postponement of gubernatorial actions until his return. We note that the Constitution Revision Commission could have proposed a change in the language in 1966 to reflect modern conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of travel and communication but did not do so. We are not persuaded that time or technology compels such a change by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We are mindful that some jurisdictions have interpreted similar provisions to prevent the acting governor or other executive from exercising full executive powers, or more precisely, to invalidate the acts of officials empowered to perform executive functions during the absence of the executive from the city or state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Governor embraces the theory propounded by these cases and contends that not merely physical absence but \u201ceffective\u201d absence must be shown before the substitute executive can act. The rationale of the cases that support his view is summarized in <em>Sawyer </em>(82 Nev. 53, 56 [410 P.2d 748]): \u201c\u2018absence\u2019 as contained within rules for orderly succession in government means \u2018effective absence\u2019\u2014i.e., an absence which is measured by the state\u2019s <em>need </em>at a given moment for a particular act by the official then physically not present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The conceptual difficulty with the effective-absence test is that virtually any physical absence of the Governor may create a need for action by an acting governor, at least to deal with emergencies. The Governor here does not claim any power to act from outside the state boundaries, nor does it appear that any such claim has ever been made by his predecessors. Since a physically absent Governor cannot act, the overriding purpose of avoiding a hiatus in the availability of executive power requires that, during the absence, the sole and entire power to act as Governor be transferred to a Lieutenant Governor who is physically within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Legislative enactments which implement article V, section 10, are in full accord with this view. Section 12002 of the Government Code provides that \u201cEvery law of this State relating to the powers and duties of the Governor and to acts and duties to be performed by others toward him extends to the person performing for the time being the duties of Governor.\u201d Section 12058 (Gov. Code), enacted in 1966, provides that \u201c[i]n case of impeachment of the Governor or officer acting as Governor, his <em>absence from the state, or his other temporary disability to discharge the powers and duties of office, </em>then the powers and duties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the office of Governor devolve upon the same officer as in the case of vacancy in the office of Governor, but only until the disability shall cease.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">There is no room in the all inclusive language of these statutes for a watered down \u201ceffective\u201d absence or any other concept whereby an acting governor could discharge some but not all of the duties of the governor in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Our conclusion is also in accord with the contemporaneous and settled interpretation of the constitutional provision by those charged with its execution. (See <em>State of South Dakota </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 765, 777-778 [144 Cal.Rptr. 758, 576 P.2d 473] and cases there cited.) We take judicial notice (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c)) of the more than 1,400 gubernatorial actions taken in the last 16 years by Lieutenant Governors or other acting governors during the Governor\u2019s absence. The unquestioned acceptance of these exercises of gubernatorial power is evidence of a settled contemporaneous construction deserving of great weight. <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Rancho Homes, Inc. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 764, 770-771 [256 P.2d 305]; <em>State of South Dakota </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at pp. 777-778.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cNot lightly vacated is the verdict of quiescent years.\u201d <em>(Anderson Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Luckett </em>(1944) 321 U.S. 233, 244 [88 L.Ed. 692, 703, 64 S.Ct. 599, 606, 151 A.L.R. 824], quoting from <em>Coler </em>v. <em>Corn Exchange Bank </em>(1928) 250 N.Y. 136, 141 [164 N.E. 882, 884, 65 A.L.R. 879].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The command that the Lieutenant Governor \u201cact as Governor\u201d during the Governor\u2019s absence (art. V, \u00a7 10) places upon the Lieutenant Governor complete, albeit temporary, responsibility for \u201c[t]he supreme executive power of the State\u201d and for \u201csee[ing] that the law is faithfully executed\u201d (art. V, \u00a7 1). As acting governor, the Lieutenant Governor is free to act on whatever matters he determines need attention during the Governor\u2019s absence. Thus, the appointment by Lieutenant Governor Curb of Judge Arabian as presiding justice of the Court of Appeal was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">There remains the question of the Governor\u2019s authority to revoke, rescind, or withdraw the appointment of Judge Arabian.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The Lieutenant Governor contends that his letter submitting the Arabian appointment to the Commission on Judicial Appointments exhausted the appointive power and could not be revoked by gubernatorial act. The leading statement of the principle relied on is in <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison </em>(1803) 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 [2 L.Ed. 60], where President Jefferson\u2019s Secretary of. State, Madison, was held to have a ministerial duty to deliver a document evidencing Marbury\u2019s appointment as justice of the peace made by outgoing President Adams with the advice and consent of the Senate. Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion states: \u201cThe last act to be done by the president is the signature of the commission: he has then acted on the advice and consent of the senate to his own nomination. The time for deliberation has then passed: he has decided. His judgment, on the advice and consent of the senate, concurring with his nomination, has been made, and the officer is appointed. This appointment is evidenced by an open unequivocal act; and being the last act required from the person making it, necessarily excludes the idea of its being, so far as respects the appointment, an inchoate and incomplete transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u201cSome point of time must be taken, when the power of the executive over an officer, not removable at his will, must cease. That point of time must be, when the constitutional power of appointment has been exercised. And this power has been exercised, when the last act, required from the person possessing the power, has been performed: this last act is the signature of the commission.\u201d (5 U.S. at p. 157 [2 L.Ed. at p. 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">California courts have followed that principle. (See <em>Weatherbee </em>v. <em>Cazneau </em>(1862) 20 Cal. 503 [Governor\u2019s interim appointment]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Mizner </em>(1857) 7 Cal. 519, 526 [same]; <em>MacAlister </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1934) 139 Cal.App. 183 [33 P.2d 469] [city council\u2019s appointment to vacant council seat].) On the other hand, uncompleted appointments are subject to withdrawal. (See <em>Conger </em>v. <em>Gilmer </em>(1867) 32 Cal. 75 [board of supervisors could reconsider appointment before issuing appointee a commission]; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Pardee </em>(1905) 1 Cal.App. 278 [82 P. 83].) Thus, in <em>Harrington, </em>Governor Pardee was held entitled to refuse to issue a commission to a person whose appointment by his predecessor had been confirmed by the Senate, since issuance of the commission was deemed a discretionary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Harrington </em>is distinguishable here because transmittal of an appointment to the Commission on Judicial Appointments completes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>gubernatorial action necessary to an appellate judicial appointment. Though the Governor issues commissions to new appellate judges (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 1340, subd. (d)), the Constitution makes the appointment \u201ceffective when confirmed by the Commission on Judicial Appointments.\u201d (Art. VI, \u00a7 16, subd. (d); see Gov. Code, \u00a7 68121 [confirmation \u201cis effective when filed in writing with the Secretary of State\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Even though submission for commission confirmation completes the gubernatorial action necessary for an appointment to an appellate judgeship, it does not complete the appointive process or confer even an interim right to assume office.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under those circumstances may the Governor withdraw the appointment before confirmation?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Past governors appear to have withdrawn appointments from commission consideration without challenge of their power to do so. (See Partial Rep. of Joint Judiciary Com. on Administration of Justice, pp. 38-39, 2 Appen. to Sen. J. (1959 Reg. Sess.), testimony of Chief Justice Gibson.) There are good reasons for upholding the power. The fact that the appointee has not yet acquired any rights eliminates the objection that withdrawal constitutes removal from office. The withdrawal power prolongs gubernatorial scrutiny of the appointment, furthering the confirmation\u2019s ultimate purpose of assuring thorough consideration of the candidate\u2019s qualifications. (See Nelson, <em>Variations on a Theme\u2014Selection and Tenure of Judges </em>(1962) 36 So.Cal.L.Rev. 4, 19-26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Finally, the general rule in other states is that \u201cwhere the nomination must be confirmed before the officer can take the office or exercise any of its functions, the power of removal is not involved and nominations may be changed at the will of the executive until title to the office is vested.\u201d <em>(McChesney </em>v. <em>Sampson </em>(1930) 232 Ky. 395, 401 [23 S.W. 2d 584]; accord: <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Osborn </em>(1942) 59 Ariz. 321 [127 P.2d 134] [upholding withdrawal]; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>(1971) 86 S.D. 71 [191 N.W.2d 281]; <em>In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor </em>(Fla. 1971) 247 So.2d 428, 433; <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Essling </em>(1964) 268 Minn. 151, 156 [128 N.W. 2d 307].) Therefore we conclude that Governor Brown\u2019s withdrawal of the Arabian appointment was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the Commission on Judicial Appointments to exercise its discretion with respect to the appointment of Justice Jefferson.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Tobriner, Acting C.

Justice Holmes once cautioned: \u201c[W]hen we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters... .The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago.... We must consider what this country has become. ...\u201d <em>(Missouri </em>v. <em>Holland </em>(1920) 252 U.S. 416, 433-434 [64 L.Ed. 641, 647-648, 40 S.Ct. 382, 11 A.L.R. 984].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">His wise admonition applies here, as does this comment by Chief Justice Hughes in <em>Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell </em>(1934) 290 U.S. 398, 442 [78 L.Ed. 413, 431-432, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481] (see also Miller, <em>The Elusive Search for Values in Constitutional Interpretation </em>(1979) 6 Hastings ConstL.Q. 487): \u201cIt is no answer to.. .insist that what the provision of the Constitution meant to the vision of that day it must mean to the vision of our time. If by the statement that what the Constitution meant at the time of its adoption it means to-day, it is intended to say that the great clauses of the Constitution must be confined to the interpretation which the framers, with the conditions and outlook of their time, would have placed upon them, the statement carries its own refutation. It was to guard against such a narrow conception that Chief Justice Marshall uttered the memorable warning\u2014\u2018We must never forget that it is a <em>constitution </em>we are expounding\u2019 (McC<em>ulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, 4 </em>Wheat. 316, 407)\u2014\u2018a constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various <em>crises </em>of human affairs.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>p. 415....

Article V, \u00a7 10 refers to other \u201ctemporary exercise of the Governor\u2019s functions\u201d; and it orders the Lieutenant Governor to \u201cact as Governor during the impeachment, absence from the State, or OTHER TEMPORARY DISABILITY of the Governor\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">My majority colleagues conclude that \u201cabsence\u201d means having crossed a state boundary. Might it rather mean now what the draftsmen intended it to mean 130 years ago; that is, absence constitutes a disability like other temporary disabilities when now, as then, <em>in fact </em>it is disabling? (Note again the words \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cable\u201d in art. IV, \u00a7 21 (b), quoted in my preceding paragraph.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">When the Governor is absent from the state is he in fact disabled from performing the duties of his office? Indeed he is not. Car-to-office, air-to-ground, and ship-to-shore calls are routine; so are conference calls and closed-circuit TV consultation. Many tasks that Governors have performed while temporarily residing in San Francisco or Los Angeles, say, could be done from any city, within or without California. Constant travelers such as the President of the United States, the Governors of other states with problems comparable to ours, the mayors of great cities, and countless government and corporate executives every day benefit from telecopiers, distance-ignoring word-processors, \u201ctalking\u201d typewriters, signature reproducers, instant information-retrieval, other marvels not affected by state or even international boundaries. (Cf. Hanna, <em>Law Office of the Future </em>(Feb. 1979) N.J. State Bar J. No. 86, p. 10; Brown, <em>N.Y.U. Law Professor to Teach on Coast via TV, </em>N.Y. Times (Sept. 5, 1979) (\u201can interactive hookup by satellite that will permit him to take questions and engage... in discussion for an hour\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>So therefore should we infer that, in the 20th century, absence is never disabling? The answer is No. The Lieutenant Governor (or his surrogate, should he too be temporarily disabled) must be alert not only \u201c[t]o meet the needs resulting from war-caused or enemy-caused disaster\u201d (art. IV, \u00a7 21) but also to act as Governor whenever the elected Governor suffers a true disability. It could be caused by serious illness. It could occur when he is incommunicado\u2014in a jungle or a mountain wilderness, for instance, or because of a natural disaster or other catastrophe. It could be the result of electronic or other malfunctioning. But the test should always be \u201cdisability.\u201d <em>Absence that is not disabling is not a temporary disability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The 1849 and 1879 constitutions talked of the Governor\u2019s \u201cinability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office\u201d and required the Lieutenant Governor to act \u201cuntil the disability shall cease.\u201d To hold in this Centennial Year 1979 that the 130-year-old tradition must be frozen until modernized by constitutional amendment seems almost irrational and yet radical. By no means does rationality call for a Gold Rush Days approach to governing. (See the quotations from Justices Holmes and Hughes, <em>supra.) </em>And when we contemplate its antiquated, stifling, and potentially hurtful impact on use of the executive power in our complex state, cannot the majority\u2019s approach here fairly be labeled radical (albeit reactionary)?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The majority concede that \u201cthe purpose of article V, section 10, [is] to prevent gaps in the availability and continuity of the executive power\u201d (a<em>nte, </em>p. 117); and they refer to \u201cpublic policy, namely the need for certainty in effectuating executive decisions\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p. 117). Yet neither the availability nor the continuity of executive power need be affected by mere absence. (See <em>In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor </em>(Fla. 1959) 112 So.2d 843.) Moreover, serious discontinuity and uncertainty and even bizarre effects can result from the pretense that \u201ca physically absent Governor cannot act.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 119. The Justice Jefferson vs. Judge Arabian contretemps here is illustrative; and cf. <em>Program of Would-Be Acting Governor Curbed, </em>S.F. Examiner (Nov. 8, 1979) p. 46.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>What Was the True Intent in 1966?</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The scores of individuals involved in the drafting and approval of the 1966 revision of the words concerning us that now are in effect (\u201cThe Lieutenant Governor shall act as Governor during the impeachment, absence from the State, or other temporary disability of the Governor\u201d) might have written, \u201cThe Lieutenant Governor shall act as Governor during the impeachment or other temporary disability of the Governor.\u201d Instead they included and thus preserved \u201cabsence from the State.\u201d Does that imply an intent in 1966 to cast in concrete all the old assumptions on what those four words demand? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In February 1966 the California Constitution Revision Commission submitted the first of many reports to the Legislature. It was lengthy (212 pages). It proposed <em>first, </em>that many words (16,000 out of 22,000) be deleted from the Constitution (from articles III to VIII and also XXIV); <em>second, </em>that many other words be left unchanged; <em>third, </em>that new wordings be adopted to effect major and minor revisions, several of them simplificatory only.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Was there an intent in 1966 to freeze the nonjudicial, archaic interpretation of \u201cabsence from the State\u201d that my majority colleagues now decree? Their opinion relies on excerpts from February 23, 1966, testimony before the Assembly Interim Committee on Constitutional Amendments. They summarize it as follows <em>(ante, </em>p. 118): \u201c[Sjpecial counsel to the Constitution Revision Commission was asked the meaning of \u2018absence from the state\u2019 and its reference to \u2018disability.\u2019 Counsel\u2019s response indicated that \u2018absence from the state\u2019 meant physical absence in the literal sense; as to the use of the term \u2018disability,\u2019 he stated: \u2018.. . [T]he Commission felt that if the Constitution should prohibit the Governor from acting then it should be classified as a disability. It is not an inability. The Governor could be some place outside the State and be very capable of performing his duties by a long distance telephone. He would be legally disabled from doing so. Disability is more accurate.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The quoted words (and also those in the majority\u2019s fn. 5) are best understood if we check the full testimony. \u201cTo use snippets.. .is perilous.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 514, at p. 539 [156 Cal.Rptr. 450, 596 P.2d 328] (conc. opn.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The Commission\u2019s special counsel and the staff attorney who testified with him understandably had to ad-lib many answers to often-tough questions put by legislators at the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I doubt that the special counsel, if pressed, could have documented his view (quoted in my excerpt from the majority opinion) as to what it was \u201cthe Commission felt.\u201d There were some 80 commissioners\u2014including 6 legislative members, 17 \u201cex officio legislative members,\u201d and 11 individuals who had resigned or died. The draft language that puzzles us here was a tiny segment of a huge set of initial recommendations. Most commissioners, obviously, \u201cfelt\u201d nothing whatsoever on our subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Regarding what \u201cthe Commission [might have] felt,\u201d are not the most reliable guides the words that appear in the Commission\u2019s formal proposal? It read: \u201cThe Lieutenant Governor. .. shall act as Governor during the impeachment, absence from the State, or other temporary disability of the Governor. .. .The Legislature shall provide for an order of precedence after the Lieutenant Governor. . .for the temporary exercise of [the Governor\u2019s] functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">To be contrasted are certain words (which I now bracket and italicize) that the Commission proposed to delete from the then existing Constitution, as amended in 1948: \u201cIn case of impeachment of the Governor ..., his absence from the State, or his other temporary disability <em>[to discharge the powers and duties of </em>office], then the powers and duties of the Office of Governor devolve upon the same officer as in the case of vacancy in the Office of Governor <em>[but only until the disability shall cease].\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">It seems clear that the proposed deletion of \u201cto discharge the powers and duties of office\u201d evidenced no intent to change \u201cother temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>disability\u201d and that the deletion of \u201cbut only until the disability shall cease\u201d involved mere style. Those two phrases are helpful, though, in analyzing the 1946 deletion of the word \u201cinability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Inability and Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Readers will recall, from an earlier paragraph in this opinion, the dictum of the Revision Commission\u2019s special counsel that \u201c[Disability. . .is not an inability.\u201d The 1849 constitution provided that \u201cthe powers and duties of the office shall devolve upon the Lieutenant Governor. .. until the disability shall cease\u201d; and \u201cdisability\u201d meant impeachment, absence from the State, and <em>\u201cinability </em>to discharge the powers and duties of the office\u201d (italics added). There was no change in 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In 1946 the clause was amended to read, \u201cIn case of the impeachment of the Governor..., his absence from [the] State, or his other temporary disability to discharge the powers and duties of office, then the powers and duties of the office of Governor devolve..., but only until the disability shall cease.\u201d <em>In this lawsuit there is not even a scrap of evidence that suggests any intent by anyone in 1946 to distinguish \u201cdisability\u201d from \u201cinability\u201d </em>For nearly a century the words had been treated as synonymous. After 1946 they still were synonymous. The special counsel erred, I think, when he ad-libbed his brief comment in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Further, a Revision Commission memo on \u201cPresentation of proposed Article V,\u201d addressed by the staff attorney on April 7, 1966, to the Chairman of the Commission, the Chairman of its Article V Committee, and the Chairman of its Drafting Committee, on page 3 states: \u201cStandard of \u2018temporary disability\u2019 has a sufficiently definite and understood meaning to serve as a reasonable guideline for the court. Additional detail might bind the court, in a situation which we cannot now foresee, in a way that defeats the otherwise clear purpose underlying the scheme of succession and disability provisions.\u201d What was that clear purpose? It was to have the \u201cscheme of succession\u201d take effect whenever the Governor becomes temporarily disabled, for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Quite comparable is this excerpt from the hearings: \u201cSong: ... [W]hat if a Governor is so physically disabled he\u2019s confined to bed? His mental process is working quite well. I would assume, then, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>what you say, that the court can declare the office vacant. [If] [Staff Attorney]: They would have that authority, yes, subject to all the responsibilities placed upon a judiciary construing the Constitution. [If] Song: Shouldn\u2019t certain limitations be spelled out in the Constitution? [IT] [Staff Attorney]: We felt that the spelling out of certain limitations and describing specific situations left the body which has to make this ultimate determination, a very difficult determination, really insufficient tools to do it with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Nonetheless the majority opinion here does spell out an indisputably needless limitation; i.e., that mere absence is a disability, always.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In sum, analysis and history justify a conclusion that \u201cabsence from the State\u201d does mean now what it meant when it was first written. In 1979, as in 1849, absence should effect the transfer of gubernatorial power only when in fact it is disabling, temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Official Travel?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">A hidden weakness in the majority opinion is disclosed when we examine its reach. Californians are advised that <em>\u201cthe sole and entire power </em>to act as Governor\u201d is transferred to the Lieutenant Governor when he is within the state while the Governor is outside <em>(ante, </em>p. 119; italics added). Similarly he has <em>\u201ccomplete, </em>albeit temporary, responsibility\u201d; and he is \u201cfree to act on <em>whatever matters </em>he determines need attention during the Governor\u2019s absence\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p. 120; italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">What those words overlook is that most travels by modern Governors are for official state purposes. Most trips involve something more than seeking federal office, exploring a distant continent, or vacationing with family or friends. Yet if the Lieutenant Governor truly does have \u201cthe sole and entire power,\u201d if his duties do involve \u201ccomplete...responsibility,\u201d if he is \u201cfree to act on whatever matters he determines need attention,\u201d then may he not legally intervene in the official projects of the traveling Governor?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">To illustrate: How should a Congressional committee respond if a telegram or phone call from a Sacramento-based Lieutenant Governor purports to negate the on-going testimony of a Governor who is in Washington, D.C., to describe California\u2019s emergency needs? When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Governor is absent here but present there, who articulates authoritatively our state\u2019s concerns at the out-of-state headquarters of the innumerable officials who, pursuant to negotiations that might involve the Governor, supply federal funds for state use? Who speaks and acts for California at Governors\u2019 sessions, at formal meetings with other-state and overseas investors, at innumerable other \u201coutside forums\u201d where the Governor\u2019s main concerns demonstrably are official concerns?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The majority opinion fails to recognize those questions. It ignores even more intricate questions as to the need for limitations on a Lieutenant Governor\u2019s power to undermine indirectly, in Sacramento, gubernatorial projects outside the state that for various reasons an ambitious Lieutenant Governor might not wish to countermand or modify directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s words are so comprehensive that they may even authorize improbable, yo-yo-like contests regarding rescission or revocation of prior acts of the Governor. In this case, for example, what might have happened if the Lieutenant Governor, after March 28, 1979, and during a subsequent absence of the Governor, had withdrawn the Jefferson appointment and reappointed Arabian?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">I conclude by quoting the possibly prophetic comment of a legislator during the 1966 committee hearings: \u201cAssuming we have a Democratic Governor and a Republican'Lieutenant Governor, I can see the court getting into the midst of a tremendous political brawl. . .</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">If, hypothetically, Earl Warren had been Chief Justice of California and not a politically ambitious Governor, would he have construed \u201cabsence from the State\u201d restrictively? Cf. the majority\u2019s footnote 8 and also Rodda, <em>The not-always-accurate memoirs of Earl Warren, </em>(Nov. 1977) Cal. J. page 378.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">That sometimes the correct answers were not known is shown by this exchange: \u201cWILLSON:.. .What is the process in the Constitution for impeaching the Governor of the State of California? Is there a trial by the Assembly and trial by the Senate? [\u00b6] [SPECIAL counsel]: He is tried by the Assembly, I believe, he is tried by the lower house. [\u00b6] WILLSON: Is there a written charge that claims he should be impeached on certain charges? Is that the way it operates? [\u00b6] [SPECIAL COUNSEL]: The specific form, the pleading, is not in the Constitution, Mr. Willson, and I\u2019m not sure what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">One wonders why the staff attorney said that \u201cthe Supreme Court could provide for an acting Governor\u201d in this excerpt: \u201c[I]f the Governor were merely impeached the Supreme Court could provide for an acting Governor in the Lieutenant Governor who would take over the duties of office until the Governor was either convicted, in which case the Lieutenant Governor would become Governor, or was acquitted, in which case the Governor would resume his office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The two excerpts exemplify the kind of partially correct answering that often typifies legislative committee hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
