The matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to further remand to the city council \u201cfor proceedings in the manner required by law, particularly as required by section 11526, subdivision (c), of the Business and Professions Code.. .; and as required by the case of <em>Topanga Assn. For A Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>11 Cal.3d 506...with respect to making findings.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 838-839.) Thereafter the trial court issued its peremptory writ mandating the council to set aside the earlier approval, to reconsider the application and to take further action as enjoined by law upon the council and other subordinate agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">City prepared an environmental impact report (EIR) and again approved the proposed subdivision. In further proceedings for discharge of the peremptory writ in the trial court, plaintiffs contended the EIR had not been submitted for public discussion and that city had, in the interim, prepared a second EIR relating to an alternate plan of develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>ment. The trial court issued a supplemental peremptory writ, commanding city to vacate its later approval of the proposed subdivision, to prepare a draft integrated EIR relating to all reasonably available alternative methods of developing the property\u2014including methods proposed by plaintiffs\u2014and to submit the draft EIR for public discussions prior to preparation of a final report, all in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Defendants appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Although issuing its supplemental peremptory writ as prayed for by plaintiffs, the trial court rejected certain of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. Plaintiffs appeal, contending (1) that particular council members should have been disqualified from voting on the proposed subdivision because the real party and its agents and representatives had made political contributions to campaign committees controlled by such council members; (2) that certain council members had failed to exercise their discretion on mandated reconsideration of the application; (3) that the city had not followed mandated procedures on reconsideration; (4) that the evidence does not support findings that the proposed subdivision is consistent with the general district plan \u201cincluding specifically density and minimizing of grading;\u201d and (5) that the evidence does not support council findings that the subdivision, its site, design and improvements are consistent with applicable general and specific plans, are physically suitable for the type of proposed development and density, are not likely to cause substantial environmental damage, and will not conflict with easements for access through or use of the property within the subdivision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Council Members Are Not Disqualified by Reason of Campaign Contributions</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">The issue most vigorously argued on appeal is plaintiffs\u2019 contention that council members who had received campaign contributions from parties having a financial interest in an application before the council are disqualified from considering and voting on that application. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention is based on the fair hearing requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The trial court found real party, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>law and engineering firms, and members of such firms, had \u201cmade substantial contributions of money to the campaign committees of [the council\u2019s] bare majority [of members voting to approve the proposed subdivision]. The sum of these gifts exceeded $9,000.00. [Real party] and representatives also made contributions of money to the campaign committees controlled by two members of [the council] who absented themselves from the Council\u2019s vote on [the subdivision], and two other members who voted against the approval.\u201d The trial court concluded that, \u201cThe approval by members of [the council] whose campaign committees had received campaign contributions from real party in interest... or its representatives in the court-mandated reconsideration of [the application] did not deny petitioners a fair trial within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 or otherwise invalidate [council\u2019s] approval of [the application]. Absent a showing of bribery or conflict of interest, the law does not render it improper for members of [the council] to vote on projects of developers who have given campaign contributions to committees controlled by those members, and the law does not require such council members to disqualify themselves in such circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Expression of political support by campaign contribution does not prevent a fair hearing before an impartial city council within the meaning of section 1094.5. That section requires that on judicial review of administrative decisions the trial court\u2019s inquiry shall extend to \u201cwhether there was a fair trial\u201d or \u201cany prejudicial abuse of discretion.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 accusation that receipt of a campaign contribution inevitably results in an appearance of bias or prevents a fair hearing is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Plaintiffs do not contend the contributions were bribes for favorable votes. Nor did all recipients vote in favor of the proposed subdivision. The contributions were lawfully made and received pursuant to laws governing campaign contributions. The Political Reform Act of 1974 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 81000 et seq.) provides for disclosure of campaign contributions by recipients of contributions rather than disqualification of recipients from acting in matters in which the contributor is interested. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 81002, subd. (a), 84200 et seq.) While the act precludes an elected official from participating in a decision in which he has \u201ca financial interest\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 87100),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it expressly excludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>from definition of \u201cfinancial interest\u201d the receipt of campaign contributions. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 87103, subd. (c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 82030, subd. (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>) Thus, the Political Reform Act\u2014dealing comprehensively with problems of campaign contribution and conflict of interest\u2014does not prevent a city council member from acting upon a matter involving the contributor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Political contribution involves an exercise of fundamental freedom protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 2 of the California Constitution. <em>(Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo </em>(1975) 424 U.S. 1, 14-15, 22 [46 L.Ed.2d 659, 684-685, 689, 96 S.Ct. 612]; <em>Hardie </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 371, 377 [134 Cal.Rptr. 201, 556 P.2d 301]; <em>Citizens for Jobs &amp; Energy </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 671, 674-675 [129 Cal.Rptr. 106, 547 P.2d 1386].) To disqualify a city council member from acting on a development proposal because the developer had made a campaign contribution to that member would threaten constitutionally protected political speech and associational freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Governmental restraint on political activity must be strictly scrutinized and justified only by compelling state interest. <em>(Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, supra, </em>424 U.S. 1, 25 [46 L.Ed.2d 659, 691].)  While disqualifying contribution recipients from voting would not prohibit contributions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>it would curtail contributors\u2019 constitutional rights. Representative government would be thwarted by depriving certain classes of voters (i.e., developers, builders, engineers, and attorneys who are related in some fashion to developers) of the constitutional right to participate in the electoral process.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">Public policy strongly encourages the giving and receiving of campaign contributions. Such contributions do not automatically create an appearance of unfairness. Adequate protection against corruption and bias is afforded through the Political Reform Act and criminal sanctions. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 165;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 67 et seq.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Plaintiffs further complain because city did not on remand follow normal procedures for approval of a proposed subdivision. This would have required approval first by subordinate, agencies followed by appeals eventually to the city council. However, we do not now consider procedures to be followed upon initiation of an application for approval of a proposed subdivision. The procedures to be followed in this case were dictated, first, by the Court of Appeal in remanding the cause to the trial court (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>and then by the trial court in its peremptory writ.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The writ expressly affords to city an election either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>start the approval process anew, or merely to reconsider the application at the city council level. When the alternative language first appeared in the proposed judgment following remand, plaintiffs challenged it and sought clear direction that the approval process be commenced anew. Their challenge failed in the trial court and they did not seek review of the form of judgment. The city council, in compliance with the writ, elected to reconsider the application without referring the matter to subordinate agencies. It thus appears city has complied with the direction of the writ insofar as it was required to remand the cause to subordinate agencies, and plaintiffs are now precluded by law of the case from challenging city\u2019s election.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Other Contentions Urged by Plaintiffs on Appeal Need Not Be Considered</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Because we conclude for reasons discussed below that the trial court properly vacated the city\u2019s order approving the subdivision, we need not address certain of plaintiffs\u2019 additional challenges to the approval. Such challenges are embodied in plaintiffs\u2019 objections to trial court findings with respect to compliance with mandated procedures and the compatibility of the subdivision and various requirements of the governing general plan. As hereinafter appears, a new EIR will necessarily be prepared on remand and the city will be required to consider again approval of the plan if resubmitted. Issues of noncompliance in procedures leading to the now-vacated order of approval are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Defendants\u2019 Appeal Is Not Moot</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">A preliminary issue is presented before considering defendants\u2019 substantive contentions on appeal. Plaintiffs urge defendants\u2019 appeal is moot because the city has, since this appeal, caused a new EIR to be prepared in accordance with the supplemental writ. There have not been, so far as we are aware, proceedings in the city council on the new EIR nor, of course, determination by the trial court that defendants have in fact complied with the supplemental writ. Clearly, the question whether the city has complied with CEQA procedures is not moot, and requires our review for a proper disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Defendants\u2019 Appeal Is Without Merit</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The net effect of the judgment is that the city\u2014in approving the subdivision\u2014failed to follow proper procedures, and that it must vacate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>approval and reconsider the application. The trial court grounded its judgment on conclusions of law, first, that defendants had failed to consult with plaintiffs \u201cearly in the preparation of the draft EIR, as required by the California Administrative Code, title 14, section 15085(b), and the City of Los Angeles CEQA Guidelines....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">The trial court further found that defendants had prepared two EIRs, one for the proposed 123-unit development, and a later one for a 73-unit development. The court concluded that defendants had \u201cthereby failed to prepare a single integrated EIR on those developments as required by California Administrative Code, title 14, section 15061(f),\u201d and that the council had accordingly been precluded from \u201cfully, fairly and openly determining whether there are feasible alternatives to [the proposed subdivision] and whether specific economic, social or other considerations make infeasible such alternatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">As to the trial court\u2019s determination of defendants\u2019 failure to consult with plaintiffs during early preparation of the draft EIR, defendants contend informal communications between plaintiffs and the city agency preparing the EIR on the 123-unit development, in combination with public hearings on the draft EIR after its preparation, satisfies requirements of law. Defendants\u2019 contention is basically a factual challenge to court findings on the issue in dispute. As to such issues the court found the proposed final EIR recited that during preparation of the draft city agencies were in \u201cregular communication\u201d with plaintiffs\u2019 representatives and \u201con numerous occasions\u201d discussed the proposed project and draft EIR, that plaintiffs\u2019 representatives had access to the EIR file and were sent copies of the draft EIR \u201capproximately one month prior to commencement of the formal circulation period,\u201d and that the \u201citems of environmental concern\u201d to plaintiffs were documented and known to the concerned city agency \u201cand were addressed in such draft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The trial court neverthel\u00e9ss further found defendants had failed \u201cto seek the citizens\u2019 comments in time to influence the preparation and content of the draft EIR,\u201d that although city was aware of plaintiffs\u2019 opposition, it failed prior to publication of the draft EIR \u201cto solicit the citizens\u2019 specific environmental comments or objections for use in preparation of\u201d the draft EIR, and that citizens\u2014not the city\u2014\u201cinitiated the contacts with the planning staff prior to publication of the draft EIR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>It must be apparent that in serving the policy of CEQA it is necessary to secure all conflicting views prior to preparation of even a draft EIR. Once a draft has been prepared by persons who have not had full opportunity to be apprised of all conflicting views, it becomes more difficult for those persons to accept at full value new views necessarily critical of the draft. Such contrary views cannot be weighed with the same objective balance had they been considered at the time of initial presentation. Moreover, in the interest of more efficient administration of CEQA\u2014and inefficient administration of the act could impose intolerable burdens\u2014all related views whether in favor of or against a specific proposal should be openly and timely solicited by or on behalf of those charged with preparation of the draft.  Because evidence in the instant case is conflicting there is substantial support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs were not afforded a fair opportunity to express their views at a time sufficiently early to receive even-handed consideration on the draft and revised EIRs.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">As to the trial court\u2019s conclusion city had failed to prepare an integrated EIR for the project, city contends it is required to prepare but one report for each \u201cproject,\u201d and that real party\u2019s alternative proposals are for separate projects. An analysis of the environmental change resulting from a proposed development is incomplete unless the proposed alternative developments are also considered and reported. The \u201cproject\u201d constitutes the entire tract of land proposed for development by the applicant. Real party proposes only alternative developments\u2014whether for 123 or 73 building sites\u2014of the same project. City must consider such alternatives in a single report.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The judgment is affirmed. All parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Real party seeks to develop a tract of land in the Santa Monica Mountains within the city. It is- claimed extensive grading and fill required to accommodate the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>123 homesites included within the proposed subdivision would severely alter the hill configuration in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"AbyP\">City is not named a party defendant. References herein to action by the city relate to actions by the city council and subordinate agencies of the council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The opinion recites that \u201cAlthough the Legislature has expressly provided (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11526, subd. (c), 11526.2, subd. (c), 11549.5) that the advisory agency, appeal board (planning commission), or governing body (city council) shall not approve a tentative subdivision map unless it first finds that the proposed subdivision is consistent with the applicable general and specific plans, there was no express finding by any of those agencies that the proposed subdivision herein was consistent with the district plan (which was a part of general plan).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The opinion also states: \u201cThe petitioners, in addition to raising the issue as to whether the proposed subdivision was consistent with the district plan, raised issues such as to whether the proposed subdivision would cause excess traffic and whether an environmental impact report was required. Failure by the council (and planning commission) to make findings to support its ultimate decision resulted in inability of a reviewing court to bridge the analytic gap between the evidence and the ultimate decision of the council (and planning commission). (See <em>Topanga Assn. For A Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>11 Cal.3d 506, <em>supra.)\u201d (Id., </em>at pp. 837-838.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">The Court of Appeal left open the question of an award of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fees on appeal. A motion for such fees was denied on remand, but on appeal we reversed the order of denial and remanded the matter for reconsideration pursuant to recently enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 927-938 [154 Cal.Rptr. 503, 593 P.2d 200].) Such issues are not now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The matters appealed from by plaintiffs are not incorporated in the judgment, but are conclusions of law based on specific findings of fact by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Section 87100 provides: \u201cNo public official at any level of state or local government shall make, participate in making or in any way attempt to use his official position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>influence a governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Section 87103, subdivision (c), provides: \u201cAn official has a financial interest in a decision within the meaning of Section 87100 if it is reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material financial effect, distinguishable from its effect on the public generally, on.. .(c) any source of income, other than loans by a commercial lending institution in the regular course of business, aggregating two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or more in value received by or promised to the public official within twelve months prior to the time when the decision is made;...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Section 82030, subdivision (b), provides: \u201c\u2018Income\u2019 also does not include: (1) campaign contributions required to be reported under Chapter 4 of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b902-10\">The Political Reform Act is also concerned with a public official\u2019s involvement in decision-making in which he may have a financial interest. Government Code section 87100 provides that a public official \u201cat any level of state or local government\u201d shall not \u201cmake, participate in making or in any way attempt to use his official position to influence a governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest.\u201d However, section 87101 provides in pertinent part: \u201cSection 87100 does not prevent any public official from making or participating in the making of a governmental decision to the extent his participation is legally required for the action or decision to be made.\u201d Before land can be put to a particular use an application is \u201clegally required\u201d to be approved by a city\u2019s legislative body (i.e., the city council)\u2014 either directly in response to the application or on appeal from the decision of a subordinate agency. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 66452.1, 66452.2, 66452.5; see also Los Angeles Mun. Code, \u00a7 17.06.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Section 165 provides in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person who gives or offers a bribe to any member of any common council, board of supervisors, or board of trustees of any county, city and county, city, or public corporation, with intent to corruptly influence such member in his action on any matter or subject pending before, or which is afterward to be considered by, the body of which he is a member, and every member of any of the bodies mentioned in this section who receives, or offers or agrees to receive any bribe upon any understanding that his official vote, opinion, judgment, or action shall be influenced thereby, or shall be given in any particular manner or upon any particular side of any question or matter, upon which he may be required to act in his official capacity, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention might well be self-defeating should they prevail. If a political contribution automatically disqualifies the recipient after his election from considering and acting on' matters in which the contributor has an interest, the enterprising developer could disqualify all known environmentalists who are running for municipal office by making nominal contributions to the campaign committees of such persons. Future applications of the developer could then be judged by a panel from which all known environmentalists have been disqualified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b903-8\">The writ provides in part as follows: \u201cWe command you immediately upon receipt of this writ to set aside your decisions approving Tentative Tract 28569 (which proceedings are hereby remanded to respondent City Council which may in its discretion further remand these proceedings, if necessary, to respondents Planning Commission and Advisory Agency), and to reconsider your actions in light of this Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to take any further action specially enjoined upon you by law; but nothing in this Writ shall limit or control in any way the discretion legally vested in you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b906-7\">BIRD, C.

Surely the amount of the contribution, its timing, its method, as well as the signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>canee of the issue being considered, would be relevant in judging the appearance of bias. While the specter of a decision maker having received large campaign contributions from one of the parties in the adjudication process is troubling and a worthy subject for scrutiny (cf. <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 518 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12]), a legislative body is better equipped to initially address this problem. It can more easily determine whether existing requirements governing disclosure of conflict of interest are sufficient to ensure fair hearings before city councils. (Cf. <em>First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 765, 789 [55 L.Ed.2d 707, 725-726, 98 S.Ct. 1407].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Accordingly, it is not the place of this court to declare, as does the majority, that \u201c[a]dequate protection against corruption and bias is afforded through the Political Reform Act and criminal sanctions.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 947.) Whether or not this is true is a matter for the Legislature to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The presence of an unbiased tribunal has long been regarded as an essential component of due process of law. <em>(In re Murchison </em>(1955) 349 U.S. 133, 136 [99 L.Ed. 942, 946, 75 S.Ct. 623]; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Kiff (1912) </em>407 U.S. 493, 501-502 [33 L.Ed.2d 83, 93-94, 92 S.Ct. 2163].) It is essential if our political and jurisprudential systems are to function. Indeed, little value would attach to other procedural protections if the decision makers were biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Sensitive to the importance that fairness plays in our political and legal processes, the courts have repeatedly held that furtherance of these objectives justifies infringing on the very \u201cfundamental rights\u201d at issue in this case. (E.g., <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 1, 26-29 [46 L.Ed.2d 659, 691-694, 96 S.Ct. 612] [upholding recordkeeping, reporting and disclosure requirements, as well as a limitation on campaign contributions]; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 772, 780, 782-783 [160 Cal.Rptr. 102, 603 P.2d 19] [upholding disclosure requirements]; <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 46-48 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46] [upholding registration and reporting requirements]; <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345] [upholding a conflict of interest law and disclosure requirements]; <em>Morial </em>v. <em>Judiciary Com\u2019n. of State of La. </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 565 F.2d 295, cert. den. 435 U.S. 1013 [56 L.Ed.2d 395, 98 S.Ct. 1887] [upholding statute and canon of judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ethics requiring a judge to resign from the bench when running for an elective, nonjudicial office]. Cf. <em>Hardie </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 371, 378 [134 Cal.Rptr. 201, 556 P.2d 301].) The majority\u2019s assertion to the contrary is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The majority correctly note that a campaign contribution does not constitute a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d which could precipitate the official\u2019s disqualification under the Political Reform Act of 1974. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 945.) Therefore, the act is not available as a basis for precluding the defendant council members from participating in the underlying proceeding. However, the majority proceed to suggest that even if there were a conflict of interest, the participation of the council members would be permitted. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>fn. 7.) This unnecessary observation is not only gratuitous but erroneous as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Government Code section 87101 provides that an official otherwise disqualified from participating in a decision under Government Code section 87100 may act if <em>\u201chis participation </em>is legally required.. . .\u201d (Italics added.) While the city council may be required to act in the present case\u2014a conclusion which is disputed by plaintiffs and which the court need not decide\u2014the disqualification of a particular member would not preclude the council from acting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of the general objective of the act to avoid having officials participate in decisions affecting their financial interests (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 81001, subd. (b), 87100), it would appear more reasonable to construe section 87101 to permit participation only where a governmental decision requires the <em>individual\u2019s </em>participation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a construction is consistent with regulations promulgated by the Fair Political Practices Commission mandating a narrow construction for the exception in Section 87101. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 2, \u00a7 18701, subd. (c).)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In fact, two members of the council did not participate in the challenged vote. There is no suggestion that the council\u2019s action was defective for that reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-8\">This construction is also consistent with the second sentence of section 87101, which provides that \u201c[t]he fact that an official\u2019s vote is needed to break a tie does not make his participation legally required for purposes of this section.\u201d Again, the emphasis is on the status of the individual official, not the body of which he or she is a member.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b908-6\">NEWMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuJ\">I concur in the result. I share the Chief Justice\u2019s concern regarding the majority\u2019s pronouncement that \u201c[a]dequate protection against corruption and bias is afforded...\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 947). I also agree with her view regarding the interpretation of Government Code section 87101 <em>(ante, </em>this page, above).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Regarding the difficulties that confront legislators and judges who in the future will struggle with the problem of campaign contributions to adjudicators see, e.g., <em>The Robed Politician </em>(Mar. 1979) 2 L.A. Law. pages 10, 30; cf. my dissents in <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 50-54 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46], and <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1979), <em>id., </em>772, 801-802 [160 Cal.Rptr. 102, 603 P.2d 19]. Money has been called \u201cthe mother\u2019s milk of politics\u201d. Campaign contributions, unfortunately, seem likely to become the mother\u2019s milk of nonpolitical as well as political elections.</p>\n<author id=\"b909-4\">TOBRINER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHX\">I join in the majority opinion upon my understanding that nothing in that opinion is intended to preclude the Legislature or a local governmental entity from enacting appropriately defined legislation providing for the disqualification of a decisionmaker in a quasi-judicial proceeding on the basis of the decisionmaker\u2019s receipt of campaign contributions from a party to the proceeding. We have no such disqualifying legislation in the present case. Thus the majority correctly holds that in the absence of such provision the fact that a decisionmaker has received a campaign contribution does not automatically demonstrate bias or the appearance of bias. The receipt of such a contribution does not preclude the decisionmaker\u2019s participation in the proceeding under the \u201cfair hearing\u201d principles of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 or of the due process sections of the state or federal Constitutions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
