We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">The defendant, Vincent Bugliosi (Bugliosi), was at one time a deputy district attorney, and in this capacity prosecuted and obtained a conviction against Charles Manson and certain of his coterie for the highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>publicized crimes collectively referred to as the Tate-LaBianca killings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bugliosi has been recognized by the public as being an authority on these killings and on the members and activities of that loose-knit group of persons known as the Manson Family.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Bugliosi and the other defendants are variously the authors and publishers of the book Helter-Skelter, which purports to be an inside account of the Tate-LaBianca killings, the subsequent murder trial and of the criminal activities of the Manson Family.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The edition of the book complained of is more than 650 pages long. Its cover proclaims its nature as an inside account of the \u201cwhole story \u2014including the never-before-revealed \u2018retaliation\u2019 slayings\u2014of the most baffling mass murder case in the annals of American crime....\u201d At the outset the book sets forth a \u201ccast of characters.\u201d Included is Ronald Hughes (Hughes), described as being \u201conce Charles Manson\u2019s \u2018hippie lawyer,\u2019 he later defended Leslie Van Houten [member of Manson family on trial in the Tate-LaBianca matter], up until the time he was murdered by the Family.\u201d The killing of Hughes is described as being one of the first of the retaliation murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The book further raises questions about the proficiency of the various police agencies involved in the investigation activities of the Manson clan, the failure to pursue leads and the destruction and overlooking of evidence being noted continually throughout the book.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The book recounts events in great detail leading up to the prosecution of Manson and others. It was in the course of this trial that Hughes, while representing Leslie Van Houten, failed to appear at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, plaintiff refers us to the following account;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201cWhen court resumed on Monday, November 30, Ronald Hughes was absent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\u201cQuizzed by [Judge] Older, none of the other defense attorneys knew where he was. Fitzgerald said that he had last talked to Ron on Thursday or Friday, and that he sounded O.K. at that time. Hughes often spent his weekends camping at Sespe Hot Springs.... It was possible that Hughes had been stranded there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cThe next day we learned that Hughes had gone to Sespe on Friday with two teenagers, James Forsher and Lauren Elder, in Miss Elder\u2019s Volkswagen. The pair\u2014who were questioned but not held\u2014said that when it began raining, they had decided to return to L.A., but Hughes had decided to stay over until Sunday. When the two tried to leave, however, their auto became mired down, and they were forced to abandon it and hike out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201cThree other youths had seen Hughes on the morning of the following day, Saturday the twenty-eighth. He was alone. .., well away from the flood area. Chatting with them briefly, he appeared neither ill nor in any danger. Polygraphed, the three were found to have no additional knowledge and they were not held. Since Forsher and Elder had last seen Hughes a day earlier, they apparently were not polygraphed and their story was taken at face value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">\u201cOwing to the continued bad weather, it was two days before the Ventura Sheriff\u2019s Office could get up a helicopter to search the area. In the meantime, rumors abounded. One was to the effect that Hughes had deliberately skipped, either to avoid argument or to sabotage the trial. Knowing Ron, I seriously doubted if this was true. I became convinced it wasn\u2019t when reporters visited the place where Hughes lived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cHe slept on a mattress in a garage behind the home of a friend. According to reporters, the place was a mess\u2014one remarked that he wouldn\u2019t even let his dog sleep there. But on the wall of the garage, neatly framed and carefully hung, was Ronald Hughes\u2019 bar certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">\u201cAlthough there were numerous reports that a man fitting Hughes\u2019 description had been seen in various places\u2014boarding a bus in Reno, driving on the San Bernardino freeway, drinking at a bar in Baja\u2014none checked out. On December 2, Judge Older told Leslie Van Houten that he felt a co-counsel should be brought in to represent her during Hughes\u2019 absence. Leslie said she would refuse any other attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\u201cOn December 3, after consulting with Paul Fitzgerald, Older appointed Maxwell Keith co-counsel for Leslie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">\u201cA quiet, somewhat shy man in his mid-forties, whose conservative clothing and courtroom manner were in sharp contrast to those of Hughes, Keith had an excellent reputation in the legal community. Those who knew him well described him as conscientious, totally ethical, and completely professional, and it was clear from the start that he would be representing his client and not Manson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201cSensing this, Manson asked to have all the defense attorneys dismissed (\u2018they aren\u2019t our lawyers; they won\u2019t listen to us\u2019) so he and the girls could represent themselves. He also demanded that the case be reopened so they could put on a defense. They had twenty-one witnesses waiting to testify, he said. Both requests were denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cNeither the air search nor a subsequent ground search of the Sespe area yielded any trace of Hughes. The abandoned Volkswagen was found, with a batch of court transcripts inside, but other papers Hughes was known to have had, including a secret psychiatric report on Leslie Van Houten, were missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201cThe most persistent rumor was that Hughes had been murdered by the Family. There was, at this time, no evidence of this. But there was more than ample cause for speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cThough once little more than an errand boy for Manson, during the course of the trial Hughes had grown increasingly independent, until the two had finally split over whether there should be a defense \u2014Hughes strongly opposing his client\u2019s taking the stand to absolve Charlie. I also heard from several sources, including Paul Fitzgerald, that Hughes was afraid of Manson. It was possible that he showed this fear, which in Manson\u2019s case, was like waving a red flag before a bull. Fear turned Charlie on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">\u201cThere could have been several reasons for his murder, if it was that. It may have been done to intimidate the other defense attorneys into letting Manson put on a defense during the penalty trial (one was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>so shaken by Hughes\u2019 disappearance that he went on a bender which ended in his arrest for drunken driving). Equally likely, it could have been a tactic to delay the trial\u2014with the hope that it would result in a mistrial, or set the stage for a reversal on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\u201cSpeculation, nothing more. Except for one odd, perhaps unrelated, incident. On December 2, four days after Hughes was last seen alive, fugitives Bruce Davis and Nancy Pitman, aka Brenda McCann, voluntarily surrendered to the police. Two of the Family\u2019s most hard-core members, Pitman had been missing for several weeks after failing to appear for sentencing on a forgery charge, while Davis\u2014who had been involved in both the Hinman and Shea murders, who had picked up the gun with which Zero had \u2018committed suicide\u2019 but had somehow left no prints, and who was the chief suspect in the slaying of two young Scientology students\u2014had evaded capture for over seven months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">\u201cMaybe it was just the proximity in time that linked the two events in my mind: Hughes\u2019 disappearance; Davis\u2019 and Pitman\u2019s surprise surrender. But I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that in some way the two incidents might be related.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Approximately 110 pages later, plaintiffs name again appears as part of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">\u201cWith three exceptions, these are all the known murders which have been proven, or are suspected to be, linked to the Manson Family. Are there more? I\u2019ve discussed this with officers from LAPD and LASO, and we tend to think that there probably are, because these people liked to kill. But there is no hard evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">\u201cAs for those three other murders, two of them occurred as late as 1972.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">\u201cOn November 8, 1972, a hiker near the Russian River resort community of Guerneville, in Northern California, saw a hand protruding from the ground. When police exhumed the body, it was found to be that of a young man wearing the dark-blue tunic of a Marine dress uniform. He had been shotgunned and decapitated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">\u201cThe victim was subsequently identified as James T. Willett, twenty-six, a former Marine from Los Angeles County. This information appeared on radio and TV newscasts on Friday, November 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>\u201cOn Saturday, November 11, Stockton, California, police spotted Willett\u2019s station wagon parked in front of a house at 720 West Flora Street. When refused entry to the house, they broke in, arresting two men and two women and confiscating a number of pistols and shotguns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">\u201cBoth women had Manson Family X\u2019s on their foreheads. They were Priscilla Cooper, twenty-one, and Nancy Pitman, aka Brenda McCann, twenty. A few minutes after police entered the residence, a third female called, asking to be picked up and given a ride to the house. The police obliged, and also arrested Lynette Fromme, aka Squeaky, twenty-four, ex-officio leader of the Family in Manson\u2019s absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u201cThe two men were Michael Monfort, twenty-four, and James Craig, thirty-three, both state prison escapees wanted for a number of armed robberies in various parts of California. Both had the letters \u2018AB\u2019 tattooed on their left breasts. According to a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, the initials stood for the Aryan Brotherhood, described as \u2018a cult of white prison inmates, dedicated largely to racism but also involved in hoodlum activities, including murder contracts. . .. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u201cWhile in the house, the police noticed freshly turned earth in the basement. After obtaining a search warrant, they began digging, and early the following morning exhumed the body of Lauren Willett, nineteen. She had been shot once in the head, her death occurring either late Friday night or early Saturday morning, not long after the identity of her slain husband was revealed on the news broadcasts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">\u201cQuestioned by the police, Priscilla Cooper claimed that Lauren Willett had killed herself \u2018playing Russian roulette.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">\u201cAlthough, like Zero, Mrs. Willett was not able to contradict this story, the Stockton police were far more skeptical than had been LASO. The three women and two men were charged with her murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">\u201cThey were scheduled to go on trial in May 1973. On April 2, however, four of the five surprised the Court by entering guilty pleas. Michael Monfort, who pleaded guilty to the murder of Lauren Willett, was sentenced to seven years to life in state prison. Superior Court Judge James Darrah also ordered consecutive terms of up to five years and two years for James Craig, who had pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to murder and to possessing an illegal weapon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>i.e., a sawed-off shotgun. Both girls also pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact, and both Priscilla Cooper and Nancy Pitman, aka Brenda, who Manson once indicated to me was his chief candidate for Family assassin, were sent to state prison for up to five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\u201cMonfort, and an accomplice, William Goucher, twenty-three, subsequently pleaded guilty to second degree murder in the death of James Willett, and were sent to state prison for five years to life. Craig, who pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the murder, was given another prison term of up to five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">\u201cThe motive for the two murders is not known. It is known that the Willetts had been associated with the Manson Family for at least a year, and possibly longer. Police surmised that Lauren Willett was killed after learning of the murder of her husband, to keep her from going to the police. As for the murder of James Willett, the official police theory is that Willett himself may have been about to inform about the robberies the group had committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201cThere is another possibility. It may be that both James and Lauren Willett were killed because they knew too much about still another murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201cJames and Lauren. Something about those first names seemed familiar. Then it connected. On November 27, 1970, a James Forsher and a Lauren Elder drove defense attorney Ronald Hughes to Sespe Hot Springs. After Hughes disappeared, the couple were questioned but not polygraphed, the police being satisfied that when they left the flooded area Hughes was still alive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">\u201cAt first I thought \u2018Elder\u2019 might be Lauren Willett\u2019s maiden name, but it wasn\u2019t. Nor, in checking the police reports and newspaper articles, was I able to find any description of Forsher and Elder. All I did find were their ages, both given as seventeen, and an address, from which I subsequently learned they had long since moved. All other efforts to track them down were unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">\u201cIt appears unlikely that James Forsher and James Willett were the same person: Willett would have been twenty-four in 1970, not seven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>teen. But Lauren is a decidedly uncommon name. And, nineteen in 1972, she would have been seventeen in 1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">\u201cCoincidence? There have been far stranger ones in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">\u201cOne thing is now known, however. If an admission by one of Manson\u2019s most hard-core followers is correct, Ronald Hughes <em>was </em>murdered by the Manson Family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">By way of innuendo appellant alleged: \u201cBy publishing the book Helter-Skelter ..., Defendants... intended that when Helter-Skelter was published the readers thereof would believe that Plaintiff was a participant in the alleged murder of Ronald Hughes, that he was guilty of the crime of murder or the crime of being an accomplice or accessory to murder and that Plaintiff was a member or close associate of the Manson \u2018Family.\u2019 The aforesaid portions of Helter-Skelter, when read in the context of the whole book, were, in fact, understood and believed by numerous readers of Helter-Skelter to mean that Plaintiff was a participant in the alleged murder of Ronald Hughes, that he was guilty of the crime of murder or of the crime of being an accomplice or accessory to murder and that he was a member or close associate of the Manson \u2018Family.\u2019 Said understanding and belief on the part of said readers of Helter-Skelter was reasonably drawn from the aforesaid portions of the book when read in the context of the whole book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The first two causes of action of the first amended complaint seek to allege causes of action for libel essentially on the facts set forth above, distinctions between the two causes being immaterial on this appeal. The third cause of action attempts to allege an invasion of plaintiff\u2019s privacy based upon the publication of the book and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">To this complaint defendants interposed general demurrers which the trial court sustained without leave to amend. This appeal is from the ensuing judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The Complaint Fails to State a Cause of Action for Libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">We turn first to appellant\u2019s attempt to state a cause of action for libel. Libel is defined by Civil Code section 45 as \u201ca false and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d As appellant points out, the definition of libel has been held to include almost any language which, upon its face, has a natural tendency to injure a person\u2019s reputation. <em>(Schomberg </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1901) 132 Cal. 224, 227 [64 P. 290]; <em>MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 536, 546 [343 P.2d 36]; Prosser, Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 111, p. 739 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In determining whether a statement is libelous we look to what is explicitly stated as well as what insinuation and implication can be reasonably drawn from the communication. <em>(Cameron </em>v. <em>Wernick </em>(1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 890, 893 [60 Cal.Rptr. 102].) \u201cTo constitute a libel it is not necessary that there be a direct and specific allegation of improper conduct, as in a pleading. The charge may be either expressly stated or implied; and in the latter case the implication may be either apparent from the language used, or of such a character as to require the statement and proof of extrinsic facts, <em>(inducement, colloquium, </em>and innuendo) to show its meaning. In the last case, proper allegations and proofs of the facts necessary to make the meaning of the language apparent will be required.\u201d <em>(Schomberg </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>132 Cal. at pp. 227-228.) In this connection the expression used as well as the \u201cwhole scope and apparent object of the writer\u201d must be considered. <em>(MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co., supra, </em>at p. 546.)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In determining the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrer, this court\u2019s inquiry is not to determine if the communications may have an innocent meaning but rather to determine if the communication reasonably carries with it a defamatory meaning. <em>(Mullins </em>v. <em>Brando </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 409, 414-415 [91 Cal.Rptr. 796], cert, den. <em>Brando </em>v. <em>Coffman </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 923 [29 L.Ed.2d 701, 91 S.Ct. 2231].) Just as the court must refrain from a \u201chair-splitting analysis\u201d of what is said in an article to find an innocent meaning, so must it refrain from scrutinizing what is not said to find \u201ca defamatory meaning which the article does not convey to a lay reader.\u201d <em>(Mullins </em>v. <em>Thieriot </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 302, 304 [97 Cal.Rptr. 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Appellant concedes, as he must, that there is no single statement in the book which, standing alone, could be said to libel appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Appellant\u2019s contention is that, when read in the context of the entire book, \u201cthe cumulative impact.. . implies that he was involved in the alleged murder [of Hughes]... and associated with the Manson \u2018family.\u2019\u201d In this connection he details a series of statements from the book. Appellant notes that the book proclaims to be the never-before-told complete inside story of the Manson Family by the prosecutor who put \u201cthe puzzle together.\u201d It suggests that retaliatory murders went on even after the the jailing of Manson, that the slaying of Hughes was the first of the proposed retaliatory murders and that Manson wanted Hughes dead. In addition, appellant claims that in examining the circumstances surrounding Hughes\u2019 disappearance, the book, describing appellant and Lauren Elder as teenagers, states that the two drove Hughes to a desolate camping spot; the book does not expressly state why they drove Hughes or what their connection with him was.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Appellant further develops the claimed implication by noting the representations that appellant and Elder were living together at the time, that their stories were never checked out by the police, that the last three other people known to have seen Hughes alive after appellant\u2019s and Elder\u2019s departure were polygraphed, that the cause of Hughes\u2019 death was poison and that Lauren Willett and her husband James were killed because they knew too much about the slaying of Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The book expressly rules out the probability of James Willett\u2019s being the appellant, James Forsher, because of an age differential.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the book states, \u201cBut Lauren is a decidedly uncommon name. And, nineteen in 1972, she would have been seventeen in 1970. [11] Coincidence? There have been far stranger ones in this case.\u201d The book further states that \u201cAfter Hughes disappeared, the couple were questioned but not polygraphed, the police being satisfied that when they left the flooded area Hughes was still alive.\u201d On the morning of the following day, the book recites, three other youths had seen Hughes, alone, but well and in no danger. \u201cSince Forsher and Elder had last seen Hughes a day earlier, they apparently were not polygraphed and their story was taken at face value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Under the circumstances depicted in the book it cannot be reasonably said a defamatory picture is painted of appellant. Although he and Elder had driven Hughes to the remote area, Hughes, according to the book, appears to have been left there by his choice, alive and well. There may be an inference that Lauren Elder and Lauren Willett, the latter clearly depicted as being involved in the Manson family, might have been one and the same. However, the book does not allow such an inference to be reasonably made that appellant was a member of the family. No reasonable imputation can be made that appellant was involved in Hughes\u2019 death other than being with Elder and driving Hughes to the camping area and at Hughes\u2019 election leaving him. The book\u2019s \u201ccast of characters\u201d lists the \u201cManson family members and associates;\u201d included in this list are the names of James and Lauren Willett; absent is the name of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Instead of placing responsibility for Hughes\u2019 death on Forsher, the book suggests that Hughes was killed by two Manson family members, Bruce Davis and Nancy Pitman, who while fugitives for some time, voluntarily surrendered to police five days after Hughes was last seen alive. The book does not place Davis or Pitman with appellant or Elder during the time the latter were at Sespe Hot Springs.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In sum, the book simply establishes that appellant and Elder took Hughes to Sespe Hot Springs, that Hughes decided to stay, and that appellant and Elder left while Hughes was alive and in no danger. Possibly Lauren Willett may have been killed because she knew something of Hughes\u2019 death. Hughes may have been killed by Manson followers Pitman and Davis. However, the book neither expressly nor by fair implication charges appellant with killing or aiding or abetting the killing of Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The defamatory meaning which appellant urges that this court discern in the context of the whole book must be one that can be reasonably inferred. If the defamatory character were open to reasonable debate we would agree with appellant\u2019s assessment of the book. Here, however, the claimed defamatory nature of the book insofar as it relates to appellant is so obscure and attenuated as to be beyond the realm of reasonableness. (See <em>Yorty </em>v. <em>Chandler </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 467, 475 [91 Cal.Rptr. 709]; <em>Corman </em>v. <em>Blanchard </em>(1962) 211 Cal.App.2d 126, 137-138 [27 Cal.Rptr. 327].) In determining the defamatory nature of written material, the fact that some person might, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>extra sensitive perception, understand such a meaning cannot compel this court to establish liability at so low a threshold. Rather, the test as noted above is whether by reasonable implication a defamatory meaning may be found in the communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">To bolster his pleadings, and, apparently in an attempt to plead extrinsic circumstances giving meaning to the alleged offending passages, appellant alleged certain \u201comitted facts\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which did not find their way into the book. However, appellant\u2019s position is not appreciably improved thereby. Even if we consider these omitted facts, we still cannot discern a defamatory meaning reasonably inferable therefrom. The additional information does not reasonably contribute to a defamatory meaning. Moreover, there is also the problem of appellant\u2019s failure to allege any special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Civil Code section 45a provides: \u201cA libel which is defamatory of the plaintiff without the necessity of explanatory matter, such as an inducement, innuendo or other extrinsic fact, is said to be a libel on its face. Defamatory language not libelous on its face is not actionable unless the plaintiff alleges and proves that he has suffered special damage as a proximate result thereof. Special damage is defined in Section 48 a of this code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Appellant has not effectively pleaded that he has suffered any special damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To be sure, appellant has alleged he \u201chas suffered in an amount, which, as yet, cannot be ascertained and which will be proven at trial.\u201d Such an allegation is insufficient. Appellant should have been able to plead injury to property, business, trade, profession or occupation, if these interests have been injured even though the monetary extent might not have been ascertainable. Unless there is a special damage as defined by Civil Code section 48a, no cause of action arises. <em>(Mullins </em>v. <em>Thieriot, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 302, 304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The Complaint Fails to State a Cause of Action for Invasion of Privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Forsher\u2019s third cause of action, which incorporates by reference much of the first cause of action, is an attempt to allege invasion of privacy. The essential allegations concerning the alleged invasion of privacy may be summarized as follows: \u201c[The] publication of Plaintiff\u2019s identity in connection with the events surrounding the disappearance of Ronald Hughes was of little or no informational or social value. At no time relevant herein was Plaintiff\u2019s identity newsworthy; at no time relevant herein was there any substantial reason or justification for focusing public attention on Plaintiff as an individual or any legitimate public interest in ascertaining Plaintiff\u2019s identity. ... [It] At no time relevant herein did Plaintiff seek or in any way encourage the publication of his name... in connection with the disappearance of Ronald Hughes. At no time.. .did plaintiff attempt.. .to solicit publicity... .At no time.. .was Plaintiff regarded as a public figure or did plaintiff hold such a position in the community [that] plaintiff\u2019s. .. involvement in the Hughes disappearance was a matter of general, legitimate or substantial public interest.\u201d Forsher further alleges that defendants published his identity with reckless disregard of the fact that the publication would be offensive to him, that the publication was offensive to him and that the publication was intentional, fraudulent, malicious and oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>The right of privacy is a rather recent development of the common law. The celebrated article by Warren and Brand\u00e9is, <em>The Right to Privacy </em>(1890) 4 Harv.L.Rev. 193, attempted to trace the right and to provide a theoretical base for the recognition of privacy as an interest especially entitled to protection. Justice Peters, writing for this court, observed in <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 529 at page 533 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34, 57 A.L.R.3d 1 ]: \u201c... Warren and Brand\u00e9is perceived that it was mass exposure to public gaze, as opposed to backyard gossip, which threatened to deprive men of the right of \u2018scratching wherever one itches.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d Succinctly stated, the right is to be \u201cleft alone.\u201d (See 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7 334, p. 2599; Rest. 2d Torts, \u00a7 652A, com. a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Our courts have dealt with four distinct factual settings under the heading of invasion of privacy. As identified by the late Dean Prosser, those four types of cases are: (1) intrusion upon one\u2019s physical solitude or seclusion; (2) public disclosure of private facts; (3) false light in the public eye; and (4) appropriation. <em>(Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 20, 35, fn. 16 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360, 459 P.2d 912]; Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 117, p. 804 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Plaintiff claims through his allegations that private embarrassing facts about him were revealed and that his personal character was thereby injured. The allegations of the complaint might involve either the public disclosure of private facts branch or the false light branch of the tort. On appeal, plaintiff, while not labeling which branch of the tort he contends was committed, most clearly contends that there has been public disclosure of private facts. In particular, plaintiff complains of the use of his true name and identity in connection with the admittedly newsworthy publication of the facts surrounding Hughes\u2019 disappearance and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Three required elements of the cause of action for public disclosure of private facts may be discerned from decisions of our courts. First, the disclosure of private facts must be a <em>public disclosure. (Porten </em>v. <em>University of San Francisco </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 825, 828 [134 Cal.Rptr. 839]; <em>Timperley </em>v. <em>Chase Collection Service </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 697, 700 [77 Cal.Rptr. 782] (quoting Prosser, Law of Torts (3d ed. 1964) \u00a7 112, p. 835).) Second, the facts disclosed must be <em>private facts, </em>and not public ones. <em>(Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>20, 35; <em>Coverstone </em>v. <em>Davies </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 315, 323 [239 P.2d 876]; <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Reid </em>(1931) 112 Cal.App. 285, 290 [297 P. 91].) Third, the matter made public must be one which would be <em>offensive </em>and objectionable to a reasonable [person] of ordinary sensibilities. <em>(Gill </em>v. <em>Hearst Publishing Co. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 224 [253 P.2d 441]; <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Curtis Pub. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1954) 122 F.Supp. 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In determining whether a cause of action has been stated, we must consider certain principles relating to the First Amendment, for the right to keep information private often clashes with the First Amendment right to disseminate information to the public. Warren and Brand\u00e9is themselves noted the potential conflict between freedom of the press and the right of privacy and suggested that the right should not apply to matters of \u201cpublic or general interest.\u201d (Warren &amp; Brand\u00e9is, <em>supra, </em>4 Harv.L.Rev. 193, 214; see also <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 529, 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The conflict between freedom of the press and the right of privacy was considered in <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 529. In that case, Briscoe\u2019s identity as a former hijacker was revealed in a magazine article 11 years after he had committed his crime. During the intervening years Briscoe had become rehabilitated and was a respectable member of society. Briscoe filed suit against Reader\u2019s Digest claiming that it had invaded his privacy by disclosing truthful but private, embarrassing facts ab'out his past life and that as a result, his daughter and friends had abandoned him. We concluded that Briscoe had stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">We recognized in <em>Briscoe </em>that the case pitted \u201ca rehabilitated felon\u2019s right to anonymity against a magazine\u2019s right to identify him\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 534), and proceeded to analyze the nature of these competing interests. In so doing, we acknowledged the significant public interest in true reports of recent crimes and the names of persons charged with their commission and concluded they are protected by the First Amendment: \u201cThe circumstances under which crimes occur, the techniques used by those outside the law, the tragedy that may befall the victims\u2014these are vital bits of information for people coping with the exigencies of modern life.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 536.) Naming the suspect may legitimately put others on notice that the named individual is suspected of having committed a crime and may also persuade eyewitnesses and character witnesses to testify. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>In <em>Briscoe, </em>however, we had to go further and determine whether the public interest in reports of long past crimes was of similar strength so as to fall within the First Amendment protections. We recognized that reports of the facts of past crimes may be newsworthy and may prove educational in illustrating the reasons for and methods by which crimes are committed as well as methods of apprehension. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 537.) We found it a different matter, however, as to the inclusion of the actor\u2019s identification: \u201cOnce legal proceedings have terminated, and a suspect or offender has been released, identification of the individual will not usually aid the administration of justice. Identification will no longer serve to bring forth witnesses or obtain succor for victims. Unless the individual has reattracted the public eye to himself in some independent fashion, the only public \u2018interest\u2019 that would usually be served is that of curiosity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">We considered three factors drawn from our decision in <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 20, to determine whether the Reader\u2019s Digest story was newsworthy: \u201cthe social value of the facts published, the depth of the article\u2019s intrusion into ostensibly private affairs, and the extent to which the party voluntarily acceded to a position of public notoriety.\u201d (Id<em>., </em>at p. 36.) Applying the three <em>Kapellas </em>criteria to the revelation of Briscoe\u2019s identity, we determined: (1) the public had little interest 11 years after the crime was committed in knowing Briscoe\u2019s identity; (2) a jury could find that the revelation of a person\u2019s criminal past is grossly offensive; and (3) Briscoe did not voluntarily consent to the publicity accorded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Most important to our decision, however, was the fact that the state has a compelling interest in the rehabilitative process and that a continuing threat of media disclosure of the identity of past criminals is counterproductive to this process. This additional interest, when pooled with the privacy and First Amendment interests, swung the pendulum in privacy\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">California courts have refrained from extending the <em>Briscoe </em>rule to other fact situations. For example, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, Inc. </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 880 [118 Cal.Rptr. 370], the court distinguished <em>Briscoe </em>by pointing out that it was not dealing with a reformed criminal, but an honest citizen who had returned $240,000 in cash to Brinks after it had been mislaid. The <em>Johnson </em>court interpreted <em>Briscoe </em>as holding that \u201cwhere the plaintiff is a past criminal and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>name is used in a publication, the mere lapse of time may provide a basis for an invasion of privacy suit.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 891.) Lapse of time is not an issue, the court concluded, in a case where the plaintiff is not a past criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Our decision in <em>Briscoe </em>was an exception to the more general rule that \u201conce a man has become a public figure, or news, he remains a matter of legitimate recall to the public mind to the end of his days.\u201d (Prosser, <em>Privacy </em>(1960) 48 Cal.L.Rev. 383, 418, quoted in <em>Werner </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co. </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 111, 118 [14 Cal.Rptr. 208]; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 807, 814 [292 P.2d 600]; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 652D, com. k.) As we noted in <em>Kappellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 20, 36: \u201cIf the information reported has previously become part of the \u2018public domain\u2019 or the intrusion into an individual\u2019s private life is only slight, publication will be privileged even though the social utility of the publication may be minimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The clash between claims of privacy and claims of a free press has also been considered in recent years by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp. </em>v. <em>Cohn </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 469 [43 L.Ed.2d 328, 95 S.Ct. 1029], an action for invasion of privacy brought upon defendant\u2019s publishing the name of plaintiff, a rape victim, in violation of a state statute, the high court invalidated the statute. In so doing arid while recognizing the \u201cimpressive credentials for a right of privacy,\u201d the court determined (1) the commission of crime, prosecutions resulting from it and judicial proceedings arising from prosecutions are events of legitimate concern to the public and fall within the responsibility of the press to report the operations of government, and (2) the interest in privacy fades when the information involved already appears on the public record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 489-496 [43 L.Ed. at pp. 345-350].)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>More recently in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Daily Mail Publishing Co. </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 97 [61 L.Ed.2d 399, 99 S.Ct. 2667], the high court struck down a West Virginia statute making it a crime to publish, without approval of the juvenile court the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender. The state\u2019s interest in protecting the anonymity of the juvenile to further his rehabilitation was held to be subordinate to the reach of the First Amendment, especially in the absence of the unlawful obtaining of such information or of an issue of privacy or pretrial publicity. Since <em>Smith </em>did not involve an individual right of privacy claim, its holding is of narrow scope and affords little aid in analyzing the problems before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">From the foregoing discussion we discern certain guidelines to be considered in determining whether a report is newsworthy and thus constitutionally protected. Among the factors to consider are the depth of the intrusion into the plaintiff\u2019s private affairs, the extent to which the plaintiff voluntarily pushed himself into a position of public notoriety, the exact nature of the state\u2019s interest in preventing the disclosure, and whether the information is a matter of public record. Additionally, we look to any continued public interest in the event so that the passage of time does not per se extinguish the privilege of the publisher; if a report made reasonably contemporaneously with the incident would have been in the public interest, the weighing process continues in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time of publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Although plaintiff concedes that the disappearance of Hughes was newsworthy, he insists that no facts were stated in the complaint or in the book which would enable the trial court to conclude that his identity was newsworthy. He admits, however, that his name was published in connection with a description of Hughes\u2019 disappearance by two Los Angeles area newspapers in December 1970.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the mention of plaintiff in the book is not offensive, for the clear import of it is to ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>solve plaintiff of any responsibility for Hughes\u2019 death. The depth of intrusion, if indeed there be any, is miniscule. In the book, as our prior discussion indicated, plaintiff is not treated in any great detail; his name might even escape notice in the context of the entire volume. The book clearly does not exaggerate the importance of plaintiff\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We are convinced that the publication of the book and plaintiff\u2019s identity did not affront any significant state interest. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>112 Cal.App. 85 and <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 529, no rehabilitation or other social processes have been threatened. Also, unlike <em>Briscoe, </em>at the time of the publication of Helter Skelter, the event (disappearance and death of Hughes) had not become a wholly closed chapter. It is possible that the book could have elicited leads which might have explained Hughes\u2019 death in a more certain manner. At the time the book was written, Manson and events connected with the murder case were still a matter of public concern, the appeal not being decided until August 1976. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Manson </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 102 [132 Cal.Rptr. 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Weighing the interest of plaintiff, the state and public, as we must under the cases cited, we conclude that the attempt to plead a cause of action for invasion of privacy must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The judgment of dismissal entered upon the sustaining of the demurrer is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">Bird, C. J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Since the judgment was entered upon the sustaining of the general demurrer, the factual allegations of the complaint will be deemed true for the purposes of this appeal. The book is incorporated by reference into the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\">For example, police officers originally accepted the theory that family member \u201cZero\u201d had fatally shot himself while playing \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d simply because the same story relating to the event was told by three other members of the family and despite the fact that the gun which supposedly was used contained no fingerprints and contained seven live rounds and one spent shell, indicating that when fired it was fully loaded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The book uses pseudonyms and symbols to refer to persons who were tangentially involved or who were members of law enforcement agencies whose competence was questioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Those most likely to deem the book defamatory to appellant are those who are acquainted with him and would therefore not identify the live appellant with the dead Willett.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In his closing brief appellant concedes \u201chis claim is <em>not </em>based on any contention that Helter-Skelter implies that he and James Willett are the same person.... [T]he book makes it clear that [they]... are not the same person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The allegations read as follows: \u201cIn publishing HELTER-SKELTER and in publishing the aforesaid portions pertaining to Plaintiff, which are more particularly set out in paragraph 13 above, Defendants, and each of them, deliberately, willfully, maliciously and with reckless disregard for the truth and Plaintiffs reputation, omitted the following facts: [\u00b6] a) Shortly after James Forsher and Lauren Elder were forced to abandon her Volkswagen and hike out of Sepse [sic] Hot Springs, they were picked up by two independent witnesses and driven to Los Angeles: [\u00b6] b) That these two independent witnesses were later questioned by police and verified the fact that they picked up James Forsher and Lauren Elder and the time at which they were picked up; [\u00b6] c) That each of these two independent witnesses was polygraphed by the police and was shown to have been telling the truth; [\u00b6] d) That the time at which these two independent witnesses attested to having picked up James Forsher and Lauren Elder was prior to the time three other independent witnesses, who were later polygraphed and shown to be telling the truth, reported that they talked to Ronald Hughes; [\u00b6] e) That the rainstorm which occurred during the weekend of Hughes\u2019 disappearance was the biggest of that year in Southern California; [\u00b6] f) That several people had previously died in flash floods occurring in the area where Hughes dispeared [sic]; [\u00b6] g) That subsequent to Hughes\u2019 disappearance James Forsher and Lauren Elder were questioned by the police very throughly [sic] for long periods of time on more than one occasion and details of their stories were carefully checked by police. [\u00b6] h) That James Forsher and Lauren Elder were neighbors of Ronald Hughes who drive [sic] him up to Sespe Hot Springs at his urging. [\u00b6] i) That James Forsher and Lauren Elder had no connection whatsoever with Charles Manson, the Tate-La Bianca killers or the Manson \u2018Family.\u2019\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Section 48a defines special damages as \u201cdamages which plaintiff alleges and proves that he has suffered in respect to his property, business, trade, profession or occupation, including such amounts of money as the plaintiff alleges and proves he has expended as a result of the alleged libel, and no other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Earlier, in <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967) 385 U.S. 374 [17 L.Ed.2d 456, 87 S.Ct. 534], the court reversed a decision of the New York Court of Appeals holding Time magazine liable under a New York statute protecting the right of privacy. Time had published an account of a play relating to an incident where the plaintiff and his family had been held hostage by escaped convicts. The magazine portrayed the play as a reenactment. Plaintiff, asserting the false light branch of the invasion of privacy tort, alleged that the article gave a false impression that the play depicted the incident. The Supreme Court held that liability could be consistent with the First Amendment only if the inaccurate portrayal were recklessly or knowingly false, thus applying the rule of <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 84 S.Ct. 710, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412].</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 29, 31, footnote 1 [29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>L.Ed.2d 296, 305, 91 S.Ct. 1811], the court made it clear that the malice rule in <em>Hill </em>was confined to suits for invasion of privacy based upon false statements where a matter of public interest was involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Appellant in his closing brief makes reference to newspaper articles, copies of which are in the clerk\u2019s transcript. Among other statements in the newspapers was the following: \u201cJames Forsher, Los Angeles, who along with his girl friend Lauren Elder, said they drove Hughes into the area November 27, was the first questioned. [\u00b6] His story remained undenied. He told deputies he and Miss Elder were at the hot springs with Hughes, when rains came Friday (Nov. 27) [sic], they decided to leave the next day. Hughes told them he would stay behind. The couple drove two miles, then had to abandon Miss Elder\u2019s car, but managed to get a ride out before the roads closed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
