Singleton, who was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>argues that the district court erred by failing to explicitly or implicitly consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when making its decision to run his federal sentence consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. Because he raises this issue for the first time on appeal, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 378 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Singleton does not argue that his sentence was unreasonable, that his sentencing guidelines range was improperly calculated, or that the district court\u2019s order that his federal sentence run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence was contrary to the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. Accordingly, it is inferred that the district court considered all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006). Singleton\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
