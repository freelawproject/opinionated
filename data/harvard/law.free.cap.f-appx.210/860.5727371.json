This appeal is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), because Franks filed his petition after the effective date of the AEDPA. A judge of this Court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on: \u201cWhether the district court erred by concluding that appellant had failed to exhaust his state remedies with respect to the claims raised in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition.\u201d For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Careful review of Franks\u2019s appellate brief reveals that he has not addressed the issue on which the COA was granted. Instead, Franks argues the merits of his underlying claim. Under the AEDPA, appellate review is limited to\u00bbthe issues specified in the COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). However, Franks is a <em>pro se </em>litigant and is thus entitled to a lenient interpretation of his arguments on appeal. <em>See GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Nevertheless, we will not act as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a <em>pro se </em>litigant. <em>Id. </em>Even construing Franks\u2019s brief liberally, there is no indication that he presents any arguments regarding the issue on appeal. Therefore, Franks has abandoned the issue on which we granted the COA. <em>See Atkins v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 952, 955 n. 1 (11th Cir.1992) (concluding that an appellant abandons an issue not addressed on appeal). Accordingly, as Franks has shown no reversible error, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
