After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">A jury convicted Taylor of one count of conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robberies, one count of conspiracy to use and carry a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, three counts of Hobbs Act robbery and three counts of using, carrying and discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. Taylor was sentenced to a total of 955 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Taylor filed a direct appeal, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support his Hobbs Act convictions. This Court affirmed his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Taylor then filed this \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that his trial counsel had been ineffective for a variety of reasons, including, in relevant part, (1) failing to object to the jury instruction about \u201caffecting interstate commerce\u201d as improperly amending the indictment; and (2) failing to object that the indictment was insufficient because the charge did not include (a) the type of firearm allegedly used or carried, and (b) the element of criminal intent for the Hobbs Act robberies, which were material elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">The district court denied Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Specifically, the district court stated that, while counsel\u2019s failure to object to a defective indictment could constitute ineffective assistance, the indictment in Taylor\u2019s case was not defective. The district court then concluded that \u201c[bjecause these and the other points Taylor now raises with respect to [the indictment] are patently without merit, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to assert them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">The district court also addressed Taylor\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance based on counsel\u2019s failure to object to the \u201caffecting interstate commerce\u201d jury instruction. The district court found no ineffective assistance of counsel because \u201call of the challenged jury instructions ... were proper and supported by the charged offenses and the evidence presented at trial.\u201d The district court stated that, had Taylor\u2019s counsel raised Taylor\u2019s proposed objections to the jury instructions, the district court would have properly overruled them. The district court also determined that the jury instructions did not constructively amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Taylor filed this appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on only this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-17\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address appellant\u2019s claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the fact that (1) the indictment was insufficient because the charges did not include (a) the type of firearm that was allegedly used or carried, and (b) the element of criminal intent for the Hobbs Act robberies, and (2) the fact that the court\u2019s jury instruction on what constituted \u201caffecting interstate commerce\u201d improperly amended his indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On appeal, Taylor argues that the district court failed to address some of his ineffective assistance claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Clisby, </em>this Court instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus prior to granting or denying relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 936. When a district court fails to address all claims in the habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Here, we find no <em>Clisby </em>error because the district court addressed all of the claims in Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Specifically, the district court expressly discussed and rejected Taylor\u2019s ineffective assistance claims based on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the indictment and failure to object to the \u201caffecting interstate commerce\u201d instruction as improperly amending the indictment. The district court ruled that the indictment claim lacked merit, that the jury instruction was proper and did not constructively amend the indictment and that trial counsel was not ineffective for not raising those objections. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-12\">. Specifically, Taylor received concurrent 235-month sentences on counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 (the conspiracy and substantive offenses related to the Hobbs Act robberies), a consecutive 120-month sentence on count 4 (one of the firearms charges), a 300-month sentence on count 6 (another firearms charge), to run consecutively to counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and a final sentence of 300 months on count 8 (the third firearms charge), to run consecutively to all the other counts, resulting in a total of 955 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that Taylor abandoned the <em>Clisby </em>issues (upon which this Court granted the COA) by failing to argue them sufficiently in his brief. Taylor\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, which we construe liberally, expressly states that \"the district court failed to properly address\u201d certain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b977-9\">. Although <em>Clisby </em>involved a petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the primary concern motivating this Court\u2019s decision to require district courts to address all issues in the first instance was the piecemeal litigation that necessarily ensues when only some claims are addressed in the first instance. <em>Clisby, 960 </em>F.2d at 935. Likewise, a district court is required to address all issues raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion in the first instance. <em>See Gay v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 614, 616 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987) (\"|T]he principles developed in habeas cases also apply to \u00a7 2255 motions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b977-23\">. In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
