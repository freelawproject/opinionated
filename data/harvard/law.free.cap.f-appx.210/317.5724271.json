His only argument on appeal is that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">In imposing a sentence after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-20\">Peele argues that the hardship his incarceration will cause his family warranted a sentence below the advisory guideline range. \u201cThis Circuit has construed downward departures based on family ties very narrowly.\u201d <em>United States v. Maddox, </em>48 F.3d 791, 799 (4th Cir.1995). We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s decision, and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, and conclude that the circumstances facing Peele, while regrettable, do not rise to the level of \u201cextraordinary\u201d and thus do not warrant a reduced sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bell, </em>974 F.2d 537, 538 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Brand, 907 F.2d </em>31, 33 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In addition, the district court properly weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Peele\u2019s sentence. \u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion;\u2019 \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432 (quoting <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)). The district court adequately explained the reasons for Peele\u2019s sentence, and Peele has not rebutted the presumption that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Peele\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
