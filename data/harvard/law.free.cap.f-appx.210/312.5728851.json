We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). The INA defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). \u201cPersecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds ....\u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2006). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). The well-founded fear standard contains both a subjective and an objective component. The objective element requires a showing of specific, concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be met through the presentation of candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution____ [It] must have some basis in the reality of the circumstances and be validated with specific, concrete facts ... and it cannot be mere irrational apprehension.\u201d <em>Li, </em>405 F.3d at 176 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou, </em>445 F.3d at 353. A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (West 2005). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Soghe claimed she was entitled to relief because she feared returning to Gabon and possibly being kidnapped by agents from the CAR as a result of her father\u2019s involvement in the prior government for the CAR. We find substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding that this claim was entirely speculative and without corroborative support.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
