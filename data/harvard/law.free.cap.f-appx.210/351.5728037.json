Gunn does not challenge on appeal the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint and, instead, reurges the claims raised in her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Gunn has not challenged the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint, she has abandoned the issue, and this court need not further address it. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">For the first time on appeal, Gunn argues that a social worker for the Monroe County, Mississippi Department of Human Services had her arrested based on false allegations that Gunn had abused her son and her mother. She also alleges that the Monroe County School District \u201callowed [her son\u2019s] eligibility to run out.\u201d Because Gunn failed to present these claims to the district court, this court need not consider them. <em>See Burch v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>119 F.3d 305, 319 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Gunn\u2019s complaint is affirmed. Gunn\u2019s motion to be appointed guardian ad litem is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
