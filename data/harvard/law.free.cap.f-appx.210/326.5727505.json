Martinez-Garcia was sentenced to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-27\">Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. Although Martinez-Garcia was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Because the district court properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range and weighed the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors, we conclude Martinez-Garcia\u2019s 188-month sentence, which was below the statutory minimum and at the bottom of the advisory guideline range, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-17 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (stating a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
