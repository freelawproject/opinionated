After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-26\">In 1998, Rincon was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment for car-jacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, and to a consecutive sixty months\u2019 imprisonment for use of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). In 2005, Rincon filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendment 599<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Sentencing Guidelines should be applied retroactively. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>district court agreed that Amendment 599 applied retroactively, it denied Rincon\u2019s motion. Rincon filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1228 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">On appeal, Rincon first argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the district court decided the motion without a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rincon\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), required the district court to hold a hearing before ruling on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is merit-less. Not only did Rincon fail to request a hearing before the district court, but <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. See <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1643, 164 L.Ed.2d 351 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Rincon also argues that the district court abused its discretion when its order denied Rincon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without expressly addressing all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment, upon motion of the defendant, where the defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must \u201crecalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must \u201cdecide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence. This decision should be made in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">In considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, \u201ca district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applieability-if any-of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding that district court provided sufficient reasons and considered the pertinent factors in its short order by referencing the government\u2019s brief, which enumerated specific elements relevant to the \u00a7 3553(a) inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>In Rincon\u2019s case, the district court properly complied with the <em>Bravo </em>two-part analysis. First, as both parties concede, the court correctly recalculated Rincon\u2019s amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Second, the district court then properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, in its written order, the district court expressly stated that its decision about Rincon\u2019s sentence reduction was governed by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that \u201camong the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) is the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d The district court then stated that \u201cin light of the circumstances of this case, those factors outweigh[ed] all of the other listed considerations.\u201d The district court then noted that \u201cthis case arose out of the carjacking of a bus in the streets of Miami, Defendant and his accomplice pointed two guns at the bus driver, threatened to kill him, struck him in the head causing injuries that required medical treatment and robbed him.\u201d Therefore, the record reflects that the district court properly considered and weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The fact that the district court decided that certain factors outweighed other listed factors does not show that it failed to consider adequately those other listed \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rincon\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and, thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-18\">. Amendment 599 clarified \"under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599, reason for amend. (2000). Specifically, Amendment 599 directed that a weapon enhancement could not be applied to the guideline calculation for certain underlying offenses if a sentence was also imposed for a violation of \u00a7 924(c). <em>Id. </em>Amendment 599 may be applied retroactively. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (2000); U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 607, reason for amend. (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-10\">.
