He argues that the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). We have held, however, that a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because it was equivalent to the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling. <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006). Valdez concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Garciar-Mendez </em>and raises it to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-19\">Valdez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Valdez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Valdez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it also to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">Valdez\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. We REMAND to the district court for correction of the judgment pursuant to Fed.R.CrimjP. 36 to reflect, in the written Statement of Reasons, that Valdez had a criminal history category IV, not V, and that the applicable guidelines range was 57 to 71 months of imprisonment, not 70 to 87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>AFFIRMED.
