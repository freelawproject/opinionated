The district court concluded that Witherspoon qualified for sentencing as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-21\">On appeal, Witherspoon asserts that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced based upon facts, his qualifying prior convictions, that were not alleged in the indictment, admitted by him, or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Wither-spoon does not assert that his prior convictions are not valid predicates for sentencing as an armed career criminal, but states only a legal challenge to his sentence. Witherspoon\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006), and <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We therefore affirm Witherspoon\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
