The plea agreement included a stipulation that the \u201cquantity of cocaine involved is 1 kilogram of cocaine with a base offense level of 26 for purposes of calculating the Defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-24\">In determining the sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for Count Two, the probation officer recommended a base offense level of twenty-six pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7), based on the plea agreement stipulation. After a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Yarborough\u2019s total offense level for Count Two was twenty-four. Yarborough\u2019s prior criminal activity resulted in a total of elev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>en criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category Y. The resulting sentencing range for Count Two was ninety-two to 115 months. Count Four carried a mandatory minimum of five years of imprisonment, consecutive to the sentence on Count Two. Yarborough did not object to the presentence report (PSR). At sentencing the district court adopted the factual findings and Guideline calculations in the PSR. The court noted its consideration of the advisory Guidelines range and the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), and sentenced Yarborough to ninety-two months of imprisonment on Count Two and a consecutive sixty months of imprisonment on Count Four, for a total of 152 months of imprisonment, four years of supervised release, and a $200 special assessment. Yarborough timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questions whether the district court erred in imposing a sentence of 152 months. Yarborough filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting two allegations of error. The Government declined to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Counsel suggests that the district court erred in imposing a sentence of 152 months of imprisonment. We review a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cConsistent with the remedial scheme set forth in <em>Booker, </em>a district court shall first calculate (after making the appropriate findings of fact) the range prescribed by the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Counsel does not assert that the district court erred in determining the applicable Guideline range, and Yarborough\u2019s offense level was determined based on the stipulation in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Next, the district court must consider the Guideline range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. \u201cA sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006). If a court imposes a sentence outside the Guideline range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted). Yarborough\u2019s guilty plea to a drug conspiracy involving 500 or more grams of cocaine exposed him to a statutory sentence of at least five and not more than forty years, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); and his plea to using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime carried a statutory minimum consecutive sentence of five years. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In this case the district court calculated the Guideline range and specifically stated that it considered the advisory Guidelines pursuant to \u00a7 3553 before imposing sentence. \u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion\u2019; \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.)(quoting <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Yarborough\u2019s sentence was within the properly calculated Guideline range and did not exceed the statutory maximum. Our review leads us to conclude that Yarborough\u2019s \u201csentence was selected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with law, in which the court did not give excessive weight to any relevant factor, and which effected a fair and just result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>light of the relevant facts and law.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We have considered the arguments raised in Yarborough\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit. We therefore affirm Yarborough\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Yarborough, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Yarborough requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Yarborough. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-16\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2004) (USSG).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
