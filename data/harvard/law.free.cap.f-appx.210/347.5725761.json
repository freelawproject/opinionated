California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Johnson has received a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and brief but has not filed a response. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
