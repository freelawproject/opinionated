In their brief to this court, the Bartrugs seek to challenge the propriety of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s assessment of the underlying income tax liability and the validity of the tax lien on the property. This appeal is untimely as to the district court\u2019s November 25, 1996, order upholding the tax lien. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (providing sixty day appeal period when the United States or its agency is a party); <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (holding that appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">This appeal is timely only as to the district court\u2019s orders confirming the sale of the property and denying the Bartrugs\u2019 motion for stay of execution of the judgment. The Bartrugs have presented no arguments challenging these orders. Therefore, they have waived review of these orders. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999); 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
