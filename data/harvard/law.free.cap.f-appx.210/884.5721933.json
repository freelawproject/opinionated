On appeal, the defendants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction, under 46 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 1903, and their motion for a continuance. Lopez-Moreno also argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant him a mitigating-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, for his limited role in the offense. Furthermore, Arias argues that the district court erred by imposing an unreasonable sentence, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and by denying him a two-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a). Finally, Arias argues that the government abused its discretion in filing an information alleging a prior felony conviction, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, and that the court erred in believing that prior conviction precluded it from using its <em>post-Booker </em>discretion to sentence Arias to a term of imprisonment below the 20-year statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">\n<em>I. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction under 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non-jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997) (involving a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial) (quotation and alteration omitted). We have concluded that the jurisdictional requirement of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\u201cMDLEA\u201d), under 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(a), is an issue that goes to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1112 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Under the MDLEA, the government bears the burden of establishing that the statutory requirements of subject-matter jurisdiction have been met. <em>Id. </em>\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutory provisions that go to whether the court has subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to jurisdiction, however, are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1114 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Under the MDLEA, \u201c[i]t is unlawful for any person on board a vessel of the United States, or on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, ... to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute, or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance.\u201d 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(a). A vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States includes a vessel without nationality. 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(c)(1)(A). A vessel without nationality includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-11\">(B) any vessel aboard which the master or person in charge fails, upon request of an officer of the United States empowered to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-12\">(C) a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(c)(2). \u201cA claim of nationality or registry means flying its na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>tion\u2019s flag, possessing and producing documents evidencing the vessel\u2019s registry, or a verbal claim of nationality by the master or person in charge of the vessel.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Cruz, </em>443 F.3d 830, 832 (11th Cir.2006) (citing 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(c)(3)). We have held that a vessel was one without nationality so that it was subject to United States jurisdiction under \u00a7 1903 where the vessel in question flew no flag, carried no registration paperwork, bore no markings indicating its nationality, the crew made no claims about the boat\u2019s nationality or registry upon questioning, and the captain hid among the crew and failed to identify himself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Because we have held that the jurisdictional requirement of the MDLEA is an issue that goes to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts, the defendants did not waive this issue by entering into unconditional guilty pleas. <em>Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d at 1112, 1114; <em>U.S. v. Tomeny, </em>144 F.3d 749, 751 (11th Cir.1998). Nevertheless, the court did not err in finding jurisdiction because the government\u2019s factual proffer at the plea hearing, to which the defendants did not object, was sufficient to establish jurisdiction, pursuant to 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(c)(2)(B). Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\n<em>II. Denial of a continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">As discussed above, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non-jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings.\u201d <em>Pierre, </em>120 F.3d at 1155 (quotation and alteration omitted). A defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere, </em>reserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion only with the consent of the court and the government. Fed.R.Crim.P 11(a)(2). We have held that an unconditional guilty waives non-jurisdictional defects such as the right to a speedy trial, the right to inspect grand jury minutes, and the right to challenge the composition of the grand and petit juries. <em>See Pierre, </em>120 F.3d at 1155-56; <em>United States v. Tallant, </em>547 F.2d 1291, 1294 n. 4, 1295 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Winters v. Cook, </em>466 F.2d 1393, 1394-95 (5th Cir.1972). Moreover, the Tenth Circuit, in addressing this issue, held that in the absence of a conditional plea, a guilty plea waives an appellant\u2019s right to challenge a district court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance. <em>United States v. Lora-Solano, </em>330 F.3d 1288, 1295 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">A denial of a continuance is not an issue that brings into question our jurisdiction to review this appeal. Because the defendants entered unconditional pleas, as opposed to conditional pleas, they have waived their right to challenge this non-jurisdictional issue on appeal. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">\n<em>III. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 mitigating-role reduction (Lopez-Moreno only)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">\u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The proponent of the downward adjustment always bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cIn making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the \u201cdecision falls within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, ... it will be rare for an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). A defendant is a minimal participant if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4). The Sentencing Guidelines also permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [his] role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Regarding the first prong, we have stated that \u201cthe district court <em>must </em>measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cIn other words, the district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. As for the relevant facts to be taken into consideration under the first prong of the <em>De Varon </em>test, we have noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">[i]n the drug courier context, examples of some relevant factual considerations include: amount of drugs, fair market value of drugs, amount of money to be paid to the courier, equity interest in the drugs, role in planning the criminal scheme, and role in the distribution. This is not an exhaustive list, nor does it suggest that any one factor is more important than another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 945. Nonetheless, we have noted that \u201cbecause the amount of drugs in a courier\u2019s possession \u2014 whether very large or very small \u2014 may be the best indication of the magnitude of the courier\u2019s participation in the criminal enterprise, [it does] not foreclose the possibility that amount of drugs may be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Regarding <em>De Varon\u2019s </em>second prong, we stated that \u201cthe district court <em>may </em>also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944 (emphasis added). If the district court chooses to assess the defendant\u2019s relevant culpability versus that of his fellow co-conspirators, it may only do so within certain parameters. We have proscribed the district court\u2019s discretion, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-15\">[fjirst, the district court should look to other participants only to the extent that they are identifiable or discernable from the evidence. This is a fact-intensive inquiry. Second, the district court may consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.... Simply put, a defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Lopez-Moreno a role reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>tion because (1) he was only held accountable for the quantity of drugs related to his role in the offense, (2) the quantity of drugs involved supported the court\u2019s finding that he was not a minor participant, and (3) he failed to produce any evidence in support of his mitigating role. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939, 941, 943. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">\n<em>IV. Booker Reasonableness (Arias only)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We review sentences imposed under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory Guideline scheme for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 260-63, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66 (holding that appellate court review sentences for unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have held that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s advisory Guideline range, and then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Moreover, our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We have stated that we \u201cmust evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a),\u201d and that in evaluating a sentence for reasonableness, we recognize that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 786; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">In <em>United States v. Scott, </em>we held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors. 426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). We held \u201cthat nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">In the instant case, the district court imposed a sentence that was reasonable. First, as discussed in Issue V, the district court correctly calculated the range. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. Second, the district court\u2019s Guideline sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment was within the Guideline range and did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Third, the record reveals that the district court, in imposing the sentence, took into consideration the statutory factors such as Arias\u2019s history and characteristics, the seriousness of the offense, and the need for adequate deterrence. Although the district court did not explicitly discuss each statutory factor, it was not required to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. Fourth, the district court applied the Guidelines in an advisory manner. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>\n<em>V. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 acceptance-of-responsibility reduction (Arias only)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">\u201cThis Court reviews the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Dodd, </em>111 F.3d 867, 870 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cA district court occupies the unique position to evaluate whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for his acts; its determination is entitled to great deference on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Hromada, </em>49 F.3d 685, 689 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense receives a two-level decrease in his offense level. In the determining whether the defendant has accepted responsibility, the commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 states in pertinent part that the court should look to several considerations, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">(a) truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Note that a defendant is not required to volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction in order to obtain a reduction under subsection (a). A defendant may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction under this subsection. However, a defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">(h) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s conduct in manifesting the acceptance of responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l). We have noted that a court can consider a wide range of evidence in deciding whether an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction is appropriate such as \u201cthe offender\u2019s recognition of the wrongfulness of his conduct, his remorse for the harmful consequences of that conduct, and his willingness to turn away from that conduct in the future.\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1215 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Arias had not met his burden of clearly demonstrating his acceptance of responsibility. The record supports the court\u2019s denial on the basis that Arias\u2019s plea was untimely. Arias only agreed to plea after a jury had been selected and the government had expended considerable resources in preparing for trial, in part due to counsel\u2019s representation that Arias was proceeding to trial. More importantly, Arias, other than agreeing to the factual basis of the plea, did not put forth any evidence or testimony clearly demonstrating his acceptance-of-responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">\n<em>VI. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 prior-conviction enhancement (Arias only)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Gray, </em>260 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.2001). Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), a person who has a prior conviction for a felony drug offense \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life imprisonment\u201d upon being convicted of a subsequent felony drug offense. In seeking an enhanced penalty based on a prior conviction, the government must file an information listing the conviction before trial or the entry of a guilty plea. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">The government\u2019s decision to provide notice under \u00a7 851(a)(1) to one defendant, but not to another is \u201csimilar to the discretion a prosecutor exercises when he de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>cides what, if any, charges to bring against a criminal suspect. Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, so long as it is not based upon improper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 761-62, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997) (rejecting an argument that prosecutorial discretion under \u00a7 851 leads to unwanted sentencing disparity). We have noted that \u201cunder \u00a7 851 ... prosecutors may file for enhanced sentences only in a limited and explicitly defined category of cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329, 1334 (11th Cir.1998). Furthermore, we have concluded \u201cthat a defendant has no constitutional right to avoid the statutory enhancement, and therefore has no grounds upon which to challenge the delegation of discretion over when the government may seek the enhancement as long as the exercise of that discretion does not offend some other constitutional provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we have stated that <em>post-Booker </em>district court are still bound by the statutory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">First, there is no allegation or evidence that the government\u2019s filing of an \u00a7 851 information was based on any improper factor. Second, Arias\u2019s due process argument was foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>LaBonte </em>decision. 520 U.S. at 761-62, 117 S.Ct. at 1679. Lastly, Arias\u2019s argument that the district court post-<em>Booker </em>is not bound by the statutory minimum sentence was foreclosed by our decision in <em>Shelton. </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Arias\u2019s and Lopez-Moreno\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-8\">.
