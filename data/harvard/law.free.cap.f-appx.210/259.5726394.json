Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Gomes fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for asylum eligibility; having failed to qualify for asylum, Gomes also cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Gomes also asserts on appeal that public policy, as reflected in the International Religious Freedom Act, contravenes return of a Christian to a non-Christian country. Our review discloses that this claim was not raised before the Board and was therefore not properly exhausted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000). As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1049, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005). Likewise, Gomes failed to raise a CAT claim before the Board. And given that Gomes failed to set forth any argument in his brief before this court with regard to the denial of CAT relief, we find that he has abandoned that claim on appeal. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> Gomes\u2019s wife, Cecilia, and child are derivative petitioners. Both are natives and citizens of India.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
