We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">Marin, along with three other defendants, was indicted on two counts for crimes connected to possession and conspiracy to possess cocaine while on board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction. Rl-1. He plead guilty to both counts without a plea agreement. Rl-54, Rl-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">On 27 February 2005, the United States Coast Guard detected and pursued a go-fast vessel on international waters in the Caribbean Sea. Rl-35 at 3. While fleeing at a high rate of speed, the go-fast vessel\u2019s occupants dumped bales of cocaine overboard. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the Coast Guard shot out the vessel\u2019s engine to end the pursuit. <em>Id. </em>The Coast Guard boarded the vessel and recovered 48 bales of cocaine, weighing \u201cat least 1,200 kilograms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The Coast Guard arrested the vessel\u2019s four occupants, one of whom was Marin. Although none of the vessel\u2019s occupants admitted to being the captain, it was later determined that one of them, Juan Pablo Castro, was the vessel\u2019s captain. <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">Based on the amount of cocaine found in the vessel, the probation officer assigned Marin a base offense level of 38, a two-level safety-valve reduction, and a three-level acceptance of responsibility reduction for a total offense level of 33. Marin, with no criminal history points, was assigned a criminal history category of I, resulting in a guideline imprisonment range of 135-168 months. R2-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">Marin objected that he should have received a minor or minimal role reduction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>because he was not an organizer, manager, or supervisor of the charged criminal activity and his \u201crole in this offense compared to his other co-defendants is minimal at best and minor at the least.\u201d Rl-72 at 8; R2 at 5-8. Marin stated that he was entitled to such a reduction because: (1) he did not plan the trip; (2) he was not paid for the drug shipment; (3) he did not have a financial interest in the drugs; and (4) he was unaware of the delivery plans for the drugs. Rl-72 at 6; R2 at 7. At the sentencing hearing, Marin emphasized that he was only one small piece of a much larger conspiracy. R2 at 6-7. In support of mitigation, Marin presented information about his impoverished background, his sick mother, his children, and his lack of a criminal background. <em>Id. </em>at 10-15. Marin also spoke directly to the district court and asked for forgiveness. <em>Id. </em>at 17. The government responded to Marin\u2019s reduction request that he had failed in his responsibility to show that he was less culpable than most other participants, but made no argument concerning Marin\u2019s mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The district court overruled Marin\u2019s objection and found that he was as culpable as his fellow crew members, and adopted the probation officer\u2019s findings of fact and suggested guideline range. R2 at 8-9. After Marin\u2019s presentation of mitigation information and request for forgiveness, the district court noted that Marin had attempted to harm families in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 17-18. The district court told Marin that it \u201cunderstood his] poverty and ... need\u201d but commented that he would \u201chave to find some other legitimate way to support\u201d his family. <em>Id. </em>at 18. The district court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements, the guidelines, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Marin to concurrent prison sentences of 135 months and concurrent five years on supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">On appeal, Marin presents two issues: (1) whether the district court clearly erred in finding that Marin was not entitled to a minimal or minor role reduction; and (2) whether the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence on Marin.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">A. <em>Minimal or Minor Role Reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Marin argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minimal or minor participant reduction. Marin argues that because his role was limited to one shipment and not to the larger drug distribution conspiracy, he is less culpable than most other participants. Acknowledging that the court must consider Marin\u2019s role in relation to the relevant conduct used to calculate his base offense level, Marin cites U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a) for what constitutes relevant conduct and argues that the district court failed to take the \u00a7 lB1.3(a) factors into account when refusing his request for a minor or minimal role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">We have \u201clong and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G \u00a7 3B1.2(a). A defendant is a minimal participant if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment (n.4). The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In determining whether a role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [ ]he has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, h[is] role as compared to that of other participants in h[is] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. In looking to relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating h[is] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. For a drug offense, the judge may not consider the \u201cgreater drug conspiracy,\u201d but only the conduct that determined the defendant\u2019s base offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 942. Furthermore, in the drug courier context, the amount of drugs involved \u201cis a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in h[is] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. In looking at the defendant\u2019s role in comparison to other participants, \u201cthe district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in h[is] relevant conduct\u201d before granting a role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">In this case, under the first prong of the <em>Be Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, Marin\u2019s emphasis on his minor role in the greater drug conspiracy is irrelevant. <em>See id. </em>at 942 (the determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the case must be based on the relevant conduct charged). The only relevant facts are those surrounding the transport of at least 1,200 kilograms of cocaine found on the go-fast vessel. Marin\u2019s base offense level was calculated according to this one shipment of cocaine. It cannot be said that he played a minor role in the shipment of cocaine with which he was involved. In addition, the large amount of drugs involved further establishes that Marin did not have a minor role. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943 (the \u201camount of drugs is a relevant factor and ... under some circumstances it may be dispositive.\u201d). Under the second prong of <em>Be Var\u00f3n, </em>all of the other participants, other than the captain, were in the same position as Marin, riding on the go-fast vessel and transporting the drugs. Marin presented no evidence or argument as to why he was less culpable than the other go-fast crew members, beyond a bare assertion that he was less culpable. Marin thus failed to show that the district court clearly erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">B. <em>Unreasonable sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Marin argues that the 135-month sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable because it failed to consider certain 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, specifically his lack of a criminal history, and his family\u2019s health and educational and financial background, and merely applied a minimum guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">\u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). Some factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\u201d (2) \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed \u2014 to reflect the seriousness of the offense\u201d; (3) \u201cthe need ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d; and (4) the sentencing range established by the sentencing guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(C), (a)(4). District courts, however, do not need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>establish the reasonableness of the imposed sentence by explicitly considering every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. In determining if the district court has adequately considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we may look to the district court\u2019s statements over the entire sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Although a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, the Guidelines remain central to the sentencing process. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Therefore, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Marin presented evidence regarding his impoverished background and his familial responsibilities. R2 at 10-16. The evidence showed that he was a Columbian indigenous Indian whose family lived in poverty, with no sewer system, drinkable water, hospitals, open roads, trails, or transportation. <em>Id. </em>at 11-15. He had served in the military, had no criminal record, and was the primary financial support for his seriously ill mother, his common law wife, and his seven children. <em>Id. </em>Following the presentation of the mitigation evidence and a statement by Marin, the district court addressed Marin stating that it understood his poverty and needs. <em>Id. </em>at 18. In addition, the court discussed the harm that cocaine causes to families and the need to protect the public, commenting that Marin was \u201cbringing the cocaine for consumption in the United States to harm our families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also specifically acknowledged taking into consideration the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. Thus, the district court\u2019s deliberations reflect consideration of: (1) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to protect the public; and (3) the sentencing guidelines. Because the imposition of Marin\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of several relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court explicitly acknowledged utilizing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which is all that is required by <em>Scott, </em>the sentence it imposed was reasonable. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Marin was not entitled to a minor or minimal role reduction because he was only held accountable for the drugs he transported, the amount of drugs was very large, and he produced no evidence that he was less culpable then most other people on the boat transporting the drugs. Moreover, the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable as it considered the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
