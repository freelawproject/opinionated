Maqsood argues that the BIA erroneously determined that he failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-24\">Maqsood\u2019s claims of past persecution are based on his assertion that when he was 14-years old members of the MQM party fired at a car in which he was riding with his mother because his father was a member of a rival political party. He also claims that the MQM made threatening telephone calls to his house. Maqsood admitted at the hearing before the IJ that he had no proof that the MQM was involved in the attack on his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Maqsood\u2019s also fears future persecution if returned to Pakistan. Maqsood admitted, however, that he and his family remained in Pakistan without suffering any harm for one-and-a-half years after the attack on his car. And, he admitted that his father returned to Pakistan to attend a wedding and complete a business deal without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings that Maqsood failed to show past persecution on account of a protected ground or a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
