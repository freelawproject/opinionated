Harvey appeals his guilty plea conviction and sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm. He argues that he was sentenced in violation of his plea agreement and that the district court erred in upwardly departing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-27\">For the first time on appeal, Harvey argues that the terms of his plea agreement were violated by (1) the district court\u2019s upward departure from the advisory guideline range; (2) the Government\u2019s failure to move for a third acceptance-of-responsibility credit; and (3) the district court\u2019s failure to offer him the opportunity to withdraw his plea. Affording his argument plain error review, <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Munoz, </em>408 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.2005), we hold that the conduct of the district court and the Government was entirely consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement. <em>See United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1295 (5th Cir.1994). Consequently, his breach argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Harvey additionally argues for the first time on appeal that the district court\u2019s upward departure was erroneous. Affording this argument plain error review, <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006), we hold that Harvey has shown no error, plain or otherwise. To the extent that Harvey seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to award him a two-level \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment, that issue is inadequately briefed and is therefore waived. <em>United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 611 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
