California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but presenting one issue for our review. Counsel suggests the district court erred in denying Odom\u2019s motion for a downward departure due to Odom\u2019s extraordinary physical condition. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5H1.4 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines is not subject to appellate review unless the refusal to depart is based on the mistaken belief that the court lacked jurisdiction to depart. <em>United States v. Quinn, </em>359 F.3d 666, 682 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990)); <em>see also United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases adopting this rule after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). Here, the district court recognized its authority to depart but found, under the circumstances of Odom\u2019s case, that departure was not warranted. Thus, this claim is not subject to appellate review. <em>Quinn, </em>359 F.3d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Odom\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but his counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
