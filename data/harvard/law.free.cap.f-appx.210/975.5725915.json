Nesbitt asserts the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress post-arrest statements he made to detectives that he claims were in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights to silence and counsel. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Specifically, Nesbitt maintains the detectives induced him into cooperating by assuring him that he had a meritorious self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, reviewing the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Gil, </em>204 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2000). All facts are construed in a light most favorable to the successful party. <em>United States v. Behety, </em>32 F.3d 503, 510 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\"><em>Miranda, </em>86 S.Ct. at 1612, guarantees the right against self-incrimination by ensuring the accused\u2019s right to remain silent and right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation. \u201cThe law in this area is clear: once an accused requests counsel, the officer cannot ask questions, discuss the case, or present the accused with possible sentences and the benefits of cooperation.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>927 F.2d 1530, 1539 (11th Cir.1991). An accused waives his previously asserted right to silence or right to counsel when he reinitiates conversation with law enforcement officers. <em>Henderson v. Singletary, </em>968 F.2d 1070, 1072-73 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cHowever, [ ] where the accused initiates a conversation after a request for counsel, an officer\u2019s explanation of the investigation and the possibility of cooperation\u201d is not improper. <em>Gomez, </em>927 F.2d at 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">In the instant case, Nesbitt initiated conversation with the detectives when they asked him for his shoes, then voluntarily questioned the officers about self-defense, thereby waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The district court did not clearly err in finding that (1) Nesbitt reinitiated conversation with the detectives; and (2) the detectives did not induce Nesbitt into cooperating by implying that he had a meritorious self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Nesbitt also argues that the imposition of his sentence violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. Nesbitt acknowledges that this Court rejected similar arguments in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1306-07 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005), and <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348 (11th Cir.2006), but submits this argument to preserve the issue for further appellate review. The district court did not sentence Nesbitt in excess of the statutory-maximum in effect at the time of the conduct and therefore did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Upon review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we have determined the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
