Carr\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. Califor</em>nia, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging there are no meritorious issues on appeal but noting that Carr challenges the validity of his plea and sentence. Although informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Carr has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">Because Carr did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and conclude that the district court did not err in accepting Carr\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-18\">At sentencing, the district court considered the properly calculated advisory sentencing guideline range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). The sentence imposed is within the guideline range and well below the statutory maximum set forth in \u00a7 841. We find that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>error by the district court at the sentencing hearing and that Carr\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Carr\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
