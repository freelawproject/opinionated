Inter alia, </em>she challenges the dismissal with prejudice of her claims against: the City of Baytown, Baytown Police Department, Dell Computers, Inc., Reliant Energy, and Crosby State Bank for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6); Crosby Independent School District (CISD) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6); and the Harris County Sheriffs Department because, as a <em>non sui juris </em>division of Harris County, it lacks the capacity to be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Along this line, the Office of the Texas Attorney General (OAG) and Texas Department of Family and Protective Services\u2019 (TDFPS) seek summary affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Potts\u2019 claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Finally, at issue is an order barring any new actions by Potts absent judicial approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">Potts sued these parties for various vague and seemingly unrelated claims including discrimination, conspiracy, harassment, retaliation, slander, and violation of her equal-protection rights. In her second amended complaint, Potts alleged, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the City of Baytown, its police department, and TDFPS violated her civil rights by conspiring with her mother, her ex-husband, Baker Downs Apartments, and Harris County to terminate her parental rights; (2) the City and police department violated her civil rights by failing to protect her from, and refusing to investigate, harassment claims; (3) CISD engaged in employment discrimination by \u201cfiring her from her job as a school bus driver with no explanation\u201d; (4) Dell Computers and Crosby State Bank caused her to incur insufficient funds charges and conspired against her; (5) Reliant Energy discriminated against her by failing to invoice her for 11 months and then sending five bills at once for an apartment she never inhabited; and (6) the Harris County Sheriffs Department failed to investigate a burglary of her apartment, disregarded pleas to investigate her harassment, and slandered her by placing theft charges on her record, causing her to lose two jobs; and (7) the OAG violated her civil rights by directing her ex-husband to mail child-support payments to the Harris County Child Support Division and failed to modify her child-support amount in spite of her requests. On 28 June 2005, the district court granted these defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and dismissed this action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants are liberally construed. <em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988). Nevertheless, such litigants must brief issues to preserve them. <em>Id. </em>(finding inadequate fleeting error claims that provide no analysis or authority) (citing Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)); <em>see also In re Tex. Mortgage Servs. Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1068, 1073 (5th Cir.1985)(holding abandoned appellant\u2019s unbriefed claims; collecting cases). \u201cWe will not raise and discuss legal issues that [an appellant] has failed to assert.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). In practical effect, a cursory \u201crecitation of familiar rules governing our review of summary judgments, without even the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis or [] application\u201d is as if the appellant makes no appeal at all. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Potts asserts the district court erred in dismissing her claims and in barring new claims because it \u201cdetermin[ed] that [her] claims were not legitimate, simply because of allegations that [she] suffers from a mental illness or \u2018Delusional Disorder\u2019 \u201d. Claiming \u201ca complete lack of evidence to support the conclusions that [her] claims were a \u2018delusion\u2019 and \u2018frivolous\u2019 \u201d, she demands this court review the record for this purpose. She cites no authority, save one inapposite reference to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35 (authorizing a district court to order a medical examination when a party\u2019s mental condition is in issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Potts fails to make \u201ceven the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis\u201d. <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Specifically, the court granted City of Baytown, Baytown Police Department, Dell Computers, Crosby State Bank, and Reliant Energy\u2019s 12(b)(6) motions because Potts made no cognizable claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 or 1985(3). <em>Potts v. Crosby Ind. Sch. Dist., </em>No. Civ.A. H-04-2852, 2005 WL 1527657 at *4-5, 8-9 (S.D.Tex.28 June 2005) (Police Department is not a separate legal entity and thus cannot be sued (citing <em>Darby v. Pasadena Police Dept., </em>939 F.2d 311, 314 (5th Cir.1991)); City cannot be held liable because plaintiff failed to demonstrate injury resulting from decision by a final policy maker (citing <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 483, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986))). Similarly, Potts\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Dell Computers, Crosby State Bank, and Reliant Energy were dismissed as conclusory, <em>id. </em>at *4-5 (citing <em>S. Christian Leadership Conf. v. Supreme Court of La., </em>252 F.3d 781, 786 (5th Cir.)(\u201clegal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions\u201d insufficient to survive 12(b)(6) motion), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 995, 122 S.Ct. 464, 151 L.Ed.2d 381 (2001)); and because these parties are not state actors and did not act under color of state law, <em>id. </em>at *4 (citing <em>Am. Mfg. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999)). Her \u00a7 1985(3) claim failed because, even liberally construed, it met none of the requisite elements. <em>Id. </em>at *5 (citing <em>Horaist v. Doctor\u2019s Hosp. of Opelousas, </em>255 F.3d 261, 270 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The district court granted CISD\u2019s 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) motions because Potts\u2019 alleged \u201cno set of facts ... entitling] her to relief\u2019; therefore, she failed to meet the legal requirements of her claims against CISD. <em>Id. </em>at *5-8 (citing <em>Teague v. City of Flower Mound, Tex., </em>179 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.1999) (setting forth elements to employee First Amendment retaliation claims against an employer); and <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983) (no scrutiny required of reasons for discharge if employee\u2019s speech does not address a matter of public concern)). The court held that Harris County Sheriffs Department, as a <em>non sui juris </em>division of Harris Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ty, lacks the capacity to be sued. <em>Id. </em>at *7-8 (citing <em>Darby, </em>939 F.2d at 313). Finally, it held Potts\u2019 claims against OAG and TDFPS barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at *3 (citing <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (Eleventh Amendment bars suits against state agencies by state\u2019s citizens unless the state waives sovereign immunity or Congress, pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, intentionally abrogates that immunity)).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In any event, Potts has not sufficiently challenged the district court\u2019s rulings to require review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
