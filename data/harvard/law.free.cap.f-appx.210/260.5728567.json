Coleman Trucking, LLC (Coleman Trucking) in a personal injury action pursuant to commercial automobile liability policies separately issued by Empire and CNA to Coleman Trucking. The personal injury action arose from an underlying automobile accident involving a tractor-trailer owned by Coleman Trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Following discovery, CNA moved for summary judgment, and Empire moved for partial summary judgment. The dis-positive issue in the case is which commercial automobile liability policy was in effect at the time of the underlying accident, the one issued by Empire or the one issued by CNA. In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the district court concluded that only Empire\u2019s policy was in effect at the time of the underlying accident. Accordingly, the district court granted CNA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Empire\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment. Empire noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Having thoroughly reviewed the district court\u2019s opinion and the parties\u2019 briefs and submissions on appeal, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of CNA. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of CNA on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Empire Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>426 F.Supp.2d 329 (D.Md. 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
