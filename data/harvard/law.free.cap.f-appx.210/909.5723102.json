In her amended complaint in this case, she sought money damages from Naphcare, Inc., which provided medical care for inmates at the facility, ten physicians, and thirty-eight other individuals, including the facility\u2019s Director of Nursing, Robert Nichols, several nurses and correctional officers and the facility\u2019s warden. The amended complaint contains four counts; Counts II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII each incorporate by reference the allegations of all preceding counts. For our purposes, the case presents two bases for liability: (1) the defendants failed to exercise the care, skill, and diligence as other similar health care providers would have afforded Cassady under the circumstances, as required by the Alabama Medical Liability Act (AMLA), Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-480 <em>et seq., </em>and \u00a7 6-5-540 <em>et seq., </em>and (2) the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Cassady\u2019s serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and, thus, are answerable in damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By the time the district court granted the summary judgment now before us for review, the defendants had been reduced to Naphcare, three physicians, the Director of Nursing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Nichols, a registered nurse practitioner, and a licensed practical nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The district court granted these defendants summary judgment in a comprehensive 91-page Memorandum of Opinion and final judgment issued on May 5, 2006. The court rejected appellant\u2019s AMLA claim on two grounds. First, appellant\u2019s experts were not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to the two physicians who were most involved in Cassady\u2019s care and allegedly breached their AMLA duties, the Director of Nursing, Nichols, and the licensed practical nurse. Second, appellant failed to establish that the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence \u201cprobably\u201d caused Cassady\u2019s death. The court rejected appellant\u2019s constitutional claim under \u00a7 1983 on the ground that appellant failed to establish the components of an Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim against any of these defendants; that is, that the defendant was aware of Cassady\u2019s serious medical needs and yet was deliberately indifferent to such needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal challenges the court\u2019s May 5, 2006 order (with the exception of the grant of summary judgment to one of the physicians) in its entirety. Appellant\u2019s brief on appeal, however, only addresses the judgment granted to Nichols, the Director of Nursing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have carefully examined the district court\u2019s reasons for granting Nichols summary judgment and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-9\">. We therefore consider abandoned appellant\u2019s appeal as to the other defendants named in the notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
