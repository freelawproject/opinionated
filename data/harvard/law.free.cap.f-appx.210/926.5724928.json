(AFC). Shahbaz also appeals the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to AFC. AFC cross-appeals, arguing that its motion for Rule 11 sanctions was improperly denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">The district court granted AFC summary judgment on Shahbaz\u2019s claims that AFC breached the development agreement between the parties by failing to provide him with proper site development assistance with regard to location of a Popeye\u2019s restaurant at a Highway 249 location and that AFC defrauded Shahbaz with respect to the possibility that Shahbaz could open a Popeye\u2019s restaurant at the Eldridge Location. Shahbaz concedes that he did not provide AFC with a site approval request (SAR) for the Highway 249 location. We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that, because Shahbaz did not submit an SAR, AFC had no obligation under the development agreement to provide the site development assistance that Shahbaz complains was lacking. Neither do we find error in the district court\u2019s determination that Shahbaz\u2019s fraud claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Shahbaz presented no evidence in the district court to rebut AFC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">Finally, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to AFC. The development agreement provides that Shahbaz will pay AFC \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by [AFC] in connection with any litigation relating to any aspect of\u2019 the development agreement. (Development Agreement, 11.04.) A review of the complaint and the summary judgment papers filed by Shahbaz demonstrates that all of the claims he asserted were confused and intertwined throughout the litigation and that each of them could be reasonably construed as \u201clitigation relating to any aspect of\u2019 the development agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">On the cross-appeal, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award Rule 11 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
