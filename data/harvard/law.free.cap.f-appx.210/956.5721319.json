The BIA dismissed Ceja\u2019s appeal based upon Ceja\u2019s appeal waiver he had made before the IJ. The issue before this Court is whether Ceja\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny Ceja\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-24\">Ceja entered the United States in May 1985 and adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident on July 31, 1991. On December 15, 1989, however, Ceja was convicted in California for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell. On August 2, 2005, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Ceja a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A) because, at the time Ceja adjusted his status, he was within a class of inadmissible aliens, specifically, aliens who had been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a State. On November 1, 2005, Ceja moved the IJ to terminate his removal proceedings or, alternatively, change the venue to San Francisco, California. In this motion, Ceja argued that his proceedings should have been terminated because he was not actually deportable, or, in the alternative, that his case should have been moved to California for him to pursue his claim that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996). The IJ never ruled on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">On November 15, 2005, Ceja appeared before an IJ for a hearing with regard to his removal proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A sworn interpreter translated the hearing from English to Spanish. Ceja, who was not represented by counsel, admitted that he was convicted of the above-mentioned offense in December 1989. The IJ found that, based upon Ceja\u2019s admissions, he was removable as charged in the NTA. Ceja indicated that he did not have a fear of torture or persecution upon his return to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The IJ then rendered his oral decision, in which the IJ determined that, because Ceja was not eligible to adjust his status at the time he sought such adjustment, he did not properly obtain lawful permanent resident status. The IJ further found that removability had been established by clear and convincing evidence, and that Ceja was ineligible for the minimum form of relief, voluntary departure, because of his 1989 conviction. Thus, the IJ ordered Ceja removed to Mexico. After the IJ\u2019s rendition of its oral decision, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-8\">IJ: Sir, I\u2019ve just ordered you deported to Mexico. If you disagree with this decision, you have a right to appeal or you can accept the order of removal. Ceja: How long would it take to appeal? IJ: I will reserve your right to appeal. That appeal will be due December 15th, 2005. The Board of Immigration Appeals will immediately review your file and will do their best to have a decision back to you within six months to a year. Ceja: No, I\u2019d rather sign the deportation. How long will it take for me to be sent to Mexico?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-9\">IJ: Well, since you waived it and it\u2019s now a final order, the Government will then move you as soon as possible. You may not remain, you may not return to the United States for 20 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-10\">Ceja: That\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. No problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-11\">IJ: And you may not return to the United States without proper documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-12\">Ceja: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-13\">IJ: Also because of this drug conviction, it may mean that you may never be allowed to enter the United States in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-14\">Ceja: Doesn\u2019t matter, I just want to go back to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-15\">IJ: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>The IJ\u2019s written order of removability was entered on November 15, 2005, and indicated that Ceja waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">On November 18, 2005, Ceja filed a notice of appeal to the BIA, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his waiver of his right to appeal the IJ\u2019s order was not voluntary and intelligent because he was coerced by the IJ. Ceja also asserted that his waiver of his right to appeal was especially questionable in light of his motion to terminate his removal proceedings, which Ceja filed on November 1, 2005 and \u201cthe IJ ignored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">The BIA dismissed Ceja\u2019s appeal, finding that Ceja waived his right to appeal. Specifically, the BIA found that Ceja\u2019s waiver was valid because: (1) the removal hearing was translated into Spanish for Ceja\u2019s benefit; (2) Ceja admitted that he had been convicted of possession of cocaine; (3) there was no evidence that the IJ coerced Ceja to waive his right to appeal by informing Ceja that it could take six months to one year to resolve his appeal; and (4) the IJ made no statement regarding whether Ceja would be detained pending the resolution of his appeal. The BIA also noted that, despite Ceja\u2019s argument that he had submitted a motion in which he argued that he was not subject to removal and that the IJ had not addressed that motion, Ceja did not pursue that motion before the IJ and, furthermore, he admitted that he was convicted of possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Ceja argues on appeal that the BIA and IJ violated his due process rights because his appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary. He specifically contends that the IJ misrepresented the time within which the BIA would conclude an appeal of his case because the IJ told Ceja that it would take approximately six months to one year, which time-frame is contrary to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(8). He asserts that the BIA\u2019s finding that the IJ never told Ceja that he would be incarcerated during an appeal ignores the fact that the IJ previously had denied Ceja\u2019s motion for bond. He also maintains that his motion to terminate or change venue, in conjunction with the IJ\u2019s misrepresentation of the appeal time, establishes that his appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to entertain Ceja\u2019s petition for review. We have no jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if the alien is inadmissible or removable by reason of having committed a violation of a State law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); INA \u00a7 212(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2). Ceja admitted at his removal hearing that he was convicted of committing a controlled substance offense. We retain jurisdiction, however, to consider constitutional claims or questions of law raised in an alien\u2019s petition for review. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Balogun v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, Ceja raises a constitutional claim that his appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary, and, thus, his removal hearing violated his due process rights. Accordingly, we retain jurisdiction to entertain Ceja\u2019s petition for review to the extent that he challenges the validity of his appeal waiver. We review an alien\u2019s constitutional claim <em>de novo. Ali v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Concerning an alien\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal an IJ\u2019s order of removal, the Supreme Court has determined that, where an appeal waiver is not \u201cconsidered or intelligent,\u201d the alien\u2019s deportation proceeding violates due process. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 839-40, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 2156, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). This Court and the BIA have analyzed aliens\u2019 appeal waivers under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>knowing and voluntary standard. <em>See United States v. Holland, </em>876 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir.1989); <em>In Re Rodnguez-Diaz, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); <em>In Re Patino, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 74, 76 (BIA 2001). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mendoza-Lopez </em>and the BIA\u2019s use of a knowing and voluntary standard, we will review the record to determine whether an alien\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary, considered, or intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Based upon the record in Ceja\u2019s case, the IJ did not coerce Ceja into waiving his right to appeal. In fact, the IJ initially reserved Ceja\u2019s right to appeal and deemed the right waived only after Ceja insisted that he would \u201crather sign the deportation.\u201d Ceja argues on appeal that the IJ misrepresented the time-frame within which an appeal to the BIA would be pending. According to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(8), \u201cafter completion of the record on appeal ... the [BIA] ... shall issue a decision on the merits as soon as practicable, with a priority for cases or custody appeals involving detained aliens.\u201d The regulation specifically provides that the BIA \u201cshall dispose of all appeals assigned to a single Board member within 90 days of completion of the record on appeal, or within 180 days after an appeal is assigned to a three-member panel.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(8)(i). However, the regulation makes clear that the above time limit \u201creflects] an internal management directive in favor of timely dispositions,\u201d but does not \u201ccreate any substantive or procedural rights enforceable before any immigration judge or the Board, or in any court of law or equity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(8)(vi). Thus, even though the IJ\u2019s response that the BIA would begin processing Ceja\u2019s file \u201cimmediately\u201d and would \u201cdo their best to have a decision back to you within six months to a year\u201d was in conflict with the recommended time limits set forth in the regulation, it was not a misrepresentation because the time limits are only internal directives and do not necessarily represent the reality of the BIA\u2019s appeal processing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">To the extent that Ceja argues that his appeal waiver was invalid in light of his pending motion to terminate his removal proceedings or, alternatively, to change venue so that he could raise a claim for \u00a7 212(c) relief, Ceja\u2019s argument is without merit. At Ceja\u2019s removal hearing, the IJ explicitly asked him whether he had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance, and Ceja responded that he had. The IJ then informed Ceja that, as a result of his admission, he was removable as charged in the NTA. At that point Ceja could have, and arguably should have, raised his contention that he was not removable as charged, as he argued in his motion to terminate or change venue. However, Ceja did not contend as such and thus conceded removability. Because he did not challenge his removability before the IJ at his hearing, especially where the IJ had not yet ruled on his motion, Ceja abandoned his claim that he was not removable as charged. In any event, his admissions at the hearing were inconsistent with the position that he maintained in his motion, and, thus, his motion does not support his argument that his appeal waiver was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Accordingly, because the IJ (1) informed Ceja of his right to appeal, (2) explained the consequences of the appeal waiver and Ceja\u2019s deportation, and (3) did not coerce or misinform Ceja regarding the waiver, the BIA did not err in finding that Ceja\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. Thus, Ceja\u2019s removal proceeding did not violate his due process rights. Ceja\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-16\">. The Homeland Security Act (\"HSA\u201d), effective November 25, 2002, created the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d) and abolished the INS. Pub.L.No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135. The HSA transferred INS functions to the DHS. This case was initiated while the INS was still in existence. This memo, therefore, refers to the INS rather than the DHS as the relevant agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b986-6\">. The date listed on the transcript of Ceja\u2019s hearing before the IJ is August 2, 2005, which was the date of his notice to appear. However, it appears that the date is a mistake because the IJ\u2019s written order of removal was entered on November 15, 2005. Moreover, Ceja and the government indicated in their briefs before the BIA that the date on the transcript was incorrect and that the actual date of the hearing and the court\u2019s oral decision was November 15, 2006. This also comports with the IJ\u2019s indication during the hearing that any appeal by Ceja would have had to been filed by December 15, 2006, which was 30 days after the day of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
