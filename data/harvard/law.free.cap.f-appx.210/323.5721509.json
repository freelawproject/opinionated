Counsel has filed an <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), brief and McKoy has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government elected not to file a reply brief. Counsel raises issues of whether McKoy\u2019s sentence was reasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-23\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guideline range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. A sentence imposed within the properly cal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>culated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because the district court adequately explained the basis for its sentencing decision, taking into consideration McKoy\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the resulting 180-month sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.-(U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McKoy\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
