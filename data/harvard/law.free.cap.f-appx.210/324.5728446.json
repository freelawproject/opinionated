The district court sentenced him under the Armed Career Criminal Act to the statutorily-mandated minimum sentence of 180 months of imprisonment. Middleton\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>An</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>ders v. California, </em>886 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issue of the adequacy of the plea colloquy but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Middleton was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Middleton points out that the district court failed to inform him that he could persist in his plea of not guilty as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(B) and also failed to discuss the provision in his plea agreement waiving his appellate rights. Because Middleton did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the record on appeal convinces us that the district court\u2019s failure to explicitly tell Middleton that he could persist in his plea of not guilty did not affect Middleton\u2019s substantial rights. And because the Government is not seeking to enforce the waiver provision in Middleton\u2019s plea agreement, the court\u2019s omission in discussing the waiver also did not affect Middleton\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (discussing factors courts should consider in determining whether substantial rights affected in decision to plead guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Middleton\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his Ghent, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
