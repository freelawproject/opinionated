Zhang concedes that his motion to reopen was not filed until after the 90-day deadline in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) had passed, but Zhang argued before the BIA \u2014 and argues again here \u2014 that his late filing is excused under \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii) because country conditions changed in China when government officials there communicated threats against Zhang to his father in response to Zhang\u2019s Falun Gong activities in the United States. The BIA rejected this argument and denied Zhang\u2019s motion to reopen, reasoning that China\u2019s repressive policy toward Falun Gong practitioners does not- represent a change in country conditions that was not available or discoverable at the time of Zhang\u2019s previous hearing because the policy existed at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">We have jurisdiction to entertain Zhang\u2019s petition for review. <em>Panjwani v. </em>Gonzales, 401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). This situation is analogous to cases affirming the denial of motions to reopen where, for example, the birth of another child in the United States raised for the first time the spectre of persecution under China\u2019s already-existing \u201cone child\u201d policy. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-131 (2d Cir.2005). Like those cases, the policy at issue here was discoverable prior to Zhang\u2019s first hearing even if it only became material for the first time at a later date. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s finding that the threats communicated to Zhang\u2019s father do not reflect the kind of change in country circumstances that is contemplated by \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000); <em>see also Gomez-Arevalo v. Gonzales, </em>161 Fed.Appx. 354, 357 (5th Cir. 2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">Accordingly, Zhang\u2019s motion for judicial notice is GRANTED, but his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
