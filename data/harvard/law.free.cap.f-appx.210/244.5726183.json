AtlantiGas appeals the district court\u2019s disposition. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">Gaslantic Corporation (\u201cGaslantic\u201d) was a purchaser of natural gas supplies in the wholesale market for resale to commercial and industrial end-user customers, who in turn burned the gas for heating or manufacturing purposes. Gaslantic also provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ed advisory services to the end-user natural gas customers in connection with those customers\u2019 acquisition of natural gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In September 1998, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), Pepeo Services, Inc. (\u201cPSI\u201d) agreed to purchase and Gaslantic agreed \u201cto sell, transfer, convey, and deliver to [PSI] ... all of the Acquired Assets for the consideration specified [in the Agreement].\u201d The parties defined the term \u201cAcquired Assets\u201d in part as \u201call right, title, and interest in and to all of the assets and properties of [Gaslantic] owned, used or held for use by [Gaslantic] primarily in connection with the Business, whether tangible or intangible, whether real, personal, or mixed, whether fixed, contingent or otherwise, and wherever located.... \u201d The \u201cBusiness\u201d as defined in the Agreement is limited to the \u201cbusiness of retail natural gas marketing and advisory services.\u201d In addition to selling all of its Acquired Assets, Gaslantic agreed to change its name to AtlantiGas Corporation and contracted, as AtlantiGas, not to engage in any natural gas related business for a specified period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In consideration for Gaslantic\u2019s sale of all of its Acquired Assets, PSI agreed to pay Gaslantic $4.28 million plus Contingent Payments, which were calculated according to PSI\u2019s annual gross earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In February 1999, subsequent to consummation of the PSI and Gaslantic Agreement, two natural gas pipeline companies, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company, disclosed their conduct in an alleged illegal parking and lending scheme to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d). According to this disclosure, from 1996 to May 1999, three pipeline companies (\u201cPipeline Company Defendants\u201d) were allegedly providing eight select natural gas shipper companies (\u201cSelect Shipper Defendants\u201d) with illegal natural gas storage and transportation services in exchange for \u201ckickback\u201d payments. The scheme allegedly allowed the Select Shipper Defendants to deliver natural gas at locations and prices that other natural gas shippers could not meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">FERC instituted an investigation and in October 2000, issued an order approving a Stipulation and Consent Agreement with regard to the two pipeline companies who reported their actions. Under this order, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company agreed to refund certain penalties and disgorge profits to the industry participants who FERC found had been illegally excluded from the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Thereafter, on October 22, 2004, AtlantiGas joined seven other \u201cnon-select\u201d natural gas shipper companies (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) in filing a proposed class action against the Pipeline Company Defendants and the Select Shipper Defendants (collectively \u201cAppellees\u201d) in West Virginia state court, seeking damages under theories of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of state and federal antitrust laws. Appellees removed the case to federal court. Subsequently, Appellees filed a joint motion to dismiss AtlantiGas pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In short, Appellees contended that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement AtlantiGas had sold the claims it asserted in the underlying lawsuit to PSI and, therefore, did not have standing to pursue those claims against Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The district court dismissed all of AtlantiGas\u2019s claims, concluding that AtlantiGas had sold all its claims under the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the Agreement. The district court found that the language of the Agreement was clear and unambiguous on its face and that since the claims arising out of the alleged illegal parking and lending scheme had been transferred to PSI as part of the sale of Gaslantic, AtlantiGas had not suffered a redressable injury and, therefore, did not have standing to pursue the instant claims against Appellees. On appeal AtlantiGas challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R. Co. v. United States, </em>945 F.2d 765, 768-69 (4th Cir.1991) (citing <em>Revene v. Charles County Comm\u2019rs, </em>882 F.2d 870, 872 (4th Cir.1989); <em>Shultz v. Dept. of the Army, 886 </em>F.2d 1157, 1159 (9th Cir.1989)). In ruling on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion a court must apply the standard applicable to a motion for summary judgment, under which the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts beyond the pleadings to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Richmond, </em>945 F.2d at 768 (citing <em>Trentacosta v. Frontier Pacific Aircraft Indus., </em>813 F.2d 1553, 1558 (9th Cir.1987)). \u201cThe moving party should prevail only if the material jurisdictional facts are not in dispute and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Trentacosta, </em>813 F.2d at 1558).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We apply the substantive law of the State of Delaware to AtlantiGas\u2019s claims, as the parties agreed that the Agreement is \u201cgoverned by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of Delaware.\u201d <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496-97, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941) and <em>Oglesby v. Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>877 F.Supp. 872, 878 (D.Del.1994) (noting that \u201c[ujnder Delaware law, where contracting parties have agreed on what law governs, a court may forgo independent analysis and accept the parties\u2019 agreement\u201d) (citing <em>Wilmington Trust Co. v. Wilmington Trust Co., </em>24 A.2d 309, 313 (Del.Ch.1942); <em>Rosenmiller v. Bordes, </em>607 A.2d 465, 468 (Del.Ch.1991); <em>National Acceptance Co. of California v. Mark S. Hurm, M.D., P.A, </em>CA 84L-JN-7, 1989 WL 70953 *1 (Del.Super.Ct. June 16, 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">A court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over an individual who does not have standing. \u201cStanding is a threshold jurisdictional question which ensures that a suit is a case or controversy appropriate for the exercise of the courts\u2019 judicial powers under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Pye v. United States, </em>269 F.3d 459, 466 (4th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 102, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998)). The core goal of the standing requirement is to ensure that a plaintiff has enough of a stake in the case to litigate it properly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">There are three basic components to standing: injury, causation and redressability. <em>Marshall v. Meadows, </em>105 F.3d 904, 906 (4th Cir.1997). To satisfy the constitutional standing requirement, a plaintiff must provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that: (1) plaintiff suffered an injury in fact, which is an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision of the court. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (citations and internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>quotation marks omitted); <em>White Tail Park, Inc. v. Stroube, </em>413 F.3d 451, 458 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">AtlantiGas initially contends that the district court erred in dismissing the claims it asserts against Appellees because these claims were unknown to AtlantiGas at the time it entered into the Agreement and the Agreement provided only for the transfer of \u201cknown\u201d claims. Alternatively, AtlantiGas maintains that, at a minimum, the Agreement is ambiguous on the issue of whether the claims were included or excluded as Acquired Assets under the Agreement and, therefore, the district court improperly granted Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u201cThe basic rule of contract construction gives priority to the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>498 A.2d 1108, 1113 (Del.1985) (citing <em>Radio Corp. of Am. v. Philadelphia Storage Battery Co., </em>6 A.2d 329 (Del.Supr.1939); <em>Pennwalt Corp. v. Plough, Inc., </em>676 F.2d 77, 80 (3rd Cir. 1982); <em>DuPont v. Wilmington Trust Co., </em>45 A.2d 510 (Del.Ch.1946); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202). A court must determine the intent of the parties from the language of the contract. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Delaware Racing Ass\u2019n, </em>840 A.2d 624, 628 (Del.2003) (citing <em>Kaiser Alum. Corp. v. Matheson, </em>681 A.2d 392, 395 (Del.1996)). This determination may require a court to decide whether or not the disputed contract language is ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA contract is not rendered ambiguous simply because the parties do not agree upon its proper construction.\u201d <em>Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chems. Co. v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>616 A.2d 1192, 1196 (Del.1992). Rather, \u201c[cjontract language is ambiguous if it is \u2018reasonably susceptible of two or more interpretations or may have two or more different meanings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Twin City Fire, </em>840 A.2d at 628 (quoting <em>Kaiser Alum. Corp., </em>681 A.2d at 395).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Ambiguity does not exist where the court can determine the meaning of the contract without any guide other than the knowledge of the simple facts on which its meaning depends. <em>Rhone-Poulenc, </em>616 A.2d at 1196 (quoting <em>Holland v. Hannan, </em>456 A.2d 807, 815 (D.C.App.1983)). Where no ambiguity exists, the contract will be interpreted according to the \u201c \u2018ordinary and usual meaning\u2019 of its terms.\u201d <em>Twin City Fire, </em>840 A.2d at 628 (quoting <em>RhonePoulenc, </em>616 A.2d at 1195). A court will not torture contractual terms to create ambiguity where the ordinary meaning of the terms leaves no room for uncertainty. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Zullo v. Smith, </em>179 Conn. 596, 427 A.2d 409, 412 (1980)). Thus, the true test of whether a contract is ambiguous \u201cis not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Steigler v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>384 A.2d 398, 401 (Del.Supr.1978); <em>State v. Attman/Glazer, </em>323 Md. 592, 594 A.2d 138, 144 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">In upholding the intention of the parties, the court must construe the agreement as a whole, giving effect to all provisions contained therein. <em>E.I. du Pont, </em>498 A.2d at 1113 (citing <em>State v. Dobson, </em>217 A.2d 497 (Del.Supr.1966); <em>Bamdad Mech. Co. v. United Techs. Corp., </em>586 F.Supp. 551 (D.Del.1984)). \u201cMoreover, the meaning which arises from a portion of the agreement cannot control the meaning of the entire agreement where such interference runs contrary to the agreement\u2019s overall scheme or plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Stemerman v. Ackerman, </em>184 A.2d 28, 34 (Del.Ch.1962); <em>Bamdad Mech. Co., </em>586 F.Supp. at 555; <em>Faw, Casson &amp; Co. v. Cranston, </em>375 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>463, 466 (Del.Ch.1977)). \u201cAll provisions of a policy are to be read together and construed according to the plain meaning of the words involved, as to avoid ambiguity while at the same time giving effect to all provisions.\u201d <em>Hercules Inc. v. OneBeacon Am. Ins. Co., </em>852 A.2d 33, 35 (Del.Super.Ct.2004) (citing <em>Delaware County Constr. Co. v. Safeguard Ins. Co., </em>209 Pa.Super. 502, 228 A.2d 15 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the district court\u2019s dismissal of AtlantiGas\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In pertinent part, the Asset Purchase Agreement provides that Gaslantic sold <em>\u201call </em>of the Acquired Assets.\u201d (emphasis added). These \u201cAcquired Assets\u201d are defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\"><em>all </em>right, title, and interest in and to <em>all </em>of the assets and properties of <em>[Gaslantic ] owned, used or held for use by [Gaslantic] primarily in connection with the Business, </em>whether tangible or intangible, whether real, personal or mixed, whether fixed, contingent <em>or otherwise, </em>and wherever located, <em>including, without limitation, </em>the following: ... (e) <em>all </em>of its ... causes of action, chooses [sic] in action, rights of recovery____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">(emphasis added). Moreover, \u201cthe Business\u201d is defined in the Agreement as \u201cthe business of retail natural gas marketing and advisory services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">Our review of the Agreement leads us to conclude that AtlantiGas\u2019s contention that the parties only contracted to transfer \u201cknown\u201d claims is not supported by the clear language of the Agreement and the use of the word \u201call.\u201d In fact, the Agreement does not differentiate between \u201cknown\u201d and \u201cunknown\u201d claims. Rather, according to the unambiguous language of the Agreement, <em>all </em>assets that were \u201cowned, used or held for use, by [Gaslantic] primarily in connection with the [business of retail natural gas marketing and advisory services]\u201d were transferred from Gaslantic to PSI as an Acquired Asset. Notably, the Agreement further emphasized that such assets included those which are \u201ctangible or intangible, ... whether fixed, contingent, or otherwise\u201d and specified that \u201call of [Gaslantic\u2019s] ... claims ..., causes of action, chooses [sic] in action, rights of recovery, rights of set off, and rights of recoupment ...\u201d were included in this definition. The use of the word \u201ccontingent\u201d would include assets dependent upon unknown future events. A \u201ccontingency\u2019 is defined as \u201csomething liable to happen as an adjunct to or result of something else.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster Dictionary, </em>http://www.m-w.com/ cgi-bin/dictionary (last visited November 8, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Therefore, the question is whether the claims AtlantiGas asserts against Appellees fall within the definition of \u201cAcquired Assets.\u201d Or, put another way, were these claims \u201cowned, used or held for use by Gaslantic primarily in connection with the Business.\u201d The Complaint answers this question in the affirmative. AtlantiGas asserted its right to join in the Complaint against Appellees on the basis that it \u201cwas (1) a purchaser, marketer, wholesaler, manager, seller and shipper of natural gas; (2) a customer of [Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation]; and (3) was damaged by the illegal scheme perpetrated by defendants and subject to this complaint.\u201d However, since AtlantiGas\u2019s claims arose out of its role in the natural gas market, those claims were clearly owned, used or held for use primarily in connection with the Business and, therefore, passed as an asset to PSI under the definition of \u201cAcquired Asset.\u201d Additionally, the use of the word \u201call\u201d solidifies our position that the claims asserted by AtlantiGas were transferred to PSI under the Agreement. By using the word \u201call,\u201d the sale of claims language is unqualified and absolute. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>noted by the Delaware courts, \u201c\u2018[a]ll\u2019 means \u2018all,\u2019 or if that is not clear, all, when used before a plural noun such as \u2018assets,\u2019 means \u2018[t]he entire or unabated amount or quantity of; the whole extent, substance, or compass of; the whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hollinger Inc. v. Hollinger Intern., Inc., </em>858 A.2d 342, 377 (Del.Ch.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Given the unambiguity of the language of the Agreement, we agree with the district court that AtlantiGas sold to PSI the claims it asserts against Appellees. Consequently, AtlantiGas does not have standing to assert those claims here and the district court properly granted Appellees\u2019 joint motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">AtlantiGas alternatively argues that it has standing with respect to the claims it asserts against Appellees because, irrespective of whether it sold such claims under the Agreement, through the Contingent Payment provision of the Agreement it retained an ownership interest in the profits earned by PSI, which interest was damaged due to the alleged illegal parking and lending scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The Agreement provided for AtlantiGas to receive Contingent Payments from PSI as part of the purchase price. Specifically, in this respect the Agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">(ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement ... [PSI] shall pay [Gaslantic] the following contingent payments as part of the purchase price (each individually, a <em>\u201cContingent Payment; </em>\u201d collectively, the <em>\u201cContingent Payments </em>\u201d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">(A) On or before March 31, 2000, fifteen percent (15%) of the first Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) in Adjusted Gross Receipts from the operations of the Gaslantic Division relating to commodity sales, utility advisory services and third-party contract services (collectively, the \u201cOperations\u201d), in calendar year (\u201cCY\u201d) 1999, and twenty percent (20%) of all Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations above $6,000,000 in CY 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">(B) On or before March 31, 2001, fifteen percent (15%) of the first Fourteen Million Dollars ($14,000,000) in Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations in calendar year 2000, and twenty percent (20%) of all Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations above $14,000,0000 in CY 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">(C) On or before March 31, 2002, fifteen percent (15%) of the first Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($18,500,000) in Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations in calendar year 2001, and twenty percent (20%) of all Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations above $18,500,000 in CY 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">(D) On or before March 31, 2003, ten percent (10%) of all Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations in CY 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-14\">(E) On or before March 31, 2004, ten percent (10%) of all Adjusted Gross Receipts from the Operations in CY 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">Despite AtlantiGas\u2019s arguments to the contrary, this Contingent Payment provision does not give AtlantiGas standing to assert its claims against Appellees. First, the clear language of the Agreement establishes that these Contingent Payments represented a contractual right, and part of the consideration that PSI paid to purchase Gaslantic. Or; put another way, Gaslantic sold <em>all </em>of its Acquired Assets for $4.23 million and the Contingent Payments. Therefore, if PSI did not pay AtlantiGas according to the Contingent Payment schedule outlined in the Agreement, and do so honestly as an accounting matter, AtlantiGas\u2019s recourse would be to pursue its recovery from PSI, and not from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the Appellees named here.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In fact, if AtlantiGas were permitted to pursue its claims against Appellees, it would be receiving a double recovery \u2014 first from PSI due to its failure to meet the correctly adjusted Contingent Payment schedule and second from the Appellees, whose illegal parking and lending scheme allegedly resulted in a diminution of the Contingent Payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Moreover, as noted above, the Constitutional prerequisites to establish standing require a plaintiff first to show that it suffered an injury in fact, which means that it must establish an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. <em>White Tail Park, </em>413 F.3d at 458. Here, there is no evidence that AtlantiGas suffered a concrete and particularized harm as a result of Appellees\u2019 alleged actions. If we were to agree with AtlantiGas\u2019s contentions, then we would be forced to guess what diminution in revenues, if any, is attributable to PSI and what diminution, if any, is attributable to Appellees. Such alleged damage is too conjectural and abstract, not distinct and palpable. <em>See Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (stating that a core component for standing is that the plaintiff allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s alleged unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed AtlantiGas\u2019s claims against Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ordered that the order of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\"> Indeed, AtlantiGas did sue PSI and settled all claims asserted in that lawsuit. <em>AtlantiGas Corp. v. Potomac Electric Power Co. et al., </em>No. 1.-02-CV-00829 (PLF) (D.D.C. filed June 17, 2002). In its complaint against PSI, AtlantiGas alleged that PSI withheld various post-closing payments due to PSI\u2019s alleged alteration of the company\u2019s books and an alleged failure by PSI to capture and appropriately account for PSI\u2019s post-closing sales. AtlantiGas alleged that as a result of this conduct, PSI diverted monies owed to AtlantiGas and understated the final value of the Gaslantic business.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
