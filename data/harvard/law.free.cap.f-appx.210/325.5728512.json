On appeal, Dickson claims her counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because he: (1) did not honor her request to plead not guilty and proceed to trial; (2) failed to prepare a defense, interview witnesses, and subject the Government\u2019s case to adversarial testing; and (3) despite being on notice of past mental and emotional problems, failed to arrange for a psychological evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless it conclusively appears from the face of the record that counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). We have reviewed the record and find that it does not conclusively demonstrate that Dickson\u2019s counsel was ineffective. Therefore, Dickson\u2019s claims are not reviewable at this stage. Accordingly, we affirm Dickson\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
