As Arreola raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>437 F.3d 450, 451 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2310, 164 L.Ed.2d 830 (2006). We previously rejected a similar argument in an unpublished but precedential decision. <em>See United States v. Wood, </em>No. 94-10217, slip op. at 15, 1995 WL 84100 (5th Cir. Feb.8, 1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Caceda, </em>990 F.2d 707, 710 (2d Cir.1993)). Accordingly, Arreola has not shown plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Arreola also challenges the two points the district court assessed for the possession of firearms under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(l). We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and reviews factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). The district court may adopt facts stated in the presentence report (PSR) if they have an adequate basis and the defendant does not rebut them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">The facts contained in the PSR repeatedly reveal firearms in the organization\u2019s stash houses with drug paraphernalia. Moreover, when officers arrested Arreola in North Carolina, they observed a firearm within easy reach of him in a trailer that also contained narcotics. Arreola has failed to rebut the evidence of the use of firearms in the conspiracy. The record as a whole demonstrates that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Arreola possessed a dangerous weapon in connection with the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-18\">Arreola also argues that the district court clearly erred in assessing a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) four-level adjustment for his leadership role in the offense. Again, Arreola has failed to rebut the considerable evidence in the record that he indeed exercised such a leadership role by directing other individuals in the organization, funding the activities of the organization, and recruiting new members. There is no clear error in the district court assessment of four points for Arreola\u2019s role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-19\">Lastly, Arreola argues that the district court erred in failing to depart downward in recognition of Arreola\u2019s assistance to the Government. The district court\u2019s refusal to depart pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 is not reviewable unless the district court mistakenly believed that it had no discretion to so depart. <em>United States v. Burleson, </em>22 F.3d 93, 94-95 (5th Cir. 1994). There is no evidence in the record that the district court misunderstood its authority under \u00a7 5K1.1. A district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>has no authority to depart on the basis of substantial assistance under \u00a7 5K1.1 absent a Government motion. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>169 F.3d 224, 226 (5th Cir.1999). Thus, the district court\u2019s decision is not reviewable. <em>Id.; Burleson, </em>22 F.3d at 94-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">To the extent that Arreola is contending that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range is unreasonable, he has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">For these reasons, Arreola\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
