No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Appellant was convicted of drug trafficking offenses in the Eastern District of Michigan in 1996; he was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal by the Sixth Circuit. In 1999, Appellant sought relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Section 2255 relief was denied in the Michigan district court; Appellant was denied a certificate of appealability. In 2003, the Sixth Circuit denied Appellant permission to file a successive section 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">In 2005, Appellant, then incarcerated in federal prison in Georgia, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 motion claiming, among other things, that his sentence was unconstitutionally imposed in violation of the principles recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Concluding that Appellant failed to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause of section 2255, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation determining that Appellant\u2019s section 2241 motion was due to be dismissed. The district court also concluded that Appellant failed to satisfy the savings clause of section 2255, adopted the report and recommendation, and dismissed Appellant\u2019s section 2241 petition. Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration in which he also argued that \u201cextraordinary and compelling\u201d reasons warranted the filing of a motion to reduce sentence by the Bureau of Prisons pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">We review the availability of habeas relief under section 2241 <em>de novo, see Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000); we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003). As a general rule, a federal prisoner collaterally attacks the validity of his sentence by filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The savings clause of section 2255 allows a prisoner to file a section 2241 habeas petition if an otherwise available remedy under section 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>tive to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 5. According to Appellant, section 2241 relief is available to him because remedy under section 2255 is otherwise inadequate to address his <em>Booker </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999), we set out when section 2255 remedies may be considered inadequate. As we stated in <em>Wofford, </em>the savings clause of section 2255 applies to open a portal for a claim to proceed pursuant to section 2241 only under certain conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"Aj3\">1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Although Appellant sources his claim of unconstitutional detention on the fine of Supreme Court eases that culminated in <em>Booker, </em>we have held that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>constitutional rule is a new rule of criminal procedure that has no retroactive application to section 2255 cases on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005). Because Appellant fails to identify a Supreme Court decision that is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s section 2241 habeas petition was due to be dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i) authorizes the district court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, to reduce a term of imprisonment if, after considering the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court finds \"extraordinary and compelling reasons\u201d warrant the reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\">. Because Appellant fails to satisfy the first of <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>three requirements, we need not address satisfaction of the other two requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-24\">. The motion for reconsideration also is predicated on a retroactive application of <em>Booker; </em>the district court committed no abuse of discretion when it denied that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
