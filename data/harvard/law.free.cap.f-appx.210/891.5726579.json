We previously affirmed his conviction and 121-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and 846. <em>See United States v. Watkins, </em>No. 01-14357, 44 Fed. Appx. 944 (11th Cir. Jun. 10, 2002) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cWatkins </em>I\u201d). Watkins now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion, filed pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g), to return property seized during criminal forfeiture proceedings that took place after his sentencing hearing. At the sentencing hearing, the government noted that it intended to submit a forfeiture order and the district court, which had already entered a prehminary forfeiture order (\u201cPFO\u201d), found that forfeiture was \u201cappropriate.\u201d The government subsequently moved for, and the district court entered, a final forfeiture order (\u201cFFO\u201d) after Watkins had filed his appeal in <em>Watkins I. </em>On appeal, Watkins argues that the district court erred by not issuing an FFO at his sentencing hearing as part of his \u201csentencing package\u201d and by not including the forfeiture in its final written judgment. Because Watkins never filed a notice of appeal from the underlying FFO, we lack jurisdiction to review it. After careful review, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Watkins\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for the return of seized property, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 973 (11th Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s application of Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 <em>de novo. United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">The procedural history is as follows. After a jury trial, in May 2001, Watkins was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. The jury also returned a special verdict, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(1) and (2), finding that Watkins should forfeit $100,000. On May 24, 2001, the government moved for a PFO of the properties identified in the jury\u2019s special verdict. From our review of the record, the foregoing motion was served on Watkins, but he did not file a response. On May 29, 2001, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and entered a PFO ordering Watkins to forfeit $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">At the sentencing hearing, on July 24, 2001, after pronouncing Watkins\u2019s 121-month sentence, the district court asked if there were \u201cforfeiture items\u201d that needed to be addressed, to which the government responded that it intended to submit a draft FFO, but that the court was required to make a finding, on the record at the sentencing hearing, as to whether forfeiture was appropriate. The court found that forfeiture was \u201cappropriate,\u201d and the probation officer recommended that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>court should include language from <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>244 F.3d 888 (11th Cir. 2001). The district court then reiterated that forfeiture was appropriate \u201c[i]n accordance with <em>U.S. v. Gilbert.\u201d </em>There were no objections to the foregoing procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">On July 31, 2001, the court entered a written criminal judgment, which did not include any mention of forfeiture, and Watkins filed his notice of appeal in <em>Watkins I. </em>The following day, the government filed its motion for an FFO, noting that the trial court had included forfeiture in its oral pronouncement of sentence. Watkins did not file any objections or otherwise respond. On August 3, 2001, three days after the criminal judgment was entered and eight business days after sentencing, the district court entered an FFO. At no point did Watkins appeal from the FFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">On August 31, 2001, the government filed a \u201cMotion and Memorandum to Forfeit Substitute Property,\u201d pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(p), seeking the forfeiture of $68,380 in cash, which previously had been seized from Watkins\u2019s property. Watkins filed a response to the Motion, but he did <em>not </em>challenge the underlying forfeiture and instead argued that the identified $68,380 was not related to his conviction. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion, finding that Watkins already had disposed of the $100,000 specified in the original forfeiture order. Thereafter, on November 14, 2001, the government filed a motion to amend the FFO, which the district court granted in an order reflecting that forfeiture of the $68,380 was in partial satisfaction of the original $100,000 forfeiture amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Watkins then filed a \u201cMotion to Modify or Set [Aside] Order Forfeiting Substitute Property,\u201d arguing that the government\u2019s Motion to Substitute Forfeiture Property had not been addressed in open court, and that he had not disposed of the $100,000 in forfeited proceeds, such that the substitution of forfeiture property was improper. Watkins also attempted to appeal the district court\u2019s order granting the government\u2019s Motion to Substitute Forfeiture Property, but we dismissed the appeal as untimely. Watkins then filed a \u201cSecond Motion For Final Judgement on Defendants] Motion to Modify or Set Aside Order Forfeiting Substitute Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The district court denied Watkins\u2019s motion for modification of the substitute-property order and granted his motion for final judgment. Watkins then filed another appeal in this Court, this time <em>from </em>the order denying his motion to modify or set aside judgment, but we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because the appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">On November 25, 2003, Watkins, now proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cMotion for Return of Property,\u201d pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(e), seeking return of the $68,380. He argued that the issue of forfeiture was not addressed at sentencing or made a part of the criminal judgment, and that the FFO was insufficient as it was entered after the written criminal judgment. The government responded that the FFO entered <em>three </em>days after the final judgment was properly made a part of the final judgment, as it had been discussed and forfeiture was ordered as part of the oral pronouncement at sentencing. The government noted that the circuits were split as to whether a court may amend a judgment to include an order of forfeiture more than <em>seven </em>days after the entry of judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">The magistrate judge denied Watkins\u2019s motion to return property, stating that the relief was denied for \u201cthe reasons stated in the government\u2019s response\u201d and based on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Arevalo, </em>No. 02-15388, 2004 WL 1253057 (11th Cir. May 13, 2004) (unpublished). Over Watkins\u2019s objections, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">As a preliminary matter, we must address the scope of our jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>413 F.3d 1295, 1299 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Gilchrist v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>390 F.3d 1327, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that \u201cwe are required, even <em>sua sponte, </em>to initiate an inquiry into our subject-matter jurisdiction whenever we become concerned that it may not exist.\u201d). We recently held that we lacked jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s entry of an FFO where the defendant had not timely appealed the order. <em>See United States v. Machado, </em>465 F.3d 1301 (11th Cir.2006). Indeed, in <em>Machado, </em>just like here, the defendant filed <em>no appeal </em>from the FFO which he asked us to set aside. <em>Id. </em>at 1305-06. We held that because the filing of a timely notice of appeal was jurisdictional, Machado\u2019s failure to file one stripped us of jurisdiction to review the FFO order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Here, the FFO was entered on August 3, 2001. Under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, in a criminal case, a defendant who takes an appeal as of right must file his notice of appeal \u201cwithin 10 days after the later of ... the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.... \u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). The district court may extend the 10-day period by up to thirty days if a party shows excusable neglect. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). \u201cEven if there is excusable neglect the latest a defendant may wait before appealing a final order in a criminal case is <em>forty days </em>after it was entered.\u201d <em>Machado, </em>465 F.3d at 1305 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The deadlines of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 have long since passed and Watkins did not file a timely notice of appeal from the FFO. Instead, he filed numerous post-judgment motions, including the Rule 41(g) motion to return seized property that forms the basis of this appeal. In short, our recent decision in <em>Machado </em>makes clear that we lack jurisdiction to review the underlying FFO.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Although we cannot review the underlying FFO, we retain jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Watkins\u2019s motion for return of property because Watkins filed a timely notice of appeal from that order. <em>Id. </em>at 1307-08. We review legal issues connected to the 41(g) motion <em>de novo, </em>but review \u201cthe equitable equation of the district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 41(g) motion only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">According to Rule 41(g), \u201c[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property\u2019s return. The motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(g). \u201cThe district court can exercise equitable jurisdiction over a Rule 41(g) motion filed after criminal proceedings have ended.\u201d <em>Machado, </em>465 F.3d at 1307. Notably, for the district court to exercise its equitable jurisdiction, \u201cthe owner of the properly must have clean hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">As in <em>Machado, </em>it would be inequitable to return to Watkins \u201cthe fruits of his crime,\u201d and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Rule 41(g) motion. <em>Id. </em>Although the defendant in <em>Machado </em>voluntarily forfeited his property as part of a plea agreement, while Watkins has always maintained that the substitute property ($68,380 in cash) was from a legitimate business he operated, the equities still are not in his favor. The district court expressly rejected Watkins\u2019s suggestion that the $68,380 was not related to his illegal activities. After Watkins filed an untimely appeal of that ruling, we dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Accordingly, under <em>the </em>law-of-the-ease doctrine, the district court\u2019s determination about the $68,380 \u2014 that it came from Watkins\u2019s criminal activities \u2014 may not be relitigated here. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that \u201c[t]he law of the case doctrine bars the relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)). We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s order denying Watkins\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion for return of forfeited property, which is the only determination properly before us in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
