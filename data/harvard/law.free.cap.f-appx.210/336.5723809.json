The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims and any dispositive rulings are debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Thorne has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-14\"> To the extent that Thorne\u2019s informal brief filed in this court can be construed as a request for this court\u2019s permission to file a successive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion under 28 <em>U.S.C. \u00a7 </em>2244(b), we deny it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
