Humana-Heron argues that the district court erred by admitting a warrant of deportation at trial because this document amounted to hearsay. As he concedes, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Maltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 265, 166 L.Ed.2d 205 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-27\">Humana-Heron\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>350 (1998). Although Humana-Heron contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Humana-Heron properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for farther review.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Humana-Heron\u2019s challenge to his sentence, which was within the applicable guidelines range, is unavailing. His challenge to this court\u2019s prior caselaw concerning the presumption of reasonableness attached to sentences that are within the pertinent guidelines range is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Ruff </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993). His disagreement with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s assessment of the seriousness of his offense does not establish that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
