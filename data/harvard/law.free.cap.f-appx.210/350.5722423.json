AH\u2019s brief challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his motion for administrative closure of his removal proceeding or, alternatively, for a continuance of his removal proceeding. Ali has failed to brief, and has thus waived, the issue whether the BIA abused its discretion in summarily dismissing his appeal. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Because he has waived this issue, he has not shown error in the BIA\u2019s decision. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
