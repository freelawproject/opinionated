Walton argues that, although he is entitled to the retroactive application of the Sixth Amendment holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the remedial portion of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>holding, which made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, may not be applied in his case without violating the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Constitution. As Walton concedes, his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 575-76 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">Walton additionally argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court misapplied the Guidelines by increasing his sentence based on information concerning the relevant drug quantity, although such information was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. After <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[t]he sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline sentencing range and all facts relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Walton\u2019s sentence fell at the lowest end of his properly calculated advisory guidelines range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Giving \u201cgreat deference\u201d to such a sentence, we conclude that Walton\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
