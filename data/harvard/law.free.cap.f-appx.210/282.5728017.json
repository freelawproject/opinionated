Because we believe that AACPS offered the student a free appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d) at a state-approved school for the 2002-2003 school year, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny the parents tuition reimbursement and award AACPS judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Seventeen-year-old Z.W. has learning disabilities and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Accordingly, he is a \u201cchild with a disability\u201d to whom the IDEA guarantees a free appropriate public education. 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1400(d), 1401(3)(A). Z.W. attended Maryland\u2019s Anne Arundel County public schools through the end of the 1999-2000 school year but encountered academic and emotional problems there. These problems led his parents to enroll him, at their own expense, in a non-public day school, The Lab School of Washington, Baltimore Campus (\u201cBaltimore Lab\u201d), for the 2000-2001 school year. Subsequently, his parents and AACPS entered into a settlement agreement by which AACPS agreed to provide public funding for Z.W. to attend Baltimore Lab the next year\u2014 the 2001-2002 school year \u2014 as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">On May 6, 2002, a team including Z.W.\u2019s parents met to develop an individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d) for him. The team discussed Z.W.\u2019s progress at Baltimore Lab and determined his placement for the 2002-2003 school year. At the meeting, AACPS confirmed that it did not have an appropriate public school placement for Z.W. and agreed to fund his education at a non-public day school. The parents requested that AACPS maintain Z.W.\u2019s current placement at Baltimore Lab, but AACPS informed them that Baltimore Lab had not yet received approval from the Maryland State Department of Education (\u201cMSDE\u201d) as a fundable nonpublic special education school. AACPS instead referred Z.W. for admission to High Road Academy (\u201cHigh Road\u201d), a nonpublic special education school in Maryland that was approved by the MSDE. High Road accepted Z.W. on June 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The parents visited High Road that summer but feared that a change in placement would impair Z.W.\u2019s social, emotional, and academic progress. They therefore, at their own expense, continued his placement at Baltimore Lab for the 2002-2003 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Dining the summer of 2003, MSDE approved Baltimore Lab as a fundable nonpublic special education school. AACPS then agreed to place Z.W. at the Baltimore Lab for the 2003-2004 school year. Z.W. now attends Baltimore Lab with public funding from AACPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">On April 16, 2004, the parents requested a due process hearing on the grounds that AACPS failed to provide Z.W. with a FAPE for the 2002-2003 school year, when AACPS attempted to send Z.W. to High Road. The parents sought reimbursement for their placement of Z.W. at Baltimore Lab that year. After a hearing on June 24, 2004, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a decision concluding that AACPS was not obligated to reimburse the parents because: (1) AACPS had offered Z.W. a FAPE at High Road for the 2002-2003 school year, and (2) the parents had not given proper notice to AACPS of their intent to enroll Z.W. at Baltimore Lab rather than High Road for the 2002-2003 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The parents appealed, and the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On January 5, 2006, the district court ruled in AACPS\u2019s favor, upholding the ALJ\u2019s decision that the parents were not entitled to reimbursement because they did not comply with the IDEA\u2019S notice requirements. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>court did not reach the question of whether AACPS had offered a FAPE to Z.W. for the 2002-2003 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Ordinarily, this Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. In IDEA eases, however, this Court conducts \u201ca modified de novo review, giving \u2018due weight\u2019 to the underlying administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>MM ex rel. DM v. Sch. Dish of Greenville County, </em>303 F.3d 523, 530-31 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982)). Administrative findings of fact in IDEA cases \u201care entitled to prima facie correctness;\u201d when the district court does not follow those findings, it must explain why not. <em>Doyle v. Arlington County Sch. Bd., </em>953 F.2d 100, 105 (4th Cir.1991). \u201cAfter giving the administrative fact-findings such due weight, if any, the district court then is free to decide the case on the preponderance of the evidence, as required by the statute.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Congress enacted the IDEA largely \u201cto ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\u201d to meet their unique needs. 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A). <em>See generally id. </em>\u00a7 1400(d) (describing purposes of the IDEA). The statute defines the term \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d as special education and related services that (1) have been provided at the public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge; (2) meet the standards of the state educational agency; (3) include an appropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education in the state; and (4) conform with the IEP required by the statute. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1401(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">States qualify for federal funds under the IDEA by adopting policies and procedures consistent with the statute. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a). A major condition for federal funding is that state and local education agencies develop an IEP for each eligible child before the beginning of each school year. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(4). The statute also requires that state or local educational agencies pay for a child\u2019s private school tuition when the agencies place the child in, or refer the child to, a private school to comply with the IDEA. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(10)(B)(i). When parents unilaterally place a child into private school, a court or hearing officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents if \u201cthe agency had not made a [FAPE] available to the child in a timely manner\u201d before the parents enrolled the child in private school. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The IDEA limits, however, parents\u2019 right to reimbursement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azp\">The cost of reimbursement ... may be reduced or denied\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">(I) if-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">(aa) at the most recent IEP meeting that the parents attended prior to removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not inform the IEP Team that they were rejecting the placement proposed by the public agency to provide a free appropriate public education to their child, including stating their concerns and their intent to enroll their child in a private school at public expense; or (bb) 10 business days (including any holidays that occur on a business day) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>prior to the removal of the child from the public school, the parents did not give written notice to the public agency of the information described in item (aa)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Although the district court ruled on the issue of whether Z.W.\u2019s parents had complied with the IDEA\u2019S notice requirements, it did not address the ALJ\u2019s finding that AACPS was not obligated to reimburse the parents because High Road would have provided Z.W. with a FAPE. It is on this latter ground, however, that we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant AACPS judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Scott v. United States, </em>328 F.3d 132, 137 (4th Cir. 2003) (\u2018We are, of course, entitled to affirm on any ground appearing in the record, including theories not relied upon or rejected by the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The IDEA\u2019S requirements regarding a FAPE are \u201cmodest.\u201d <em>A.B. ex rel. D.B. v. Lawson, </em>354 F.3d 315, 325 (4th Cir.2004). A school system satisfies its statutory obligation when it provides sufficient personalized instruction and support services to \u201cpermit the child to benefit educationally.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 203, 102 S.Ct. 3034. Otherwise stated, \u201ca FAPE must be reasonably calculated to confer <em>some </em>educational benefit on a disabled child.\u201d <em>MM, </em>303 F.3d at 526 (emphasis added); <em>see also Barnett v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., </em>927 F.2d 146, 153 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cIn essence, an appropriate education is one which allows the child to make educational progress.\u201d). The IDEA\u2019S requirements are this modest, according to the Supreme Court, because Congress intended the IDEA to increase access to public education more so than to \u201cguarantee any particular level of education once inside.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 192, 102 S.Ct. 3034. Thus, the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[wjhatever Congress meant by an \u2018appropriate\u2019 education, it is clear that it did not mean a potential-maximizing education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. 3034.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">In reviewing administrative proceedings to decide whether a school system has provided a FAPE, courts \u201cby no means [have] an invitation ... to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities they review.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034. This Court \u201cmust defer to educators\u2019 decisions as long as an IEP provided the child the basic floor of opportunity that access to special education and related services provides.\u201d <em>Tice v. Botetourt County Sch. Bd., </em>908 F.2d 1200, 1207 (4th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">At the administrative hearing, Z.W.\u2019s stepmother and two IEP team members confirmed that the parents and AACPS agreed on the substance of the IEP. They merely disagreed on whether Baltimore Lab or High Road was the appropriate school at which to implement the IEP. Three experts in special education testified on behalf of AACPS that placement at High Road would have provided Z.W. with an educational benefit. These experts were the executive director of High Road, who had reviewed Z.W.\u2019s record before hosting his parents\u2019 visit to High Road during the summer of 2002; the chairperson of the IEP, who had placed students successfully at High Road in the past; and Z.W.\u2019s case manager, who had observed Z.W. at Baltimore Lab and had observed the program at High Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Two witnesses testified on behalf of the parents that Baltimore Lab would have been the appropriate placement. They were Z.W.\u2019s stepmother and the principal of Baltimore Lab. The principal conceded that she did not know the program at High Road well enough to comment upon its appropriateness for Z.W. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>principal explained that she did not participate in the IEP team meeting because she had just assumed her position. The principal merely testified that she felt Baltimore Lab was an appropriate placement for Z.W. because he was making progress there. Neither the principal nor Z.W.\u2019s stepmother testified that High Road would be unable to provide Z.W. with an educational benefit. Z.W.\u2019s stepmother testified that High Road could provide Z.W. with some level of educational benefit and that the school was not inappropriate per se. She and her husband simply thought High Road \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to be the type of total educationally [sic] program that we think is best for [Z.W.]\u201d because the school lacked a strong focus on the arts and appeared to afford students less social interaction. J.A. 51. Z.W.\u2019s stepmother also testified that she and her husband opposed placement at High Road because Z.W. would resist the transition.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">After reviewing this and other testimony about Z.W., High Road, and Baltimore Lab, the ALJ concluded that, despite the schools\u2019 slight differences (namely, High Road is state-approved and aspires to mainstream students whereas Baltimore Lab was not approved at the time and had an arts program), both would offer Z.W. a FAPE. The ALJ further concluded that \u201c[t]he weight of the expert testimony is against the Parents\u2019 position concerning the adversity of a move upon the Student.\u201d J.A. 697. Only the Baltimore Lab principal corroborated the parents\u2019 view that a move to High Road would be detrimental to Z.W., the ALJ noted, and no testimony showed that such detriment, if any, would otherwise deny a FAPE at High Road. Thus, the ALJ concluded, \u201c[e]ven if Lab were an MSDE approved school at the time of the unilateral placement, I would be compelled to give weight to the IEP Team\u2019s recommendation of High Roads [sic].\u201d J.A.698.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The ALJ\u2019s factual findings, which this Court must presume correct, are, upon review, fully supported by the record. <em>See Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 203, 102 S.Ct. 3034. The ALJ properly deferred to the views of educational authorities and searched only for evidence that High Road could meet the modest IDEA requirement that a state agency\u2019s placement provide <em>some </em>educational benefit. <em>See A.B., </em>354 F.3d at 325; <em>MM, </em>303 F.3d at 526; <em>Tice, </em>908 F.2d at 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The ALJ did not, as the parents argue, disregard the testimony of Z.W.\u2019s stepmother and the Baltimore Lab principal. By contrast, the ALJ considered their testimony and found that the testimony of AACPS\u2019s expert witnesses outweighed it. Here, as in <em>A.B., </em>354 F.3d at 328, \u201c[t]he ALJ correctly recognized that while AACPS and [the parents\u2019] experts disagreed, IDEA requires great deference to the views of the school system rather than those of even the most well-meaning parent.\u201d Deference in this situation was warranted especially because the testimony by AACPS\u2019s experts shows that AACPS applied its expertise to Z.W.\u2019s unique situation. <em>Cf. McKenzie v. Smith, </em>771 F.2d 1527, 1535 (D.C.Cir.1985) (\u2018Where there is no indication that the school officials\u2019 expertise has been brought to bear on the individual needs of the handicapped child ... the deference granted will be commensurately lower.\u201d). Perhaps more importantly, allegations like that of Z.W.\u2019s stepmother that one school \u201cis better than\u201d another \u201cdo not state a meritorious cause of action\u201d under the IDEA. <em>Hessler v. State Bd. of Educ. of Md., </em>700 F.2d 134, 139 (4th Cir.1983); <em>see id. </em>(\u201c[B]ecause a given educational placement is allegedly more appropriate than another, it does not follow that the less appropriate program is \u2018not appropriate\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d). Thus we find that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and ultimate determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>High Road offered Z.W. a FAPE were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The parents\u2019 arguments to the contrary fail. The parents argue, for example, that the record is devoid of evidence that High Road is a better placement for Z.W. or that Baltimore Lab was not meeting his needs. This argument, however, misunderstands the standard. Rather, \u201c[t]he FAPE must only be calculated to confer some educational benefit on a disabled child.\u201d <em>A.B., </em>354 F.3d at 319 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The ALJ found that placement at High Road met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The parents further argue that the ALJ should have decided that keeping Z.W. at Baltimore Lab was the proper course of action because courts have held that the IDEA favors maintaining the status quo when a child is already receiving an appropriate education. The cases cited by the parents (none of them decisions of this Court) for this proposition are inapposite. Those cases involve a court\u2019s determination that a child should not be moved during the final year of high school, in the middle of the school year, or when the court lacks any evidence that the proposed school could actually meet the child\u2019s needs. <em>See Hale v. Poplar Bluffs, R-I Seh. Dist., </em>280 F.3d 831, 833 (8th Cir.2002); <em>Block v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>748 F.Supp. 891, 895 (D.D.C.1990); <em>Holmes v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>680 F.Supp. 40, 41-42 (D.D.C. 1988). These circumstances do not apply to Z.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Lastly, the parents argue that AACPS has not cited any legal, policy, or educational rationale for moving Z.W. from Baltimore Lab to High Road for the 2002-2003 school year. The record does not support this argument. AACPS stated at the IEP meeting, and has maintained throughout this litigation, that it could not place Z.W. at Baltimore Lab for the 2002-2003 year because Baltimore Lab was not yet state-approved. AACPS was able to fund Z.W.\u2019s education at Baltimore during the 2001-2002 year only because the funding was pursuant to a settlement agreement, not an IEP team decision. Outside of settlement, AACPS maintains, it has no authority to place students in non-approved schools. The parents refute all of these contentions. Although the ALJ did not reach this issue, we note that the weight of the evidence, both testimonial and documentary, supports AACPS\u2019s contentions, as does the caselaw and the statute itself. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(B) (providing that when public agencies place children in private schools, \u201cthe State educational agency shall determine whether such schools and facilities meet standards that apply to State educational agencies\u201d); <em>Carter v. Florence County Sch. Dist. Four, </em>950 F.2d 156, 162 (4th Cir.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>510 U.S. 7, 14, 114 S.Ct. 361, 126 L.Ed.2d 284 (1993) (holding that the unilateral placement of a student <em>by the parents </em>in an unapproved school is not by itself a bar to tuition reimbursement, but <em>public schools </em>may not place students in unapproved schools).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In sum, the record fully supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that AACPS\u2019s proposed placement at High Road for the 2002-2003 school year offered Z.W. a FAPE and therefore precluded the parents\u2019 request for tuition reimbursement. Having decided the case on this ground, we do not reach the second question presented to this Court: whether the district court properly denied the parents\u2019 request for tuition reimbursement based on their failure to comply with the IDEA\u2019S notice requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Because AACPS offered to Z.W. a FAPE at High Road for the 2002-2003 school year, the district court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>grant AACPS judgment as a matter of law is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-14\">.
