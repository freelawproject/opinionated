The district court dismissed Singleton\u2019s case without prejudice pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Dismissals for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under \u00a7 1997e(a) are reviewed de novo. <em>Powe v. Ennis, </em>177 F.3d 393, 394 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">The district court concluded that the Step 1 and 2 grievances that Singleton produced involved an appeal of a disciplinary procedure and did not relate to the excessive force claim that Singleton raised in his complaint. A \u201cgrievance should be considered sufficient to the extent that the grievance gives officials a fair opportunity to address the problem that will later form the basis of the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 517 (5th Cir.2004). The record shows that the investigating officer responded to Singleton\u2019s Step 2 grievance in part by opening an investigation of Singleton\u2019s excessive force allegations. Thus, it is unclear whether the grievance forms on which Singleton relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>relate only to the appeal of a disciplinary procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Nevertheless, we need not reach the question whether Singleton\u2019s grievance was sufficient to provide notice of this claim, as we affirm the dismissal for failure to exhaust on an alternative ground. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998). At the time Singleton filed his complaint, he had not completed the Texas Department of Criminal Justice grievance process. Generally, an inmate must exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit. <em>Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 890-91 (5th Cir.1998). Because Singleton did not do so, the district court did not err in dismissing the case. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
