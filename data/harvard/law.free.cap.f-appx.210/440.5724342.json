The district court determined that the complaint was frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and that it failed to state a claim for relief. Hinojos\u2019s pleadings do not establish that the defendant intentionally deprived him of access to the courts or that he suffered any injury as the result of her actions. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.1998). Hinojos\u2019s argument that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint prior to serving the defendant is without merit. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-18\">Hinojos\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-19\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Hinojos\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Hinojos is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
