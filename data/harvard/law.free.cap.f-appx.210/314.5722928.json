The district court sentenced him as a career offender to a 151-month term of imprisonment, the bottom of the adviso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ry sentencing guideline range. Jennings\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging Jennings\u2019 sentence but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Jennings was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Counsel questions whether the district court violated Jennings\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights by classifying Jennings as a career offender under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2004), where the predicate convictions were not charged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Counsel also suggests that Jennings\u2019 151-month sentence is unreasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 433. \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Contrary to counsel\u2019s assertion, the district court properly relied on Jennings\u2019 North Carolina felony conviction for possession with intent to sell and deliver crack cocaine to find that Jennings qualified as a career offender. In imposing the sentence, the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the sentence falls within a properly calculated guideline range and is well within the statutory maximum sentence of twenty years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Thus, we conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Jennings\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
