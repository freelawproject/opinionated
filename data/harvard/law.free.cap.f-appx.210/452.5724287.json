Gonzales, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC, Caryl G. Thompson, U.S. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service District Directors Office, New Orleans, LA, Sharon A.

The immigration judge (IJ) determined that Hornburg had not made the requisite showing that her United States citizen daughter would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). A single member of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ decision without opinion, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831-32 (5th Cir.2003). To the extent that Hornburg challenges the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that she had not made the requisite showing under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), this court is without jurisdiction to hear her petition. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (ii); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">Hornburg also challenges the BIA\u2019s application of its summary affirmance procedures to her case, arguing that the procedure violated her due process rights and that her appeal did not satisfy the requirements for employing that procedure enumerated in \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), (e)(6). This court has previously held the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures constitutional. <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 832-33. The IJ\u2019s decision met the criteria for summary affirmance pursuant to \u00a7 1003.1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
