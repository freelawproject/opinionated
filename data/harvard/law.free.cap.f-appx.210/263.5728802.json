Because we conclude, based on the totality of the circumstances and the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), that Reid\u2019s identification was reliable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">On December 20, 2004, at approximately 3:30 a.m., a black male entered a Charleston convenience store, pointed a gun at the sole cashier, Norris Reid, and demanded money and packs of Newport cigarettes. Reid handed the cash and cigarettes to the robber, whose face was partially covered by a black and grey checked jacket draped over his head. After threatening to shoot Reid, the gunman ordered Reid into the store bathroom, grabbed two 24-ounce Miller Lite bottles of beer, and left the store. Reid remained in the bathroom a short period of time, and emerged to see a red Pontiac Grand Am driving out of the store lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">Reid called the police. He described the robber, and his clothing, firearm, and car to a City of Charleston police officer. The description was radioed to other units, and, within approximately ten minutes, a second Charleston Police Officer, Officer West, spotted a red Pontiac Grand Am parked at a second convenience store a short distance from the robbery scene. Officer West initiated a traffic stop and the defendant was arrested while trying to evade the stop. Officer West testified that when the defendant emerged from his still-moving car and ran around a nearby house he was wearing a black and grey checked jacket and had a gun in his hand. He searched the area and found a black handgun beside a car. The defendant contends, however, that the gun and jacket were both found in the red Pontiac.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-18\">Officer West removed $34.54 and approximately $50 worth of crack cocaine from Wilson\u2019s pockets. Five packs of Newport cigarettes and two 24-ounce Mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Ier Lite bottles of beer were found in the front passenger seat of the Grand Am. Following Wilson\u2019s arrest, Corporal Jim Byrne drove Reid to the arrest scene twice. On the first visit, Reid identified the Pontiac Grand Am, the grey and black checked jacket, and the defendant. On the second trip to the arrest scene, Reid identified the .38 caliber gun recovered from the arrest scene. The time from robbery to identification was approximately twenty to thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Wilson filed a pre-trial motion to suppress Reid\u2019s out-of-court identification on the grounds that the arrest scene show-up was impermissibly suggestive. The district court denied the motion because it found that Wilson\u2019s show-up was not suggestive and because, even if the show-up was suggestive, Reid\u2019s identification was a reliable one. The jury convicted Wilson of armed robbery, use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of crack cocaine. Wilson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. McKinnon, </em>92 F.3d 244, 246 (4th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). We review for abuse of discretion the court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence. <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The Supreme Court has outlined a two-step approach to determine the admissibility of identification testimony. First, the defendant must prove that the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. <em>Holdren v. Legursky, </em>16 F.3d 57, 61 (4th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977)). Second, even if the defendant proves that the identification procedure was suggestive, an identification is still valid if reliable. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243; <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The reliability of eyewitness identifications are assessed \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>Satcher v. Pruett, </em>126 F.3d 561, 566 (4th Cir.1997), gauged by the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). These factors include: \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Defendant maintains that the arrest scene show-up confrontation in which Reid identified him was unconstitutionally suggestive. Reid identified Wilson from the front seat of Corporal Byrne\u2019s patrol car. The defendant was placed in front of the patrol car, and Corporal Byrne illuminated the area with his headlights and the white lights located on top of his car. Defendant challenges as suggestive the fact that he was handcuffed and wearing a restraint belt and leg chains. Likewise, defendant claims that the show-up was suggestive because Corporal Byrne asked Reid if he recalled the gunman\u2019s height, weight, build, jacket, belt, pants, and shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">To begin with, the exclusion of identification evidence is a \u201cdrastic sanction\u201d which is \u201climited to identification testimony which is manifestly suspect.\u201d <em>Harker v. Maryland, </em>800 F.2d 437, 443 (4th Cir. 1986). Thus, while arrest scene show-ups may under some circumstances be suggestive, <em>see, e.g., Smith v. Coiner, </em>473 F.2d 877, 881 (4th Cir.1973), prompt show-ups are not per se suggestive and may in fact \u201cpromote fairness, by enhancing reliability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of the identifications, and permit expeditious release of innocent subjects.\u201d <em>Willis v. Garrison, </em>624 F.2d 491, 494 (4th Cir. 1980) (quoting <em>Stanley v. Cox, </em>486 F.2d 48, 51 (4th Cir.1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Assuming, however, that this show-up was suggestive, we \u201cproceed directly to the reliability of the identification\u201d to determine its admissibility. <em>Holdren, </em>16 F.3d at 61 (citations omitted). Here, the totality of the circumstances and all five of the <em>Biggers </em>factors support the district court\u2019s finding that Reid\u2019s identification of the defendant was sufficiently reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">1. The Opportunity to View. Reid had an adequate opportunity to view the gunman during the course of the robbery. The convenience store surveillance tape reviewed by the district court shows a well-lit store, that the robbery lasted one minute and forty-nine seconds, that Reid and the gunman were standing less than two feet apart during most of that time, and that five hand-to hand exchanges took place between Reid and the gunman.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Wilson argues that Reid did not have ample opportunity to observe the robber\u2019s face. Even if true, we held in <em>Willis v. Garrison, </em>that \u201cheight, weight and clothing are acceptable elements of identification\u201d especially where, as here, \u201cthe confrontation takes place shortly after the crime when it may reasonably be inferred that the suspect is dressed as he was at the time of the robbery.\u201d 624 F.2d at 494-95. Indeed, the <em>Willis </em>robbery victim was unable to discern <em>any </em>of his attacker\u2019s facial characteristics. <em>Id. </em>at 492. We nevertheless upheld the victim\u2019s identification \u2014 based on the suspect\u2019s height, weight, clothing, and automobile \u2014 as reliable. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\"><em>2. </em>The Degree of Attention. The district court properly concluded that Reid was attentive. Reid was not a casual observer. He testified that he looked the perpetrator \u201cin the face\u201d and also observed his clothing and firearm. <em>See Willis, </em>624 F.2d at 494. Reid\u2019s attentiveness is also evidenced by his detailed description of the gunman, his clothing, his weapon, and his car to police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">3. Accuracy of the Description. We agree with the district court that Reid\u2019s description of the gunman was not only accurate but \u201cright on the money.\u201d As in <em>Willis, </em>the eyewitness\u2019s description included Wilson\u2019s \u201crace, height, approximate weight, complexion, and clothing.\u201d <em>Willis, </em>624 F.2d at 494. Specifically, Reid told Officer Salkeld that the robber was a black male approximately 25 years old, 5'9\" to 5'10\" tall, of medium build and complexion, and weighing between 150 and 180 pounds. The defendant is a black male, 25 years old, five feet nine inches tall, and weighs approximately 190 pounds. Again, as in <em>Willis, </em>the eyewitness also gave an accurate description of defendant\u2019s vehicle. <em>See Willis, </em>624 F.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">4. The Witness\u2019 Level of Certainty. Reid testified at trial that he was \u201csure\u201d of his identification. His conduct at the show-up buttresses this testimony. Reid immediately identified the black and grey checked jacket and the red Pontiac and positively identified Wilson after studying him for a few minutes. <em>See Willis, </em>624 F.2d at 494 (out-of-court identification admissible where eyewitness positively identified defendant after he put on clothing he was wearing during the robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">5. The Time Between the Crime and Confrontation. Reid\u2019s identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Wilson as robber occurred within twenty to thirty minutes of the underlying offense. This short time frame, like the other four <em>Biggers </em>factors, weighs in favor of reliability. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Finally, Wilson argues that Reid\u2019s in-court identification was improper. But an in-court identification is admissible if reliable, <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>84 F.3d 692, 695 (4th Cir.1996), and Wilson does not argue that Reid\u2019s in-court identification was not rehable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Reid\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> Wilson also argues that this Court\u2019s finding, in <em>Smith v. Coiner, </em>473 F.2d 877 (4th Cir. 1973), that a victim\u2019s identification was not reliable, controls this case. But the victim in <em>Smith </em>suffered from impaired eyesight and observed her assailant for \"two seconds\u201d with a flashlight. <em>Id. </em>at 882. Reid's opportunity to view the defendant is not analogous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
