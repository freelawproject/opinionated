Lurry\u2019s plea agreement indicated the parties were unable to stipulate a drug quantity to which Lurry would be held responsible for sentencing purposes and provided relevant conduct would be litigated before the district court. Lurry alleges aspects of his sentencing were improper. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-19\">Lurry\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a base offense level of thirty-six, reflecting 500 grams of crack. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (2004). However, following a two-day sentencing hearing in which ten witnesses testified concerning relevant conduct, the district court found Lurry was responsible for 432.75 grams of crack. Therefore, the court found Lurry\u2019s base offense level was thirty-four. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). The district court also granted Lurry a two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. Based on a total offense level of thirty-two and a criminal history category of IV, the district court determined the applicable range under the sentencing guidelines was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table). The district court sentenced Lurry to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-20\">Lurry argues the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it erroneously held him responsible for 432.75 grams of crack and improperly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>nied him an offense level reduction for a mitigating or minor role in the offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47; <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (stating a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456. A sentence is unreasonable if based on an error in construing or applying the sentencing guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 456-57. In calculating the guideline range for each co-conspirator, \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense\u201d are to be included. USSG \u00a7 1B1.3 (a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Lurry contends the district court overstated the drug quantity attributable to him and confused powder cocaine with crack. Of the 432.75 grams of crack the district court found attributable to Lurry, 425.25 grams were based upon Albert Byrd\u2019s testimony. Byrd testified he pooled funds from the members of then-crack distribution conspiracy and \u201cpurchased some drugs.\u201d Byrd initially stated he purchased \u201c[pjrobably like nine ounces\u201d with the pooled funds, but then agreed he had previously told an officer he purchased fifteen ounces.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his prior interview, Byrd indicated he cooked the cocaine he purchased, presumably referring to powder cocaine, although he did not indicate whether he cooked the fifteen ounces referenced above.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">We need not determine whether the district court\u2019s factual finding concerning relevant conduct was clearly erroneous, because any error was harmless. In <em>United States v. Ricco, </em>52 F.3d 58, 63 (4th Cir. 1995), we approved a conversion ratio of 100 grams of powder cocaine yielding eighty-eight grams of crack. Applying this formula, we find fifteen ounces of powder cocaine yield 374.22 grams of crack and nine ounces of powder cocaine yield 224.53 grams of crack. Both amounts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are within the range that produces a base offense level of thirty-four. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (grouping amounts at least 150 grams and less than 500 grams). Accordingly, we conclude the district court\u2019s determination of Lurry\u2019s base offense level was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">Turning to Lurry\u2019s argument under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he had a mitigating role in the offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>defendant may receive a four-level reduction for being a minimal participant if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4). This level of culpability is shown by \u201cthe defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others....\u201d <em>Id. </em>A two-level reduction may be made when a defendant is a minor participant; that is, one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). In deciding whether the defendant played a minor or minimal role, the \u201ccritical inquiry is not just whether the defendant has done fewer \u2018bad acts\u2019 than his co-defendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 646 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Role adjustments are determined on the basis of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1183-84 (4th Cir.1990). The district court\u2019s determination concerning the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a factual issue reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Lurry incorrectly claims the district court failed to provide a basis for its denial under \u00a7 3B1.2. At the end of the sentencing hearing\u2019s first day, the court overruled Lurry\u2019s objection concerning the PSR\u2019s alleged failure to recommend a reduction on this basis. The court found Lurry presented no credible evidence he was less responsible than the other members of the crack distribution conspiracy. Clearly, the district court found Lurry failed to carry his burden by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Lurry also contends the district court erred when it disregarded testimony from several witnesses that he was a minor player in the drug conspiracy and instead credited Byrd\u2019s testimony that Lurry was an equal member. Lurry claims Byrd, who received the longest sentence of all of the conspirators, had the most to gain by assisting the Government. Thus, Lurry attacks the district court\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Credibility determinations are within the province of the sentencing court and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>58 F.3d 96, 100 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Choate, 12 </em>F.3d 1318, 1321 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cUnless we can discern some greater unfairness, we will not confine the sentencing court\u2019s discretion to the evidence the adversaries wish it to consider.\u201d). The district court found Byrd\u2019s testimony credible because he did not plainly contradict earlier statements to the authorities, unlike the witnesses Lurry urges this court to credit on appeal. This credibility determination was not clearly erroneous, and we will not overturn it. Furthermore, after reviewing the sentencing transcript, we conclude the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction under USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The district court imposed a sentence below the statutory maximum, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (2000), and within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range; thus, the sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. Accordingly, we affirm Lurry\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\">. Lurry does not appeal his conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\">. One ounce converts to 28.35 grams. See USSG \u00a7 2D 1.1(c), comment, (n.10).
