Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Koch v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 995, 125 S.Ct. 1944, 161 L.Ed.2d 764 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-26\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b405-27\">A jury convicted Delgado-Gama of illegal re-entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(2). Delgado-Gama asserted no objections to the Presentence Report. The district court sentenced Delga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>do-Gama to 125 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. The court also ordered Delgado-Gama to pay a $100 special cost assessment. Delgado-Gama raised two issues on appeal to this court: erroneous jury instructions and improper admission of expert testimony. On December 20, 2004, we affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Delgado-Gama, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 304 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In his petition for writ of certiorari, filed on March 11, 2005, Delgado-Gama for the first time argued that his sentence should be reversed, or in the alternative, vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>The Supreme Court granted his petition for writ of certiorari, vacated our earlier judgment, and remanded the case for our reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">FURTHER CONSIDERATION IN LIGHT OF <em>BOOKER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Pursuant to our instructions, the parties filed briefs on <em>Booker\u2019s </em>affect upon the sentence imposed by the district court. Delgado-Gama acknowledges that he did not present any <em>Booker </em>challenges before the district court or this court on direct appeal. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we may not review <em>Booker </em>issues raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Assuming arguendo that Delgado-Gama presented <em>Booker </em>arguments before this court on direct appeal, we would review the district court\u2019s judgment for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). To demonstrate plain error, a party must establish: (1) an error; (2) that was clear and obvious; and (3) said error affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>If the foregoing elements are satisfied, a reviewing com ; may then use its discretion to find plain error only if: (4) the error seriously affected \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The imposition of a sentence under a mandatory application of the Guidelines, even without a Sixth Amendment violation, is plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Therefore, Delgado-Gama meets the first two prongs of the plain error test. To satisfy the third prong, we must determine \u201cwhether [Delgado-Gama] demonstrated that the sentencing judge-sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one-would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. The district court made no indication that Delgado-Gama would have received \u201ca lesser sentence if it [the court] was not bound by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 456 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 641, 163 L.Ed.2d 519 (2005). He faced a maximum twenty-year term of imprisonment and was subsequently sentenced to 125 months, which falls within the maximum allowed under the applicable Guideline range. Moreover, Delgado-Gama actually filed a Notice of No Objections to the PSR scoring calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Because Delgado-Gama fails to show plain-error, he also fails to meet \u201cthe much more demanding standard for extraordinary circumstances\u201d necessary to review an issue raised for the first time in a petition for certiorari. <em>Taylor, </em>409 F.3d at 677. Delgado-Gama also argues that- the <em>Booker </em>error should be deemed structural or presumptively prejudicial. Under the <em>Olano </em>test, however, the defendant bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Furthermore, this Circuit has rejected these claims in similar contexts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we affirm Delgado-Gama\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
