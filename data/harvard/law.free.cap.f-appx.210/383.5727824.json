At sentencing, Rodriguez received a 16-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on a previous Texas state conviction for delivery of heroin and was sentenced to 60 months of imprisonment. Rodriguez contends that the district court committed reversible plain error when it enhanced his sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). We reject the Government\u2019s contention that Rodriguez \u201cinvited,\u201d and thus waived this argument. Defense counsel\u2019s remarks at sentencing did not rise to the level of a concession that the enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-20\">Under plain error review, \u201cthe defendant has the burden to show that there is clear or obvious error and that it affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir. 1994). If the defendant carries that burden, this court has the discretion to correct the error if it \u201cseriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-21\">In order to show that the enhancement of his sentence affected his substantial rights, Rodriguez must have at least argued that his prior conduct did not constitute drug trafficking. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir. 2006). Because he does not argue that the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) was ultimately wrong, Rodriguez has not shown plain error. <em>Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-22\">Rodriguez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
