On appeal, Hernandez asserts that the district court clearly erred in denying \u2022 him a minor role reduction and his sentences were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">First, Hernandez argues that he was entitled to a minor role reduction as he was only a cook and not an integral member of the smuggling boat\u2019s crew. A sentencing court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense constitutes a factual finding that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(gn </em>banc). The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 939. The standards for reviewing the application of the Guidelines before the <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), decision apply after <em>Booker </em>as well. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA sentencing court under <em>Booker </em>still must consider the Guidelines, and, such consideration necessarily requires the sentencing court to calculate the Guidelines sentencing range in the same manner as before <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>at 1178-79 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">The Guidelines provide for a four-level reduction for a defendant who acts as a minimal participant, a two-level reduction for a minor participant, and a three-level reduction for cases falling in between the minor and minimal level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A minimal participant is a defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of the group,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>while a minor participant means any participant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1) and he is entitled to a mitigating-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, then his base offense may be reduced by 4 levels if his base offense level is 38 based on drug quantity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">To determine whether a defendant is entitled to a mitigating-role reduction, the district court first must measure the defendant\u2019s role in the offense against the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Next, the court may compare the defendant\u2019s culpability to that of other participants in that relevant conduct. <em>Id, </em>at 944. The district court may consider other participants in the offense, but \u201conly to the extent that they are identifiable or discern-able from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In cases where the defendant is a drug courier, relevant factual considerations include, but are not limited to: (1) the amount of drugs involved; (2) the fair market value of the drugs involved; (3) the amount of compensation received by the courier; (4) the courier\u2019s equity interest in the drugs, if any; (5) the courier\u2019s role in planning the scheme; and (6) the courier\u2019s role, or intended role, in the distribution of the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court correctly found that the relevant conduct for which Hernandez was held accountable was the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and the possession with intent to distribute 2,012 kilograms of cocaine, a very large amount of drugs. The district court correctly assessed Hernandez\u2019s role in connection with this scheme, and not in connection with any larger conspiracy. In assessing his role as it relates to the other crew members, though the captain would have a significant role in the vessel\u2019s transportation of drags, Hernandez put forth no evidence that the other eight crew members were more involved in the venture than he was. Though Hernandez now asserts that he was a mere cook, he did not make such an assertion before the district court. He even admitted he was a seaman by trade. Thus Hernandez does not qualify for a minor role reduction and the district court\u2019s finding that he is not entitled to a reduction was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Secondly, Hernandez argues that his sentences were unreasonable. Sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines system are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765. Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guideline range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but is expected to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 787-88. We have held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in post-<em>Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors, and concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the Guideline range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">We conclude from the record that Hernandez\u2019s sentences were reasonable. The district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Hernandez to the lowest sentence of the Guidelines range that it calculated. Hernandez\u2019s sentences were within the applicable Guidelines range, a range that takes into consideration his offense conduct, his personal characteristics and history, just punishment, and adequate deterrence. Further, Hernandez has failed to put forth any evidence showing his sentences were unreasonable. Therefore, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
