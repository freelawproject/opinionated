Sanchez contends that the BIA incorrectly determined that he had not complied with the requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) by submitting newly discovered evidence in support of his motion to reopen. Sanchez asserts that the affidavit of support that he submitted with his motion to reopen constituted newly discovered evidence because it was not available until his joint sponsor executed it after the conclusion of his hearing before the immigration judge (IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s \u201cdenial of both a motion to reopen and a motion for reconsideration under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). The decision will be upheld unless it was \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>436 F.3d at 487 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-18\">In the instant case, the BIA considered whether the affidavit of support executed by Allen Gully on March 17, 2005, qualified as new evidence that merited the exercise of its discretion to grant reopening of Sanchez\u2019s proceedings. In denying Sanchez\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA correctly applied \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), which limits the grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ing of a motion to reopen to evidence that \u201cis material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA concluded that Sanchez failed to show that the affidavit was \u201cnew or previously unavailable evidence\u201d because he failed to explain why Gully was not located or presented during Sanchez\u2019s hearing before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The decision by the BIA was not unreasonable nor arbitrary. The fact that the affidavit was executed after the conclusion of Sanchez\u2019s proceedings does not make it \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d evidence warranting a reopening of the proceedings. <em>See Manzano-Garcia, v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 470 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, the BIA\u2019s conclusion, when denying Sanchez\u2019s motion to reconsider, that it had correctly determined he had not complied with the requirements of \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) was not an abuse of discretion because Sanchez failed to explain why his new evidence supporting the motion to reopen could not have been discovered prior to the former proceeding. <em>See Singh, </em>436 F.3d at 487. Sanchez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
