Tully appeals from the twenty-four month sentence imposed for violation of the terms of his supervised release. On appeal, Tully argues that the district court did not sufficiently address the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) factors in determining his sentence. He alleges that, instead, the court focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>only on his extensive criminal history. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Because Tully did not object to the determination of his sentence on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) grounds in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Under the plain error standard, Tully must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even when these conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W.-(U.S. Nov. 3, 2006) (No. 06-7631), this court held that, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201crevocation sentences should be reviewed to determine whether they are \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 with regard to those \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d 461 F.3d at 437 (footnote omitted). This court explained that it must first assess the sentence for reasonableness, \u201cfollow[ing] generally the procedural and substantive considerations that we employ in our review of original sentence ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. Should this court conclude a sentence is reasonable, it should affirm the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 439. Only if a sentence is found unreasonable will this court \u201cdecide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court emphasized that, although the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and the requirements of \u00a7 3553(a) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583 (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), \u201cthe [district] court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The court also has held that a sentencing court is presumed to have considered the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) unless the record indicates otherwise and that it need not specifically address each factor. <em>United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 728-29 (4th Cir. 2000) (dealing with denial of motion to reduce sentence); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (stating that district court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Although the record does not indicate whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553 factors applicable to revocations of supervised release, as provided in <em>Crudup, </em>the district court considered the probation officer\u2019s report and testimony, the violations Tully committed, his prior criminal history, argument by counsel, and Tully\u2019s statement to the court. The court sentenced Tully within the statutory maximum. Thus, we find no evidence that the district court\u2019s determination of Tully\u2019s sentence was plainly erroneous or plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
