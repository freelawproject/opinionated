McDonald, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>78, 35 A.3d 669 (2012), separately conducted sentencing proceedings resulted in sentences that imposed, in their aggregate, multiple extended-term sentences. Previously, in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Papasavvas<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>State v. Pennington,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we addressed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(l)\u2019s prohibition against sentencing a defendant to multiple extended terms in a single sentencing proceeding. In this appeal, we address, for the first time, the import of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l)\u2019s incorporation of subsection a\u2019s prohibitions to certain offenses and sentencing proceedings, when sentencing is conducted in separate proceedings. Subsection b pertains when \u201csentences of imprisonment [are] imposed at different times,\u201d and provides that \u201c[w]hen a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence ... (1) The multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this matter defendant, Kevin Hudson, was sentenced to a second extended-term sentence for an offense committed prior to the imposition of the extended-term sentence he was serving. The imposition of that second extended-term sentence fit, in all respects, the temporal requirements for subsection (b)(l)\u2019s application. We hold that imposition of the second extended-term sentence transgressed the direction in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) to incorporate subsection a\u2019s prohibition against a defendant serving an aggregate sentence that accumulates multiple extended-term sentences. Subsection b\u2019s plain language applies subsection a\u2019s bar against imposing a sentence comprised of more than one extended term for the conviction of an offense which was committed prior to the imposition of the defendant\u2019s current extended-term sentence but for which defendant is being sentenced after the imposition of the first extended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We find unavailing the argument that the \u201cso far as possible\u201d qualifier in subsection (b)(1) waters down the specific prohibition to a mere preference to be considered in the general discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the sentencing court. Rather, based on the Legislature\u2019s express incorporation in subsection b of the prohibitions enumerated in subsection a and its direction that they be given effect \u201cso far as possible,\u201d we conclude that those limitations must be given effect and their application excused only when it is not possible to apply subsection a\u2019s limitations and parameters. That circumstance is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Both of Hudson\u2019s extended-term sentences stemmed from the same original indictment. He was tried and sentenced in separate proceedings as a result of his having moved for severance of the charges against him because two victims were involved. The extended-term sentence challenged herein was imposed in the second of the two trials on an offense that preceded in time the imposition of the extended-term sentence he was serving at the time of his second trial. Under these facts, the imposition of the second extended term violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), rendering it illegal. We are constrained to reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"Akp\">On June 12, 2006, Hudson was indicted in Monmouth County Indictment No. 06-07-1466 on twenty-three counts charging him with offenses associated with multiple assaults on two victims. He moved to sever the counts for trial because separate victims were involved. The severance motion was granted and, thereafter, he was subjected to two trials and sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The sentencing issue before us arose from the charges involving the victim, G.B. The trial that concerned the offenses involving the other victim, G.R., proceeded first. In the first trial, a jury found Hudson guilty of four third-degree offenses based on conduct that occurred on February 7, 2006. On one third-degree offense, the court sentenced defendant, on August 21, 2007, to an extended-term sentence of seven years imprisonment with a three-and-one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>half-year period of parole ineligibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s sentences on the other offenses were made to run concurrently with the extended-term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Hudson then was tried for the offenses involving G.B., which concerned conduct that had occurred on October 12, 2005 and on February 8, 2006. Although there were multiple charges, defendant was found guilty on two counts\u2014second-degree aggravated assault (Count 13) and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon (Count 15)\u2014both of which arose from the February 8, 2006 incident. The facts underlying those charges may be summarized briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Hudson and G.B. became involved in a romantic relationship beginning in 2004. There was a significant age difference between the two as Hudson was twenty-live years older than G.B., who was in her early twenties at the time of the assaults described herein. On the evening of October 12, 2005, allegedly because she had not been in touch with him, Hudson attacked G.B. as she walked to her home from a local train station. After slashing her face with a scalpel-like device, he wrapped her wounds with gauze and left her at the scene of the attack. When this incident initially was investigated by law enforcement authorities, G.B. gave a physical description of her attacker, but did not identify him as Hudson. She later attributed her reticence to fear, yet continued to see him, even after she learned that he was involved with another woman (the other victim, G.R.), with whom he had a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">G.B.\u2019s relationship with Hudson again turned violent when, in the early hours of February 8, 2006, he was waiting for her at the train station. He made her walk with him to an apartment complex where he forced her to have sexual intercourse. Afterward, G.B. unsuccessfully attempted to escape and defendant hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>her in the eye. She thereafter remained with him throughout the evening, eventually entering another building and sleeping for awhile. Later, Hudson became enraged when, after searching G.B.\u2019s belongings, he found she had been deleting messages on her cell phone. A vicious attack ensued in which he twice attempted to suffocate her with a plastic bag and, when that proved unsuccessful, he used an eyebrow archer\u2019s razor to trace over and reopen her facial scar where he had cut her before. He also inflicted cuts to her neck. Afterward, he did not prevent her from going home.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">G.B. reported the February 8, 2006, as well as the earlier October 12, 2005, incidents to the police and identified Hudson as the assailant in each. Approximately two weeks later, when she found Hudson again waiting outside the train station when she emerged, she called 9-1-1. Police arrived and apprehended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Hudson was tried on the charges involving G.B. in January 2007. The jury found him guilty of third-degree aggravated assault (as a lesser-included offense of Count 13, second-degree aggravated assault) contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 12-1 (b)(7), and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon (Count 15) contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(d). Both counts related to the February 8, 2006 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The State filed a motion seeking imposition of a discretionary extended term. Defense counsel conceded that Hudson was extended-term eligible based on his prior record; however, he argued that an extended term could not be imposed because Hudson had been sentenced to an extended term in the earlier trial that stemmed from the same indictment. According to the State, that did not free Hudson from eligibility for another extended-term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The court found that Hudson qualified as a persistent offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3(a) based on his prior record,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>mined that the imposition of an extended-term sentence in Hudson\u2019s earlier proceedings did not preclude the imposition of a second extended-term sentence because the indictments had been severed. The court explained, \u201cthis is a second sentencing hearing and he\u2019s being sentenced for different crimes committed on different dates against different victims,\u201d and thus distinguished <em>Papasavvas, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>565, 751 A.2d 40, which prohibited the imposition, on the same day, of multiple extended terms on counts from the same indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">After considering the extended-term range, the court imposed a five-year term of imprisonment with a two-year period of parole ineligibility on the third-degree aggravated-sexual-assault charge (Count 13), which was made to run consecutively to the extended-term sentence Hudson already was serving. On the fourth-degree charge of unlawful possession of a weapon (Count 15), the court imposed an eighteen-month flat sentence, concurrent to the term on Count 13, but consecutive to the term Hudson was serving.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In sum, Hudson\u2019s aggregate sentence on the two consecutive extended terms, imposed as a result of his one indictment and two trials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>was twelve years, with a five-and-one-half-year period of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed the sentence in an unpublished opinion. In addressing Hudson\u2019s arguments, the panel recognized that multiple extended terms may not be imposed in a single sentencing proceeding, but concluded that because Hudson sought severance and subjected himself to two separate sentencing proceedings, the bar in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) that we addressed in <em>Papasavvas, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 627, 751 A.2d 40, did not render defendant\u2019s sentence illegal. As the parties\u2019 arguments focused on the significance of defendant\u2019s original single indictment in respect of subsection a\u2019s application, the court\u2019s analysis did not touch on subsection b.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for certification. <em>State v. Hudson, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>80, 12 A.3d 212 (2011). Following a clarifying motion by the State, the grant of certification was honed to \u201cwhether it was an abuse of discretion to sentence defendant to an extended term consecutive to the extended term defendant was then serving.\u201d <em>State v. Hudson, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>385, 31 A.3d 271 (2011). The Attorney General (AG) filed a motion for amicus curiae status, which we granted. Supplemental briefing has addressed the need to construe <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) when assessing the legality of defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Hudson argues that had his indictment not been severed and the offenses tried in a single proceeding, only one extended term could have been imposed under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2). He claims that it is unfair to require a defendant to choose between the right to seek severance and the possibility of multiple extended terms. He adds that the imposition of multiple extended terms was particularly unfair in his case because the first trial judge, faced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>with imminent reassignment to the Civil Division, proceeded to sentencing before the second trial took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Further, Hudson argues that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) precludes the imposition of his second extended-term sentence and urges favorable review of the recent Appellate Division decision in <em>State v. Pennington, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 14 A.3d 790 (2011). In that case, the court held, based on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), that a second extended term cannot be imposed on an offense occurring before the imposition of the first extended term. It distinguished other seemingly contrary appellate decisions as involving offenses, for which the second extended-term sentence was imposed, that were committed <em>after </em>the imposition of the original extended-term sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Hudson, the scheduling of sentencing proceedings and the date of the offense are the controlling features for determining the propriety of sentencing a defendant to more than one extended-term sentence under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(1). In further support, he cites to the commentary to <em>Model Penal Code </em>\u00a7 7.06(2)(a) <em>{MFC), </em>which section is identical to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44~5(b)(l). Hudson argues that the commentary is further evidence that the purpose of this sentencing subsection is to prevent the timing or number of trials (and sentencing proceedings) from enlarging a defendant\u2019s overall sentencing exposure when the offense for which he is being sentenced, in the second sentencing proceeding, was committed prior to imposition of the first sentence. <em>See MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06 explanatory note (stating that \u201cthe timing of trials or the number of trials for different offenses should not affect the limitations established by Subsection (1)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The State\u2019s argument recognizes that pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b), certain multiple terms of imprisonment, imposed at different times, \u201cshall so far as possible conform to subsection a,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), and, further, that subsection (a)(2) of the statute requires, in part, that \u201cnot more than one sentence for an extended term shall be imposed.\u201d Its argument hinges on subsection (b)(l)\u2019s requirement that the sentence \u201cshall so far as possible conform\u201d with subsection a. According to the State, the word \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory, but the word \u201cpossible\u201d \u201cindicates that conformity to subsection a. is ... less than absolutely required in all situations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Claiming that the qualifying words are ambiguous, the State draws support from its view of the <em>MFC </em>Commentary to \u00a7 7.06(2)(a). Although the State acknowledges that the commentary supports the argument that subsection (b)(l)\u2019s overall goal is to place defendants convicted of multiple offenses generally in the same sentencing position regardless of whether the offenses are tried together or separately, that purpose does not extend to the proscription against multiple extended-term sentences. It is argued that that proscription is subject to the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In respect of Hudson specifically, the State argues that the fact that a discretionary extended term was granted should not control the sentence\u2019s legality; rather, the fundamental concern should be the real time that Hudson will serve. Because he received a five-year sentence for a third-degree crime, and because five years is the maximum period permitted for a third-degree crime, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6(a)(3), Hudson remained in the same position he would have been in had the indictment not been severed, which, the State argues, complies with the philosophy underlying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The AG\u2019s argument turns first to the bar in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2). She argues, similarly to the State, that its prohibition against the imposition of multiple extended terms is inapplicable when courts impose extended terms on different occasions. The AG points to earlier Appellate Division decisions that found no violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) when multiple extended-term sentences were imposed in different cases involving the same defendant, and emphasizes that the Legislature has not acted to amend the statute to correct any misinterpretation of its intent since those cases were decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In Hudson\u2019s case, the AG asserts that the severed charges should be considered two trials and two convictions for purposes of eligibility for multiple extended-term sentences. The AG argues that the rules governing joinder of offenses in the same indictment do not speak to the issue of sentencing on those offenses if severed, and maintains that the State should not be bound by the initial determination to charge offenses together. Therefore, when a defendant\u2019s motion for severance is granted under <em>Rule </em>3:15-2, the defendant should not be barred under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) from the possibility of receiving more than one extended-term sentence as a result of the multiple proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In respect of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), the AG argues that the qualifier, \u201cso far as possible,\u201d evinces an intent to leave \u201ca residuum of discretion\u201d with trial judges when sentencing. The AG regards the language as, at most, \u201ca presumption against a second extended term.\u201d To give the language a more inflexible reading would permit defendants to manipulate the order of sentencing to the end of requiring sentencing on lower-degree offenses to proceed first and thereby avoid an extended term on a later-sentenced higher-degree offense. As the AG puts it, the State would be required to gamble on a second trial\u2019s outcome: \u201cwhere a defendant is tried years apart on the severed counts, the State would not know whether to seek an extended term following conviction on the first trial, where a defendant\u2019s sentencing expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>sure is minimal, or risk waiting for the second trial\u201d that could result in an acquittal. A deserving defendant could then escape imposition of any extended term.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (Code) makes available ordinary length sentences, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(a) (establishing ordinary sentencing ranges), as well as various extended-term sentencing options, <em>see generally State v. Pierce, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>155, 161, 902 A.2d 1195 (2006) (listing examples of extended-term sentencing provisions). Extended-term sentences impose greater punishment, most often on the basis of an offender\u2019s past record of criminality. <em>See ibid; State v. Dunbar, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>80, 87-88, 527 A.2d 1346 (1987). Although the Code makes some extended-term sentencing mandatory, <em>see, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(f), other provisions confer a sentencing court with the discretion to impose an extended-term sentence when specified prerequisites are met. <em>See Pierce, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 161, 902 A.2d 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Pursuant to the persistent offender statute, a court \u201cmay, upon application of the prosecuting attorney, sentence a person who has been convicted of a crime of the first, second or third degree to an extended term of imprisonment\u201d if the individual is found to be a persistent offender. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-3. A \u201cpersistent offender\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">a person who at the <em>time of the commission of the crime </em>is 21 <em>years of </em>age <em>or </em>over, who has been previously convicted on at least two separate occasions of two crimes, committed at different times, when he was at least 18 years of age, if the latest in time of these crimes or the date of the defendant\u2019s last release from confinement, whichever is later, is within 10 years of the date of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3 (a).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The sentencing court must assess the defendant\u2019s prior convictions to determine whether the defendant meets those requirements. <em>See Pierce, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 163, 168, 902 A.2d 1195. Once the court finds a defendant qualifies as a persistent offender, the permissible sentencing range expands; the maximum sentence of the higher-degree range becomes the top of the extended-term range, <em>id. </em>at 168, 902 A.2d 1195, while the bottom remains the minimum sentence of the ordinary-term sentencing range, <em>id. </em>at 169, 902 A.2d 1195. When fixing the appropriate sentence length for the defendant within that expanded range, the court may consider, in addition to finding and weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, the \u201cprotection of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 902 A.2d 1195. Defendant was sentenced to a discretionary extended-term sentence pursuant to that statutory scheme. However, the issue in this appeal centers on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5\u2019s application to defendant\u2019s sentencing and whether a defendant can be sentenced to multiple extended terms at separate sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5, entitled \u201cMultiple Sentences; Concurrent and Consecutive Terms,\u201d guides sentencing in multiple-sentence circumstances. Many of its subparts address specific sentencing situations and instruct on whether a consecutive or concurrent sentence should be imposed and the manner of its calculation, <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2C:44~5(c), (e), (f), (h), or how a subsequent offense committed during suspension of a sentence or probation should affect such a previously imposed sentence, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(g). Subsections a and b address the imposition of multiple sentences generally. They provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALG\">a. Sentences of imprisonment for more than one offense. When multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant for more than one offense, including an offense for which a previous suspended sentence or sentence of probation has been revoked, such multiple sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively as the court determines at the time of sentence, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALt\">(1) The aggregate of consecutive terms to a county institution shall not exceed 18 months; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(2) Not more than one sentence for an extended term shall be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">There shall be no overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">b. Sentences of imprisonment imposed at different times. When a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(1) The multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">(2) Whether the court determines that the terms shall run concurrently or consecutively, the defendant shall be credited with time served in imprisonment on the prior sentence in determining the permissible aggregate length of the terms or terms remaining to be served; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">(3) When a new sentence is imposed on a prisoner who is on parole, the balance of the parole term on the former sentence shall not be deemed to run during the period of the new imprisonment unless the court determines otherwise at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\"><em>[N.J.SA </em>2C:44-5(a), (b)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">In the context of reviewing whether a defendant\u2019s sentence complies with <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5\u2019s requirements, certain standards govern the performance of our task. Appellate review of a sentence encompasses three distinct inquiries. <em>See State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-66, 471 A.2d 370 (1984). The first is paramount in this instance. Appellate review at its most fundamental level requires the determination that the sentence imposed does not violate \u201clegislative policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 471 A.2d 370. There must be compliance with statutory sentencing authority and stated parameters for a sentence to be lawful. <em>Id. </em>at 365, 471 A.2d 370. Beyond that, appellate review includes an examination into whether the aggravating and mitigating factors found by the sentencing court \u201cwere based upon competent credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 471 A.2d 370; <em>see N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-7. And further, appellate courts are empowered \u201c[to] determine whether, even though the court sentenced in accordance with the guidelines, nevertheless the application of the guidelines to the facts of this case makes the sentence clearly unreasonable so as to shock the judicial conscience.\u201d <em>Roth, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-65, 471 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Generally, the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies in appellate sentencing review, <em>see State v.

Gandhi, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161, 176, 989 A.2d 256 (2010) (noting that legal conclusions of trial or intermediate appellate court in sentencing context are reviewed de novo). Thus, the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation and application of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5, in respect of whether multiple extended terms were permissible when imposed on defendant in separate proceedings at different times, raises an issue of law that we review de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Well-known principles of statutory construction guide the analysis of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5. The overriding goal is to determine as best we can the intent of the Legislature, and to give effect to that intent. <em>See State v. Shelley, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>320, 323, 15 A.3d 818 (2011); <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). To accomplish that end, we adhere to the belief that \u201cthe best indicator of ... [legislative] intent is the plain language chosen by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Gandhi, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 989 A.2d 256 (citing <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The inquiry thus begins with the language of the statute, and the words chosen by the Legislature should be accorded their ordinary and accustomed meaning. <em>See Shelley, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>at 323, 15 A.3d 818. If the language leads to a clearly understood result, the judicial inquiry ends without any need to resort to extrinsic sources. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. D.A., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>158, 164, 923 A.2d 217 (2007)). In other words, extrinsic aids may not be used to create ambiguity when the plain language of the statute itself answers the interpretative question; however, when the statutory language results in more than one reasonable interpretation, then resort may be had to other construction tools and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>extrinsic aids to assist in the analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 15 A.3d 818 (citing <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492-93, 874 A.2d 1039).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the task at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">With enactment of <em>N.J.S. A. </em>2C:44-5, the Legislature has woven a piece on how a sentence should be configured for a defendant confronted with the possibility of serving multiple sentences. N.J.S.A 2C:44-5(a) instructs courts on how to sentence a defendant with multiple offenses whose sentences can combine and overlap. It addresses the sentencing of a defendant on multiple offenses in a single sentencing proceeding, and states, with unmistakable clarity, that there shall be imposed \u201cnot more than one sentence for an extended term\u201d when sentencing a defendant for more than one offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2). The statute also instructs the court to assess at sentencing whether the sentences shall be served concurrently or consecutively, addresses the aggregate length of consecutive terms to a county institution, and provides that there shall be no \u201coverall outer limit\u201d on the accumulation of consecutive sentences. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Subsection b, on the other hand, instructs courts about sentences of imprisonment that are imposed at different times. Specifically, subsection b levels its sights on the sentencing of a defendant \u201cwho has previously been sentenced to imprisonment,\u201d and who must be sentenced \u201cfor an offense committed prior to the former sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b). That language renders implausible the AG\u2019s proffered straw-man \u201calternative\u201d interpretation of the statute that would permit only one extended term in a convicted person\u2019s lifetime. The opening language to subsection b plainly makes its target the overlap or combining of multiple sentences when the second offense was committed before the sentence a defendant is serving. <em>See id.; see also State v. L.H., </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>528, 547, 20 A.3d 1137 (2011) (Rivera-Soto, J., concurring) (discussing how origins of subsection b demonstrate that \u201c[it] is addressed to the problem of a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon a person <em>who is already serving a term, </em>under a sentence imposed for an earlier offense\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). It does not purport to apply as a perpetual ineligibility for any subsequent extended term once one is imposed. Indeed, that interpretation is at odds with the statute\u2019s title, which indicates that it is addressing multiple sentences, and its opening operative provisions, which plainly focus on the impact of such multiple sentences, in combination, on a defendant\u2019s overall sentence length. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Applying the plain language of the statute, which must be our starting point, <em>see Gandhi, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 989 A.2d 256, it is apparent that subsection b speaks directly and unambiguously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to the factual circumstances presented in defendant\u2019s sentencing. Hudson was sentenced in separate sentencing proceedings. By giving effect to the straightforward language of subsection b, Hudson clearly and unambiguously falls, factually, within its application, including its sweeping-in of subsection a\u2019s sentencing directives and all that entails. <em>See DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (stating that court\u2019s duty is to apply statute where plain language leads to unambiguous result). As we construe the statutory scheme presented in subsections a and b of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5 and search for the legislative intent behind it, no salutary effect is gained from engaging in a formalistic assessment of whether proceedings should be deemed \u201cone\u201d or \u201ctwo\u201d due to the charges\u2019 origination in a single indictment. The statute\u2019s words direct the inquiry elsewhere. Subsection b speaks clearly, and directly, in terms of the date of the latter offense and the time of imposition of the prior sentence that the defendant is serving. We apply the clear words chosen by the Legislature that fit foursquare defendant Hudson\u2019s circumstances and bring to an end this aspect of our inquiry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The plain fact of the matter is that defendant was subject to two trial proceedings and two sentencing proceedings. And, in the second sentencing, he was sentenced on an offense that occurred at a time that preceded the imposition of his first sentencing wherein he received an extended-term sentence. At the first sentencing proceeding, the State certainly was aware of the severed trial that would occur later and of the timing of the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>to be tried in that matter. Therefore, we are not confronted in these circumstances with subsection b\u2019s application to the type of cold ease where the State never knew of the possibility of defendant\u2019s connection with the other offense that could lead to the second-in-time trial and sentencing at the time of the first trial and sentencing. <em>See, e.g., L.H., supra, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>at 548-50, 20 A.3d 1137 (discussing inapplicability of gap-time under subsection b for time spent on defendant\u2019s subsequent-in-time convictions when defendant\u2019s connection with earlier unsolved sexual assault offense was utterly unknown to State). The State could not possibly combine, or consciously coordinate, sentencing in such circumstances in order to fashion an appropriate overall sentence for such multiple offenses; however, such circumstances are not present here and we therefore need not consider the potential outer edges to the elasticity permitted by the \u201cso far as possible\u201d language included by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We turn then to the meaning to be ascribed to the language used by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l)\u2019s direction to sentencing courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) directs courts, when imposing a sentence that may combine or overlap with an already imposed sentence defendant is serving, that any sentence imposed \u201cshall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section.\u201d We note at the outset that nothing in that language limits subsection b\u2019s incorporation of subsection a\u2019s caveats to some, but not all, of the directions contained in subsection a. It does not by its plain terms exclude the multiple-extended-terms prohibition, as the State argues; rather, it embraces all of the sentencing mandates of subsection a, subject to the \u201cso far as possible\u201d qualifier. Thus, our interpretation of the meaning and intent of the subsection begins with the understanding that the Legislature expected the proscription against multiple extended terms to be as much a part of subsection b\u2019s application as subsection a\u2019s other mandates. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Multiple extended terms are thus generally forbidden by subsection b when a defendant is being sentenced for an offense committed prior to the former sentence that may combine or overlap with the sentence about to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Turning to the meaning of the \u201cso far as possible\u201d qualifier in subsection b, we again find that the interpretation of that language urged by the State, as well as the AG, does not square with the plain language. In our view, \u201cso far as possible\u201d supports that the Legislature wanted the limitation <em>so far as </em>\u201cpossible.\u201d Plainly, the limitation would be excused from application when following its mandate would <em>not </em>be possible. By using the word \u201cpossible,\u201d the Legislature has made the prohibition the default, unless it is not possible to conform the sentence to subsection a\u2019s prohibition against multiple extended terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The State contends that the proscription is only a factor to be considered in the exercise of sentencing discretion by the second sentencing court. That would render the proscription the equivalent of a suggestion or preference. The AG refers to it as, at most, a presumption against multiple extended terms. Those interpretations are not apparent from the plain language for that is not what subsection b says. The word choice is \u201cpossible,\u201d not \u201cpracticable\u201d or \u201cpreferable\u201d or \u201cpresumptive.\u201d We cannot rewrite the Legislature\u2019s words; we can only enforce the language as it is written.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Further, we note that the statute contains a specific section vesting courts with discretion generally with respect to concurrent versus consecutive sentencing unless controlled specifically by another subsection, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(d), but there is no equivalent vesting of discretion in respect of multiple extended-term sentences. We have only the specific prohibition in subsection a, made applicable in specific settings through subsection b. The Legislature was prescient to include minimally qualifying language in subsection b, which allows some leeway that permits adjustment for the evolution of mandatory extended-term sentences, <em>see, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(f), or other developments that bollix the antici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>pated planning and coordination in sentencing a defendant to cumulating sentences through separate sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We therefore discern from the plain language a clear direction to sentencing courts. The prohibition against multiple extended-term sentences applies, as far as it is possible to do so, when sentencing a defendant who is already serving a sentence and who is about to be sentenced for an offense that predated imposition of that sentence. The construction given to the qualifying \u201cso far as possible\u201d language does not render the qualifier superfluous. The qualifier would come into application, certainly, if the offense for which a defendant (who is already serving a discretionary extended term) is being sentenced, second in time, is one that is subject to a mandatory extended term. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(f). In such circumstances, the law requiring the mandatory extended term would override the more general sentencing direction contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l). <em>See Trinity Cemetery Ass\u2019n v. Twp. of Wall, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>39, 46, 784 A.2d 52 (2001) (\u201c[I]t is well-established that a specific statutory provision dealing with a particular subject prevails over a general statute on the same subject.\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). Other potential extenuating examples are possible to envision, subject to further case development. <em>See, e.g., supra, </em>Part IV. A, at 532-33, 39 A.3d at 161-62 (discussing \u201ccold case\u201d example as not fitting subsection\u2019s purpose of addressing sentences that overlap or combine to be served together). Thus, the qualifying wording has substance and applicability without giving the qualifier so broad a sweep that the clear and plainly included proscription is reduced to a mere preference to be considered in unguided fashion in the discretion of the sentencing court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Finally, we add that we discern no guidance on the instant matter from the legislative inaction that the State and the AG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>underscore. Specifically, it is contended that the Legislature\u2019s failure to correct past decisions that permitted more than one extended term to be imposed on a defendant in separate sentencing proceedings should inform us that such results were intended to be permitted under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5. There are several responses to that argument. First, the only previous decisions rendered by this Court on the subject of multiple extended-term sentences addressed specifically the application of <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:44-5(a) to multiple extended terms imposed in a single proceeding. <em>See Papasavvas, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>565, 751 A.2d 40, and <em>Pennington, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>344, 712 A.2d 1133. Legislative inaction to those decisions tells nothing about <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Second, as for the two Appellate Division cases relied on by the State, <em>Reldan, supra, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 555 A.2d 653, and <em>Williams, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 690 A.2d 1082, both involved factual circumstances that did not implicate subsections a or b. Multiple sentencing proceedings were involved in each, rendering subsection a facially inapplicable. And, neither discussed the application of subsection b at all. In each, the second-in-time imposed sentence related to an offense that did not fit the temporal requirements of subsection b.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Legislative inaction is a thin reed generally on which to base an interpretive argument. It is of even less worth when the decisions to which one might reasonably \u201cexpect\u201d a legislative reaction do not even apply the subsection under interpretation. Moreover, as defendant rightly contends, the two decisions, on whose back this argument would be carried in respect of subsection b, have no applicability to the facts of the case before us as neither fit the factual and temporal requirements for subsection b\u2019s application. That point also was not lost on the Appellate Division in the recent decision in <em>Pennington, supra, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 14 A.3d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In <em>Pennington, supra, </em>Judge Waugh, writing for the panel, distinguished <em>Reldan </em>and <em>Williams </em>on their different factual bases as well as for their lack of analysis of subsection b\u2019s applicability, and considered, for the first time as far as our research reveals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the issue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l)\u2019s application to multiple extended terms. <em>Id. </em>at 554-56, 14 A.3d 790. The Appellate Division concluded, as do we, that a \u201cplain reading of the statutory-language\u201d supports the \u201cargument that the imposition of a second extended term under the circumstances of this case was not permitted\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 14 A.3d 790. The panel also deduced support from the MPC Commentary. <em>Ibid. </em>We however do not view the commentary as lending much help in this regard,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> other than to echo, as the <em>Pennington </em>panel noted, that the overriding principle of our statutory subsection, and its MPC counterpoint, undoubtedly was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3c\">that the timing of trials or the number of trials for different offenses should not affect the limitations established by Subsection (1). Thus, if a defendant has committed two offenses, the sentencing limitations established by this section will apply if he is tried separately for the two crimes as well as if he is tried for both offenses at the same time. Subsection (2) also sets forth other principles to control the situation in which the defendant is being sentenced for an offense that was committed prior to the imposition of another sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 557, 14 A.3d 790 (quoting <em>MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06 explanatory note).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In sum, the legislative inaction argument advanced by the State and the AG is unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">To conclude, we adhere to a plain-meaning reading of the language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) and hold that it was legal error to have imposed a second extended-term sentence on defendant in his trial on the charges stemming from his assaults on G.B. The timing and sequence of his offenses and sentencing bring him squarely under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(l)\u2019s application. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the proscription against multiple extended-term sentences, incorporated from subsection a through subsection b, was applicable to Hudson and must be implemented. Because the sentence imposed transgressed the legislative policies of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5, defendant\u2019s extended-term sentence on Count 13 must be reversed. It is of no legal matter that the actual sentence imposed on Hudson was the equivalent of the top of the former ordinary range for a third-degree crime. The sentence was imposed as a discretionary extended term, a sentence made illegal under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44r-5(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed only in respect of defendant\u2019s sentence on Count 13.

The court found that the instant offenses and the offenses underlying the prior sentence had independent objectives, involved separate acts or threats of violence against different victims, and were committed at different times in different places separated by a period of two weeks. Noting Hudson's extensive history of domestic violence, the court imposed consecutive sentences so as not to award Hudson a free crime against G.B.

Thus, to the extent that the MPC Commentary discusses limiting the accumulation of consecutive sentences as an overarching principle to subsections a or b, <em>see MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06 comments 1-2, it is inapposite as that principle does not animate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5 (a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>It bears mentioning that subsections a and b have been amended on one other-occasion since their adoption in 1978.

In my view, the majority\u2019s construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) contravenes the statute\u2019s goals and legislative history, and unnecessarily constrains the discretion of sentencing courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a) restricts a sentencing court\u2019s discretion when simultaneously sentencing a defendant for more than one crime in two respects: (1) \u201c[t]he aggregate of consecutive terms to a county institution shall not exceed 18 months;\u201d and (2) \u201c[n]ot more than one sentence for an extended period shall be imposed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(l) and (2). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) provides that \u201c[w]hen a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b), \u201cthe multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l). Absent the phrase \u201cso far as possible,\u201d there would be no question that when <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) applies, a sentencing court may not impose more than one extended term sentence, and the majority\u2019s conclusion would be self-evident. The language \u201cso far as possible\u201d is part of the statute, however, and the Legislature\u2019s intent when it chose to include those four words is thus the central issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The majority ascribes to the language \u201cso far as possible\u201d a plain meaning. It concludes that if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44\u20145(b)(1) applies, a second extended term sentence would be barred unless (1) the defendant has also committed an offense that requires a mandatory extended term, such as a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(f), that would \u201coverride the more general sentencing direction contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l),\u201d or (2) other situations necessitating another extended term develop, such as a \u201ccold case\u201d in which the State, at the time of the first trial and sentencing, would have been unaware of a prior crime rendering defendant eligible to be sentenced to an extended term. <em>Ante </em>at 534-36, 39 A.3d at 163. In the majority\u2019s view, this construction is clear based upon the unambiguous language of the statute. <em>Ante </em>at 535-36, 39 A.3d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">I respectfully differ from the majority\u2019s view of the import of the statutory language. The Legislature did not use the precise language that it typically does when it conveys the message to which the majority refers. When the Legislature expresses its intent that statutory language shall govern unless, in a given case, it would directly contravene another provision of the statutory scheme, it uses such language as \u201cunless otherwise provided by\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>or \u201cexcept as otherwise provided.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No such language is found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5 (b)(1). There, instead of qualifying the limitation on extended term sentences with \u201cunless otherwise provided by\u201d or \u201cexcept as otherwise provided,\u201d the Legislature chose to modify the word \u201cshall\u201d with the more general phrase \u201cso far as possible.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44r-5(b)(l). By virtue of the Legislature\u2019s choice of language, the direction to sentencing courts\u2014not to impose a second extended term when <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b) applies\u2014is not intended to be absolute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5 (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The crucial word \u201cpossible\u201d has a variety of definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Capable of existing, happening, being, becoming or coming to pass; feasible, not contrary to nature of things; neither necessitated or precluded; free to happen or not; contrasted with impossible. In another sense, the word denotes improbability without excluding the idea of feasibility. It is also sometimes equivalent to \u201cpracticable\u201d or \u201creasonable,\u201d as in some cases where action is required to be taken \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\"><em>[Black\u2019s Laiw Dictionary </em>1166 (6th ed. 1990).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In light of this range of definitions, the meaning of the Legislature\u2019s direction that no more than one sentence for an extended term shall be imposed \u201cso far as possible\u201d is not, in my view, obvious from the plain language. For example, if \u201cpossible\u201d is defined as \u201cpracticable\u201d or \u201creasonable,\u201d the Legislature intended it to be more broadly construed than the majority suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Accordingly, because the phrase that the Legislature actually chose to convey its meaning is ambiguous, under our rules of statutory construction, the Court may \u201cturn to extrinsic evidence for guidance.\u201d <em>State v.

The statute was originally enacted in 1978 and was based on Model Penal Code <em>(MPC) </em>\u00a7 7.06; the commentary to our Code of Criminal Justice characterizes <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5 as \u201csimilar to \u00a7 7.06 of the Model Penal Code.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5 (Historical and Statutory Notes). Given the Legislature\u2019s use of <em>MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06 as a basis for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5, the commentary to the relevant MPC section may be consulted by the Court in determining the legislative intent. <em>See State v. D.A., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>158, 167, 923 A.2d 217 (2007). However, that commentary reflects that the limiting language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44r-5(b)(l) was primarily intended to address a provision that did not find its way into the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice. <em>MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06(l)(c) would have barred consecutive indefinite terms that \u201cexceed in minimum or maximum length the longest extended term authorized for the highest grade and degree of crime for which any of the sentences was imposed!)]\u201d <em>Model Penal Code and Commentaries (MPCC) </em>\u00a7 7.06(l)(c) (1985). The commentary provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">Subsection (2) [of <em>MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06] is based on the premise that the timing of the trials for multiple charges against a defendant should have as little bearing on the extent of his exposure to consecutive sentences as possible. In other words, the limits on consecutive sentences should apply in like manner when the defendant is tried and sentenced in the same proceeding for multiple offenses and when he is tried separately for each of them, either by the same court or by another comparable court within the same state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\"><em>[MPCC, supra, </em>\u00a7 7.06, cmt. 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>However, as the majority notes, <em>ante </em>at 530-31 n. 9, 39 A.3d at 160 n. 9, our Legislature chose not to adopt the provision that is discussed by the drafters, <em>MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06(1 )(e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5; <em>Richardson v. Nickolopoulos, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>241, 244, 540 A.2d 1246 (1988). Accordingly, the MPC authors\u2019 primary objective in drafting \u00a7 7.06(2)(a)\u2014applying <em>MPC </em>\u00a7 7.06(l)(c)\u2019s limitation on consecutive sentences when a defendant previously sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence\u2014is irrelevant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l), as enacted by the Legislature. The MPC commentary thus provides little guidance to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">One aspect of the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-o is important, however. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that the language \u201cso far as possible\u201d was constricted to the narrow meaning ascribed to it by the majority\u2014to exclude from the limitations of <em>NJ.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) sentences for offenses involving mandatory extended terms. <em>See ante </em>at 534, 39 A.3d at 162-63. This could not have been the Legislature\u2019s intent, because at the time of the statute\u2019s enactment, there were no such offenses in existence. In 1978, when <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5 was enacted, and in 1979, when it was first amended, the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice did not yet include provisions mandating extended terms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor could the \u201cso far as possible\u201d language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>have been a reference to mandatory extended terms in the MPC, because it contained no mandatory extended sentences at that time. Consequently, there is nothing to suggest that the MPC\u2019s drafters intended the \u201cso far as possible\u201d language to refer to such sentences. It is unlikely that the 1978 Legislature enacted the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice devoid of provisions mandating extended terms, and nonetheless added the \u201cso far as possible\u201d language to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44\u20145(b)(1), for the sole purpose of anticipating a statutory change that was years away. If the Legislature had intended the phrase \u201cso far as possible\u201d to allow for mandatory extended terms that were not part of New Jersey\u2019s Code as it then existed, but only to anticipate a future change in the law to provide for such terms, it would surely have so indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">It is, in my view, more likely that the Legislature included the language \u201cso far as possible\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) in order to leave to sentencing judges an essential modicum of discretion to ensure that a given sentence will satisfy the Legislature\u2019s overarching sentencing goals. The Legislature has identified paramount objectives in enacting the sentencing provisions of the Code: deterrence and punishment of crimes, correction and rehabilitation of offenders, promotion of the public safety, and fairness, consistency and \u201cjust individualization\u201d in sentencing. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-2(b). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5 should be construed in accordance with the purpose of the persistent offender extended term statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C.-44-3, to enhance the punishment for habitual offenders. <em>See State v. Pennington, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>344, 361, 712 A.2d 1133 (1998). Statutory sentencing criteria, not the court calendar, should govern the outcome; extended term sentences imposed in separate proceedings should be no more severe than the maximum sentences that could have been imposed by a single judge in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>single proceeding. <em>See Richardson, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 255, 540 A.2d 1246 (sentencing courts should respect the principle that \u201cto the extent possible, sentencing for multiple offenses should not produce disparate results because of the incidental chronology of sentencing\u201d); <em>Meyer v. State Parole Bd., </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 430, 785 A.2d 465 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>339, 793 A.2d 717 (2002); <em>State v. Guaman, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 133-34, 638 A.2d 162 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">While a limitation to one extended term under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) will promote these objectives in most instances, our courts should retain the discretion to consider the nuances of a given case in devising a sentence. A sentencing judge is uniquely situated to identify the unusual situation in which a blanket prohibition on a second extended term would give a persistent offender an unfair and arbitrary advantage, and thereby contravene legislative goals. Construed to preserve such limited discretion, the true significance of the phrase \u201cso far as possible\u201d becomes apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Indeed, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5 has long been interpreted to permit the imposition of a second extended term, at the discretion of the trial judge, when a defendant who qualifies as a persistent offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3 is sentenced for different crimes in different proceedings. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 272-73, 690 A.2d 1082 (App.Div.1997) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2) \u201cdoes not apply to a situation in which two different courts have imposed extended terms for different offenses\u201d); <em>State v. Reldan, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 238, 555 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1989) (same); Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 2 on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5 (2011) (\u201cThe limitation of the statute has no application where extended terms have been imposed by two different courts for different offenses and at different times.\u201d). <em>Contra State v. Pennington, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 14 A.3d 790 (App.Div.2011) (discussed by the majority, <em>ante </em>at 536-37, 39 A.3d at 164). The Legislature is \u201cpresumed to be aware of the judicial construction placed on an enactment.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>325, 335, 963 A.2d 281 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Chapland, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>275, 291, 901 A.2d 351 (2006)). It has not amended the \u201cso far as possible\u201d language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b)(l) in the thirty-four years since the statute was enacted, despite the long-standing judicial construction that is rejected by the majority in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The Legislature\u2019s distinction between sentences imposed in a single proceeding under <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:44-5(a)(l), which does not contain the \u201cso far as possible\u201d language, and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(b)(1), which does, is consonant with the legislative purpose if that language is read to grant limited discretion to the sentencing court. When a defendant is sentenced to two or more offenses in the same proceeding, the sentencing court is limited to a single extended term sentence. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-5(a)(2); <em>State v. Papasavvas, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>565, 627, 751 A.2d 40 (2000); <em>Pennington, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 361, 712 A.2d 1133. With all of the defendant\u2019s offenses before it, that court is in a position to impose an extended term for the most serious offense, if warranted by an application of <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:44-3\u2019s criteria to the specific case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In contrast, as the majority understands that \u201cso far as possible\u201d limitation, a subsequent sentencing court has no discretion to achieve a similar result. A sentencing court confronted with a defendant previously sentenced to an extended term sentence for a lesser crime and who then appears for sentencing on a higher-degree offense is prohibited fimo choosing the defendant\u2019s most serious offense for the imposition of the extended term. Only if the second sentencing court is afforded sufficient discretion to sentence the defendant to a second extended term can the court ensure that the defendant\u2019s offenses\u2014not an accident of timing\u2014 will guide the result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>This case illustrates the appropriate exercise of such discretion. The maximum ordinary term that could have been imposed for defendant\u2019s third-degree offense was five years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(a)(3). His sentence in this case, the lowest extended term sentence that could be imposed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7(a)(4), was five years. Notwithstanding his election to seek severance of his twenty-two-eount indictment, defendant\u2019s sentence was comparable to what a sentencing court could have imposed had defendant been tried, convicted and sentenced in a single proceeding in which the court was limited by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a) to a single extended term. Defendant\u2019s sentence was within the statutory range that would have been available to the sentencing court in a combined proceeding. The Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:44-3 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:44-5 was fully achieved by the trial court\u2019s sentence, and properly construed by the Appellate Division panel that affirmed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">I disagree with the majority that construing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(b) to deprive trial courts of the opportunity to impose an extended term sentence in matters covered by that provision, no matter what the circumstances of the individual case, is either warranted by the language of the statute or consonant with the Legislature\u2019s objectives.

McDonald, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>78, 35 A.3d 669 (2012). There, the majority of this Court today holds that the defendant, who had been previously sentenced to an extended term for a third-degree crime, could not be sentenced in a subsequent proceeding to an extended term for a second-degree offense, even though the overall sentence would have complied with the range applicable to the more serious offense. By virtue of the Court's construction of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:44\u20145(b)(1) to eliminate the sentencing court's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>discretion, the defendant in McDonald will receive a substantial benefit by virtue of the chronology of her sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b569-7\">Judge WEFING</author>\n<p id=\"AMl\">(temporarily assigned), dissenting in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">I write separately because, although I agree with my colleague Justice Patterson that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5b(l) recognizes that a trial judge, faced with crafting an appropriate sentence for a defendant who had previously been sentenced to an extended-term sentence for a completely separate conviction, possesses a residuum of judicial discretion to impose a second extended-term sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>upon that defendant, I also agree with my colleague Justice LaVecchia that under the factual complex presented to us, this defendant is entitled to be resentenced. I come to that conclusion, however, through a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The only reason that this defendant was subjected to separate sentencing proceedings was that the initial trial judge granted his motion to sever certain counts of the indictment to avoid the risk of undue prejudice and was then, after conclusion of the first proceeding, fortuitously transferred to another division. If this matter had proceeded in the normal course, defendant would have been tried on all counts before the same trial judge before he was sentenced on any. The quantum of his aggregate sentence for all of his convictions would have been determined by one judge, who heard all of the proceedings. In that posture, he could not have received two extended-term sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In my judgment, a defendant\u2019s sentencing exposure should not be increased because of such a coalescence of events. Further, I cannot consider the potential for harm to be obviated because defendant\u2019s second extended-term sentence was, legally, within the range of what could have been imposed if he had been sentenced at one final proceeding. The second sentencing court viewed the permissible range to span from five to ten years, rather than from three to five years. Defendant is entitled to be sentenced by a court that employs the correct range; it is of little solace to him that the same result could have been achieved by a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\"><em>For reversal in respect of defendant\u2019s sentence on count </em>lS/remandment\u2014Chief Justice RABNER, and Justices LONG, LaVECCHIA, and ALBIN\u20144.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\"><em>For </em>dissent\u2014Justices HOENS and PATTERSON\u20142.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\"><em>For concurrence in part/dissent in </em>part\u2014Judge WEFING (temporarily assigned)\u20141.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
