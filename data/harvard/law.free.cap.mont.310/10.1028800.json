Robbins, filed a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District in Cascade County. The District Court denied the petition based on its conclusion that <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204, did not retroactively apply to Robbins\u2019 petition. Robbins appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition. We reverse the District Court and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">\u00b62 We find the following issue dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it concluded that <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204, did not retroactively apply to Robbins\u2019 petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b64 On July 20,1995, the Petitioner, Robert J. Robbins, was charged by Information filed in the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District in Cascade County with deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, and with robbery in violation of \u00a7 45-5-401, MCA. Before trial, Robbins moved to quash the jury panel because prospective jurors had not been summoned pursuant to \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997). The District Court denied Robbins\u2019 motion based on its finding that the clerk of court had substantially complied with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b65 The jury convicted Robbins of the offenses charged and the District Court sentenced Robbins to the Montana State Prison for 75 years for deliberate homicide, 40 years for robbery, and 25 years as a persistent felony offender. The District Court ordered all sentences to run consecutively and restricted Robbins\u2019 parole eligibility for 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"ALT\">\u00b66 On direct appeal, Robbins argued that the clerk of court violated \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), when she summoned jurors by telephone instead of by mail or personal service. According to Robbins, the clerk\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), deprived him of his constitutional and statutory rights to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b67 We addressed these arguments in <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, 292 Mont. 23, 971 P.2d 359, and held that the District Court erred when it found that the clerk was in substantial compliance with the statute but that the error was harmless because Robbins had not introduced any evidence that he was actually prejudiced. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b68 On February 15, 2000, we decided <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b69 On April 10, 2000, Robbins filed a petition for postconviction relief. First, Robbins contended that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury. Second, he contended that unless this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. LaMere </em>was applied to his case, his rights to due process and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment would be violated. The District Court denied Robbins\u2019 petition in an order dated December 29, 2000. Although it noted that our holding in <em>LaMere </em>seemed to require reversal, the District Court ultimately concluded that our holding in Robbins\u2019 direct appeal was the law of the case and therefore the District Court was bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b610 Robbins now appeals from the District Court order which denied his petition for postconviction relief. We reverse the District Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err when it concluded that <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204, did not retroactively apply to Robbins\u2019 petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b612 Robbins urges us to retroactively apply the rule we announced in <em>LaMere </em>and reverse his conviction. The State asserts that the issues raised in Robbins\u2019 petition are proeedurally barred because they were not raised on direct appeal. The State further contends that unlike <em>LaMere, </em>the alleged error in this case was not \u201cstructural\u201d error and that automatic reversal is not required. Finally, the State argues that retroactive application of <em>LaMere </em>is barred by <em>Teague v. Lane </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b613  We conclude that the District Court erred when it refused to apply <em>LaMere </em>to Robbins\u2019 petition. <em>LaMere </em>specifically overruled <em>Robbins </em>to the extent that it held that a violation of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), could be harmless error. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 61. Instead, we held that failure to properly summon jurors, in violation of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), implicates the constitutional right to an impartial jury in violation of the Sixth Amendment and affects the very framework in which the trial proceeds. We characterized the error as structural as opposed to trial error and held that the right to an impartial jury is so essential to the concept of a fair trial that its violation can never be considered harmless. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b614  The \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine invoked by the District Court is inapplicable to these facts. That doctrine provides that where a decision has been rendered by the Supreme Court on a particular issue between the same parties in the same case, that decision is binding on the parties and the courts and cannot be relitigated in the trial court or on a subsequent appeal. <em>See Belgrade State Bank v. Swainson </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 444, 446, 578 P.2d 1166, 1167. However, we have also recognized that even though an issue has been addressed and determined adversely to a prisoner on direct appeal, a court may reconsider the issue in postconviction proceedings when there has been a substantial change in the applicable law. <em>Coleman v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 428, 440, 633 P.2d 624, 631. Since we held <em>in LaMere </em>that errors in jury selection are no longer amenable to the harmless error analysis we employed in Robbins\u2019 direct appeal, we conclude there has been a substantial change in the applicable law and the application of <em>LaMere </em>is not precluded by the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u00b615 The State\u2019s contentions that Robbins waived the constitutional argument that he makes in this case or that <em>LaMere </em>is inapplicable because based on constitutional considerations, whereas Robbins\u2019 argument is primarily statutory, are also without merit. Robbins and LaMere made the same successful argument in their direct appeals. That argument was that the clerk of court failed to summon jurors in accordance with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA(1997). The identity of the two defendants\u2019 arguments is apparent from our <em>LaMere </em>opinion where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\"><em>InRobbins, </em>the defendant challenged the telephone-dependent summoning process utilized in Cascade County as failing to substantially comply with \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997), in that it failed to serve prospective jurors with a jury summons. We agreed, ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We hold that the telephone summoning of jurors failed, as in <em>Robbins, </em>to substantially comply with \u00a7 3-15-505, MCA (1997). <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b616 The only difference between our holding in <em>Robbins </em>and <em>LaMere </em>is that in <em>Robbins </em>we accepted the State\u2019s contention that the defendant had not been prejudiced. <em>See LaMere, </em>\u00b6 18. In <em>LaMere, </em>we overruled that aspect of <em>Robbins </em>and returned to a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal for failure to substantially comply with Montana\u2019s statutes concerning procurement of a jury. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">However, after doing extensive research far beyond that submitted by the parties, we choose to overrule <em>Robbins </em>and <em>return to </em>a <em>per se </em>rule of reversal for a failure to substantially comply with Montana statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury. [Underlining added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b617 The State\u2019s confusion in this regard appears to be based not on arguments which Robbins previously failed to raise on appeal and not on the fact that Robbins\u2019 statutory argument is different than LaMere\u2019s constitutional argument; it seems to be based on our ultimate conclusion that by ignoring the statutory requirements for procurement of a jury, LaMere\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury was violated. We explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">Under this Court\u2019s case law, the statutory procedures have been construed as designed \u201c \u2018to carry out the constitutional guarantee\u2019\u201d of \u201c \u2018a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>[State v.] Deeds, </em>130 Mont. at 510-11, 305 P.2d at 325 (quoting <em>Porter, </em>125 Mont. [503] at 506, 242 P.2d [321] at 986 (quoting Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>III, Sec. 16, Mont. Const. (1889))). A defendant\u2019s statutory right to challenge the jury panel for a substantial failure to comply with the law governing jury selection is but \u201ca legislative amplification of the constitutional ... right to \u2018a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>[State v.] Groom, </em>49 Mont. [354] at 359, 141 P. [858] at 858. That the \u201c \u2018jury shall be selected according to methods established\u2019\u201d is intended \u201c \u2018to secure a just and impartial administration of the jury system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diedtman, </em>58 Mont. [13] at 18, 190 P. [117] at 118-19 (quoting <em>People v. McQuade </em>(N.Y. 1888), 18 N.E. 156, 165). Since \u201ca substantial compliance is necessary in order to meet the constitutional requirement,\u201d a defendant is therefore entitled \u201cto a [jury] panel drawn in substantial conformity with the requirements of statute.\u201d <em>Landry, </em>29 Mont. at 223-24, 74 P. at 420.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">In short, the objective procedures established by the Montana Legislature for the random selection of jurors are intended to protect a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair and impartial jury, as guaranteed by Article II, Sections 24 and 26 of the Montana Constitution and by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. We construe the substantial compliance standard as being designed to protect a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to an impartial jury, primarily, by encouraging reasonably strict compliance with statutory procedures intended to implement, and thereby secure, the fair cross-section guarantee of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b618 Finally, the State contends that <em>LaMere </em>cannot be retroactively applied to <em>Robbins </em>in a collateral proceeding such as postconviction relief based on the test for retroactive application set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Teague v. Lane </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334, and followed by this Court in <em>State v. Egelhoff </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 114, 900 P.2d 260 <em>(rev\u2019d on other grounds by Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 37, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361). In <em>Teague, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that, with certain exceptions, new constitutional rules will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced. 489 U.S. at 310, 109 S.Ct. at 1075. However, assuming that <em>LaMere </em>did establish a new rule rather than return to an old rule regarding <em>per se </em>reversal for error in the jury selection process, as the previously quoted language suggests, the State concedes, \u201cthat a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>rule should be applied retroactively if it requires the observance of \u2018those procedures that... are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d ....\u201d <em>See Teague, </em>49 U.S. at 310-11, 109 S.Ct. at 1076. It is hard to read the <em>LaMere </em>opinion without coming to the conclusion that any state action which denies a defendant an impartial jury as guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions violates procedures \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">However, some constitutional violations \u201cby their very nature cast so much doubt on the fairness of the trial process that, as a matter of law, they can never be considered harmless. Sixth Amendment <em>violations that pervade the entire proceeding </em>fall within this category.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 40. Based on that holding, we concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">In summary, then, a material failure to substantially comply with Montana statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury cannot be treated as harmless error for the following reasons: ... (4) the impartiality of the jury goes to the very integrity of our justice system, and the right to an impartial jury is so essential to our conception of a fair trial that its violation cannot be considered harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\"><em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b619  We conclude that a right which goes to the very integrity of our justice system is also \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u201d for the purposes of coming within the exception to the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity analysis. Therefore, we conclude that Robbins is entitled to the retroactive application of our decision in <em>LaMere </em>and reverse the judgment of the District Court on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b620 The parties\u2019 final brief was filed in this matter on November 7, 2001. On March 26,2002, we decided <em>State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, 309 Mont. 63, 43 P.3d 922. In <em>Whitehorn, </em>we held that the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity analysis applies only to procedural rules and that substantive rules of law should be given retroactive application without regard to <em>Teague </em>analysis. On that basis, we overruled our decision in <em>State v. Nichols, </em>1999 MT 212, 295 Mont. 489, 986 P.2d 1093, to the extent that it barred retroactive application of our double jeopardy decision in <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312. We concede that there is a strong argument that a process which denies Robbins his constitutional right to an impartial jury implicates a substantive rather than a procedural right. However, because <em>Whitehorn </em>was decided after final briefing in this matter and supplemental briefing was not requested; and, because the same result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>follows from the application of the <em>Teague </em>analysis, we need not conclude in this case whether procedural or substantive rights are involved. Assuming for purposes of this case only that Robbins\u2019 rights were procedural, because that is the basis on which the case was briefed, we conclude he is still entitled to retroactive application of our <em>LaMere </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b621 For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and this case is remanded to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
