Because we conclude that Eric has not complied with the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure in filing his brief on appeal, we dismiss the appeal and award attorney\u2019s fees to Pamela.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u00b62 In view of Eric\u2019s failure to properly set forth the issues on appeal (which we discuss in more detail later in this Opinion), we will consider this matter on the issues as delineated and set forth by Pamela. Thus, as restated by Pamela, the issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u00b63 1. Has Eric properly appealed the District Court\u2019s order?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in not adopting Eric\u2019s Proposed Residential Schedule?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying Eric\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">\u00b66 4. Should Pamela be awarded her attorney\u2019s fees because of a frivolous appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">\u00b67 Since we find Issue 1 dispositive, we do not address Issues 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">\u00b68 Eric and Pamela were married on December 20, 1986, in Newberg, Oregon. They have two sons: Colton, bom February 24, 1989; and Matthew, bom October 7, 1991. In June 1994, Pamela and the children returned to Montana for a visit with Pamela\u2019s parents. During this visit, Pamela decided to remain in Montana because of problems with her marriage. On July 11,1994, Pamela filed a \u201cPetition for Unlimited Separation\u201d in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Marion. And, in December 1994, Eric and Pamela entered into a Marital Settlement Agreement. That agreement was incorporated into a \u201cJudgment of Unlimited Separation\u201d in the Oregon Circuit Court on January 18,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-17\">\u00b69 From June 1994 until July 1995, the parties attempted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>reconciliation with Eric moving to Montana in December 1994 to be near Pamela and the children. However, the reconciliation efforts proved fruitless and Pamela filed a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage in the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District, Carbon County, Montana, on July 24, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b610 On August 22, 1996, Eric, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed his \u201cAmended Motion to Reopen Case and Amended Motion to Give Full Custody of Parties Minor Children to Father\u201d in the Oregon courts. Pamela responded with a Motion to Dismiss and on December 6, 1996, the Oregon court dismissed Eric\u2019s motion and awarded Pamela her attorney\u2019s fees. On January 13, 1997, Eric appealed to the Oregon Appellate Court. That court also ruled against Eric and awarded Pamela her attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b611 On January 31,1997, the Carbon County, Montana District Court entered a decree dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. This Final Decree of Dissolution incorporated the Marital Settlement Agreement entered into by the parties in December 1994, with some minor modifications as to visitation. Eric appealed to this Court on February 25,1997, but we affirmed the determination of the District Court in a noncitable opinion. <em>In re Marriage of Snow, </em>1998 MT 146N. Thereafter, Eric filed two Petitions for Rehearing, both of which we denied, whereupon Eric filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court in October 1998. Said petition was subsequently denied. <em>Snow v. Snow </em>(1999), 525 U.S. 1126, 119 S.Ct. 911, 142 L.Ed.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b612 From January 31,1997, onward, Eric filed dozens of motions with the District Court, most of which requested a change in visitation. On December 28, 1998, the District Court issued an \u201cOrder re Contempt, Order Implementing Stipulation and Order of Protection.\u201d In that order, the court granted Pamela\u2019s Motion for Contempt and levied a fine against Eric. The court also issued an order permanently restraining Eric from coming within five miles of Pamela\u2019s home or place of employment and from coming within 1500 feet of Pamela. Thereafter, Eric left Montana to return to Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b613 The parties\u2019 Final Decree of Dissolution provides one visitation schedule when the parties live more than 120 miles apart and another visitation schedule when the parties live less than 120 miles apart. On May 8, 2000, Eric sent a notice to the District Court that he intended to return to Montana to live by June 1, 2000. Eric also sent the court his \u201cProposed Residential Schedule\u201d wherein Eric attempted to revise the parties\u2019 parenting arrangement and the visitation schedules as set forth in the Final Decree of Dissolution. In his Proposed Residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Schedule, Eric asserted that the schedule would take effect on June 9, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b614 Eric alleges that he also sent Pamela a copy of the new schedule and the notice of his intent to move. Pamela maintains, however, that she never received a copy of the notice or the schedule. Due to problems between the parties, Eric was to correspond with Pamela only through her attorney or a neutral third party. Any correspondence from Eric sent directly to Pamela was returned by her unopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b615 Eric subsequently sent Pamela\u2019s counsel a copy of the Proposed Residential Schedule which counsel received on June 26, 2000. Eric informed counsel that under the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA, since Pamela did not respond to Eric\u2019s Proposed Residential Schedule within 30 days, the District Court was required by law to adopt that schedule. Pamela\u2019s counsel responded that Eric was misinterpreting \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA, and that if Eric wanted to modify the current visitation schedule, he would have to go back to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b616 On July 21, 2000, the District Court issued an order wherein the court refused to adopt Eric\u2019s Proposed Residential Schedule. In that order, the court admonished Eric for attempting to modify the parties\u2019 parenting arrangement without adequate knowledge of the law and the appropriate procedure to address such issues. In response, Eric requested an immediate telephone hearing on the matter. Said hearing took place on July 27,2000, at which time the District Court informed Eric that he would have to adhere to the visitation schedule as set forth in the parties\u2019 Final Decree of Dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b617 On November 27, 2000, Eric filed a Motion for Modification in which he again requested that the court adopt his Proposed Residential Schedule and a Motion for Summary Judgment of the Motion for Modification in which he maintained that since Pamela did not respond to his Proposed Residential Schedule within 30 days, he was entitled to have the court adopt his proposed schedule. In addition, on December 14, 2000, Eric filed a Motion for Default Judgment requesting that the District Court enter an order of default against Pamela because Pamela did not respond to his other motions within 14 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b618 Thereafter, additional motions and responses were filed by both parties until, finally, on February 13, 2001, the District Court issued an order denying Eric\u2019s motions for modification, for summary judgment, and for a default judgment and reaffirming the court\u2019s prior determination that the visitation schedule as set forth in the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Final Decree of Dissolution adequately and appropriately provided for parenting opportunities between the parties when they reside within 120 miles of each other and when they reside further than 120 miles from each other. The court further determined that Eric\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA, is misplaced in view of \u201cthe reality that [Eric\u2019s] return to Montana actually places him closer to his children, not further away\u201d and that \u201c[t]he current visitation schedule already addresses parenting issues arising from relocation of the parties\u2019 place of residence.\u201d Consequently, finding that Eric failed to present evidence showing adequate cause for modification based on the best interests of the children standard, the court denied Eric\u2019s motions. It is from this order that Eric appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b619 <em>Has Eric properly appealed the District Court\u2019s order ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b620 Pamela argues on appeal that Eric failed to properly file his Appellant\u2019s Brief in violation of Rule 23, M.R.App.P., thus his appeal should be summarily dismissed. Pamela alleges that Eric violated Rule 23(a)(1), M.R.App.P., by not properly citing his authorities; Rule 23(a)(2), M.R.App.P., by not properly setting forth the issues presented for review; Rule 23(a)(3), M.R.App.P., by not filing a proper statement of the case or a proper statement of the facts; Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., by not preceding his argument with a properly drafted summary; and Rule 23(a)(5), M.R.App.P., by not providing a conclusion stating the precise relief sought. Many of Pamela\u2019s arguments in this regard are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b621 First, Rule 23(a)(1), M.R.App.P., requires that all briefs contain \u201c[a] table of contents, with page references, and a table of cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes and other authorities cited, with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited.\u201d The error Pamela complains of here is that Eric failed to properly cite the United States Supreme Court case of <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49, \u201cso that it may be reviewed as to its applicability.\u201d In this regard, Eric refers to it as a \u201cSupreme Court of Washington\u201d case rather than a case from the Supreme Court of the United States, thus hindering Pamela in her attempts to review the case for its applicability to the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b622 Second, Pamela argues that Eric violated Rule 23(a)(2), M.R.App.P., by not properly setting forth the issues presented for review. Eric lists six issues in his brief on appeal, but he fails to argue all but his first issue. Even so, Eric\u2019s first issue is almost unintelligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and creates a disadvantage for Pamela by not setting forth a clear statement of what Eric is attempting to argue and what Pamela needs to address in her response brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b623 Third, Pamela argues that Eric violated Rule 23(a)(3), M.R.App.P., by not filing a proper Statement of the Case or a proper Statement of the Facts. Rule 23(a)(3), M.R.App.P., requires that the Statement of the Case \u201cshall first indicate briefly the nature of the case and its disposition in the court below.\u201d Pamela is correct that Eric fails to set forth the nature of the case-i.e., that this is a case involving visitation. However, Eric does manage to indicate the disposition of the case in the court below-i.e., \u201cthe Court issued an Order... denying the Motion for Modification and the Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d regarding Eric\u2019s Proposed Residential Schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b624 In addition, Rule 23(a)(3), M.R.App.P., requires that, after the Statement of the Case, \u201c[t]here shall follow a statement of the facts relevant to the issues presented for review, with references to the pages of the parts of the record at which material facts appear.\u201d Eric asserts in the beginning of his Statement of Facts: \u201cIn accordance with Rule 23(e), References to Record: No transcript or record exist.\u201d While Eric may be correct that no transcript pertinent to this case exists, there is a substantial record consisting of five folders from the District Court. Eric should have referenced the documents within this District Court file in presenting his Statement of Facts to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b625 Fourth, Pamela argues that Eric violated Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., by not preceding his argument with a properly drafted summary. While this rule does require that the argument be <em>preceded </em>by a summary, we have not in the past faulted someone, particularly not an individual acting <em>pro se, </em>for placing the summary at the end of the argument as Eric did here. Also, while Eric\u2019s summary is not a model of clarity, it does set forth an \u201caccurate statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief\u2019 as required by the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b626 Fifth, Pamela argues that Eric violated Rule 23(a)(5), M.R.App.P., by not providing a \u201cconclusion stating the precise relief sought.\u201d Contrary to Pamela\u2019s contention, Eric does ask in his conclusion that we \u201coverturn the lower Court\u2019s rulings and adopt the Proposed Residential Schedule.\u201d While this statement comes at the end of a wordy discourse about the policy behind \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA, and the Legislature\u2019s intentions in enacting it, nevertheless, Eric has complied with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b627 Finally, although Pamela does not list this as one of Eric\u2019s violations of Rule 23, M.R.App.P., in filing his appeal with this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>it is actually the most egregious violation of the rules committed by Eric. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., provides that \u201c[t]he argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d In five of the issues presented by Eric, he sets forth little or no argument and no citations in support of his argument. Instead, after setting forth the issue, Eric merely states: \u201cThis issue is presented at face value to the court without argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b628  In order for Eric to properly raise an issue in his opening brief, he must list his contentions with respect to the issues presented and the reasons therefor with citation to the authorities relied on. This Court has repeatedly held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>In re Custody of Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6 32, 304 Mont. 202, \u00b6 32, 19 P.3d 811, \u00b6 32 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Pfennigs, </em>1999 MT 250, \u00b6 32, 296 Mont. 242, \u00b6 32, 989 P.2d 327, \u00b6 32). \u201c[I]t is not this Court\u2019s obligation to conduct legal research on appellant\u2019s behalf, to guess as to his precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to his position.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b629 Accordingly, we dismiss Eric\u2019s appeal for failing to comply with the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b630 <em>Should Pamela be awarded her attorney\u2019s fees because of a frivolous appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b631 Pamela requests that we award her her attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., based upon Eric\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s order \u201cwithout substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d As a general rule, this Court will not impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 32, M.R.App.P., unless the appeal is entirely unfounded and intended to cause delay or unless counsel\u2019s actions otherwise constitute an abuse of the judicial system. <em>In re Marriage of Moss, </em>1999 MT 62, \u00b6 41, 293 Mont. 500, \u00b6 41, 977 P.2d 322, \u00b6 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u00b632  In this case, we hold that Eric\u2019s appeal was taken without substantial and reasonable grounds, was entirely unfounded, and was intended to cause delay. The District Court has repeatedly ruled on visitation in this case determining that the visitation schedule as set forth in the parties\u2019 Final Decree of Dissolution adequately and appropriately provides for parenting opportunities between the parties. Eric continually files motions in the District Court and appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to this Court attempting to modify visitation. In the appeal presently before us, Eric fails to properly present evidence or authority that the District Court erred in refusing to modify visitation. Moreover, he has filed briefs on appeal that do not comply with the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure and that Pamela cannot intelligently respond to. Accordingly, we award Pamela her attorney\u2019s fees and costs for having to respond to this frivolous appeal. <em>See Thomas v. Hale </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 64, 68-69, 802 P.2d 1255, 1258; <em>In re Marriage of West </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 47, 53, 758 P.2d 282, 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b633 We dismiss this case and we remand to the District Court for a determination of Pamela\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
