Fliehler then filed a Petition for Trial in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (the \u201cWCC\u201d). The WCC found that Fliehler was entitled to compensation benefits and costs from the UEF. The UEF filed this appeal and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b63 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that Fliehler was an \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA (1997)?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\u00b64 Greg Casey owns a business named The Restaurant Installation Company, which installs restaurant kitchens. On April 23, 1999, Fliehler suffered an injury when he fell off a ladder during his employment with Casey. The accident took place at a job site in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u00b65 Since 1997, Casey has resided in a home outside Big Fork, Montana. His work crew, including Fliehler, also reside in the Big Fork area. Because Casey considered the members of his work crew to be independent contractors, he did not maintain workers\u2019 compensation coverage for his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u00b66 Typically, when a restaurant designer notified Casey that a job was available, Casey would gather his crew and drive to the site. This normally involved an initial departure from the Big Fork area. Occasionally, however, Casey and his crew would travel from one out-of-state job site to the next. They would travel together in a pickup truck owned by Casey. The truck is also where they permanently kept all of the tools necessary for their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">\u00b67 In the two years before Fliehler\u2019s injury, Casey installed kitchens primarily for three restaurant chains: Marie Callender\u2019s, East Side Mario\u2019s and McGrath\u2019s Fish House. Casey\u2019s work projects took place in several western states, including Idaho, Oregon, Washington, California, Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma. He never undertook any projects in Montana, and he testified that the majority of his jobs were in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\u00b68 Fliehler filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the UEF, which denied coverage because of a lack of medical information. Fliehler then filed a Petition for Trial in the WCC. While Fliehler was able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>provide medical information establishing that he was injured, the UEF countered that Montana law did not govern Fhehler. Specifically, the UEF argued that Fhehler was not an \u201cemployee or worker in this state,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b69 The WCC concluded that Fhehler was an employee of Casey, rather than an independent contractor. The WCC further concluded that Fhehler was an \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d and thus entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and costs from the UEF. The UEF then sought to amend the WCC\u2019s findings and conclusions through a post-trial motion. The WCC denied the UEF\u2019s motion and issued its \u201cOrder Amending Findings of Fact.\u201d The UEF then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b610 Because the parties do not dispute the relevant facts, this appeal presents only a question of law. We review a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>See Russette v. Chippewa Cree Hous. Auth. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 90, 91-92, 874 P.2d 1217, 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b611 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that Fhehler was an \u201cemployee or worker in this state\u201d as defined by \u00a7 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA (1997)?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u00b612 The UEF argues that the WCC erred in concluding that the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) applied to Fhehler. In deciding that the Act did apply to Fhehler, the WCC had to determine whether Fliehler\u2019s \u201cemployment duties\u201d were \u201cprimarily carried out or controlled within this state.\u201d Section 39-71-118(10)(a), MCA (1997). While the parties agreed that Fhehler primarily performed his employment duties outside Montana, they disputed where Casey \u201cprimarily controlled\u201d these duties. The WCC ultimately concluded that Casey primarily controlled Fliehler\u2019s employment duties within Montana. The UEF now argues that the WCC improperly interpreted the term \u201cprimarily controlled\u201d in reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b613 Statutory interpretation is a \u201cholistic endeavor\u201d that must consider the statute\u2019s text, language, structure, and object. <em>See S.L.H. v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 16, 303 Mont. 364, \u00b6 16, 15 P.3d 948, \u00b6 16 (citing <em>United States Nat\u2019l Bank v. Independent Ins. Agents of Am., Inc. </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S. Ct. 2173, 2182, 124 L. Ed. 2d 402, 418 (quotations omitted)). When construing a statute, our goal is to ascertain and give effect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>legislative intent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-102, MCA; S.L.H., \u00b6 16. If the words of the statute are clear and plain, we discern the intent of the legislature from the text of the statute. <em>See S.L.H., </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Western Energy Co. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 289, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 55, \u00b6 11, 990 P.2d 767, \u00b6 11. We will also read and construe the statute as a whole to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to a statute\u2019s purpose. <em>See S.L.H., </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Skinner Enters. v. Lewis &amp; Clark County Bd. of Health </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 256, 276, 950 P.2d 733, 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b614 The UEF urges us to interpret \u201cprimarily controlled\u201d as the location where Casey performed most of the day-to-day management of his employees. The parties agree that Fliehler conducted his \u201cemployment duties,\u201d namely the carpentry and metalworking activities involved in installing kitchens, outside Montana. Casey\u2019s day-to-day management of these activities, according to the UEF, took place outside Montana. For these reasons, the UEF argues that Casey\u2019s primary control of Fliehler\u2019s employment duties necessarily took place outside Montana. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b615 Although Casey\u2019s management of Fliehler\u2019s day-to-day kitchen installation duties may have taken place outside Montana, Casey also controlled Fliehler\u2019s employment activities within Montana. Casey\u2019s principal place of business was in Big Fork. While Casey performed no jobs in Montana, Montana was the state where he hired his crew, where they left for their jobs and where they returned to live between jobs. Casey also kept his truck and tools at his residence in Big Fork between jobs. Occasionally Casey would receive the plans for his next job at his home in Big Fork. In addition, Casey paid Fliehler in Montana the day after they returned from a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b616  As the WCC noted, \u201cthere was no singular point of control in the sense that all of [Fliehler\u2019s] duties were controlled from Montana, or that all of his duties were controlled at non-Montana job cites.\u201d When faced with multiple locations where Casey controlled Fliehler\u2019s employment duties, the WCC was correct in comparing all of Casey\u2019s activities at these various locations and concluding that the primary, principal and ultimate control over Fliehler\u2019s work took place in Montana. For these reasons, we conclude that the WCC was correct in concluding that Casey primarily controlled Fliehler\u2019s employment duties in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
