We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">\u00b62 The issues are whether the District Court made the necessary findings, whether the findings made are clearly erroneous and whether the court abused its discretion in modifying the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">\u00b63 Jack and Kelly\u2019s marriage was dissolved in 1998, at which time both Jack and Kelly resided in Eureka, Montana. After a contested custody hearing, the District Court stated concerns with regard to both parents, but also found that \u201c[d]espite his flaws, Jack puts his children first.\u201d It adopted a parenting plan awarding the parties joint custody of their three preteenage children, with Jack designated as the primary residential custodian, and Kelly having visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">\u00b64 The District Court amended the parenting plan at Jack\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>in March of2000, after Kelly relocated to the state of Washington. The amended parenting plan addressed visitation arrangements in view of the increased distance between the parents\u2019 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b65 In May of 2001, Kelly moved the District Court to modify the parenting plan again and to designate her as the children\u2019s residential parent. In support of her motion, she filed an affidavit stating that, for the preceding 20 months, the children had been living with Jack\u2019s parents in Eureka while Jack worked long hours out of town as a logger. She stated Jack returned to Eureka primarily on weekends, spending very little time with the children and leaving their care to his parents. She further averred that she had visited the children for 5 to 7 days every two months or so over the past two years, contacted them by telephone at least twice a week, and had them with her in Washington during the summer months. She alleged the children\u2019s home environment in Eureka was both verbally and physically abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b66 The District Court held a hearing on Kelly\u2019s motion to modify at which it heard testimony from Jack, Kelly and numerous other witnesses, and received a number of exhibits into evidence. Kelly presented evidence which supported the statements in her affidavit. Jack presented evidence that the children were content and well-cared-for in his parents\u2019 household. He also argued Kelly was not a suitable custodial parent because she smoked cigarettes, had corporally punished the children, and was cohabitating with a man with whom she had a new baby and whose two children from a previous marriage also would be included in their household.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b67 In detailed findings and conclusions, the District Court determined Jack had basically turned the children over to his parents to raise and had not continued to \u201cput the children first.\u201d The court found that, even when Jack was in town and not working, such as during the six to eight weeks of \u201cspring breakup\u201d each year, the children continued to live with his parents. The court found Kelly had made significant strides to straighten out her life and had continued to demonstrate \u201ca fairly remarkable devotion to the children under fairly difficult circumstances.\u201d Ultimately, the District Court found the children\u2019s best interests would be served by granting Kelly\u2019s motion to modify and designating her as the residential parent. Jack appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court make the necessary findings, are the findings made clearly erroneous and did the court abuse its discretion in modifying the parenting plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u00b69 A district court may amend a parenting plan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Section 40-4-219(1), M[CA. Jack contends the court failed to make a finding regarding a change in circumstances, the change in circumstances which existed was not based on \u201cnew\u201d facts, and the court erred in finding the change was necessary to serve the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b610 Jack argues first that the District Court failed to make the finding regarding a change in the children\u2019s circumstances required by \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, however, the District Court expressly found that its 1998 Parenting Plan placed the children\u2019s legal residence \u201cwith Jack at his residence in/near Eureka, Montana.\u201d It further found that, soon after the Parenting Plan was entered, Jack moved the children into his parents\u2019 home. Finally, the District Court found that, at the time the original Parenting Plan was modified in 2000 at Jack\u2019s request, it was not aware that the children already had been moved into Jack\u2019s parents\u2019 home. In this latter regard, Jack concedes on appeal that he did not apprise the court of that fact during the modification proceeding in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s unchallenged findings state, as matters of fact, that Jack moved the children\u2019s residence after the original parenting plan and that it was not aware of that move at any time prior to Kelly\u2019s motion to modify in 2001. While lacking the statutory \u201cchange in circumstances\u201d language, we conclude the District Court\u2019s findings clearly state the component parts of a change in circumstances finding-namely, facts arising after the 1998 plan and unknown to the court at the time of the amendment of the plan in 2000- required by \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. Moreover, Jack cites to no authority-and we know of none-rendering a court\u2019s failure to use the actual \u201cchange in circumstances\u201d language of the statute reversible error. An express finding using the statutory language certainly is preferable. However, we have held that a court\u2019s failure to specifically use those words in findings which otherwise imply a finding of change in circumstances was, at most, harmless error. <em>See In re Custody of </em>Arneson-Nelson, 2001 MT 242, \u00b6 30, 307 Mont. 60, \u00b6 30, 36 P.3d 874, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u00b612 Jack also asserts that, because Kelly failed to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>arrangement-of which, she was aware-during his modification proceeding in 2000, the District Court erred in considering the placement of the children with his parents as the basis for the change in circumstances. The District Court stated, however, that even <em>if Kelly </em>were aware of the arrangement between Jack and his parents at the time of the modification in 2000, <em>it </em>was not aware of the children\u2019s placement with Jack\u2019s parents at that time. As a result, the court properly ruled that the this modification pursuant to Kelly\u2019s motion was permissible under the portion of \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, which allows modification on a finding of changed circumstances based on facts \u201cunknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b613 Jack also relies on several of our cases for the proposition that a default judgment precludes relitigation of custody proceedings which do not meet the threshold change of circumstances requirement of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. His interpretation of the cases is correct, but the cases do not help him here.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b614 By its terms, the change in circumstances requirement contained in \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, applies to modifications of all parenting plans. Our cases merely recognize that, even if the original plan and decree were entered by default, a showing of substantial change in the child\u2019s circumstances is required to meet the statutory requirements for modification. <em>See In re Marriage of Hay </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 372, 376-77, 786 P.2d 1195, 1198; <em>In re Custody of Andre </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 80, 85, 761 P.2d 809, 812; <em>Svennungsen v. Svennungsen </em>(1974), 165 Mont. 161, 166, 527 P.2d 640, 643. In other words, even where an original decree is uncontested, the defaulting parent must satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, for a modification. Thus, the issue is not whether the original or 2000 modification was contested. The issue is whether, in the present case, Kelly met the change of circumstances requirement. As discussed above, that requirement is met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b6 15 Jack next makes a number of assertions relating to findings of fact made by the District Court. Specifically, Jack objects to the court\u2019s findings reprimanding him for hitting the children with a piece of kindling and for leaving the children in his parents\u2019 care.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u00b616  Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces it that a mistake has been made. <em>In re Marriage of Johnson </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 158, 166-67, 879 P.2d 689, 694 (citations omitted). District court findings are presumed correct and the appellant has the burden of establishing error. <em>DeVoe v. State </em>(1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>281 Mont. 356, 363, 935 P.2d 256, 260 (citation omitted). Jack does not argue a lack of substantial evidence to support the above findings and has not established that the findings are otherwise clearly erroneous. \u00b617 Jack also contends the District Court erred by failing to make certain findings. He contends the court essentially condoned Kelly\u2019s admission that she had disciplined the children by hitting them with a belt and disregarded that she had established a new relationship with a man who had custody of his two children from a previous relationship and with whom she had a 19-month-old child, and that she planned to provide child care by hiring an unlicensed 23-year-old baby sitter -with two small children of her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b618 A court need not make findings on every piece of evidence, but only the essential and determining factors upon which its determination is based. <em>In re Marriage of Drake, </em>2002 MT 127, \u00b6 23, 310 Mont. 114, \u00b6 23, 49 P.3d 38, \u00b6 23 (citation omitted). The fact that the District Court made no findings on Kelly\u2019s discipline with a belt and her choice of babysitter is not dispositive. Moreover, the District Court addressed Kelly\u2019s relationship with her boyfriend, finding that \u201cKelly has a 19 month child with her boyfriend (whom she claims to be planning to marry), and she now has her boyfriend\u2019s two children to help raise.\u201d The court also stated it was impressed with Kelly\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s \u201cdevotion to Kelly and to her children.\u201d Thus, while the court found that some of Kelly\u2019s circumstances are \u201csomewhat troubling, the Court has no doubt that Kelly is prepared to provide the parental love and attention that Jack has seemed so reluctant to provide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b619  Jack also contends the District Court did not consider his evidence about the good care provided the children by his parents, thereby abusing its discretion. The record reflects otherwise. The court clearly considered Jack\u2019s evidence. It found that, \u201c[e]ven if Jack\u2019s parents are providing a good home for the children, Kelly\u2019s rights cannot be subjugated to those of the grandparents.\u201d The court was correct. A modification of a parenting plan is based on the best interests of the children with regard to the respective parents. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. In unchallenged findings, the District Court found that Jack has been an indifferent parent, is not adequately committed to his children and, basically, has abandoned the children. In light of these findings, Jack\u2019s contentions regarding the quality of care his parents provide are of little relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b620 Jack\u2019s final argument relates to whether the District Court demonstrated sufficient consideration of the best interest of the child factors set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and 40-4-219, MCA. In ruling on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>motion to modify a parenting plan, the court may consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, in addition to considering \u201call relevant parenting factors\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-212(1), MCA. The district court need not make a specific finding on each statutory factor, but must show that it considered each element by making specific findings regarding the best interests of the children. <em>In re Marriage of Arrotta </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 508, 513, 797 P.2d 940, 943 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b621 Jack is correct in pointing out that the District Court did not expressly address in its findings such statutory factors as the wishes of the children; the interaction and interrelationship of the children with their paternal grandparents and cousins; the children\u2019s adjustment to home, school and community; or continuity of care. He is not correct that the court failed to <em>consider </em>those factors and his evidence relating thereto. Indeed, the District Court stated it had considered the \u201cbest interest\u201d factors set forth at \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and 40-4-219, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b622 Jack also contends the court did not address the physical health of the individuals involved and, specifically, the daughter\u2019s asthma in relation to her mother\u2019s and mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s smoking or whether one parent knowingly failed to financially support the children. However, the court found Kelly\u2019s testimony that she does not smoke in the house convincing. It further found that, while Kelly is not entirely current on her share of the children\u2019s medical and dental bills, that failure is largely attributable to factors other than a knowing or willful failure to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b623 The District Court also made findings in addition to those discussed previously. It found that \u201c[t]he bottom line is that for the past 2% years the children have been farmed out to their grandparents while Jack has shown a lack of commitment to the children. At the same time, Kelly has made significant strides in her own life and has consistently shown that she is devoted to her children.\u201d Furthermore, after considering the other statutory factors relating to the children\u2019s best interests, the court stated that \u201cnone of the factors identified in those statutes, alone or taken together, outweigh the fact in this case that Jack has basically abandoned his children, and Kelly stands willing and able to provide a good home for the children.\u201d Jack does not address these findings and we conclude they are supported by substantial evidence and are not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b624  Atrial court\u2019s modification of custody or a parenting plan will be reversed only upon a showing of clear abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Marriage of Hunt </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 159, 164, 870 P.2d 720, 723. An abuse of discretion occurs only when the court \u201cacted arbitrarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Meeks </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 237, 242, 915 P.2d 831, 834 (citation omitted). Based on the record before us, it cannot be said that the court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
