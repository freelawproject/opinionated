Although the State had petitioned for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights, following the evidentiary hearing, the District Court did not proceed on the issue of termination, but rather entered an order adjudicating L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. as youths in need of care and granting the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) temporary legal custody for six months. The court also granted DPHHS the authority to forego reunification efforts with Donald. On appeal, Donald contends he did not receive proper notice of the proceedings prior to the filing of the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights with Right to Consent to Adoption (hereinafter, Petition for Permanent Legal Custody) and alleges the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and the District Court\u2019s order granting DPHHS temporary legal custody did not meet statutory notice requirements. Donald also contends the District Court failed to conduct a timely show cause hearing following the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and appeals the District Court\u2019s order authorizing DPHHS to forego reunification efforts with him, arguing that the court failed to make sufficient findings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u00b62 Donald presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">1. Whether failure to personally serve the father, who was incarcerated in another state, with notice of proceedings prior to filing a petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights constitutes reversible error;</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">2. Whether the petition for permanent legal custody and subsequent order granting temporary legal custody, contained the required statutory notices;</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">3. Whether the District Court failed to conduct a timely show cause hearing; and</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">4. Whether the District Court erred when it granted the State\u2019s request for determination that preservation or reunification services for the father were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u00b63 Following reports of abuse and neglect, the State filed a Petition for Temporary Investigative Authority (TIA) and Protective Services on November 17,2000, and L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. were removed from their mother\u2019s home. L.M.A.T. (now 5 years old) and B.L.F.T. (nearly 3 years old) remain in foster care where they have been since December of 2000. Throughout these proceedings, Donald has been incarcerated in Washington State, having been found guilty on March 2, 2000, of the attempted rape of a child in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">\u00b64 On November 21,2000, a Summons and Order to Show Cause and a copy of the November 17, 2000 Petition for TIA were served on Donald by mail at a corrections facility in Airway Heights, Washington. Following a show cause hearing on December 4, 2000, during which the children\u2019s mother, Catherine, did not oppose the TIA petition, the District Court entered an order granting TIA to DPHHS for 90 days. The accompanying Certificate of Service listed Donald\u2019s address as \u201cunknown,\u201d and the record is not clear whether he received a copy of this December 6, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">\u00b65 Following a review hearing on February 26, 2001, the District Court continued the TIA for two weeks, and re-set the hearing for March 12,2001. A copy of the District Court order continuing the TLA was served on Donald by mail at a corrections facility in Aberdeen, Washington. On March 2, 2001, the State filed a Petition for Temporary Legal Custody. On that same day, Donald was served by mail at the Aberdeen facility with a Summons and Order to Show Cause for the March 12, 2001 hearing, and also copies of the Petition for Temporary Legal Custody and the proposed treatment plan for Catherine.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>\u00b66 After another continuance, the review hearing commenced on March 19, 2001, during which Catherine agreed to the Petition for Temporary Legal Custody and her treatment plan. On March 21,2001, the District Court entered an Order Granting Temporary Legal Custody to DPHHS for a six-month period. A Certificate of Service, dated March 26, 2001, indicates this order and a copy of Catherine\u2019s treatment plan were served on Donald by mail at his Aberdeen address.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b67 At a review hearing on September 17, 2001, the State requested a 90-day extension of temporary legal custody, since it intended to file for permanent legal custody. The District Court granted the extension and appointed indigent counsel for Catherine. On September 18,2001, the State filed the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody, and attached a copy of Donald\u2019s Judgment and Sentence and Warrant of Commitment from Washington. Also on September 18, 2001, Amy Guth, who had been acting as Guardian Ad Litem for L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. since November 20, 2000, filed a Motion to Appoint Counsel, requesting that she be appointed to represent Donald pursuant to the public defender contract. The District Court granted this motion the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b68 The District Court entered an order on September 19, 2001, granting continued temporary legal custody to DPHHS for a period of 90 days. This order was served on Donald by mail at his Aberdeen address. On that same day, the District Court also issued a Summons and Order to Show Cause relating to the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody, setting the hearing date for November 5, 2001. The Summons and Order to Show Cause was personally served on Donald at the Aberdeen correction facility on October 2, 2001. Donald\u2019s appointed counsel was served by mail with copies of the Summons and Order to Show Cause and the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody on September 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b69 During the show cause hearing on November 5, 2001, Catherine was prepared to relinquish her rights as to B.L.F.T., but wished to continue her treatment plan and possibly reunite with L.M.A.T. Donald\u2019s counsel also appeared, and represented that Donald contested termination of his parental rights as to both girls. Donald\u2019s counsel also informed the court that Donald would be incarcerated in Washington until 2004, at which time he would presumably be eligible for parole. On November 8,2001, the District Court granted continued temporary legal custody and scheduled the hearing on the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody for January 4, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b610 Catherine did not appear on January 4, 2002, so the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Court vacated the hearing date and continued temporary legal custody pending further adjudication of whether L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. were youths in need of care. At this time, a letter from Donald was filed with the court, wherein he expressed an interest in reuniting with his children upon release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b611 On January 24, 2002, the State filed a Request for Determination, asking the District Court to determine that preservation or reunification services need not be provided as they relate to Donald. The State based its request on Donald\u2019s conviction for attempted rape of a child in the second degree and his continued incarceration in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b612 The hearing on the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody was held on January 24, 2002. At the hearing, Donald\u2019s counsel objected to the proceedings as untimely. The court overruled the objection and upon the request of the State and in light of our recent decision, <em>In re T.C., </em>2001 MT 264, 307 Mont. 244, 37 P.3d 70 (district court improperly terminated parent\u2019s rights without first adjudicating whether children were youths in need of care), the hearing proceeded on allegations that the children were youths in need of care and request for temporary legal custody to DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b613 During the hearing, Beverly Miller (Miller), a social worker on the case, explained that DPHHS requested that it be excused from providing preservation or reunification services for Donald because B.L.F.T. had never seen Donald and Donald could not work on beginning a relationship with either child until he was released. Miller testified that Donald was convicted in Washington for attempted sexual intercourse with an unrelated thirteen year old. Miller told the court that Donald was sentenced to 89 months, and after credit for time served, he had 78 months (six years, six months) to serve beginning April 2000, and thus would not be discharged from his sentence until 2006. Miller also explained that if the children had to wait until Donald was available to begin parenting, the children\u2019s foster parents may not form necessary attachments, which would lead to less bonding for the children and a loss of trust. The court received copies of Donald\u2019s Washington Judgment and Sentence and Warrant of Commitment, which indicated he was arrested on June 4,1999 and convicted on March 2, 2000. Donald remains incarcerated in Washington, serving his sentence. Donald\u2019s counsel presented no evidence and at the end of the hearing, moved to dismiss on grounds of failure of proof. The court denied the motion</p>\n<p id=\"Anj\">\u00b614 On January 30, 2002, the District Court entered an Order Authorizing Department to Forego Reunification Efforts with Donald, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>noting that Donald\u2019s conviction of attempted rape of a child in the second degree was an \u201caggravated circumstance,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA (2001). The District Court also entered an order adjudicating L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. as youths in need of care and granting temporary legal custody to DPHHS for six months. It is from these two orders that Donald appeals. The children\u2019s mother has not appealed any of the protection proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b615 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See In re A.M., </em>2001 MT 60, \u00b6 33, 304 Mont. 379, \u00b6 33, 22 P.3d 185, \u00b6 33 (citing <em>In re J.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 11, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 11). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or, if after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re </em>A.M., \u00b6 33 (citation omitted). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>In reA.M., </em>\u00b6 33 (citation omitted). We review transfer of a child\u2019s custody from his or her parents to DPHHS for abuse of discretion since such a transfer of custody is dependent upon an initial discretionary determination that the child is abused or neglected. <em>See Matter of Custody of J.H., </em>1998 MT 128, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 111, \u00b6 15, 958 P.2d 1191, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Matter of C.M. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 183, 186, 932 P.2d 1063, 1065).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">DISCUSSION Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b616 Does failure to personally serve the father, who was incarcerated in another state, with notice of proceedings prior to filing a petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights constitute reversible error?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\u00b617 Donald argues that the State failed to properly serve him with notice of any of the proceedings prior to the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody, which was filed on September 18,2001, and served on his appointed counsel, September 19, 2001 (Donald was personally served on October 2, 2001, with the District Court\u2019s September 19, 2001 Summons and Order to Show Cause on the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody). Donald contends those previous proceedings were therefore void as applied to him because he received notice of those prior proceedings by mail, not by personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of his contention, Donald cites \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-422(4)-(7), MCA (2001)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. Section 41-3-401, MCA (1999), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">(3) A petition alleging abuse or neglect is a civil action brought in the name of the state of Montana. The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure apply except as modified in this part. Proceedings under a petition are not a bar to criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">(4) The parents or parent, guardian, or other person or agency having legal custody of the youth named in the petition, if residing in the state, must be served personally with a copy of the petition and summons at least 5 working days before the date set for hearing. If the person or agency cannot be served personally, the person or agency may be served by publication in the manner provided by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure for other types of proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b618  In interpreting a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of the words it contains. <em>City of Great Falls v. DPHHS, </em>2002 MT 108, \u00b6 16, 309 Mont. 467, \u00b6 16, 47 P.3d 836, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Section 41-3-401(4), MCA (1999) (now renumbered at \u00a7 41-3-422(6), MCA (2001)), provides that personal service is required for parents \u201cif residing in the state.\u201d At no time during these proceedings has Donald resided in Montana. Therefore, the State was not required under \u00a7 41-3-401(4), MCA (1999), to personally serve Donald in these proceedings. While these provisions do not specify what method of service is required for parents living outside the State, we conclude, and the State concedes, that when the whereabouts of parents or guardians having legal custody are known, the better practice is to personally serve them with a copy of all petitions in accordance with \u00a7 41-3-422, MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b619  While we stress the importance of proper notice in all child protection proceedings and recognize that Donald received personal service of these proceedings only once, that is not dispositive of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>issue before us. The District Court orders that Donald seeks to invalidate would include those orders granting and continuing the TIA and those orders granting and extending temporary legal custody to DPHHS. Although Catherine, who had physical custody of the children, disputed some of the factual allegations, she did not oppose the State\u2019s petition for TIA, and agreed to the petition for temporary legal custody and her treatment plan. At the September 17, 2001 hearing, Catherine did not object to the State\u2019s request to continue temporary legal custody, but stated she would contest termination of parental rights. Donald was incarcerated at all times during these proceedings. Therefore, it would have been impossible for him to exercise his legal custodial rights to parent L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. during this time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b620 Moreover, while the evidentiary hearing on January 24,2002, was initially set to consider the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights, the District Court did not make such a determination, but rather adjudicated the children as youths in need of care and granted DPHHS temporary legal custody for a six-month period. The court recognized our recent holding from <em>In re T, </em>C., where we held that a stipulation to temporary legal custody is not the equivalent of a stipulation that a child is a youth in need of care, and without such a specific adjudication, a district court cannot terminate parental rights. <em>See In re T.C., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Significantly, the District Court has not ordered termination of either parent\u2019s rights in any of these proceedings. The court scheduled a hearing on the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and Termination of Parental Rights for July 16, 2002. The court also set a permanency hearing for February 22, 2002, in light of its determination that DPHHS could forego reunification efforts with Donald. However, this hearing date has since been vacated by the District Court, since it was divested of jurisdiction upon Donald\u2019s appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b621  This Court has repeatedly stated that \u201cno civil case shall be reversed by reason of error which would have no significant impact upon the result; if there is no showing of substantial injustice, the error is harmless.\u201d <em>In re J.M., </em>2001 MT 51, \u00b6 16, 304 Mont. 303, \u00b6 16, 21 P.3d 618, \u00b616 (citing <em>In re A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 55, 298 Mont. 237, \u00b6 55, 995 P.2d 427, \u00b6 55). We conclude that Donald failed to demonstrate how personal service of the proceedings prior to the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody would have significantly impacted these proceedings. Nor has Donald shown that invalidation of any of the proceedings would have a significant impact on his parental rights, since none of the proceedings prior to the .State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Petition for Permanent Legal Custody sought to terminate Donald\u2019s parental rights, and neither parent\u2019s rights have been terminated by the. District Court. Moreover, formal adjudication of the children as youths in need of care did not occur until January of 2002, at which time Donald had been personally served and was represented by counsel. Accordingly, we conclude that failure to personally serve Donald notice of those proceedings prior to filing the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b622 Did the petition for permanent legal custody and subsequent order granting temporary legal custody, contain the required statutory notices?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b623 Donald argues that because the State\u2019s Petition for Permanent Legal Custody and the District Court\u2019s January 30,2002 orders did not contain the notices mandated by \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-422(13) and (14), MCA (2001), they are invalid and cannot be enforced. Subsection (13) requires DPHHS, when serving a petition in an abuse and neglect proceeding, to advise parents or legal guardians of their right to counsel and right to contest the allegations, as well as the required timeliness for hearings. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-422(13), MCA (2001). Similarly, when a District Court issues an order in an abuse and neglect proceeding, it is required to include notice concerning statutory requirements for timeliness of hearings, presumptions of the best interests of the child, and that completion of a treatment plan does not guarantee return of a child. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-422(14), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b624 However, these subsections were not applicable to the child protection proceedings concerning L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. When the 2001 Legislature added subsections (13) and (14) to \u00a7 41-3-422, MCA, it provided the following savings clause: \u201cThis act does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, or <em>proceedings that were begun before </em>the effective date of this act.\u201d <em>See </em>2001 Mont. Laws Ch. 281, Sec. 19. The Compiler\u2019s Comments for \u00a7 41-3-422, MCA (2001), indicate the effective date of the Chapter 281 Amendments was October 1, 2001. Therefore, because the child protection proceedings for L.M.A.T. and B.L.F.T. were initiated by the State\u2019s Petition for TLA and Protective Services on November 17, 2000, \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-422(13) and (14), MCA (2001), were not applicable. Accordingly, neither the State nor the District Court committed reversible error by omitting the notice provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b625 Did the District Court fail to conduct a timely show cause hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b626 Donald argues that under \u00a7 41-3-432, MCA (2001), the District Court was required to conduct a show cause hearing within ten days of September 18, 2001, the day the State filed its Petition for Permanent Legal Custody. Section 41-3-432(l)(a), MCA (2001), provides that \u201c[a] show cause hearing must be conducted within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, of the filing of an initial child abuse and neglect petition unless otherwise stipulated by the parties pursuant to 41-3-434 or unless an extension of time is granted by the court.\u201d Donald contends that, since the District Court\u2019s Summons and Order to Show Cause on the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody was the first document personally served on him, the petition qualified as the \u201cinitial\u201d pleading as contemplated by the statute, and thus he argues the court\u2019s hearing on November 5,2001, was held well past the ten-day requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b627 We conclude that the petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights did not constitute an \u201cinitial\u201d filing. Here, the initial filing was the State\u2019s Petition for TIA and Protective Services, filed on November 17, 2000. Accordingly, \u00a7 41-3-403(l)(c), MCA (1999), applied. It provides that upon the filing of a petition for temporary investigative authority and protective services, the court must conduct a show cause hearing within twenty days of issuing an order granting relief as required for the immediate protection of a child. Section 41-3-403(l)(c), MCA (1999). Following the State\u2019s petition for TIA and protective services, the District Court conducted a show cause hearing on December 4, 2000, which fell within the twenty-day requirement mandated by \u00a7 41-3-403(l)(c), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"AGq\">\u00b628 Moreover, the statute Donald relies on, \u00a7 41-3-432, MCA (2001), became effective on October 1,2001. <em>See </em>Compiler\u2019s Comments, \u00a7 41-3-432, MCA (2001). Therefore, even if we accept Donald\u2019s argument that the Petition for Permanent Legal Custody was the \u201cinitial\u201d filing, \u00a7 41-3-432, MCA (2001), would not apply, since it was not in effect when the State filed the petition on September 18, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b629  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court did not fail to conduct a timely show cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\u00b630 Did. the District Court err when it granted the State\u2019s request for determination that preservation or reunification services for the father were unnecessary?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b631 Generally, DPHHS must make reasonable efforts to reunite a family after the children have been removed from the home. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA (2001) (formerly \u00a7 41-3-403(2), MCA (1999)). However, a district court \u201cmay make a finding that [DPHHS] need not make reasonable efforts to provide preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has subjected a child to aggravated circumstances, including but not limited to abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse or chronic, severe neglect of a child.\u201d Section 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA (2001) (formerly \u00a7 41-3-403(2)(a), MCA (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b632 In 2001, the Legislature added that a court\u2019s \u201cfinding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to this section must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>2001 Mont. Laws Ch. 281, Sec. 8, adding \u00a7 41-3-423(4), MCA (2001). However, like \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-422(13) and (14), MCA (2001), (See \u00b6 24 herein), this amendment did not affect rights and duties related to proceedings that began prior to the October 1, 2001 effective date, and therefore would not apply in these child protection proceedings. While \u00a7 41-3-403(2), MCA (1999), allowed a district court to make a finding regarding the necessity of preservation and reunification efforts, it did not provide any guidance as to the State\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b633 It is well-established that a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of his child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>See In re A.C., </em>2001 MT 126, \u00b6 20, 305 Mont. 404, \u00b6 20, 27 P.3d 960, \u00b6 20 (citations omitted). Accordingly, in regard to the statutorily-required findings supporting termination of parental rights, we have stated that the burden is on the party seeking termination to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that every requirement set forth in the statute has been satisfied. <em>In reA.C., </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). While we recognize that in these proceedings neither parent\u2019s rights have been terminated, we conclude that because a court\u2019s determination that reunification services are not required may necessarily impact termination of a parent\u2019s rights, the district court\u2019s findings under \u00a7 41-3-403(2), MCA (1999), must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. In cases involving the termination of parental rights,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">clear and convincing proof is simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>convincing, is somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure-that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 32, 307 Mont. 328, \u00b6 32, 37 P.3d 690, \u00b6 32 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b634 We have recently clarified that when reviewing a district court\u2019s findings in a termination of parental rights case, even for clear and convincing evidence, the applicable standard of review remains the same; \u201c[t]his Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings that the statutory criteria supporting termination are met to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous-that is, whether they are supported by substantial evidence, whether the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or whether this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake.\u201d <em>In reA.C., </em>\u00b6 36 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b635 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s finding that DPHHS was not required to provide reunification services was supported by substantial and uncontroverted evidence. At the evidentiary hearing on January 24,2002, the District Court admitted copies of Donald\u2019s Judgment and Sentence and Warrant of Commitment from Washington State, which provided clear and convincing evidence that Donald was convicted of attempted rape of a child in the second degree and was sentenced to a term of 89 months, with credit for time served. Without objection, the court heard testimony from Miller that Donald\u2019s conviction was a result of him attempting to have sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old, and that he was not related to the victim. Miller also explained that waiting for Donald to discharge his sentence would negatively affect the required bonding the children needed. Donald did not present any evidence rebutting the assertions by Miller, nor did he assert that his Washington conviction was invalid or not yet final.</p>\n<p id=\"Acv\">\u00b636 Contrary to Donald\u2019s contentions, the State was not required to present evidence as to the finality of his conviction. In criminal appeals, we have consistently held that \u201cprior convictions are presumptively valid, and a defendant who challenges the validity of his prior conviction during a collateral attack has the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 188, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 243, \u00b6 20, 32 P.3d 750, \u00b6 20 (citing <em>State v. Okland </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 10, 18, 941 P.2d. 431, 436) (lack of direct evidence as to a conviction\u2019s validity is not sufficient to shift the burden to the State to prove validity). Nor was the State required to present evidence concerning the circumstances of the conviction. The plain language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00a7 41-3-403(2)(a), MCA (1999), allows a court to conclude preservation or reunification services are not required if it finds one of the criteria is met. Here, the court made the necessary finding that Donald\u2019s conviction of attempted rape of a child in the second degree qualified as \u201csubjecting] a child to aggravated circumstances.\u201d Section 41-3-403(2), MCA (1999), includes \u201csexual abuse\u201d of a child as an example of \u201caggravated circumstances.\u201d We conclude that a conviction for attempted rape of a child met this definition, and the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b637  Accordingly, we conclude the District Court did not err when it granted the State\u2019s request for determination that preservation or reunification services for Donald were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b638 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b460-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\"> Tn his reply brief, Donald asserts for the first time on appeal that the District Court did not have jurisdiction over Donald until he was personally served on October 2, 2001. We will not address an issue raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 28, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 28, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 28 (citations omitted); and Rule 23(c), M.R.App.P.
