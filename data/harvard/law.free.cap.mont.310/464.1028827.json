We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b62 Claudia raises four issues on appeal. However, because we find the following issue dispositive, we do not address the other issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to BCP?</p>\n<p id=\"ADU\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b64 Randolph and Claudia Garland were married and have two children. In April 1997, Randolph moved out of the family home. In May 1997, Claudia filed a petition for divorce and on May 30,1997, the District Court issued a restraining order forbidding Randolph from coming within 500 feet of the family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b65 Randolph received medical services from Kalispell Regional Medical Center (KRMC) in May and June of 1997. Randolph died on June 16, 1997. After his death, KRMC assigned the debt for Randolph\u2019s medical services to BCP for purposes of collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u00b66 Claudia served as personal representative of Randolph\u2019s estate and claimed the family allowance as his surviving spouse. The only asset of the estate was a boat that Randolph had taken in payment for constructing a storage unit. Claudia sold the boat for approximately $7,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u00b67 BCP filed this action against Claudia to recover the cost of Randolph\u2019s medical services. Claudia filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b), M.R.Civ.P., and the court held a hearing on the matter. At the hearing, the District Court informed the parties that it would treat the motion as one for summary judgment. Supplemental briefs were submitted after the hearing, and the court issued an order granting BCP summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b68 Claudia then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, and the District Court denied that motion. Claudia now appeals the court\u2019s summary judgment order as well as its denial of her motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b69 We review a summary judgment order <em>de novo </em>based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Thomas v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 343, \u00b6 14, 292 Mont. 357, \u00b6 14, 973 P.2d 804, \u00b6 14. Summary judgment is proper if, \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b610 Generally, a spouse is not liable for debts incurred by the other spouse. Section 40-2-106, MCA. However, \u201cexpenses for necessaries of the family ... are chargeable upon the property of both husband and wife.\u201d Section 40-2-106, MCA. \u201cNecessary articles\u201d is broadly defined to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">all such goods and services as are reasonably required to provide for the health, welfare, comfort, and education of the married person, his spouse, and minor children, taking into consideration the earnings, resources, and general standard of living of such persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Section 40-2-210, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b611 When interpreting this statutory definition, this Court has also considered Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition that necessaries include \u201cthings indispensable, or things proper and useful, for the sustenance of human life.\u201d <em>Missoula </em>YWCA <em>v. Bard, </em>1999 MT 177, \u00b6 14, 295 Mont. 260, \u00b6 14, 983 P.2d 933, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b612 In the District Court, BCP argued that Randolph\u2019s medical expenses were \u201cnecessaries of the family,\u201d and therefore, under \u00a7 40-2-106, MCA, Claudia was responsible for the debt. Claudia argued that she was not responsible for the debt because she was legally separated from Randolph at the time he incurred the medical expenses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>because Randolph had not supported the family during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">\u00b613 The District Court relied on our holding in <em>Bard </em>and concluded that the medical expenses were necessaries. Additionally, the court concluded that because Claudia acted as personal representative of Randolph\u2019s estate and received the family allowance as his surviving spouse, she was estopped from arguing in this case that she was not legally married to Randolph. Concluding that there were no factual disputes, the court entered judgment in favor of BCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b614 On appeal, Claudia argues that \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, is applicable here and provides an exception to the liability imposed in \u00a7 40-2-106, MCA. BCP argues that Claudia did not raise this statutory argument at the summary judgment hearing, therefore this Court should not address the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b615 Section 40-2-104, MCA, provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">a married person abandoned by his spouse is not hable for the spouse\u2019s support until the spouse offers to return, unless the spouse was justified by the person\u2019s misconduct in abandoning him, nor is a married person liable for support of a spouse who is living separate from him by agreement, unless such support is stipulated in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b616 It is true that Claudia did not cite \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, until she filed her motion to alter or amend. In response to this argument, the District Court noted, \u201cthe constructive abandonment which Defendant now claims as grounds for avoiding the medical expense were ... testified to by Defendant. However, the Court chose to rely very little on that testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b617 In our <em>de novo </em>review of a district court ruling on summary judgment, we are not bound by the legal authority presented in the district court. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 22. The District Court noted that Claudia raised the issue of abandonment in her testimony. Additionally, we note that Claudia argued at the summary judgment hearing that she and Randolph were separated at the time he incurred the medical expenses at issue here. Although she argued they were \u201clegally separated,\u201d rather than \u201cliving separate ... by agreement,\u201d the issue of separation was clearly before the court. We conclude that the issues of abandonment and separation were raised in the District Court, and \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, simply represents further legal support for those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b618 Claudia does not argue on appeal that Randolph\u2019s medical expenses were not \u201cnecessaries of the family.\u201d They clearly fall within the definition of necessaries we articulated in <em>Bard. </em>Rather, Claudia argues that \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, provides an exception to the liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>imposed by \u00a7 40-2-106, MCA, and that factual questions exist which preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b619 We agree. Section 40-2-104, MCA, provides an exception to the liability imposed by \u00a7 40-2-106, MCA, if a spouse has been abandoned by the spouse incurring the debt or if the spouses are living separate by agreement. The District Court, citing <em>Caekaert v. State Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 105, 115, 885 P.2d 495, 501 (stating that under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, we do not permit litigants to assert inconsistent and contradictory positions in separate litigation), concluded that Claudia\u2019s role as personal representative in Randolph\u2019s estate was impermissibly inconsistent with and contradictory to her argument in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b620  We disagree that Claudia\u2019s argument here is inconsistent with her role in Randolph\u2019s estate. Section 40-2-104, MCA, requires abandonment or separation by agreement to limit spousal liability. Section 72-3-502, MCA, which sets forth the priorities for appointment as personal representative for a deceased\u2019s estate, states only, \u201cthe surviving spouse of the decedent.\u201d There is nothing in that statutory framework that precludes an abandoned or separated spouse from acting as personal representative in the deceased spouse\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b621  We conclude that Claudia\u2019s role as personal representative for Randolph\u2019s estate does not preclude her from arguing here that Randolph abandoned her or that she and Randolph were living separate by agreement. Furthermore, we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist on the question of whether Randolph abandoned Claudia or, alternatively, whether they were living separate by agreement. These factual disputes precluded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b622  In summary, we hold that \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, provides an exception to the liability imposed on spouses in \u00a7 40-2-106, MCA. Additionally, we hold that there is a factual dispute in this case concerning abandonment or separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b623 We remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b494-10\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ASI\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">\u00b624 I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusions that \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, provides an exception to the requirement at \u00a7 40-2-106, MCA, that a spouse be responsible for another spouse\u2019s medical expenses, and that Claudia\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, is not inconsistent with her position as personal representative of her deceased husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"AlC\">\u00b625 However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>genuine issues of material fact regarding the application of \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, and from its remand to the District Court for further proceedings to resolve that factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\">\u00b626 Even the Respondent, Balyeat Collection Professionals, concedes there are no factual issues to be resolved by the District Court. On page five of its brief, BCT states, \u201cIn this case, however, the parties agree the material facts are undisputed. ... Therefore, the Court\u2019s review in this appeal may be confined to the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b627 Based on the undisputed facts, I would conclude as a matter of law that the Appellant, Claudia Garland, was entitled to summary judgment dismissing the Plaintiffs complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b628 Section 40-2-104, MCA, provides that a married person abandoned by his or her spouse or living apart from that spouse by agreement is not liable for the spouse\u2019s support. The undisputed facts are that Claudia\u2019s husband, Randolph, left the family home in April 1997before incurring the medical expenses which are at issue. He left $30 on the table but never returned to the home, and provided no further support to his family from then until the time of his death. In May 1997, Claudia petitioned for divorce or a legal separation and on May 30, 1997, Randolph was restrained from returning to the family home. Only one day of services were provided by Kalispell Regional Medical Center in May 1997. However, they were provided after Randolph left his family without providing for their support.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b629 None of these facts are disputed. Based on these facts, the District Court can arrive at only one conclusion-that is that Claudia and her children were either abandoned by Randolph or Claudia and Randolph were separated by agreement. Under either circumstance, Claudia was not responsible to pay Kalispell Regional Hospital the $32,496 it claims for services incurred after that separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b630 The result in this case is simply common sense. In fact, during several occasions during Randolph\u2019s hospitalization while Claudia was taking his children or his father to visit him, she was asked by hospital personnel to sign paperwork authorizing his admission. On each occasion she refused to do so. It was apparently logical to her that she had no obligation to guarantee payment for services provided to the husband who had left her even without the benefit of understanding \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA. Having reviewed \u00a7 40-2-104, MCA, it should be at least as clear to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b631 For these reasons, I concur with and dissent from the majority Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
