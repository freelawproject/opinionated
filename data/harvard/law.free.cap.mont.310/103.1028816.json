We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AEV\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether P.W. was denied fundamentally fair procedures in the proceedings by which the District Court awarded long-term custody of M.W. to DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">\u00b63 P.W. is the natural father of M.W. and L.W. M.W. was born on September 30,1986. L.W. was born on April 16, 1984. P.W. is divorced from the children\u2019s natural mother, R.B., who had not seen her children for the nine years prior to these proceedings, and does not appeal from the District Court\u2019s order. The children have resided solely with P.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u00b64 DPHHS removed M.W. and L.W. from P.W.\u2019s care on July 19, 1999, and placed them in protective custody. On July 23,1999, DPHHS filed a petition for temporary legal custody pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-401 and -406, MCA (1999), based on DPHHS\u2019 involvement with the children beginning in May of 1995. The District Court ordered M.W. and L.W. to remain in protective custody pending a hearing set for August 6, 1999. At that hearing, both P.W. and R.B. agreed to grant DPHHS temporary custody, based on their inability to care for the children\u2019s special needs. The District Court declared M.W. and L.W. to be youths in need of care and granted DPHHS temporary legal custody of the children for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u00b65 On February 4, 2000, DPHHS filed a petition for extension of its temporary legal custody, which was set to expire on February 6, 2000. Neither P.W. nor R.B. objected, and the guardian ad litem supported the extension. On February 17, 2000, the District Court granted the extension for another six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u00b66 On September 1, 2000, DPHHS filed a petition for long-term custody, and requested: (1) that a permanency hearing be held; (2) that following that hearing, the District Court grant DPHHS long-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>custody of M.W. and L.W.; and (3) that long-term custody become the permanency plan for the children. DPHHS explained that the children were not ready to return to their parents\u2019 care based on the severity of their ongoing psychological and emotional problems. On September 12, 2000, the District Court ordered temporary legal custody to continue \u201cfrom August 17, 2000, until the hearing on the [long-term custody] petition.\u201d The hearing was originally set for November 14, 2000, but was rescheduled by the District Court for December 4, 2000, because of a scheduling conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b67 At the start of the December 4,2000, hearing, DPHHS moved for a continuance, based on its previous belief that the parents were going to agree to the long-term custody petition. Based on that belief, DPHHS did not subpoena the children\u2019s therapists as witnesses. The basis for DPHHS\u2019 petition for long-term custody was not the parents\u2019 refusal or failure to comply with their treatment plans, but that pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-412(6)(c)(i), MCA(1999), the children had emotional or mental handicaps so severe that the children could not function in a family setting. Therefore, testimony from the children\u2019s therapists would have been necessary to determine the extent of the children\u2019s emotional or mental handicaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b68 P.W. objected to the continuance as highly prejudicial. The District Court denied DPHHS\u2019 motion for a continuance, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">[T]he Department and the County Attorney\u2019s office has had adequate and sufficient time to be prepared for the hearing today. There\u2019s not been a permanency plan hearing within the twelve months required by law if we have to do that. So we\u2019re going to proceed. If the Court were to continue this, the Court could not hear this case in December, and I\u2019m not certain if the Court could hear it in January so we\u2019re proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">DPHHS, therefore, presented its case with one witness, the State social worker assigned to the case. The social worker testified that P.W. had completed his parenting plan, yet believed that neither parent was capable of providing for the needs of the children. Following the social worker\u2019s testimony, the DPHHS attorney stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have further questions for Ms. Bennett at this time.\u201d P.W., in turn, moved to dismiss the petition based on DPHHS\u2019 failure to meet its burden of proof. DPHHS argued that it had not rested its case and that given the nature of the hearing, the guardian ad litem should be permitted to testify before any decision was made. Furthermore, DPHHS argued that the guardian\u2019s testimony could be relied upon to satisfy its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b69 The District Court denied P.W.\u2019s motion to dismiss and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>guardian was allowed to testify. The guardian testified that she had not had any contact with the children directly, nor had she spoken directly with either of the children\u2019s primary therapists. However, based on her contact with P.W., P.W.\u2019s therapist, R.B. by telephone, \u201cthe guardian program,\u201d the prior guardian, and the social worker, she recommended that DPHHS be awarded long-term custody of both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b610 P.W. raised a hearsay objection because of the guardian\u2019s lack of direct contact with any professional who could prove the children\u2019s mental or emotional handicaps. The Court overruled the objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">Section 41-3-303(3) says that \u201cInformation contained in a report filed by the guardian ad litem or testimony regarding a report filed by the guardian ad litem is not hearsay when it is used to form the basis of the guardian ad litem\u2019s opinion as to the best interests of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b611 In response, P.W. challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 41-3-303(3), MCA (1999), as a violation of his right to confront the expert witnesses on whom the guardian had based her opinions. Given the significance of the legal issue, the District Court admitted that the constitutional issue would have to be resolved before a final decision could be made. In the interim, the District Court heard the guardian\u2019s testimony subject to P.W.\u2019s objection, and reserved its ruling on the objection pending further briefing. The guardian\u2019s attorney also called P.W. as a witness. He testified that although his children continued to have severe mental and emotional problems, he would be able to obtain the professional help required to assist his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b612 During P.W.\u2019s case-in-chief, P.W.\u2019s therapist testified that P.W. was capable of caring for M.W. in a family setting pursuant to a reunification plan which she and P.W. had developed at the social worker\u2019s suggestion. At the conclusion of testimony, P.W. renewed his motion to dismiss. In ruling on the motion, the District Court considered the ramifications of its decision. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">P.W.\u2019s Counsel: If you recall a year and a half ago when we first came, he [P.W.] was willing to submit - he\u2019s always wanted their [DPHHS] help and their services. He realizes this isn\u2019t a normal family where the kids go off to school, come home, eat dinner type of situation. But as the Court observed and he strongly feels, they have not gotten better in a year and a half of total loss of his control so he wants at least some of the control back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">Court: I understand that but it\u2019s either the Department or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>P.W.\u2019s Counsel: Based on the fact they didn\u2019t present the necessary testimony, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">Court: No, no, let\u2019s set that aside. If the Court dismisses the petition, the Department [DPHHS] is out of it; they\u2019re out of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9\">P.W.\u2019s Counsel: They [P.W.] can provide services without the Court intervention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">Court: Well, but there\u2019s nothing that says that they would. P.W.\u2019s Counsel: True.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Court: They\u2019re [DPHHS] out of it for all practical purposes, legal purposes; they\u2019re out of it. And I\u2019m not hearing him say that he wants them out of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">P.W.\u2019s Counsel: Your Honor, he wouldn\u2019t be saying that to tell you the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The District Court denied P.W.\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss. The District Court granted P.W. visitation rights to M.W. in the form of one telephone call per week and one in-person visit every month.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\u00b613 The parties briefed the constitutional issue and on January 26, 2001, the District Court issued a Memorandum and Order sustaining P.W.\u2019s objection to the use of the hearsay testimony by the guardian. It held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">[T]he language of \u00a7 41-3-303(3), which allows the hearsay presentation by the guardian ad litem of what would otherwise be considered expert testimony, violates Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution as that section is applied to the objectionable evidence before the Court, in that it is a fundamentally unfair violation of a parent\u2019s right to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Based on that determination, the District Court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">Considering that this issue is an issue of first impression and with the intent to determi ne the best interests of the youth on the merits of this matter, the Department shall be given another opportunity to present its case to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">\u00b614 A second hearing was held on February 28,2001. At that hearing, both P.W. and R.B. agreed that DPHHS should have long-term custody of L.W. With respect to M.W., P.W. objected to giving DPHHS another opportunity to present its case when it had failed to sustain its burden of proof at the December 4, 2000, hearing. The District Court denied P.W.\u2019s objection. DPHHS then called M.W.\u2019s former and present therapists to testify, as well as the group home manager of the facility where M.W. was then residing. On March 28,2001, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, and granted long-term custody of M.W. and L.W. to DPHHS. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Court concluded that M.W. \u201ccannot function in a family setting residing with his father.\u201d The District Court allowed P.W. continued visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b615 On May 24, 2001, P.W. appealed the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order of March 28, 2001, and that portion of the Memorandum and Order entered January 26, 2001, where the District Court allowed DPHHS \u201canother opportunity to present its case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Matter of D.H. </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 521, 525, 872 P.2d 803, 805. This Court has recognized that \u201ca natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>Matter of R.B. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b617 Furthermore, when determining custody, the district court is \u201cbound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the children.\u201d <em>Matter of C.M. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 183, 187, 932 P.2d 1063, 1066. The best interests of the child are paramount in child custody cases and must take precedence over parental rights. <em>C.M., </em>281 Mont. at 187, 932 P.2d at 1066; <em>Matter of B.N. </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 511, 517-18, 802 P.2d 1244, 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">\u00b618 The sole issue on appeal is whether P.W. was denied fundamentally fair procedures in the proceedings by which the District Court awarded long-term custody of M.W. to DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">\u00b619 To begin, we should note that although P.W. originally challenged DPHHS\u2019 petition for long-term custody with respect to both M.W. and L.W., we interpret this appeal as related only to M.W. At the February 28, 2001, hearing, P.W. conceded that DPHHS should have long-term custody of L.W. Furthermore, at the conclusion of P.W.\u2019s brief filed for this appeal, P.W. requests this Court to \u201creverse the district court\u2019s grant of long term custody of M.W. to the Department of Public Health and Human Services.\u201d Accordingly, we will limit our review to M.W.</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">\u00b620 P.W. alleges that he was denied fundamentally fair procedures in five areas. Specifically, P.W. contends that: (1) the District Court failed to hold a permanency plan hearing within the statutory deadline; (2) DPHHS failed to submit a statutorily-required pre-hearing report to the District Court; (3) DPHHS failed to develop a plan with any elements of permanency; (4) DPHHS tried to terminate P.W.\u2019s parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>rights without satisfying the requisite statutory criteria and burden of proof; and (5) the District Court erroneously granted DPHHS a second chance to prove its case. We will address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b621  P.W. first contends that the District Court failed to hold a permanency plan hearing within the statutory deadline. Section 41-3-412(1), MCA (1999), provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">A permanency plan hearing must be held by the court no later than 12 months after the initial court finding that the child has been subjected to abuse or neglect or 12 months after the child\u2019s first 60 days of removal from the home, whichever comes first, unless the proceeding has been dismissed, the child was not removed from the home, or the child has been returned to the child\u2019s parent or guardian.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On July 19,1999, M.W. was removed from the home of P.W. On July 23,1999, the District Court found probable cause to believe that M.W. had been abused or neglected or was in danger of being abused or neglected. Therefore, by law, the permanency plan hearing should have occurred prior to July 23, 2000. On September 1, 2000, DPHHS petitioned the District Court to schedule a permanency plan hearing, and award long-term custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court set a hearing date for November 14,2000, and subsequently rescheduled that hearing for December 4, 2000. Therefore, it is undisputed that the permanency plan hearing in this case occurred after the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b622 P.W. now contends that the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a timely permanency plan hearing deprived him of a fundamentally fair procedure. However, before making that argument to this Court, it was necessary that he make the same argument to the District Court as well as advise the District Court of the appropriate remedy. P.W. failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u00b623 Prior to the hearing, in his Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order filed on December 1, 2000, P.W. stated in a proposed conclusion of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Section 41-3-412(1), MCA, requires the Court to conduct a permanency plan hearing no later than 12 months after its initial finding that a child is abused or neglected, or 14 months after a child has been removed, whichever comes first. Neither of these deadlines was met in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>However, P.W. did not suggest to the District Court that it was without authority to proceed for that reason and did not request dismissal of the petition. Objections primarily serve two purposes: (1) to give the district court an opportunity to correct the problem and (2) to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 MT 2, \u00b6 54, 308 Mont. 75, \u00b6 54, 43 P.3d 266, \u00b6 54. P.W.\u2019s proposed conclusion merely brought the problem to the District Court\u2019s attention. It made no suggestion how to correct the problem. Therefore, the proposed conclusion of law did not, by itself, constitute a proper objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b624  P.W. next contends that he was denied a fundamentally fair procedure when DPHHS failed to submit the statutorily-required prehearing report at least three days prior to the permanency plan hearing. Section 41-3-412(2), MCA (1999), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">(2) At least 3 days prior to the permanency plan hearing, the department and the guardian ad litem shall each submit a report regarding the child to the court for review. The report must contain the:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">(a) efforts and progress demonstrated by the child\u2019s parent or guardian to complete a treatment plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">(b) extent to which the parent or guardian cooperated and used the services provided;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">(c) status of the child, including the child\u2019s mental, physical, and psychological health; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">(d) plan for permanency for the child, including specific times for achieving the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">\u00b625 It is undisputed that DPHHS failed to submit the required prehearing report. However, like the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a timely permanency plan hearing, P.W. failed to properly object to DPHHS\u2019 course of conduct either at the hearing or in a prehearing motion. At the hearing, the District Court questioned DPHHS about the absence of the report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">Court: You\u2019re petitioning the Court to develop a permanency plan, however, there was no permanency plan and now I\u2019m talking about this case. \"Where is the report regarding the child for the Court to review with respect to a permanency plan? Where is the report. The statute requires the Department to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">DPHHS: Yes, it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">Court: Where is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">DPHHS: One has not been done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">Court: It should have been done at least three days before today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4c\">DPHHS: Yes. That again is something that I should have reminded them to do because I read the same statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Despite the fact that the Court raised the issue and DPHHS acknowledged its error, P.W. failed to state an objection at that time and demonstrate or even allege resulting prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b626 As with the timeliness of the hearing, P.W. did raise the issue as a proposed conclusion of law in his Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">Section 41-3-412(2), MCA, requires both the Department and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>to each submit a report to the Court at least 3 days before the hearing. The Department and guardian both failed to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">However, once again, no specific relief was requested and, as before, we conclude that the proposed conclusion was an insufficient objection by which to preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b627 The third alleged denial of a fundamentally fair procedure was DPHHS\u2019 failure to develop a plan with any elements of permanency that would enable M.W. to move toward a settled placement. P.W. complains of the frequency with which M.W. was transferred between treatment facilities and the inability of DPHHS to \u201cstick to a plan of action.\u201d DPHHS, on the other hand, contends that M.W.\u2019s movement between treatment facilities was first and foremost in response to his best interests and to treat his severe emotional and behavioral needs. In addition, DPHHS notes that it is sometimes difficult to place children due to waiting lists that exist at various treatment facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"ALe\">\u00b628  We conclude there was substantial evidence that M.W. has reasonably progressed toward a settled placement. M.W. was initially placed at Billings Deaconess Clinic. On August 16, 1999, he was admitted into Children\u2019s Comprehensive Service (CCS) in Butte, Montana. Dr. Jeffrey Watson, a licensed professional counselor at CCS, testified that M.W. had improved during his stay at CCS and was now less aggressive. On December 22, 2000, M.W. was moved to Skyview Group Home in Missoula, Montana. Bret Gilleo, M.W.\u2019s Skyview therapist, testified of M.W.\u2019s progress, stating, \u201c[h]is behaviors are not as severe as they were when he first came in and he\u2019s only been there a little over two months and staff have been able to redirect him a little better. They\u2019re finding some of the cause for [M.W.\u2019s] problems and some of the things that work well with him to help him redirect.\u201d When asked to give an estimate as to how much longer M.W. would need specialized care, Gilleo estimated that it would take from a year to a year and a half at a minimum. Finally, the Citizen\u2019s Review Board, a citizen board of the Eighteenth Judicial District, found that M.W.\u2019s placement at Skyview was the \u201csafest, most appropriate and least restrictive\u201d placement and that \u201cprogress has been made toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>achieving permanency.\u201d Given the substantial evidence in the record and our recognition that it often takes multiple facilities and a bit of trial-and-error to find the appropriate treatment facility, we agree that M.W. has made reasonable progress toward a settled placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b629 P.W. next contends that because DPHHS repeatedly disallowed contact between P.W. and M.W., it attempted to terminate P.W.\u2019s parental rights without adequate grounds and without meeting the necessary burden of proof. From June until September 2000, DPHHS worked toward reunification of M.W. and P.W., and urged liberal visitation. P.W. and his therapist, with the social worker\u2019s approval and input, developed a plan for M.W.\u2019s return home. However, after DPHHS filed the petition for long-term custody on September 1,2000, DPHHS refused to permit contact between P.W. and M.W., based on the recommendations of M.W.\u2019s CCS treatment team which observed marked progress in M.W.\u2019s therapy when he had no contact with P.W. and regression following contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b630 Whether there was any merit to DPHHS\u2019 actions with respect to terminating visitation following September 1, 2000, however, is moot based on the District Court\u2019s reinstatement of visitation at the December 4, 2000, hearing. Where this Court can no longer grant effective relief, the issue is moot. <em>Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6 19, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6 19. Accordingly, we move to the next issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b631 P.W. claims that he was denied a fundamentally fair procedure when the District Court allowed DPHHS a second opportunity at the February 28,2001, hearing to prove that M.W. had severe mental and emotional handicaps which required long-term custody with DPHHS. P.W. contends that DPHHS sought to repeatedly litigate the issue, \u201cuntil it could get its act together sufficiently to support its allegations.\u201d Because DPHHS failed to present any evidence that supported long-term custody at the first hearing and failed to meet its burden, P.W. contends that the petition should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">\u00b632 We disagree. At the December 4, 2000, hearing, P.W. objected to the constitutionality of \u00a7 41-3-303(3), MCA, based on its violation of his right to confront certain experts whose statements were influential in forming the basis for the guardian\u2019s recommendations regarding the children. The District Court reserved ruling on P.W.\u2019s objection until after the parties briefed the issue, but allowed the guardian to testify in the interim. Subsequently, the District Court sustained P.W.\u2019s objection, and held that the guardian\u2019s report and testimony violated P.W.\u2019s right to confrontation. The District Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">Considering that this is an issue of first impression and with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>intent to determine the best interests of the youths on the merits of this matter, the Department shall be given another opportunity to present its case to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">A second hearing was then set for February 28, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b633  At the February 28, 2001, hearing, P.W. was provided the opportunity to confront and cross-examine M.W.\u2019s therapists. We agree with the District Court that a dismissal of the petition after the December 4, 2000, hearing, and after the District Court sustained P.W.\u2019s objection, would have required that the Court overlook the best interests of the child. While fundamentally fair procedures are guaranteed, a district court has a corresponding duty to consider the best interests of the child. Substantial evid\u00e9nce in the record existed to show that M.W. continued to suffer both emotionally and mentally. P.W. himself admitted that he alone was hot capable of dealing with his children\u2019s needs. Furthermore, aside from the fact that substantive evidence was offered directly which had previously been offered indirectly but then excluded, prejudice to P.W. has not been demonstrated. Since it was P.W. who objected to the form of the evidence as first offered and since it was originally offered in a form authorized by statute, we conclude that M.W.\u2019s best interests were paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b634 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\"> However, P.W. did not file a motion to dismiss based on DPHHS\u2019 failure to timely file the petition for long-term custody. In Appellant\u2019s brief, P.W. concedes, \u201cP.W. did not raise the Department\u2019s untimeliness in filing the petition as grounds to dismiss the proceeding in the court below, and is not now asking this Court to do so on that basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
