We accepted certification by our order dated August 30,2001. \u00b62 The certified question presented, by the federal court is re-stated as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">Whether an automobile policy issued in the State of Montana with respect to a motor vehicle registered and maintained in Montana that states: \u201c \u2018Uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 does not include any vehicle or equipment: ... owned by any governmental unit or agency\u201d is in violation of \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, or the public policy of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\u00b63 The parties stipulated to the following facts pertinent to our review. The Salish Kootenai College purchased a semi-trailer without wheels and intended to use it as a storage container. On August 3, 1999, Gordon Bartell and two of his co-employees at the college used a pair of forklifts to move the semi-trailer. Gordon Bartell provided direction from the ground to his co-employees as they operated the forklifts. He was killed when he was crushed by the semi-trailer as it was moved or pushed by one of the forklifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\u00b64 The Salish Kootenai College is incorporated as a tribal non-profit corporation. As of the date of Gordon Bartell\u2019s death, the college was insured by a liability insurance policy issued by St. Paul Guardian Insurance Company. The policy did not provide coverage for bodily injury to an employee arising out of his employment by the college. As such, the college was uninsured for purposes of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u00b65 At the time of the accident, Gordon Bartell\u2019s own automobile insurance policy issued by the Defendant, American Home Assurance Company (AHAC), included uninsured motorists coverage. According to the policy, AHAC agreed to pay compensatory damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by an insured and caused by an accident. The policy defines an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which no bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident. The policy also provides that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d does not include any vehicle or equipment owned by any governmental unit or agency. At issue now is this government-owned exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b66 The United States District Court concluded that since the uninsured vehicle, the semi-trailer, was owned by the Salish Kootenai College, Inc., a tribal governmental agency, the government-owned exclusion would defeat AHAC\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage in this case. After receiving additional briefing on the applicability of the government-owned exclusion, the United States District Court entered its Certification Order to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b67 Montana\u2019s mandatory uninsured motorist coverage statute, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, requires all motor vehicle liability insurance policies issued in this state to include uninsured motorist coverage unless the named insured rejects such coverage. It does not exclude any class of vehicle. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">Motor vehicle liability policies to include uninsured motorist coverage- rejection by insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">(1) No motor vehicle liability policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state, with respect to any motor vehicle registered and principally garaged in this state, unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto, in limits for bodily injury or death set forth in 61-6-103, under provisions filed with and approved by the commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting therefrom, caused by an accident arising out of the operation or use of such vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>An uninsured motor vehicle is a land motor vehicle, the ownership, the maintenance, or the use of which is not insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\">(2) The named insured shall have the right to reject such coverage</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b68 Plaintiff, Barbara J. Bartell (Bartell) claims that since \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, contains no exceptions to its mandatory uninsured motorists coverage requirement, the exclusion for government-owned vehicles at issue in this case violates the statute. She also insists that the exclusion is void as a matter of well-established Montana public policy governing uninsured motorist coverage. In support of these arguments, Bartell notes that the majority of jurisdictions with broad uninsured motorist statutes such as Montana\u2019s have concluded that government-owned exclusions are void. Finally, Bartell points out that in the face of the Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity, she cannot look to it for recovery and argues that the enforcement of the government-owned exclusion would violate a Montana insured\u2019s reasonable expectations that they will receive adequate compensation for losses caused by an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">\u00b69 AHAC claims that an insurance company can provide reasonable limitations and exclusions in a motor vehicle policy under \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA, and that the government-owned exclusion is reasonable, valid and enforceable. AHAC cites cases from several jurisdictions which have upheld the government-owned exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b610 Although we have not specifically addressed the validity of government-owned exclusions contained in uninsured motorist coverage policies, we have addressed the public policy and scope of the uninsured motorist coverage statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">The purpose of the statute is to protect completely, those -willing to accept its protection, from all harm, whatever their status-passenger, driver, pedestrian-at the time of injury, produced by uninsured motorists. The only restrictions are that the plaintiff must be an insured, the defendant motorist uninsured, and that plaintiff be legally entitled to recover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjF\"><em>Guiberson v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 279, 289, 704 P.2d 68, 74 (citing <em>Jacobson v. Implement Dealers Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 542, 547, 640 P.2d 908, 911). Relying upon <em>Guiberson, </em>this Court has stated that it \u201cdoes not support provisions placed on uninsured motorist coverage which restrict or thwart available liability coverage that the insured would be entitled to in an accident.\u201d <em>Dagel v. Farmers Ins. Group </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 402, 406, 903 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>P.2d 1359, 1361 (exhaustion clause held unenforceable); <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Taylor </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 215, 220, 725 P.2d 821, 824 (no-consent-to-settlement clause held void); <em>Guiberson, </em>217 Mont. at 289, 704 P.2d at 74 (consent provision held inapplicable and irrelevant). Additionally, we have consistently upheld and relied upon Montana\u2019s public policy that \u201can insurer may not place in an insurance policy a provision that defeats coverage for which the insurer has received valuable consideration.\u201d <em>Ruckdaschel v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 395, 398, 948 P.2d 700, 702 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b611 Other jurisdictions with statutory language similar to Montana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute have concluded that insurance policy provisions specifically excluding government-owned vehicles from the category of uninsured motor vehicles are against public policy and, therefore, void and unenforceable. <em>See </em>3 Alan I. Widiss, <em>Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance </em>\u00a7 35.10 (rev. 2d ed. 2001); <em>Cropper v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(Del. 1995), 671 A.2d 423, 426-27 (listing the majority of jurisdictions declaring government-owned exclusions void).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b612 AHAC directs our attention to jurisdictions which have upheld the government-owned exclusion in accordance with statutory language expressly excluding government vehicles from the category of uninsured motor vehicles. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Co. </em>(S.C. 1968), 163 S.E.2d 306; <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Delaney </em>(Ky. 1977), 550 S.W.2d 499; and <em>Francis v. International Service Ins. Co. </em>(Tex. 1976), 546 S.W.2d 57. The Nebraska Supreme Court recently discussed the importance of state uninsured motorist statutes to judicial decisions on the government-owned exclusion issue. Those states without statutes providing for the government-owned exclusion, like Montana, void it while those states with statutes specifically permitting the exclusion find the exclusion enforceable. <em>Continental Western Ins. Co. v. Conn </em>(Neb. 2001), 629 N.W.2d 494, 500-01. Accordingly, we are not convinced that the decisions cited by AHAC are persuasive in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b613 Finally, AHAC\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA, for the proposition that it may provide reasonable limitations and exclusions on uninsured motorist coverage in a motor vehicle policy is misplaced. This provision does not \u201coverride\u201d \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, and allow for exceptions which are not specifically delineated by the legislature. Had the legislature chosen to exclude specific vehicles from the uninsured motorist coverage statute, it could have done so. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-6-303(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>MCA (exempting specific vehicles, including government-owned vehicles, from liability insurance requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">\u00b614  In sum, Montana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute does not specifically exclude any class of vehicles. Accordingly, we conclude that the government-owned exclusion in AHAC\u2019s policy impermissibly restricts the broad and mandatory coverage of \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA. The exclusion is repugnant to the clear public policy of Montana in favor of uninsured motorist coverage and against any limitations upon complete protection. We hold that an automobile policy issued in the State of Montana with respect to a motor vehicle registered and maintained in Montana which provides that any vehicle or equipment owned by any governmental unit or agency may not be an uninsured motor vehicle violates \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, and the public policy of this state.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-4\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b307-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Ama\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b615 I concur with the Court\u2019s statutory analysis and the conclusion based thereon. I do not agree with the remainder of the Court\u2019s discussion and analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b616 As the Court observes, the certified question from the United States District Court is stated in the disjunctive: whether the automobile policy at issue \u201cis in violation of \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, or the public policy of this State.\u201d The Court concludes, and I agree, that the policy violates the statute. The first portion of the certified question having been answered in the affirmative, it is my view that the matter has been resolved and it is entirely unnecessary to go on-via dicta-to the second portion of the certified question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
