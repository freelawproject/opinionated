The case proceeded to trial, and during jury deliberations the jury asked the District Court to clarify the jury instruction concerning Count III. The court instructed the jury that it could convict Crawford on that count even if it found only a portion of the $1025 came from the sale of dangerous drugs. The jury convicted Crawford on all three counts and in a special interrogatory, concluded that only $225 of the $1025 was subject to forfeiture. Crawford appeals his conviction on Count III, property subject to forfeiture. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it submitted a supplemental jury instruction that allowed the jury to find that only a portion of the alleged property subject to forfeiture was proceeds from the sale of dangerous drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">\u00b63 Crawford\u2019s arrest stemmed from an alleged sale of methamphetamine to Beverly New (New), who was arrested for shoplifting on July 9, 1998. Following New\u2019s arrest, officers found methamphetamine while searching her purse. New informed the officers that she purchased the methamphetamine from Crawford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>earlier that day. The next day, New met with Detective Sergeant Larry Jacobs (Detective Jacobs) from the Missoula County Sheriffs Department about setting up another drug purchase with Crawford. New agreed and placed a call to Crawford, making arrangements to purchase methamphetamine from him at a gas station in East Missoula that afternoon. Detective Jacobs recorded the phone conversation between New and Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b64 Detective Jacobs and three other law enforcement officers went to the gas station to intercept Crawford. When Crawford arrived the officers attempted to block Crawford\u2019s vehicle, but Crawford managed to drive away. Following a brief pursuit, Crawford abandoned the vehicle and continued to flee on foot. Later that day, Crawford was caught riding as a passenger in another vehicle and he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"ACZ\">\u00b65 When Detective Jacobs searched Crawford incident to his arrest, he discovered $1025 in cash inside Crawford\u2019s front pants pocket. Crawford told the detective that the money was from a roofing job and other spot jobs. Detective Jacobs testified that since Crawford failed to provide him with any names of employers, he was unable to verify Crawford\u2019s explanation of the source of the cash. In addition, when the detectives searched the vehicle abandoned by Crawford, they found a ziploc baggie containing methamphetamine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b66 On July 31,1998, Crawford was charged by Information with the following felony offenses: Count I, Criminal Sale of Dangerous Drugs; Count II, Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs; and Count III, Criminal Possession of Property Subject to Forfeiture. On Count III, the Information alleged that \u201c[o]n or about July 9, 1998, [Crawford] knowingly possessed property, approximately $1,025.00 that is subject to criminal forfeiture as proceeds from the exchange of dangerous drugs.\u201d Crawford entered pleas of not guilty to all three counts and the matter proceeded to trial on December 8, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b67 At trial, New told the jury she called Crawford early in the morning on July 9, 1998, asking him to sell her some methamphetamine. New testified she met Crawford on her way to work, paying him $225, probably in twenty and ten dollar denominations, for three and one-half grams of methamphetamine packaged in a ziploc baggie. New provided an ATM receipt showing a $230 cash withdrawal on July 9, 1998, at 5:37 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b68 Crawford called only one witness in his defense, Diane Dupras (Dupras). Dupras testified that a couple of days before Crawford\u2019s arrest, she gave Crawford $100 to purchase a car battery, and that on the day of his arrest, July 10, 1998, she paid Crawford $800 to complete some body repair work on her car. A copy of a withdrawal slip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>from Dupras\u2019 bank account indicated $800 in cash was withdrawn from her account on July 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b69 On cross-examination, Dupras testified that she assumed the bank gave her large bills, fifties and/or one-hundreds, noting that is what they usually do. The State questioned Dupras about the date she allegedly gave Crawford the $800, noting that in her written statement she indicated that she gave him the $100 on July 8,1998, and the $800 on July 6, 1998, not the day Crawford was arrested. The State also asked Dupras if her son did body work on cars and Dupras explained that her son was a mechanic, but that he did not do body work.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b610 After the defense rested, the State called Missoula County Sheriff Detective Tom Lewis (Detective Lewis) as a rebuttal witness. Detective Lewis testified that he observed Dupras\u2019 son doing some body work on a car during the summer of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b611 At the close of the defendant\u2019s case, but prior to Detective Lewis\u2019 testimony, the parties finalized the jury instructions. The State did not move to make any alterations to the instructions. Later, after the jury received the instructions and began deliberating, it sent a note to the District Court concerning Count III, asking if it could find that only a portion of the $1025 came from the sale of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b612 After hearing arguments from both parties, the District Court concluded that the jury did not have to find the entire $1025 was from the sale of drugs. The court proposed an interrogatory, allowing the jury to allocate the dollar amount it determined was from the sale of drugs, if it first found the other elements set out in Count III were established beyond a reasonable doubt. Crawford\u2019s objection to the special interrogatory was overruled, and the court gave the supplemental instruction to the jury. Sometime later, the jury returned a verdict, finding Crawford guilty on all three counts. In response to the special interrogatory the jury found Crawford possessed $225 from the sale of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b613 On January 29, 1999, the District Court sentenced Crawford to the Department of Corrections for a term of five years on Count I, to the Montana State Prison (MSP) for five years on Count II, and to MSP for ten years on Count III. The court suspended all but 204 days on each of the sentences, and ordered all three sentences to run concurrently. The court further ordered that the property subject to forfeiture ($225), be disposed of in accordance with State law, and that of the remaining $800, $400 would be credited against Crawford\u2019s fine and $400 would go to Dupras.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b614 Crawford appeals his conviction on Count III, based on the District Court\u2019s supplementary instruction to the jury which allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>it to find a portion of the $1025 was proceeds of drug transactions. In his opening brief, Crawford also challenges his conviction on Count I, alleging the State failed to present sufficient evidence that he sold dangerous drugs. However, Crawford did not provide any argument on this issue, and accordingly, we conclude it has been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b615 The standard of review of jury instructions in criminal cases is whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 289, \u00b6 28, 291 Mont. 501, \u00b6 28, 969 P.2d 925, \u00b6 28. Moreover, we review a district court\u2019s decision to provide the jury with requested information pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-503(2), MCA, for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Brogan </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 156, 162-63, 900 P.2d 284, 288-89 (citing <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1974), 165 Mont. 456, 460, 529 P.2d 1377, 1379) (when district court fully and correctly instructed the jury as to defendant\u2019s legal duties at issue, it did not abuse its discretion in refusing to further instruct the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it submitted a supplemental jury instruction that allowed the jury to find that only a portion of the alleged property subject to forfeiture was proceeds from the sale of dangerous drugs?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b617 Both before the trial started and at the close of the evidence, the District Court instructed the jury on Count III by giving Instruction No. 5-11, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">To convict the defendant of criminal possession of property subject to forfeiture, the State must prove the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">1. That the defendant possessed property, approximately $1025.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-11\">2. That the property is proceeds from the exchange of dangerous drugs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\">3. That the defendant acted knowingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\">If you find from your consideration of the evidence that all of these elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then you should find the defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-14\">If, on the other hand, you find from your consideration of the evidence that any of these elements has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt then you should find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9I\">\u00b618 At some point during deliberations, the jury apparently became uncertain as to how Instruction No. 5-11 should be applied, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>indicated by the following note sent to the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">Count III. Do we have to find the entire $1025 was the result of sale of drugs, or can we find only a portion of that amount came from the sale?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">After conferring with both parties, the District Court provided the following supplemental instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">In response to your note, I instruct you that you may find only a portion of the amount ($1,025.00) came from the sale of dangerous drugs and still convict the Defendant if you find all the elements are proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The court also supplied the jury with a special interrogatory, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">We the jury in the above entitled cause, having found the Defendant guilty of Count III, Criminal Possession of Property Subject to Forfeiture, find the sum of $_to be the amount of money possessed by the Defendant from the sale of dangerous drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">As part of its verdict, the jury entered the sum of $225 in the blank provided on the interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">\u00b619  After deliberations have begun, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion whether to provide information in response to a jury\u2019s inquiry. Section 46-16-503(2), MCA, provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">[a]fter the jury has retired for deliberation ... if the jurors desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the cause, they shall notify the officer appointed to keep them together, who shall then notify the court. The information requested may be given, in the discretion of the court, after consultation with the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">A district court\u2019s decision to provide the jury with requested information pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-503(2), MCA, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Brogan, </em>272 Mont. at 162-63, 900 P.2d at 288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">\u00b620 Crawford argues that it was error for the District Court to supplement the jury instructions, noting that Instruction No. 5-11 made the specific dollar amount alleged by the State ($1025) an element of Count III. Crawford contends that once given, that instruction became the law of the case and therefore the jury was bound to follow it as given. In the alternative, Crawford argues that the District Court\u2019s supplementary instruction, allowing the jury to find that only a portion of the $1025 was drug proceeds, effectively amended the information which had set out the figure as \u201capproximately $1025,\u201d and argues that altering a substantive element of an information prejudiced Crawford because he could not adjust his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>defense strategy to rebut the State\u2019s reduced burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b621 In response, the State argues that because possession of any amount of proceeds from an illegal drug sale violated \u00a7 45-9-206, MCA, the amount identified in Count III is not an element of the crime, or even a material component of the charge or the instruction, and thus the supplemental instruction did not amend the Information. The State contends the supplemental instruction given by the District Court was proper and that the jury\u2019s finding of a lessor amount of property subject to forfeiture did not cast reasonable doubt on the State\u2019s proof with respect to the actual elements of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b622 The record is clear that the State not only charged Crawford with possession of the specific figure, $1025, in the Information, but it also prosecuted Crawford on this same figure, thus assuming the burden of proving that Crawford possessed the approximate amount of $1025 from proceeds of the sale of dangerous drugs. Moreover, the State underscored the amount as an element of the offense when in its opening comments, it asserted that at Crawford\u2019s arrest, \u201che had $1025 on his person, and it\u2019s the State\u2019s burden to show you that those proceeds were from the sale of dangerous drugs.\u201d The State then attempted to refute any alleged legitimate sources for any portion of the $1025, when it elicited testimony from Detective Jacobs concerning lack of verification of Crawford\u2019s roofing employer, attempted to discredit Dupras during cross-examination, and presented rebuttal witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b623 Although the State was clearly aware of Crawford\u2019s defense on Count III (i.e., there were other legitimate sources of $1025), in its closing argument, the State continued to assume the burden of demonstrating the entire $1025 was drug proceeds, telling the jury that \u201con Count III ... we have to show that [Crawford] possessed property subject to forfeiture. That he had about $1025, and that it was subject to forfeiture, and that it is the proceeds from drug transactions.\u201d The State argued that various evidence, including the denominations of the bills, the credibility of Dupras, and the circumstances of the arrest and New\u2019s testimony, showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the money was drug proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b624 Significantly, at no time during the presentation of its case did the State offer evidence that perhaps only a portion of the $1025 was from the sale of drugs, nor did it ever accept such a possibility in its closing remarks, despite the fact that Crawford was clearly trying to establish other sources for some or all of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b625 Crawford cites <em>State v. Cline </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 520, 555 P.2d 724, for the proposition that under the law of the case doctrine, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>was bound to prove the elements of the crime as set out in the jury instructions. In <em>Cline, </em>three defendants were convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses, by filing a false claim for workmen\u2019s compensation death benefits. The State\u2019s proposed instruction, setting out the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses, included receipt of settlement proceeds as an element of the offense. At trial, the State failed to present any proof that two of the defendants received any part of the settlement proceeds. Although on appeal the State argued that receipt of the proceeds was unnecessary for a conviction, we concluded that the instruction \u201crequiring such proof became the \u2018law of the case\u2019 and the jury was bound thereby.\u201d <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont. at 527, 555 P.2d at 729 (citations to civil cases omitted). <em>See also, State v. Hickman </em>(Wash. 1998), 954 P.2d 900 (under Washington\u2019s law of the case doctrine, state assumes the burden of proving otherwise unnecessary elements of the offense when such added elements are included without objection in the \u201cto convict\u201d instructions to the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b626 More recently, we noted that \u201c[i]n the civil context \u2018we have long adhered to the rule that an instruction given without an objection becomes the law of the case,\u2019 \u201d concluding that \u201c[t]here is no good reason why this same rule should not apply in the criminal context,\u201d when the State had opportunity to object to a proposed instruction, but failed to do so. <em>State v. Robbins, </em>1998 MT 297, \u00b6 30, 292 Mont. 23, \u00b6 30, 971 P.2d 359, \u00b6 30, overruled in part on other grounds in <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204 (citing <em>DeBruycker v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 294, 301, 880 P.2d 819, 823). In <em>Robbins, </em>we held that the State\u2019s failure to object to the defendant\u2019s proposed negligent homicide instruction, although it had ample opportunity, rendered the instruction the law of the case. <em>Robbins, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b627  We conclude the situation here is similar to that presented in <em>Cline </em>and <em>Hickman, </em>compelling a similar result. We hold that when the State fails to properly object to a jury instruction, the instruction, whether it includes an unnecessary element or not, becomes the law of the case once delivered, and the jury is accordingly bound by it. We therefore conclude that Instruction No. 5-11 became the law of the case and the jury was bound to follow it. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it gave the supplemental instruction that allowed deviation from the original \u201cto convict\u201d instruction which had alleged the specific dollar figure of $1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b628  We further conclude the State did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the $1025 possessed by Crawford was proceeds from the sale of drugs. The evidence did not sufficiently establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>even \u201capproximately\u201d $1025 was proceeds from the sale of dangerous drugs, since the jury was convinced only $225 was attributable to drug sales, as evidenced by its answer to the special interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b629 Therefore, for a lack of proof of one of the elements of the offense as defined by Instruction No. 5-11, Crawford\u2019s conviction on Count III is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b50-6\">JUSTICE REGNIER</author>\n<p id=\"AjC\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b630 The majority concludes that Instruction No. 5-11 became the law of the case and the jury was bound to follow it. Thus, the District Court abused its discretion when it gave a supplemental instruction that allowed deviation from the original \u201cto convict\u201d instruction which had alleged the specific dollar figure of $1025. Under this analysis, the Court then concludes that the State did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the $1025 possessed by Crawford was proceeds from the sale of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b631 The problem I have with this analysis is that Crawford was charged with Criminal Possession of Property Subject to Forfeiture, \u00a7 45-9-206, MCA. Montana\u2019s criminal forfeiture statute provides that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture if the person knowingly possesses ... property that is subject to criminal forfeiture under this section.\u201d Section 45-9-206(1), MCA. Property subject to forfeiture includes \u201ceverything of value furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for a dangerous drug[.]\u201d Section 45-9-206(2)(e)(i), MCA. In my view, the special interrogatory simply allowed the jury to assign a dollar amount to the property in his possession which was subject to forfeiture. The jury\u2019s finding of a lesser amount of property subject to forfeiture than charged by the State should not interfere with this conviction. The jury concluded that the Defendant was guilty of possessing $225 in cash which was subject to the criminal forfeiture statute. I believe the supplemental instruction given by the District Court was entirely proper and the jury\u2019s finding of a lesser amount of property subject to forfeiture should not result in a reversal of this conviction. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
