We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in admitting the Joint Will to formal probate?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">\u00b64 James Mylen Hall (\u201cJim\u201d) died on October 23, 1998. At the time of his death, he was 75 years old and lived in Cascade County, Montana. His wife, Betty Lou Hall (\u201cBetty\u2019), and two daughters from a previous marriage, Sandra Kay Ault (\u201cSandra\u201d) and Charlotte Rae Hall (\u201cCharlotte\u201d), survived him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">\u00b65 Jim first executed a will on April 18, 1984 (the \u201cOriginal Will\u201d). Approximately thirteen years later, Jim and Betty\u2019s attorney, Ross Cannon, transmitted to them a draft of a joint will (the \u201cJoint Will\u201d). On June 4, 1997, Jim and Betty met at Cannon\u2019s office to discuss the draft. After making several changes, Jim and Betty apparently agreed on the terms of the Joint Will. Jim and Betty were prepared to execute the Joint Will once Cannon sent them a final version.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">\u00b66 At the conclusion of the meeting, however, Jim asked Cannon if the draft could stand as a will until Cannon sent them a final version. Cannon said that it would be valid if Jim and Betty executed the draft and he notarized it. Betty testified that no one else was in the office at the time to serve as an attesting witness. Jim and Betty, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>proceeded to sign the Joint Will and Cannon notarized it without anyone else present.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b67 When they returned home from the meeting, Jim apparently told Betty to tear up the Original Will, which Betty did. After Jim\u2019s death, Betty applied to informally probate the Joint Will. Sandra objected to the informal probate and requested formal probate of the Original Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b68 On August 9, 2001, Judge McKittrick heard the will contest. He issued the Order admitting the Joint Will to probate on August 27, 2001. Sandra appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u00b69  Sandra argues that the judicial interpretation and construction of a will are questions of law. This appeal, however, does not involve interpreting or constructing a will. The dispositive issue is whether the District Court properly admitted the disputed will to probate. Determining whether a court properly admitted a will involves both questions of law and fact. <em>See In re Estate of Brooks </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 516, 519, 927 P.2d 1024, 1026. In <em>Brooks, </em>we described our standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">We will not disturb a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. A court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtI\"><em>Brooks, </em>279 Mont, at 519, 927 P.2d at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in admitting the Joint Will to formal probate?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">\u00b611  In contested cases, the proponent of a will must establish that the testator duly executed the will. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-3-310, MCA; <em>Brooks, </em>279 Mont, at 519, 927 P.2d at 1026. For a will to be valid, two people typically must witness the testator signing the will and then sign the will themselves. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-2-522(l)(c), MCA. If two individuals do not properly witness the document, \u00a7 72-2-523, MCA, provides that the document may still be treated as if it had been executed under certain circumstances. One such circumstance is if the proponent of the document establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended the document to be the decedent\u2019s will. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>523, MCA; <em>Brooks, </em>279 Mont, at 522, 927 P.2d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b612 Sandra urges this Court not to use \u00a7 72-2-523, MCA, \u201cto circumvent the statute requiring two witnesses to the execution of a will.\u201d Jim and Betty\u2019s failure to use witnesses, according to Sandra, was not an innocent omission on their part. She also expresses concern that the improperly witnessed Joint Will materially altered a longstanding agreement to divide the property. She primarily argues, however, that the Joint Will should be invalid as a matter of law because no one properly witnessed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b613 Sandra\u2019s numerous arguments about why the will was improperly witnessed are irrelevant to this appeal. Neither party disputes that no witnesses were present at the execution of Jim and Betty\u2019s Joint Will as required by \u00a7 72-2-522, MCA. In the absence of attesting witnesses, \u00a7 72-2-523, MCA, affords a means of validating a will for which the Montana Legislature expressly provides. The only question before this Court, therefore, is whether the District Court erred in concluding that Jim intended the Joint Will to be his will under \u00a7 72-2-523, MCA. We conclude that the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b614 The District Court made several findings of fact that supported its conclusion. In particular, it noted that the Joint Will specifically revoked all previous wills and codicils made by either Jim or Betty. Furthermore, the court found that, after they had executed the Joint Will, Jim directed Betty to destroy the Original Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u00b615 Sandra does not dispute any of the court\u2019s factual findings. She argues only that Betty testified that she and Jim had not executed the will even after they had signed it. In making this argument, she points to the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">Question: Do you know if [Jim] gave [Sandra and Charlotte] a copy of the new will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">Answer: I don\u2019t believe he did, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">Question: Do you know why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">Answer: Well, I guess because we didn\u2019t have the completed draft without all the scribbles on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">Question: So he thought that will was not good yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">Answer: No, he was sure it was good, but he didn\u2019t give it to the girls. And we didn\u2019t give it to my son. We didn\u2019t give it to anybody. Question: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">Answer: Because it wasn\u2019t completely finished the way Ross was going to finish it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">\u00b616 This testimony may suggest that Betty believed that the Joint Will was not in a final form because of \u201call the scribbles on it.\u201d Nevertheless, she immediately goes on to state that she believed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>will was good. When asked if it were Jim\u2019s and her intent for the Joint Will to stand as a will until they executed another one, she responded, \u201cYes, it was.\u201d The court could reasonably interpret this testimony to mean that Jim and Betty expected the Joint Will to stand as a will until Cannon provided one in a cleaner, more final form. Sandra points to no other evidence that suggests that Jim did not intend for the Joint Will to be his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b617  For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err in admitting the Joint Will into final probate. Because Jim directed Betty to destroy the Original Will, we also conclude that the District Court did not err in finding that these acts were acts of revocation of the Original Will under \u00a7 72-2-527, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
