We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b62 The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in terminating Tony\u2019s parental rights after the State conceded that he could have more time to complete his treatment plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">\u00b64 A.F. (mother) and Tony (father) are the natural parents of A.L., A.L. and C.L. The termination of A.F.\u2019s parental rights is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">\u00b65 The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) petitioned for temporary legal custody of A.L., A.L. and C.L. in November 2000. On February 2,2001, the District Court declared the children youths in need of care and granted DPHHS temporary legal custody. The parents stipulated to this determination. The court also approved and ordered treatment plans for the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">\u00b66 Tony\u2019s treatment plan required him to complete parenting classes, obtain a chemical dependency evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluation, maintain adequate housing and means of support, begin mental health counseling and visit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>maintain contact with the children through DPHHS. Although the court approved and ordered Tony\u2019s treatment plan in February 2001, Tony, who was incarcerated on a drug offense and then released, did not contact a DPHHS social worker or visit the children until July 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b67 On July 26, 2001, pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the court extended DPHHS\u2019 temporary legal custody for six months in order for the parents to complete the requirements of their treatment plans. Tony was present at this hearing. DPHHS social worker Lori Clark (Clark) testified that Tony had begun parenting classes, contacted a doctor to conduct a psychological evaluation and had begun the process to obtain a chemical health evaluation. He also had moved in with his mother and visited the children. However, in the month after the hearing, Tony tested positive for methamphetamine and cocaine and was arrested and incarcerated for violating the conditions of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b68 By the time of the court\u2019s review hearing set for January 2002, DPHHS had filed a petition for permanent legal custody and termination of parental rights. DPHHS alleged that Tony had failed to successfully comply with an ordered treatment plan and that his unfitness was unlikely to change within a reasonable period.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b69 The District Court held a hearing. Clark testified that prior to DPHHS\u2019 involvement in this case, Tony\u2019s parental rights were terminated with respect to another child due to parental neglect stemming from his substance abuse issues. She stated that while Tony had made some progress toward completing his treatment plan in the two months he was released from jail, he violated his bail conditions by using drugs and alcohol. She stated that he did well with his children at visits and that his interaction with them was appropriate and that she generally liked Tony. Clark testified that if he was sober and not incarcerated, he would be a proper placement for the children. However, due to Tony\u2019s ongoing addiction to drugs and alcohol, Clark recommended the termination of his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b610 Tony also testified. He admitted that he had a substance abuse problem and stated that he wanted to obtain inpatient treatment. Tony requested that the court extend the temporary legal custody for another six months so that he could obtain substance abuse treatment. At the same time, Tony conceded that he had verbally agreed to a plea agreement on the pending drug charges which included seven years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b611 With regard to Tony\u2019s request for an extension of temporary legal custody, the State responded that \u201c[Tony] is going to be incarcerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>for a long time. If the Court wants to give him some additional time until we see when his sentence is, that\u2019s fine with the State. He\u2019s at least partially complied with his treatment requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b612 Nevertheless, the District Court found that Tony, who did not attempt to meet the conditions of his treatment plan until five months after it was approved, had failed to even moderately comply with its requirements. The court found that Tony had a significant chemical dependency problem which he had not adequately addressed, that he was incarcerated for methamphetamine use during the period of these proceedings, and that he had not successfully accomplished any of the goals of his treatment plan. The court concluded that, due to Tony\u2019s extensive history with DPHHS, including having another child removed from his custody, as well as his noncompliance with his treatment plan, Tony\u2019s conduct and condition rendering him unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The court concluded that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate Tony\u2019s parental rights. Tony appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b613  In reviewing a decision to terminate parental rights, this Court determines whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re C.R.O., </em>2002 MT 50, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 48, \u00b6 10, 43 P.3d 913, \u00b610 (citation omitted). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re C.R.O., </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b614  It is well established that a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of his or her child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re C.R.O., </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Accordingly, with regard to the statutorily-required findings supporting termination of parental rights, we have stated that the burden is on the party seeking termination to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that every statutory requirement has been satisfied. <em>In re C.R.O., </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err in terminating Tony\u2019s parental rights after the State conceded that he could have more time to complete his treatment plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u00b616 The District Court reached its decision to terminate Tony\u2019s parental rights based on its conclusion that the following criteria set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (1999), were satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u00b617 On appeal, Tony claims that the court\u2019s decision to terminate his parental rights based upon his inability to change his conduct within a reasonable time was clearly erroneous since the State did not oppose allowing him additional time to comply with his treatment plan. He contends that according to the State\u2019s testimony, he was good with the children, and he should have been given more time to address his substance abuse problems. Tony insists that it was not in the children\u2019s best interests to terminate his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">\u00b618 We disagree. Although Tony was aware that DPHHS had removed his children from his home in November 2000, and obtained temporary legal custody of his children in February 2001, he failed to contact the social worker in the case until July 2001. Although he was incarcerated on drug charges for part of this time, Tony fails to sufficiently explain his lack of contact for the period he was not incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">\u00b619 Additionally, Tony attempted to comply with his treatment plan for less than two months before he violated the conditions of his release by continuing to use drugs. Tony admitted at the termination hearing that he had not completed his treatment plan because he was incarcerated. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s finding that Tony failed to even moderately comply with the requirements of his treatment plan was supported by substantial evidence and, thus, not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">\u00b620 Although the State conceded that it would not oppose allowing Tony additional time to complete his treatment plan until his sentence on the drug charges was known, the District Court\u2019s finding that Tony\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time was supported by substantial evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Tony\u2019s parental rights with regard to another child were previously terminated due to his substance abuse problems. We have stated that in making termination decisions, we must, to some extent, base the determination on a person\u2019s past conduct. <em>In re S.M., </em>2001 MT 11, \u00b6 41, 304 Mont. 102, \u00b6 41, 19 P.3d 213, \u00b6 41 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b621  Furthermore, during the instant proceedings, Tony was arrested and jailed on drug-related charges. By continuing his drug use, Tony ruined his chances for a favorable plea agreement and he instead, admittedly, faced several years of incarceration on the charges. Under these circumstances, the District Court correctly concluded that Tony\u2019s substance abuse problems were unlikely to change within a reasonable time. In so concluding, the District Court gave paramount consideration to the children\u2019s best interests. <em>See In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 33, 307 Mont. 328, \u00b6 33, 37 P.3d 690, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"A4l\">\u00b622  Therefore, we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the District Court\u2019s'findings that Tony failed to successfully complete the court-approved treatment plan and that his conduct rendering him unfit would not change within a reasonable time. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in terminating Tony\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b623 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
