We reverse and remand for a determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in holding that \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, does not impose strict liability on owners of trespassing livestock?</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">\u00b63 In 1996, the Huntley Ranch (Huntley) employed Madrid as a ranch hand. On or about May 26, 1996, a bull owned by Zenchiku, an adjoining ranch, was discovered on Huntley property. A Zenchiku employee named Gary James (James) came to retrieve the bull. After failed attempts to herd the bull through a gate, James, Madrid, James\u2019 wife and one other Huntley employee attempted to put the bull in a trailer. Although the bull got in the trailer, when James went to close the doors, the bull came out of the trailer and charged at Madrid, who was sitting on a horse about 30 feet behind the trailer. When the bull hit the horse, Madrid was knocked off and the bull went after him on the ground. Madrid suffered various injuries from this encounter which gave rise to this cause of action for strict liability in trespass against Zenchiku as owner of the bull.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">\u00b64 Before trial, both parties moved for summary judgment regarding whether Zenchiku was strictly liable under \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA. District Court Judge Robert J. Boyd granted summary judgment to Zenchiku and dismissed the strict liability in trespass count of Madrid\u2019s complaint, holding that the statute did not provide for strict liability. Subsequently, this Court issued <em>Larson-Murphy v. Steiner, </em>2000 MT 334, 303 Mont. 96, 15 P.3d 1205, which extensively discussed the history of open range law and the liability for damages caused by livestock. As a result of this opinion, Madrid moved for reconsideration of the previous order granting summary judgment to Zenchiku. Because Judge Boyd passed away, Judge Loren Tucker assumed oversight of the case. Judge Tucker agreed with Judge Boyd and denied Madrid\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Madrid now appeals from both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">\u00b65 We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment <em>de novo. Larson-Murphy, </em>\u00b6 20. In this case, summary judgment was granted based on the interpretation of a statute. Interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law. <em>Clover Leaf Dairy v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 380,389, 948 P.2d 1164, 1169; \u00a7 26-1-201, MCA. We review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in holding that \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, does not impose strict liability on owners of trespassing livestock?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b67 Although \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, was originally enacted in 1887, we have not had occasion to directly apply the standard of liability of a claim brought under this statute. Rather, this statute has only been discussed in its relation to other statutes; in contrast to claims not brought under it; or in relation to the exception to the statute for intentional conduct. <em>See e.g. Larson-Murphy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-69; <em>State v. Blakely </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 118, 122, 592 P.2d 501, 503; <em>Monroe v. Cannon </em>(1900), 24 Mont. 316, 326, 61 P. 863, 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b68 Section 81-4-215, MCA, entitled \u201cLiability of owners of stock for trespass\u201d reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">If any cattle, horses, mules, asses, hogs, sheep, llamas, alpacas, bison, or other domestic animals break into any enclosure and the fence of the enclosure is legal, as provided in 81-4-101, the owner of the animals is liable for all damages to the owner or occupant of the enclosure. This section may not be construed to require a legal fence in order to maintain an action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">In both of its orders, the District Court held that this section does not allow for strict liability. Rather, in the first order, the court held that the language \u201cis liable for all damages\u201d was \u201conly a reference to the measure of damages to be considered by the Court and adds no greater degree of liability on the owner of a trespassing animal.\u201d The second order held that \u201c[t]he open range concept is directly contrasted with strict liability,\u201d and that our intervening decision in <em>Larson-Murphy </em>did not require a change in the District Court\u2019s first order because <em>Larson-Murphy </em>did not address the relationship between adjoining landowners. Finally, while neither order expressly stated that the statute provides for a negligence standard, the language of both orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>implies that a negligence standard applies because both orders state that strict liability does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b69 Madrid asserts that the District Court erred in holding that \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, does not provide for strict liability. He bases his argument on the plain language \u201cis liable for all damages\u201d contained in the statute. He also argues that the history and policy of the open range doctrine illustrate that the Legislature intended to enact a strict liability standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b610 Zenchiku asserts the District Court correctly granted summary judgment because the statute provides for a negligence standard and further asserts that a strict liability interpretation would be a new development in Montana law. It also argues that strict liability is inappropriate because the definition of a legal fence is one which would not provide an absolute barrier against bulls or cows entering enclosed property and because cattle routinely jump fences. Zenchiku also argues that strict liability is inappropriate in the face of an owner\u2019s reasonable attempts to. keep cattle fenced in open range country. Zenchiku further asserts that the cooperative relations between these adjoining owners, mutual efforts by both ranches to keep bulls from going onto the other\u2019s property, and a fence for which costs and maintenance are a shared responsibility should all provide for a shared negligence standard. Zenchiku also argues that trespass does not necessarily imply strict liability, but can incorporate the concept of fault. Finally, in addition to its negligence argument, Zenchiku also argues that the fence at issue here does not fit the requirements of the statute and that consequently, Madrid does not meet the elements required by the statute to receive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b611 As mentioned above, we have not had occasion to directly address the standard of liability provided for in \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, as most of our previous cases involving livestock trespass concern intentional trespass onto unenclosed land. However, we recently reviewed the history of open range law in <em>Larson-Murphy. </em>While that case did not consider the situation of adjoining landowners presented here, <em>Larson-Murphy </em>did explain how \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, relates to the general framework of the open range doctrine. To briefly restate the relevant discussion in Larson-Murphy, under English common law an owner of livestock has the burden to <em>fence in </em>livestock because that owner is strictly liable for any damages caused by their livestock. In contrast, under the open range doctrine, owners of livestock do not have to fence in their livestock because they are not generally liable for damage caused by those livestock. Rather, if another landowner wants to recover for damages caused by trespassing livestock, that landowner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>has the burden to <em>fence out </em>trespassing livestock. <em>Larson-Murphy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-44, 69, 84, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\">\u00b612 <em>Larson-Murphy </em>noted that this change occurred because of the vast land area required to graze livestock in the arid western United States. As a result, the open range doctrine changed the English common law by shifting the burden of building fences from livestock owners to those who would want to keep livestock out, namely farmers. <em>Larson-Murphy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. We noted in <em>Larson-Murphy </em>that the intent of \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, was to codify this change. <em>Larson-Murphy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40, 69, 84. <em>See also Blakely, </em>181 Mont, at 122, 592 P.2d at 503 (\u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, provides a civil remedy for trespassing cattle); <em>Montgomery v. Gehring </em>(1965), 145 Mont. 278, 283, 400 P.2d 403, 406 (\u201cOne releasing his livestock onto lands where he has a right to do so is under no duty to restrain them from entering another\u2019s unenclosed land.\u201d); <em>Hughey v. Fergus County </em>(1934), 98 Mont. 98, 101-02, 37 P.2d 1035, 1036; Fant <em>v. Lyman </em>(1889), 9 Mont. 61, 62, 22 P. 120, 121; <em>Smith v. Williams </em>(1874), 2 Mont. 195; Ryan M. Archer, <em>Searching for the Montana Open Range: A Judicial and Legislative Struggle to Balance Tradition and Modernization in an Evolving West, </em>63 Mont. L. Rev. 197, 203-04 (2002) (the \u201cessence of this statute remains preserved in the current Montana Code Annotated.\u201d). Therefore, we agree with Madrid that the intent of \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, is to follow the open range doctrine by providing a strict liability remedy for trespassing livestock to landowners who enclose their property with a legal fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b613 Zenchiku argues that since the open range doctrine changed English common law, what changed was the standard of strict liability. We disagree. Rather, the discussion in <em>Larson-Murphy </em>makes clear that the standard of strict liability remained and the only thing that changed was who had the burden to fence in order to gain protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b614  In addition to the history and policy behind \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, the plain language of the statute indicates a strict liability standard because it states the owner of the livestock \u201cis\u201d liable. In contrast, in <em>Ambrogini v. Todd, </em>we held that language such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d or \u201callow\u201d provides for a negligence standard. <em>Ambrogini v. Todd </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 111, 119-20, 642 P.2d 1013, 1018, <em>overruled on other grounds by Larson-Murphy, </em>\u00b6 79. No such language is present in this statute. Further, to interpret \u201cis hable\u201d as a negligence standard would defeat the purpose of the statute. As Madrid points out, if the standard under the statute were negligence, a potential plaintiff does not gain anything by building a fence because that plaintiff could bring a negligence action with or without a fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u00b615 Having determined that the statute provides for a strict liability standard, we next address Zenchiku\u2019s argument that Madrid did not meet the elements required in order to recover under the statute. Zenchiku asserts that the fence at issue here does not meet the statutory requirements because there was no evidence that Huntley constructed or maintained the entire fence which enclosed the area of the Huntley ranch where the incident occurred and which separates the Huntley and Zenchiku ranches. Further, Zenchiku asserts that maintenance of the fence is shared by Huntley and Zenchiku. Zenchiku makes this argument despite its statement in its brief on appeal that the \u201csole and narrow issue on appeal is whether Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 81-4-215 imposes a standard of strict liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b616 In its orders regarding interpretation of the statute, the District Court did not consider any of these issues regarding the fence. Rather, the court stated that \u201c[t]he parties agree that the land was enclosed by a legal fence.\u201d Therefore, the court did not consider any of the issues regarding the fence which Zenchiku now raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b617 The statute itself does not state any requirements regarding who builds or maintains the \u201clegal\u201d fence. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 81-4-101, MCA. Rather, the language of the statute makes clear that liability is imposed if the fence is legal, the animal trespassing or breaking into the enclosure is not supposed to be there, and an owner or occupant entitled to be in the enclosure incurs damages. Therefore, under the terms of the statute, it is irrelevant who builds or maintains the \u201clegal fence.\u201d Rather, relative liability is determined depending on whether an animal broke into an enclosure and whether someone is an owner or occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b618  In this case, there is no dispute that Zenchiku\u2019s bull broke into an enclosure and no dispute that Madrid was a proper occupant of the enclosure. Further, Zenchiku does not dispute that the fence here meets the definition of a legal fence in \u00a7 81-4-101, MCA. Therefore, Madrid met all the requirements needed to recover under \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, and is entitled to damages because Zenchiku is strictly liable for the actions of its trespassing bull.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b619 Finally, in making this holding, we recognize that a statute written over a century ago may no longer fit the cooperative practices for building fences or managing stray livestock referred to by Zenchiku. Further, when the open range doctrine was established and codified by \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, much of the land was unfenced. Therefore the statute did not contemplate the current situation in which large ranches are entirely enclosed. However, we must interpret the statute as written and must give effect to the statute\u2019s original intent. Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>other action is properly left to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b620 Because the District Court erred in holding that \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, does not provide for strict liability, and because Madrid met all the requirements of the statute, we reverse and remand for a determination of damages.</p>\n<judges id=\"b523-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, RICE, COTTER, TRIEWEILER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b523-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"APL\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b621 I specially concur in the Court\u2019s opinion. I strenuously dissented from the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Larson-Murphy </em>and still believe it was incorrect. The Court having stated the law in that case, however, I am as bound by it as are all other Montanans. The Court properly incorporates <em>Larson-Murphy </em>into its discussion and analysis in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u00b622 Moreover, I agree entirely with the Court\u2019s interpretation of the plain language of \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA. To vary it in response to Zenchiku\u2019s arguments would be to overstep both our constitutional obligation to refrain from exercising power properly belonging to the Legislature and our statutory obligations with regard to the interpretation of statutes. <em>See </em>Art. Ill, Sec. 1, Mont. Const.; \u00a7\u00a7 1-2-101 through 1-2-208, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u00b623 Addressing several of Zenchiku\u2019s specific arguments, I offer the following observations. Regarding the assertion that a strict liability interpretation would be a new development in Montana law, I need state only that the Court and I totally agree. The reason, as the Court points out, is that the statute at issue here has not been interpreted by this Court during its 115-year history. Such interpretations, when a new matter is raised, often result in \u201ca new development in Montana law.\u201d Next, Zenchiku\u2019s several arguments that strict liability is \u201cinappropriate\u201d should be addressed to the Legislature which created \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, not to this Court. The same is true of Zenchiku\u2019s assertion that cooperative relations, mutual efforts and shared responsibility for costs and maintenance for the fence \u201cshould provide for a shared negligence standard.\u201d Such changes in \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, properly can be made only by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">\u00b624 In sum, I join in the Court\u2019s opinion and result, notwithstanding my previous dissent in <em>Larson-Murphy.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
