Dickerson was sentenced 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count One and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count Two, to run concurrently. On appeal, Dickerson argues that: (1) the court\u2019s supplemental jury instruction indicating that force could be implied from a disparity in coercive power or size impermissibly lowered the government\u2019s burden to prove force; (2) his convictions violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy; and (3) his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Typically, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal correctness of a jury instruction, <em>United States v. Webb, </em>655 F.3d 1238, 1249 n. 8 (11th Cir.2011), and a double jeopardy challenge, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1126 (11th Cir.2008). However, issues raised for the first time on appeal\u2014 like Dickerson\u2019s claims concerning the jury instruction and double jeopardy \u2014 are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, the defendant must show: (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>We may then exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if \u201c \u2018the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). There is no plain error if no statute, rule, or binding precedent directly resolves the issue. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">First, we are unpersuaded by Dickerson\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred in instructing the jury on force. We review alleged errors in a jury instruction to assess whether the court\u2019s charge, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues involved and were not misled. <em>United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1386 (11th Cir.1992). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a), an individual is guilty of aggravated sexual abuse by force or threat where that person: (1) in a United States jurisdiction; (2) knowingly causes another person to engage in a sexual act; (3) by using force or by using threats or the fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">As the record before us shows, the district court responded to a jury question about the legal definition of \u201cforce\u201d with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The element of force, as with all the elements of the offense charged in Count One of the Indictment, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This additional instruction must be considered along with all of the Court\u2019s previous instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">To establish force, the government need not demonstrate that the defendant used actual violence. The requirement of force may be satisfied by a showing of restraint sufficient to prevent the victim from escaping the sexual conduct. Force may also be implied from a disparity in coercive power or in size between the defendant and the victim or from the disparity [in] coercive power combined with physical restraint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqL\">Dickerson now argues on appeal that this instruction erroneously suggested that force could be implied from a disparity in coercive power or size, and impermissibly lowered the government\u2019s burden to prove force.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">However, Dickerson cannot show plain error here because, as he concedes, there is no controlling authority that supports his claim. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291. Dickerson asserts that the district court\u2019s definition of force permits the jury to convict a defendant under \u00a7 2241(a) where no physical force beyond the act of penetration is present. But, importantly, he has not established that \u00a7 2241(a) requires an element of <em>physical </em>force. Moreover, even if we were to review Dickerson\u2019s claim <em>de novo, </em>any error in the district court\u2019s instruction would be harmless because the victim\u2019s testimony was that Dickerson, along with two other males, used physical force in holding her down and making her have oral and vaginal intercourse with them. <em>See Webb, </em>655 F.3d at 1249 n. 8 (\u201cJury instructions are subject to harmless error review.\u201d). As a result, there was no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s supplemental jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">We also reject Dickerson\u2019s argument that \u2014 based on the supplemental jury instruction \u2014 the district court committed plain error by convicting him in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy. Where the defendant\u2019s same conduct violated two statutory provisions, courts first must determine whether the legislature intended each violation to be a separate offense. <em>Garrett v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 773, 778, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985). Cumulative punishments for a single instance of criminal behavior are not prohibited if the legislature clearly intended to prescribe cumulative punishments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">When there is no clear indication of legislative intent, however, the courts must determine whether \u201ceach provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). The Supreme Court has clarified that the <em>Blockburger </em>test asks whether each offense contains an element not contained in the other, and establishes that double jeopardy bars additional punishment and successive prosecution if they do not. <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 696, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993). Where each provision requires proof of an element that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, notwithstanding \u201ca substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes.\u201d <em>Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a), an individual is guilty of sexual abuse of a minor where that person: (1) in a United States jurisdiction; (2) knowingly engages in a sexual act; (3) with another person who is between the ages of 12 and 16 and is at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>4 years younger than the offender. Describing both \u00a7 2241(a), which we\u2019ve paraphrased above, and \u00a7 2243(a), the House Report for the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">Whether a sexual act involving a minor less than 16 years old is criminal (and, if it is, the severity of the offense) will depend upon the circumstances involved. If the young person is between the ages of 12 and 16, and if force is used or if threats of death, serious bodily harm, or kidnapping are involved, the applicable provision is proposed section 2241(a). If the child is less than 12 years old and if force is used or threats of death, serious bodily harm, or kidnapping are involved, both proposed section 2241(a) and proposed section 2241(c) are applicable. If the young person is between the ages of 12 and 16, and other threats are used, the applicable provision is proposed section 2242(1). If the child is less than 12 years old, the applicable provisions are proposed sections 2241(c) and 2242(1). If the offender renders a young person between the ages of 12 and 16 unconscious or administers a drug to that young person (by force, threats, or without the knowledge or permission of the child), then the applicable provision is proposed section 2241(b). The applicable provisions are proposed sections 2241(b) and 2241(c) if the child is under 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">If none of those factors are involved, however, then the ages of the participants are important. If the victim is less than 12 years old, then there is an offense whatever the age of the other party. If the young person is at least 12 but not 16 years old, however, the age of the other party becomes relevant. If the other person is 4 or more years older than the young person, then there is an offense under proposed section 2243(a). If the young person is not 4 or more years younger than the other person, then there is no offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">H.R. Rep. 99-594 at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Here, Dickerson once again cannot show plain error because there is no controlling authority that supports his claim. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291. Looking to the legislative intent, it is ambiguous whether Congress intended to allow cumulative punishments for his underlying conduct. Regardless, under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, \u00a7 2241(a) and \u00a7 2243(a) require proof of an element that the other does not. <em>See Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 785 n. 17, 95 S.Ct. 1284. Under \u00a7 2241(a), a defendant is only guilty if h\u00e9 uses <em>some sort of force </em>or threats to cause another person to engage in a sexual act, and there is no age element. Under \u00a7 2243(a), no such force or threat of force is required, but there is an age element in that the other person must be between the ages of 12 and 16 and be at least 4 years younger than the defendant. Accordingly, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, concerning Dickerson\u2019s double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Finally, we decline to consider Dickerson\u2019s claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by conceding that he committed the act of having sex with a minor but failing to argue the affirmative defense that he believed that the victim was older than 16. We generally do not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal \u201cwhere the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). An appellate court usually cannot adequately decide an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim raised for the first time on direct appeal because the focus at trial was not whether defense counsel\u2019s actions were prejudicial or supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>reasonable strategy. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). The preferable means for deciding a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a habeas corpus petition, \u201ceven if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The ineffective-assistance-of-counsel test is comprised of two prongs: (1) deficient performance; and (2) prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The Supreme Court has identified three exceptions to the prejudice requirement, in situations that were \u201cso likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). One of Cronic\u2019s exceptions is where \u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039. In the context of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, we have held that counsel\u2019s tactical decision to concede a defendant\u2019s guilt designed to lead the jury toward leniency on other charges and to provide a basis for a later argument for a lighter sentence is deemed to be effective assistance. <em>Darden v. United States, </em>708 F.3d 1225, 1230 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2871, 186 L.Ed.2d 922 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(c)(1), it is a defense that the defendant reasonably believed that the other person was at least 16 years old. The defendant must establish this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Here, the district court did not address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the record is not sufficiently developed for us to review whether Dickerson\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690. Given the strategic choice to make the concession that Dickerson had sex with a minor, it is possible that counsel also made a strategic decision to forego the affirmative defense that he believed the victim was over the age of 16. There simply is no evidence in the record to substantiate or disprove Dickerson\u2019s assertions regarding counsel\u2019s investigation and consideration of the defense. Because a factual record has not been sufficiently developed for an ineffective-assistance claim against Dickerson\u2019s trial counsel, we will not address such a claim on direct appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
