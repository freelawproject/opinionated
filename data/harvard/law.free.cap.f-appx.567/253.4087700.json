Santos Felix-Hernandez (Felix) was convicted of being an alien found in the United' States without permission after having been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326; he was sentenced to six months in prison and two years of non-reporting supervised release. On appeal, Felix challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss his indictment. He contends that he cannot be \u201cfound in\u201d the United States because he had voluntarily presented himself for immigration inspection when he entered the southbound exit lane at the port of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u201cA challenge to an indictment based on the legal sufficiency of uncontested facts is an issue of law reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>404 F.3d 320, 326 (5th Cir.2005). To prove Felix\u2019s offense of conviction, the Government was required to establish four elements: (1) alienage, (2) arrest and deportation, (3) unlawful presence in the United States, and (4) lack of the Attorney General\u2019s consent to reenter. <em>United States v. Flores-Peraza, </em>58 F.3d 164, 166 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Felix stipulated to the facts necessary to prove these elements, namely, that he was a citizen of Mexico, he was previously deported, he was \u201cin the United States\u201d when he was stopped (encountered) by the immigration officer, and he did not receive permission to renter the United States. <em>See Flores-Peraza, </em>58 F.3d at 166; <em>see United States v. Ramos-Flores, </em>233 Fed.Appx. 347, 348, 350 (5th Cir.2007). His reliance upon <em>United States v. Angeles-Mascote, </em>206 F.3d 529 (5th Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. Canals-Jimenez, </em>943 F.2d 1284 (11th Cir.1991), is misplaced. In those cases, the alien defendants were attempting to <em>enter </em>the United States through a port of entry. Here, Felix had already illegally entered the United States without detection and was attempting to <em>exit </em>the United States through a port of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
