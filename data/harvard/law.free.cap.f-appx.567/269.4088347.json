The district court dismissed Oguntodu\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2), 1915A; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c). Oguntodu also filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his postjudgment motion filed pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We normally review the dismissal of a civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim de novo, using the same standard applicable to dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See Rogers v. Boatright, </em>709 F.3d 403, 407 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder that standard, a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted when it does not contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>709 F.3d at 407 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In this case, however, since Oguntodu did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which was adopted by the district court, our review is only for plain error. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">To the extent that Oguntodu claims that the defendants inadequately treated him \u2022with respect to his diabetic condition and his requests for diabetic supplies, his disagreements with his medical treatment and his allegations of negligence and unprofessional behavior do not state valid claims of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Nor did Oguntodu allege facts giving rise to a valid Eighth Amendment claim in connection with the collection of a $100 copayment for health care services. <em>See Morris v. Livingston, </em>739 F.3d 740, 748-49 (5th Cir.2014). We do not consider Oguntodu\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that prison security staff denied him access to medical care. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Finally, by failing to address the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 59(e) motion, Oguntodu has abandoned any challenge to that denial. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Oguntodu\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Oguntodu\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim each count as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Oguntodu that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
