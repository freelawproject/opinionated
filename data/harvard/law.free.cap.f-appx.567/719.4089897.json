Mr. Wordley alleged in his complaint that Officer San Miguel used excessive force against him during an arrest, resulting in his broken finger. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">According to Mr. Wordley, on the afternoon of Friday, April 8, 2011, he and his minor nephew got into a verbal argument at the residence Mr. Wordley shared with his mother. This argument turned into a physical altercation, prompting Mr. Word-ley to leave the home to avoid any further incidents with his nephew. Mr. Wordley returned to his residence that same evening around midnight. After he entered the house, his security alarm company called twice for security checks and he told them that everything was fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-18\">Shortly thereafter, Mr. Wordley saw Officer San Miguel \u2014 who had been dispatched to the residence \u2014 come around the side of the house, pointing a gun at him. Using several expletives, Officer San Miguel ordered Mr. Wordley on the ground. Mr. Wordley complied with Officer San Miguel\u2019s order and told him \u201cthat [he] was down and [he] was not moving.\u201d <em>See </em>D.E. 1 at 9. Officer San Miguel then placed his knee on the middle of Mr. Wordley\u2019s back and grabbed his left hand and put it behind his back. Officer San Miguel then reached for Mr. Wordley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>right hand, but was obstructed by the leg of an adjacent table. Despite Mr. Word-ley\u2019s pleadings for him to stop, Officer San Miguel continued to twist Mr. Wordley\u2019s left hand while trying to reach his right hand. Mr. Wordley felt \u201ca sharp pain and heard [his] finger pop\u201d as Officer San Miguel placed the handcuffs on both hands. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Mr. Wordley was taken to the police station, during which time he repeatedly requested medical assistance. While at the station, Mr. Wordley asked Officer San Miguel why he broke his finger, to which Officer San Miguel responded by telling him to \u201cshut up\u201d and \u201cplac[irig] his hand around [Mr. Wordley\u2019s] neck in a choking position.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 10.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Eventually, another officer at the station called 9-1-1. The responding paramedics stated that the finger was likely broken, a diagnosis which was confirmed later at the hospital, where Mr. Wordley was also informed that surgery would be necessary to repair the broken finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Declining to adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court granted Officer San Miguel\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice, concluding that Mr. Word-ley did not meet his burden of establishing that qualified immunity should not apply. Specifically, the district court ruled that Mr. Wordley did not \u201cestablish that case law, at the time of the incident, clearly established that [Officer San Miguel] was using excessive force,\u201d nor did his complaint \u201cfall within the narrow exception when there is an absence of case law.\u201d <em>See </em>D.E. 28 at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Leib v. Hillsborough Cnty. Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2009). The facts as pleaded must \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">Qualified immunity is \u201can immunity from suit, rather than merely a defense to liability.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (internal emphasis omitted). It \u201cprotects government officials performing discretionary functions from suits in their individual capacities unless their conduct violates \u2018clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Andujar v. Rodriguez, </em>486 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). To be entitled to qualified immunity, a defendant must first establish that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority, meaning the government employee must have been performing a legitimate job-related function, or pursuing a job-related goal, through means that were within the official\u2019s power to utilize. <em>See Mathews v. Crosby, </em>480 F.3d 1265, 1269 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1265 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">Once the defendant has established that he was acting within his discretionary authority, \u201cthe burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that qualified immunity is not appropriate,\u201d <em>Mathews, </em>480 F.3d at 1269, by showing: \u201c(1) the defendant violated a constitutional right, and (2) this right was clearly established at the time of the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>leged violation.\u201d <em>Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1264. We may consider these two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis in any order. <em>See Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 228, 236, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">From the record, it is clear that Officer San Miguel was acting within his discretionary authority in arresting Mr. Wordley after being dispatched to his home, and Mr. Wordley does not claim that Officer San Miguel lacked probable cause for the arrest. The burden, therefore, shifts to Mr. Wordley to show that Officer San Miguel violated a clearly established right by injuring his finger while twisting his hand to secure handcuffs during the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Even if Officer San Miguel\u2019s actions did constitute excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Mr. Wordley has not shown that the rights allegedly deprived were clearly established at the time of the incident. In order to demonstrate that a right has been clearly established, a plaintiff may: (1) show that a materially similar case has already been decided; (2) identify a \u201cbroader, clearly established principle [that] should control the novel facts [of the] situation\u201d; or (3) argue that the conduct at issue so obviously violated the constitution that existing case law is unnecessary. <em>See Loftus v. Clark-Moore, </em>690 F.3d 1200, 1204-05 (11th Cir.2012). Mr. Wordley has not presented a \u201cmaterially similar\u201d case which would put Officer San Miguel on notice that his conduct was unlawful. Understanding the need to balance the potential intrusion on an individual\u2019s rights against countervailing governmental interests, \u201cFourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). \u201cWe do not use hindsight to judge the acts of police officers,\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Farrell, </em>280 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2002), and \u201c[n]ot every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge\u2019s chambers ... violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the officer\u2019s conduct during an arrest aggravated the plaintiffs pre-existing injury, resulting in more than twenty-five subsequent surgeries and the eventual amputation of the plaintiffs arm. We held that, despite the gravity of this injury, the force used by the officer did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation because he had used an otherwise \u201ccommon non-excessive handcuffing technique,\u201d and had no knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s pre-existing condition. <em>Rodriguez, </em>280 F.3d at 1351. Similarly, here, we carefully consider the circumstances surrounding the arrest and do not rely solely on an ex post assessment of the resulting injury. Although unfortunate, Mr. Wordley\u2019s injury occurred while Officer San Miguel attempted to secure handcuffs during the normal course of an arrest, and therefore, Officer San Miguel was not put on notice\u2014particularly in light of <em>Rodriguez </em>\u2014 that his actions were potentially unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In support of his claim, Mr. Wordley cites to <em>Smith v. Mattox, </em>127 F.3d 1416 (11th Cir.1997), a case which helps define the less-than-clear line between excessive and acceptable force. In <em>Smith, </em>the officer placed his knee on the plaintiffs back and pulled his left arm behind his back to secure handcuffs during an arrest. This put the plaintiffs forearm into a position that caused him discomfort. When the plaintiff complained, the officer then, \u201cwith a grunt and a blow,\u201d broke the plaintiff\u2019s arm. <em>Id. </em>at 1418. We found that this was a \u201cvery close case\u201d and the officer\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>duct \u201cbarely\u201d reached beyond the \u201chazy border between excessive and acceptable force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1419. Specifically, \u201cthe grunt and the blow that [the plaintiff] asserted] that he heard and felt while [the officer] was on [the plaintiffs] back, coupled with the severity of [the plaintiffs] injury, push[ed] this case over the line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although there are some similarities between the facts alleged by Mr. Wordley and the events in <em>Smith, </em>that case cannot be considered fair notice to Officer San Miguel. Here, Officer San Miguel\u2019s twisting of Mr. Wordley\u2019s hand while applying handcuffs during arrest lacks the gratuitous, separate blow that pushed \u2014 just barely \u2014 the officer\u2019s actions in <em>Smith </em>over the line between permissible and prohibited force. <em>See id. </em>Given <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Smith, </em>even if Officer San Miguel\u2019s actions constituted excessive force, the potential constitutional violation at issue was not clearly established by existing case law at the time of Mr. Wordley\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Nor has Mr. Wordley shown that, even in the absence of case law, Officer San Miguel\u2019s conduct \u201clies to so obviously at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to [him].\u201d <em>Priester, </em>208 F.3d at 926. This standard, which \u201centails determining whether \u2018application of the [excessive force] standard would inevitably lead every reasonable officer in [the Defendants\u2019] position to conclude the force was unlawful,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 926-27 (alterations in original), has not been met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order of dismissal based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-12\">. Unlike the district court, we do not consider the events described in the police reports attached to Officer San Miguel\u2019s motion to dismiss. Given what Mr. Wordley alleged, we cannot say that the events referenced in the reports \u2014 even if central to Mr. Wordley\u2019s claim \u2014 are undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">. Mr. Wordley did not make any claims in his complaint regarding the alleged \"choking\u201d by Officer San Miguel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-15\">. As Mr. Wordley is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>his pleadings are liberally construed. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
