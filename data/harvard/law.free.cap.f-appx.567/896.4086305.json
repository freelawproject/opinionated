Hall appeals his convictions and total 92-month sentence for two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). On appeal, Hall argues that (1) \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, both facially and as applied to him, and (2) the district court erred in concluding that Hall\u2019s prior conviction for escape during transport, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40, constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 and 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-19\">We generally review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 356, 181 L.Ed.2d 225 (2011). However, where a defendant fails to challenge the constitutionality of a statute in the trial court, we will only review its constitutionality for plain error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2006). Under plain error review, we will only reverse where there was (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. A defendant\u2019s unconditional guilty plea waives any challenge to whether the evidence established a sufficient connection with interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Ternus, </em>598 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-22\">We may disregard the holding of a prior panel of the Court only where it has been overruled by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009). We have previously held that \u00a7 922(g) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>constitutional because it requires proof that the firearm that is the subject of the conviction has a nexus to interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>268 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2001). Even a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d is sufficient to satisfy the Commerce Clause. <em>Jordan, </em>635 F.3d at 1189. We have held that proof that a firearm travelled interstate, even where the defendant only possessed it intrastate, satisfied the required \u201cminimal nexus.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Hall\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional because it does not require a sufficient interstate nexus to satisfy the Commerce Clause is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Kaley, </em>579 F.3d at 1255; <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1274. To the extent that Hall raises an \u201cas applied\u201d constitutional challenge \u2014 that his conviction does not contain a sufficient interstate nexus as an evidentiary matter to pass constitutional muster \u2014 his guilty plea waived that argument. <em>See Ternus, </em>598 F.3d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 824 (11th Cir.2013). Specifically, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of calculating a base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>714 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">In sentencing, the district court may consider any evidence heard during trial or admitted to by a guilty plea, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989). Further, a fact that is admitted during a guilty plea cannot be contested when it appears in the PSI. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The guideline range for convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. U.S.S.G., App. A. Under \u00a7 2K2.1, a base offense level of 26 applies where (1) the offense involved a semiautomatic firearm that is capable of accepting a large capacity firearm, and (2) the defendant committed the offense after having been convicted of two felony crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1). The associated commentary instructs that \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means the same in this provision as it does in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) and the associated commentary. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.1). Under the Guidelines, a prior conviction can be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in one of three ways. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.2(a). Under the \u201celements clause,\u201d an offense is a crime of violence if it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1). Second, the offense could also be one of the enumerated offenses of \u201cburglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion\u201d or an offense that \u201cinvolves the use of explosives....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2). Last, under the \u201cresidual clause,\u201d an offense can be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d if it \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">The ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is virtually identical to \u00a7 4B 1.2\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. Accordingly, we have reasoned that decisions regarding what constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA apply to a determination of whether an offense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 n. 2 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 288, 184 L.Ed.2d 169 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">Under Florida law, any prisoner who escapes from a place of confinement, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>while being transported to or from a place of confinement, is guilty of a felony. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40. We have recognized that \u00a7 944.40 can be violated in at least four ways: (1) escape from jail; (2) escape from custody while being transported to or from jail; (3) escape from a road camp; and (4) escape from custody while working upon the public roads. <em>United States v. Proch, </em>637 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th Cir.2011). In <em>Proeh, </em>the defendant was guilty of either the first or second category of escape. <em>Id. </em>at 1267-68. We held that escape under either category constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69. We reasoned, \u201cEscapes from custody, like burglary, will almost always involve the police attempting to apprehend the escapee and are likely to cause an eruption of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1269 (quotation omitted). We also stated that escape from custody is \u201cpurposeful, violent and aggressive because it involves a choice that will almost certainly be responded to with force, and potentially violent force, by the police.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Here, Hall\u2019s guilty plea included an admission that he had previously been convicted of \u201cescape during transport\u201d under Florida law. To the extent that Hall may not have expressly admitted that fact in his plea colloquy, the PSI also reflected that he was convicted of escape during transport, and Hall did not object to that characterization. The fact that Hall was convicted of escape during transport was, therefore, admitted for sentencing purposes. <em>See Wilson, </em>884 F.2d at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Our holding in <em>Proch </em>is controlling here. <em>See Proch, </em>637 F.3d at 1268-69. While <em>Proeh </em>involved the ACCA, we have previously recognized that the ACCA definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d and the Guidelines definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d are virtually identical. <em>See Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 975 n. 2. Hall argues that Proeh\u2019s holding does not apply here because Hall was not an armed career criminal and posed a lower risk of violence in an escape. That argument is unpersuasive. Our rationale in <em>Proch </em>for holding that escape during transport constituted a violent felony had nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s status as an armed career criminal or his individual likelihood of violence. Rather, we focused on the risk that an escape would prompt a violent response from police. <em>See Proch, </em>637 F.3d at 1269. Therefore, there is no apparent reason not to apply <em>Proeh\u2019s </em>ACCA holding here to the guidelines definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Further, Hall\u2019s argument that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague is foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d at 978 n. 3 (recognizing that the Supreme Court has rejected a challenge to the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, and noting that the rejection appeared to foreclose a conclusion by a lower court that the guidelines residual clause was unconstitutionally vague). Accordingly, we affirm Hall\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
