DaCruz, appointed counsel for Benjamin Caine in this appeal of his revocation of supervised release and his resulting sentence, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Caine\u2019s revocation and his resulting sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
