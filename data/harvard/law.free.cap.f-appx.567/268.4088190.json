Christoph asserted that his constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by the confiscation of his artwork. The district court conducted an independent review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Citing <em>Parrott v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 544, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), the district court dismissed Christoph\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review de novo the dismissal for failure to state a claim by accepting the plaintiffs factual allegations as true and determining whether no relief could be granted consistent with those allegations. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 763-64 (5th Cir.2003). Under the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, \u201ca deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest caused by a state employee\u2019s random, unauthorized conduct does not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 procedural due process claim, unless the State fails to provide an adequate postdeprivation remedy.\u201d <em>See Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 115, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). The <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, which affects only procedural due process claims, does not apply to Christoph\u2019s First Amendment freedom of expression claim, a substantive constitutional claim. <em>See Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 125-28, 110 S.Ct. 975; <em>Thibodeaux v. Bordelon, </em>740 F.2d 329, 333 (5th Cir.1984). As the substantive First Amendment claim could not be properly dismissed under the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, the dismissal for failure to state a claim based on the doctrine was error. The dismissal is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for additional proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
