Based on the record, the district court did not err by denying the 60(b) motion: the Friebels failed to show that their repeatedly omitting (in the face of court directions) to respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to enforce the settlement agreement was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. On appeal, they also have failed to advance an argument that they have a meritorious defense to the motion that is likely to prevail. No abuse of discretion has been shown. For background, see <em>In re Worldwide Web Systems, Inc., 328 F.3d 1291 </em>(11th Cir.2003). Moreover, on the recusal-sua-sponte issue, the district judge did not err: because the record shows no evidence of pervasive bias. <em>See Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
