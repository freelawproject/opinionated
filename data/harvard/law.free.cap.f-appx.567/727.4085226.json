After careful review, we deny in part and dismiss in part Reis\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-29\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Id. </em>The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that an alien may file only one motion to reopen proceedings with the BIA. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). The INA also states that a motion to reopen must generally be filed within 90 days after the BIA enters its final administrative order of removal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Given these restrictions on motions to reopen, we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion by denying Reis\u2019s second motion to reopen. Reis does not dispute that the INA allows a petitioner to file only one motion to reopen. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A). Neither does she allege that an exception to this rule applies here. <em>See id. </em>She therefore has abandoned this argument on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). In any event, the BIA also properly rejected Reis\u2019s motion because it was untimely filed on May 30, 2013, more than 90 days after the BIA issued its final administrative removal order on February 16, 2012. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Reis implies that her second motion to reopen was timely because she had petitioned this Court to review the BIA\u2019s first motion to reopen, which was not dismissed until May 14, 2013. Reis also points out that she had filed a motion to reconsider with this Court, which was not denied until August 14, 2013. Reis\u2019s argument is unavailing, however, because the INA does not delay the deadline for filing a motion to reopen simply because there are pending proceedings in this Court. <em>Cf. </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C) (providing an exhaustive list of the exceptions to the 90-day deadline for motions to reopen). As a result, we deny Reis\u2019s petition to review the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Finally, to the extent Reis petitions this Court to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen her proceedings on its own motion, we must dismiss the petition because we lack jurisdiction. <em>See Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e hold that the BIA\u2019s decision whether to reopen proceedings on its own motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is committed to agency discretion by law. We are, therefore, constrained to conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
