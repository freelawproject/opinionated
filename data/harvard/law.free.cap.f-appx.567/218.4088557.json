He was sentenced to 100 months of imprisonment. In his sole issue on appeal, Cosio Gomez argues that the district court should have granted him a minor role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because he was less culpable than the other participants in the offense. He also argues that the district court\u2019s denial of the reduction was influenced by incorrect assertions that his conduct should be compared to that of an \u201caverage\u201d drug courier.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">To qualify for a minor role reduction, a defendant must be \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005). We have held that \u201c[i]t is not enough that a defendant does less than other participants; in order to qualify as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Whether a defendant is a minor participant is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d 843, 846 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Even if the Government\u2019s arguments incorrectly compared Cosio Gomez\u2019s conduct to that of an \u201caverage\u201d courier rather than to an \u201caverage participant,\u201d the district court\u2019s statements do not suggest that it made the same error. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (nn.1 &amp; 3(A)). While Cosio Gomez\u2019s role may have been somewhat less culpable than that of the other participants, his role in transporting a large quantity of heroin from Texas to Ohio was neither \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d nor \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)); <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Cosio Gomez should not receive a minor participant reduction. <em>See Silva-De Hoyos, </em>702 F.3d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
