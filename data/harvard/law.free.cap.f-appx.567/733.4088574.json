We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AgL7\">In 2004, Icenhour was charged with aggravated battery on a correctional officer and interference with government property, in violation of Georgia state law. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 16-5-24; 16-7-24. Prior to trial, defense counsel requested the pattern jury instruction on reasonable doubt,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>but the state-trial judge gave a slightly altered instruction instead.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel reserved objections to the jury instructions but did not specifically object to the reasonable-doubt charge. The jury convicted Icenhour on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Icenhour subsequently retained new counsel and moved for a new trial on the basis his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to ascertain his mental-health history and had allowed him to take the witness stand and testify. The motion was denied and affirmed on appeal. <em>Icenhour v. State, </em>290 Ga.App. 461, 659 S.E.2d 858 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In March 2009, Icenhour filed an amended application for writ of habeas corpus in Georgia state court and raised five grounds for relief. Icenhour argued he had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate counsel failed to raise an ineffeetive-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the trial judge\u2019s jury instruction on reasonable doubt. Because the trial judge\u2019s reasonable-doubt charge omitted several important sentences from the suggested pattern jury instruction, Icenhour asserted it was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">The state post-conviction judge denied Icenhour\u2019s habeas corpus application and found Icenhour had failed to demonstrate that his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), because the trial judge\u2019s reasonable-doubt charge was proper. The post-conviction judge also found Icenhour had failed to demonstrate his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to object to the reasonable-doubt charge, because his trial counsel had re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>served objections to the charges given. Ieenhour subsequently filed an application for a certificate of probable cause with the Supreme Court of Georgia, which denied the application without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In December 2012, Ieenhour filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and raised three grounds for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. He argued he had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and asserted the trial judge\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt had been incomplete and had omitted important parts of the pattern charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The district judge denied Icenhour\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The judge found Icenh-our\u2019s assertions were conelusory, and he had provided no law or facts which revealed, but for appellate counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance, the outcome of his appeal would have been different. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The judge granted a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An3\">Whether, given AEDPA\u2019s deference to state court decisions, Icenhour\u2019s appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction itself constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">R at 824 (referencing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Our review in \u00a7 2254 proceedings is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (11th Cir.2009). To obtain review beyond the scope of the COA, the petitioner must move to expand the COA. <em>See Hodges v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>506 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2007) (noting petitioner could have moved for reconsideration of order denying a COA and asked for expansion of the COA). A petitioner abandons arguments not developed in his brief on appeal. <em>See Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.3d 1325, 1330 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007) (recognizing, because petitioner had failed to develop an argument that the state court made an unreasonable determination of the facts under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) by not challenging any specific factual finding in his brief on appeal, he had abandoned the argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Ieenhour does not address the certified issue on appeal. In his counseled brief, he instead changes the nature of his argument. He concedes his trial counsel properly preserved an objection to the reasonable-doubt instruction and argues his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the reasonable-doubt instruction directly on appeal. Because Icenhour raises an issue not specified in the COA and has not moved to expand the scope of the COA, we need not consider his argument on appeal. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1290 n. 4; <em>Hodges, </em>506 F.3d at 1339. Since he does not provide any argument or law regarding the issue actually specified in the COA, we deem that issue abandoned. <em>See Davis, </em>506 F.3d at 1330 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Because the trial judge\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction was constitutionally acceptable, Ieenhour has failed to demonstrate his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under <em>Strickland. </em>An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim under <em>Strickland </em>is a mixed question of law and fact and is subject to de novo review. <em>Brooks v. Comm\u2019r, Ala. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>719 F.3d 1292, 1300 (11th Cir.2013). Pursuant to AEDPA, a federal judge may not grant a state prisoner habeas relief on a claim the state judge denied on the merits unless the state judge\u2019s decision: (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The Sixth Amendment provides a criminal defendant shall have the right to \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI. To succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must show his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A court need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are governed by the same standards applied to trial counsel under <em>Strickland. Brooks, </em>719 F.3d at 1300. Under the <em>Strickland </em>standard, counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Appellate counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise a non-meritorious claim on direct appeal. <em>Diaz v. Sec., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>402 F.3d 1136, 1144-45 (11th Cir.2005). Prejudice occurs when there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In a criminal case, the government must prove each element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 5, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994). The beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard is a requirement of due process, \u201cbut the Constitution neither prohibits trial courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as a matter of course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As long as a trial judge \u201cinstructs the jury on the necessity that the defendant\u2019s guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the Constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Taken as a whole, the jury instructions must convey the concept of reasonable doubt correctly to the jury. <em>Id. </em>When reviewing the correctness of reasonable-doubt charges, the inquiry is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on\u201d a lower burden of proof than that required by the Constitution. <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1191 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">In this case, the trial judge\u2019s reasonable-doubt charge emphasized there was a \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d in Icenhour\u2019s favor, and the burden of proof was on the state \u201cto prove every material allegation of [the] indictment and every essential element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d R at 340-41. The trial judge also stated the burden of proof never shifted to Icenhour, he defined \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as \u201ca doubt of a fair-minded juror honestly seeking the truth,\u201d and he noted a reasonable doubt could arise from the evidence, the lack of evidence, a conflict in the evidence, or Icenhour\u2019s testimony. R at 340-41. Emphasizing the state\u2019s burden and the jury\u2019s obligation to focus on the evidence presented, the entire instruction establishes it was not reasonably likely the jury applied the instruction in an unconstitutional manner. <em>See Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 5, 114 S.Ct. 1239; <em>Johnson, </em>256 F.3d at 1190-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Furthermore, Icenhour has failed to provide any caselaw establishing the trial judge was required to use the pattern jury instruction or the omission of certain phrases from the pattern instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>error. Consequently, Icenhour\u2019s appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the reasonable-doubt instruction directly on appeal or by failing to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instruction. <em>See Diaz, </em>402 F.3d at 1144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">.
