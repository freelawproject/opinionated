Anderson filed his Rule 59(e) motion after the district court granted summary judgment to Jill Creech, his former employer and the Director of the Southeast District of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, on his claims of racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1981, 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983, and the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Solutia, Inc. v. McWane, Inc., </em>672 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Anderson makes three arguments. First, he contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 59(e) motion by ignoring manifest errors of law and fact in its original order granting summary judgment. \u201cThe only grounds for granting a Rule 59 motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). As a result, a district court does not abuse its discretion when denying a Rule 59(e) motion made merely \u201cto relitigate old matters\u201d or \u201craise argument[s] or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 n. 69 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Anderson\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion did not, despite his statements to the contrary, show that the district court made errors of law or fact in its initial order granting summary judgment. The motion instead attempted to rehash old matters and raise new issues that could and should have been raised before summary judgment was granted. For that reason, we reject Anderson\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Second, Anderson contends that the district court abused its discretion by not adequately explaining its rationale for denying his Rule 59(e) motion. Generally, district courts should provide \u201cexplanations of their rulings so as to provide [us] with an opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091 (11th Cir.2007). But the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require courts to state findings of fact or conclusions of law when ruling on Rule 59(e) motions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)(3). And in a case such as this one, where the Rule 59(e) motion bordered on being frivolous, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by denying it without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Third, Anderson asserts that the manner in which the district court denied his Rule 59(e) motion violated Canons 1 and 3 of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. The record shows that Anderson\u2019s accusations of unethical conduct by the district court are utterly baseless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to what he asserts, the fact that the district court rejected his arguments and decided this case against him does not mean that the court was unfair, partial, or anything less than diligent. <em>Cf. United States v. Berger, </em>375 F.3d 1223, 1227 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cAdverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court\u2019s impartiality is in doubt.\u201d) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). And the record reveals no impropriety on the district court\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-10\">. Anderson also challenged the district court\u2019s underlying order granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>ment, but because his notice of appeal was untimely with respect to that order, we dismissed that part of his appeal. <em>See Anderson v. Creech, </em>No. 13-13955 (11th Cir. Nov. 12, 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-12\">. Because Anderson\u2019s assertions of unethical conduct lack any foundation, we need not. decide whether an appeal is the proper procedural vehicle for making these assertions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b703-16\">. Anderson's motion to compel defendant Creech to file a motion to correct her brief is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
