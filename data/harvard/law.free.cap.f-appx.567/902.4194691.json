After the bankruptcy court confirmed Crouser\u2019s plan to repay his creditors, Crouser filed an adversary proceeding against his mortgagor for violating the automatic stay. Crouser and his mortgagor entered a settlement agreement, but the trustee for Crouser\u2019s estate argued that the proceeds of the settlement were property of the estate. The bankruptcy court agreed with the trustee, and the district court affirmed. Because the plain text of section 1306(a)(1) establishes that proceeds of a settlement received by the debtor before the closure of his ease are property of the estate, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-21\">As the second court of review, we examine independently the judgment of the bankruptcy court. <em>In re TOUSA, Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir.2012). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court and examine its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>The bankruptcy court did not err by including in Crouser\u2019s estate the proceeds of a settlement he received from his mortgagor for violating the automatic stay. A debtor\u2019s estate under Chapter 13 includes \u201call [his] legal or equitable interests ... in property as of the commencement of the case,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1), and \u201call property [in which he has a legal or equitable interest] after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1306(a)(1). The broad scope of \u201call property\u201d under section 1306(a)(1) includes even causes of action that the debtor acquires after commencement of the estate. <em>See In re Waldron, </em>536 F.3d 1239, 1241-42 (11th Cir.2008) (including claims for underinsured motorist benefits that arose after confirmation but before the completion of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy case as property of the estate); <em>see also Carver v. Carver, </em>954 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]hen a debtor files under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, the estate also includes property and earnings of the debtor acquired after filing for bankruptcy but before the disposition of the case.\u201d). Crouser\u2019s cause of action against his mortgagor arose post-petition, and he settled the action before the closure of his bankruptcy case. Under the plain language of section 1306(a)(1), his settlement proceeds are after-acquired property that vested in Crouser\u2019s bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">Crouser argues that the bankruptcy estate is not an \u201cindividual\u201d entitled to recover for violations of the automatic stay, <em>see Jove Engineering v. IRS, </em>92 F.3d 1539, 1552-53 (11th Cir.1996), but Crouser, not his estate, sued and settled with his mortgagor. When Crouser acquired the proceeds of that settlement, his property vested in the estate, and the trustee was entitled to recover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">We AFFIRM the judgment in favor of the trustee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
