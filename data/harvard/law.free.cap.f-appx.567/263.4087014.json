Brown, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>timely appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Title VII retaliatory termination claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown alleged that defendant Board of Commissions of the Port of New Orleans (\u201cPort\u201d) unlawfully terminated him in retaliation for his filing of EEOC complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-22\">On defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed plaintiffs Title VII retaliation claim. The parties agreed that there was no direct evidence of retaliatory termination, and the district court analyzed the claim under the <em>McDonnellr-Douglas</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>burden shifting framework. Applying this framework,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court held (i) that Brown failed to establish the prima facie case because he could not prove that a causal connection exists between his protected activity and his termination, and (ii) that Brown failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>to offer any evidence that the Port\u2019s given reason for his termination is pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. He argues that his termination was the direct result of his filing in EEOC complaint three years prior, and he argues that <em>Faragher </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>Ellerth</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>provide for strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">On de novo review, we agree with the district court. There is no record evidence to establish that a \u201ccausal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, Brown\u2019s reliance on <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Ellerth </em>are misplaced; those cases apply to supervisor liability in Title VII harassment claims, not Title VII retaliation claims. Because Brown failed to establish the pri-ma facie case under the <em>McDonnellr-Doug-las </em>burden shifting framework, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the Port.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
