He argues that the district court erred in imposing a one-year term of supervised release to follow his 12-month term of imprisonment because Morales-Aguilar is a deportable alien. Additionally, Morales-Aguilar contends that the district court failed to provide any fact-specific reasons for the imposition of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Morales-Aguilar has completed his term of imprisonment, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. The appeal of his sentence is therefore moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
