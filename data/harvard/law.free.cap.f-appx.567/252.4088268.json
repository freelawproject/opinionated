California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Saenz has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Saenz\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our decision not to address Saenz\u2019s ineffective assistance claims is without prejudice to Saenz\u2019s right to assert such claims in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">To the extent Saenz challenges his plea as involuntary, there is no evidence in the record to support this claim. At his plea colloquy, Saenz swore before the district court that he understood the charges against him and the potential sentence he faced, he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation, his plea was voluntary, his plea was not the result of force or threats, he had an opportunity to read and discussed the plea agreement with counsel, he signed the plea agreement with an understanding of its contents, and he understood the summary of the plea agreement recited by the government. Saenz\u2019s \u201c[sjolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d <em>See Blackledge v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). Saenz has not pointed to any evidence in the record to overcome this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Saenz\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the. limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
