On appeal, he first argues that the district court erred in dismissing his Eighth Amendment claims against Dr. Page. A. Smith, Dr. W. Beli-zaire, and Correctional Officer Howell based on its conclusion that Wilson had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>established that they were deliberately indifferent to his alleged serious medical needs. Second, Wilson argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. P. Izra and Dr. Dean C. Lohse on Wilson\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims based again on its conclusion that he had failed to establish deliberate indifference. Finally, Wilson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his ADA claim based on its conclusion that he had not established a discriminatory motive in the provision of medical services based on his alleged disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Upon a thorough review of the record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.2008). A court \u201cshall dismiss\u201d a case filed <em>in forma pau-peris </em>if the court determines that the action is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). We review a frivolity dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). A claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact. <em>Id.; Carroll v. Gross, </em>984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that a case is frivolous for \u00a7 1915(d) (now \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)) when it appears the plaintiff has little or no chance of success). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings will be liberally construed. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">A complaint stating a claim for relief must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Factual allegations in a complaint \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true-\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1955). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Conclusory allegations are not entitled to a presumption of truth, and legal conclusions must be supported by factual allegations. <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709-10 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">A claimant is entitled to redress under \u00a7 1983 if he can prove that a person acting under color of state law committed an act that deprived him of some right, privilege, or immunity protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Eighth Amendment forbids \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth Amendment to prohibit \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). \u201cTo prevail on a deliberate indifference to serious medical need claim, [a plaintiff] must show: (1) a serious medical need; (2) the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference to that need; and (3) causation between that indifference and the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cA serious medical need is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1807 (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he medical need must be one that, if left unattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">To establish deliberate indifference, the plaintiff must prove \u201c(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (8) by conduct that is more than [gross] negligence.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Jefferson Cnty., </em>601 F.3d 1152, 1158 (11th Cir.2010) (alteration in original). In other words, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant was \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists\u201d and drew the inference. <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1245 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Deliberately indifferent conduct could include grossly inadequate care or a delay in treatment. <em>McEl-ligott v. Foley, </em>182 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.1999). Failure to treat adequately an inmate\u2019s pain could also reflect deliberate indifference. <em>See id. </em>at 1257-58 (determining that a jury could find that only providing Tylenol to treat an inmate\u2019s severe pain \u201cwas so cursory as to amount to no care at all\u201d). However, \u201ca simple difference in medical opinion between the prison\u2019s medical staff and the inmate as to the latter\u2019s diagnosis or course of treatment\u201d does not support a claim of deliberate indifference. <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th- Cir.1991). Moreover, matters of medical judgment do not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 107, 97 S.Ct. at 292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Here, Wilson failed to establish that Dr. Smith, Dr. Belizaire, or Officer Howell were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. Officer Howell was not a medical doctor and did not have subjective knowledge of any alleged risk of harm to Wilson. Dr. Belizaire did treat Wilson\u2019s condition, and Wilson\u2019s disagreement with that course of treatment is not sufficient to establish deliberate indifference. Finally, Dr. Smith responded to Wilson\u2019s grievances concerning his medical care by reviewing Wilson\u2019s medical record and determining that he was receiving appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, considering all the facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Mann, </em>588 F.3d at 1303. A district court shall grant summary judgment \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201c[G]enuine disputes of facts are those in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. For factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>588 F.3d at 1303 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Here, Wilson has failed to establish that Drs. Izra and Lohse were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. At most, Wilson disputes their medical opinions on the appropriate course of treatment for Wilson\u2019s condition, but matters of medical judgment do not constitute deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Title II of the ADA, which prohibits public entities from discriminating against disabled individuals, applies to prisoners in state correctional facilities. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; <em>Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Yeskey, </em>524 U.S. 206, 210, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 1954-55, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998). The language of Title II generally tracks that of \u00a7 504 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Rehabilitation Act (\u201cRA\u201d). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). To state a claim under Title II, a plaintiff must prove</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">(1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity\u2019s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that the exclusion, denial of benefit, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiffs disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\"><em>Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>480 F.3d 1072, 1083 (11th Cir.2007). In the context of the RA, we have held that \u201ca plaintiff may demonstrate discriminatory intent through a showing of deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Liese v. Indian River Cnty. Hosp. Dist., </em>701 F.3d 334, 345 (11th Cir.2012). In this context, deliberate indifference occurs \u201cwhen the defendant knew that harm to a federally protected right was substantially likely and ... failed to act on that likelihood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344 (emphasis removed) (ellipses in original). It requires more than gross negligence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Wilson cannot prevail on his ADA claim. Because he has failed to establish that any of the defendants acted with deliberate indifference, he cannot demonstrate the requisite discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
