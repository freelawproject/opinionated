Seals was indicted, along with five codefendants, following a string of fraudulent relief claims by Hooters Pensacola Beach employees following the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Seals personally received $17,000 from a fraudulent claim that he filed asserting that the oil spill caused him to lose bonus wages as an assistant manager. His co-worker, Bernard Cook, was initially denied a $7,000 claim but then supplemented the denied claim with a letter from Seals written on Hooters letterhead. Cook subsequently filed a second claim, this time for $19,040, and it was also supplemented by a fraudulent letter from Seals. At sentencing, the district court held Seals accountable for an intended loss of $17,000 from his actions, and $26,040 from Cook\u2019s two claims, for a total intended loss of $43,040. On appeal, Seals argues that the district court erred in attributing to him $43,040 in intended losses, because it had merely speculated that the amount that Cook requested was reasonably foreseeable to Seals. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). The court may abuse its discretion if it imposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence by improperly calculating the guidelines range. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1245 (11th Cir.2009). We review a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Lamons, </em>532 F.3d 1251, 1268 (11th Cir.2008). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings \u2014 including an amount-of-loss determination \u2014 for clear error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>172 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.1999). A finding is clearly erroneous only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">In a fraud case, a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased six levels if the loss was more than $30,000 but not more than $70,000, while the offense level is increased by four levels if the loss was more than $10,000 but not more than $30,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(C)-(D). For the purposes of that provision, loss equals the greater of actual loss or intended loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 3(A)). \u201cIntended loss\u201d means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense and \u201cactual loss\u201d is the \u201creasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n. 3(A)(i)-(ii)). The Sentencing Guidelines make a criminal defendant responsible for \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant,\u201d as well as, in the case of joint criminal activity, \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">If the district court errs in calculating the guidelines range, we must vacate the sentence, unless the error is harmless. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number><em>United States v. Barner, </em>572 F.3d 1239, 1247 (11th Cir.2009). An error in loss calculation is harmless if the district court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the guidelines\u2019 recommendations on the amount of loss. <em>United States v. Tampas, </em>493 F.3d 1291, 1305 (11th Cir.2007). A loss calculation must be supported by reliable and specific evidence. <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>430 F.3d 1357, 1370 (11th Cir.2005). When a defendant, fails to object to allegations of fact in a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), he admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s amount-of-loss calculation was not clearly erroneous. Cook\u2019s requests for $7,000 and $19,040 were unobjected-to facts from the probation officer\u2019s PSI, and therefore were established with specific and rehable evidence. Moreover, Cook\u2019s reasonably foreseeable conduct could be attributed to Seals, who undertook joint criminal activity with Cook, forging letters to supplement Cook\u2019s fraudulent claims. Unob-jected-to facts from the PSI also showed that Seals had recovered $17,000 himself prior to Cook\u2019s second claim. The .amount that Cook requested was not exorbitant \u2014 the greater of his claims was only $2,040 more than Seals had already received. Therefore, a finding that the request was reasonably foreseeable to Seals does not leave us with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that a mistake was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">In any event, even if the district court had erred in its guidelines calculation, that error would have been harmless, because the district court said that Seals\u2019s sentence would be the same regardless of its ruling on his objection to the loss amount. Accordingly, we affirm Seals\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\">. Due to the proximity of his projected release date, Marquis Seals\u2019s motion to expedite is GRANTED, to the extent that it seeks to expedite the disposition of his appeal. However, because both parties have already submitted briefs, his motion is DENIED AS MOOT, to the extent that it seeks to expedite the briefing period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
