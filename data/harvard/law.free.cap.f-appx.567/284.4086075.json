Rothenberg, federal prisoner # 76042-004, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition-challenging two prison disciplinary eonvic-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tions on due process grounds. Regarding the first disciplinary conviction, Incident Report # 2213792, Rothenberg fails to address the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims are not cognizable because the claims concerned the conditions of his confinement rather than the duration of his confinement. Therefore, Rothenberg\u2019s claims regarding the first disciplinary pro-ce\u00e9ding are deemed abandoned. ' <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">With regard to the second disciplinary conviction, Incident Report # 2218281, Rothenberg fails to address the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim on the basis that temporary placement in administrative segregation does not implicate a liberty interest. Therefore, that issue is also deemed abandoned. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Rothenberg argues that his due process rights were denied because there was insufficient evidence to support his disciplinary conviction for failure to obey an order. He contends that the evidence was insufficient because the correctional officer was not credible and because Rothenberg\u2019s physical limitations excused him from cutting in line. There was at least some evidence upon which Rothenberg was convicted of the second disciplinary violation; thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the disciplinary conviction. <em>See Superintendent, Massachusetts Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Because Rothenberg failed to set forth facts which would entitle him to relief, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Ellis v. Lynaugh, </em>873 F.2d 830, 840 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
