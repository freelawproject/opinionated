We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Diaz contends that the district court abused its discretion by misapplying departure provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Government argues that the sentence is not a departure from the guidelines sentencing range but is instead a variance above that range. Given that Diaz\u2019s \u201csentence was not unreasonable,\u201d as explained below, we need not decide whether it was authorized by the Guidelines or was a \u201cnon-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 441 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The characterization of a sentence is irrelevant \u201cif the sentence imposed was reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Jones, </em>444 F.3d at 441). The district court considered the advisory guideline range and all the.factors mentioned in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court was of the opinion that a sentence above the guidelines range was warranted based on the following: Diaz\u2019s history and characteristics and the nature and circumstances of the offense; the need for the sentence to reflect the offense\u2019s. seriousness, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment; and the need to protect the public from recidivism by Diaz. \u201cThe record ... demonstrates the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349. The offense of conviction was the type that Diaz had committed before and for which he had been punished briefly before without apparent deterrent effect, and his history of other crimes supported a conclusion that there was a risk of recidivism. Diaz thus exhibited personal characteristics indicating \u201cthat a long incarceration period was required to provide just punishment, to ensure adequate deterrence, and to protect the public.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
