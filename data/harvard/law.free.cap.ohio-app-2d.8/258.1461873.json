Section 2321.17 of the Revised Code provides: \u201cWhen a new trial is granted, the court shall specify in writing the causes for which such new trial is granted.\u201d In the case at bar, this provision of the statute was not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>In the case of <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Fraley, </em>8 Ohio App. 2d 23, this exact situation was presented to the Franklin County Court of Appeals which overruled the motion to dismiss and held that a mandatory duty is placed upon the trial judge to set forth his reasons for granting a new trial. When this duty is done by the trial court in this case, the appeal on the merits can be perfected.
