Upon cross-examination, certain questions were propounded to defendants that required expert testimony. Objections were interposed to such questions and sustained by the court. Therefore, no expert testimony was elicited from the defendant. Moreover, plaintiff did not have any expert medical witness testify on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The directed verdict was predicated on the absence of expert medical testimony which is a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of medical malpractice when the facts adduced are beyond the comprehension of laymen. A motion for new trial was subsequently overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The plaintiff claims error as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201c1. In refusing to permit plaintiff to fully cross-examine defendants in accordance with the terms of Revised Code Section 2317.07. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201c2. In removing the issue of medical malpractice from the consideration of the jury, and thereby granting defendants\u2019 motion for directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201c3. In overruling plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The Court of Appeals of this state has twice passed on the question of whether a defendant called for cross-examination in a medical malpractice action can be required to give expert testimony. In <em>Forthofer </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>60 Ohio App. 436, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201c2. In an action against a physician for malpractice, the plaintiff may not, over objection, prove his case in chief by the expert opinion evidence of the defendant physician, where such defendant has been called for cross-examination under the provisions of Section 11497, General Code [Section 2317.07, Revised Code],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">This case was followed by the same court in <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>68 Ohio App. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">In <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>24 Idaho 158, 132 P. 967, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">\u201c* * * This question was asked [of defendant on cross-examination] for the purpose of advancing plaintiff\u2019s case in chief and calls for an expert opinion by the witness. The statute was not intended to enable an adverse party to call an opposing party as an expert and seek to establish his side of the ease by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>such expert evidence. Where a witness is called under the provisions of that act, he may be examined by the adverse party as if under cross-examination, subject to the rules applicable to the examination of other witnesses, but it is contrary to the purpose and reason of that statute to allow the plaintiff to make out his case in chief by expert opinion evidence secured from the defendant on cross-examination. If the plaintiff desires to make his case - by expert evidence from the defendant himself, he must call him as his own witness, but is not permitted to do so under the provisions of that statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">A very recent case (October 4, 1963) pertaining to this subject is <em>Ericksen </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>266 Minn. 401, 123 N. W. 2d 687, where the Supreme Court of Minnesota said, at page 407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 persistence in attempting to make defendant their expert medical witness under the circumstances of the instant case amounted to improper cross-examination, prejudicial to defendant, and justified curtailment in the discretion of the trial court. An examination of authorities, both local and elsewhere, shows that it is generally held that in medical malpractice actions the plaintiff ought not to be permitted under the guise of cross-examination under the rules to compel expert testimony from the defendant in the hope of proving a case of malpractice without properly calling other expert medical witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">An exhaustive review of this subject can be found in 88 A. L. E. 2d 1186.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">While some jurisdictions hold contrary to the above cases, we believe the rule set down by our Ninth Appellate District court and the high courts of our sister states to be salutary, and we therefore adhere to it in this case and overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Defendants under cross-examination would have to testify as to facts within their own personal knowledge, but if plaintiff wanted expert testimony from them he should have called them as his own witnesses. Under Ohio law they could have been compelled to give such testimony. See <em>State, ex rel. </em>O\u2019Neall, v. <em>Darby, </em>9 Dec. Repr. 725; <em>Pengelly </em>v. <em>Ashland County Commissioners, </em>11 O. D. 620, 8 N. P. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">As to assignment of error No. 2, in order to submit a medi cal malpractice case to a jury without adducing expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>mony, the negligence of the physician must he so manifest as to be within the comprehension of a layman. See <em>Modrsynski </em>v. <em>Lust, </em>55 Ohio Law Abs. 106. We hold that in this case expert testimony was necessary to establish medical malpractice and since none was produced, we overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">As to assignment of error No. 3, in view of our foregoing determination, we find that the trial court did not err in overruling plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, and thus this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-5\">Skeel, C.
