The subject costs were incurred by the defendant in the taking of depositions, pursuant to Section 2319.06, Revised Code, and the issuance of subpoenas <em>duces tecum. </em>These subpoenas were directed to plaintiff to produce certain records that were needed to secure information to enable the defendant to prepare its defense. During this time four amended petitions were filed and ordered stricken by the court. Upon failure of plaintiff to file a fifth amended petition, the court dismissed the action which negated both <em>the purpose of taking further depositions and the filing and use of same in the case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The depositions were not taken <em>de bene esse </em>(that is, no anticipation of future need) but were taken to formulate a defense. The effect of the court\u2019s ruling is to saddle the defendant with these substantial costs, leaving the plaintiff free to refile her cause. We find that the depositions were taken in good faith and were a necessary adjunct to the preparation of defendant\u2019s case. See <em>Farmers Union Fidelity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers Union Co-operative Ins. Co., </em>147 Neb. 1093, 26 N. W. 2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The order is, therefore, reversed as contrary to law, and the cause remanded to the Cleveland Municipal Court with instructions to grant defendant\u2019s motion to tax costs of depositions as costs in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-11\">Skeel, C. J., Silbert and Artl, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
