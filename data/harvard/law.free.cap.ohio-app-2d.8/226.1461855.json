Thereafter, the jury found the plaintiff had the right to participate in the State Insurance Fund as to his heart disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The defendant, appellant herein, Administrator of the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, urges the following in assignment of error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in withdrawing from the jury the issue of whether or not plaintiff on June 15, 1960, sustained an accidental injury resulting in a ruptured disc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201ca. Plaintiff did not attempt to appeal only from the dis-allowance of the heart condition but appealed from the whole decision of the commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cb. Revised Code Section 4123.519 provides for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Common Pleas Court and does not authorize an appeal from only part of the commission\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Plaintiff in his notice of appeal to the Common Pleas Court states that he is appealing from the order of the Industrial Commission of Ohio. It does not refer to any portion of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The petition as required to be filed in cases appealed under Section 4123.519, Revised Code, is not analogous to one filed under Code pleading statutes. According to the above statute, the petition is employed for the purpose of \u201csetting forth the basis for the jurisdiction of the court over the action and setting forth the issues.\u201d It is said, in <em>Swift &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Wreede, </em>110 Ohio App. 252, 255:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201c* * * There is no requirement that the petition set forth a cause of action, but the statute requires instead that it set forth the \u2018basis for [appellate] jurisdiction of the [Common Pleas] court over the action.\u2019 It has many of the characteristics of the now obsolete petition in error. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Singer Sewing Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Puckett, </em>176 Ohio St. 32, held the filing of the petition for claimant under the foregoing section not to be jurisdictional, the filing of the notice of appeal with the Industrial Commission and the Court of Common Pleas being the only act needed to vest jurisdiction in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">A special proceeding of this type under the statute whereby a trial <em>de novo </em>is provided for in the Court of Common Pleas regarding the question of participation or continued participation in the State Insurance Fund cannot be paralleled with a law and fact appeal to the Court of Appeals. Statutes of this nature must be liberally construed in favor of employees seeking the benefit. Section 4123.95, Revised Code. When a claimant appeals from an order of the Industrial Commission under Section 4123.519, Revised Code, it must be presupposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that the issue decided adversely to the claimant before the Industrial Commission is the only issue before the Court of Common Pleas. To say one is appealing the portion of an order that is favorable to him defies reason. In the instant case, the only way the question of participation regarding the back injury could be adjudicated would be for the employer to take an appeal from the order of the Industrial Commission. This the employer did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The claimant and employer are the only parties given the right under Section 4123.519, Revised Code, to appeal from the Industrial Commission to the Court of Common Pleas. There is no provision under this section giving the Administrator of the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation the right to such an appeal. We therefore overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We have examined the remaining assignments of error and find none prejudicial to the rights of defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The judgment, accordingly, is affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs and the cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas for certification thereof to the Industrial Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 4123.519, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-8\">Kovachy, P.
