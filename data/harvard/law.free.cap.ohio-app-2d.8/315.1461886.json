No such doctrine or rule has ever been followed by the Courts of Appeals. In those courts, as in all other courts, the opinion expresses the court\u2019s reasoning. There is no official syllabus. The syllabus prepared for the official publication in the Ohio Bar is merely a synopsis provided for the convenience of attorneys and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">The motion for reconsideration will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-15\">Bryant, P.
