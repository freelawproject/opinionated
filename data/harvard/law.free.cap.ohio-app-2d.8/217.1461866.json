The disobedience resulted from the defendant\u2019s re-entry upon the premises from which she had been evicted pursuant to a forcible entry and detainer action brought by the plaintiff. The record clearly evinces the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s husband, who was the owner of an undivided one-half interest in the premises, invited the defendant back into the premises subsequent to defendant\u2019s eviction. The trial court, after being apprised of defendant\u2019s re-entry, found her guilty of contempt of court,</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>An action which falls under the above section of the Revised Code is what is commonly referred to as an \u201cindirect\u201d or \u201cconstructive\u201d contempt. In such instance, an intent to disobey the court\u2019s order is a condition precedent to the finding of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In 11 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 123, Contempt, Section 38, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201c* * * Proceedings in contempt under the' statute enumerating acts in contempt of court other than direct contempts, must be based upon some order, judgment, or command of a court or officer, or they must be dismissed. In such respect, it is the wilfulness of the violation of an order of court which constitutes the contempt \u2014 that is, there must have been an intent, knowing the order, or at least its nature, to transgress it, before a court will inflict punishment. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">See, also, <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>96 Ohio App. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">It is our determination that the defendant, as a matter of law, could not have had the intent necessary to constitute contempt when the owner of an undivided one-half interest in the premises invited her to re-enter. In such situation, plaintiff could have availed herself of appropriate proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Municipal Court is reversed as contrary to law and final judgment is entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-11\">Silbert, Acting C.
