We conclude that the S.B. 2 sentencing provisions are inapplicable to those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">STATUTORY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">With the passage of S.B. 2, the General Assembly effected significant changes in Ohio\u2019s criminal code, modifying the classifications of criminal offenses and corresponding sentences. See 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136; Legislative Service Commission Analysis of Sub.S.B. No. 2, Parts II and V (1995). Ostensibly, S.B. 2 reduces the terms of imprisonment for many offenses from those possible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the former statutory scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, persons convicted of crimes for which the term of imprisonment is seemingly reduced have attempted to obtain sentencing under what they consider the more favorable S.B. 2 terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendants claim that R.C. 1.58(B) mandates that criminal offenders awaiting sentencing when S.B. 2 became effective on July 1, 1996, and whose potential sentences are reduced by S.B. 2, are entitled to the shorter sentence although their offenses were committed before S.B. 2\u2019s effective date. The instant dispute arises because the General Assembly specifically stated that all defendants who committed crimes before July 1, 1996, shall be sentenced under the law in existence at the time of the offense, \u201cnotwithstanding division (B) of section 1.58 of the Revised Code.\u201d Section 3, Am.Sub.S.B. No. 269, 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 11099, amending Section 5 of S.B. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendants in the cases at bar maintain that R.C. 1.58(B) confers a vested right to elect sentencing under the new, more lenient statute, and that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language is an attempt to circumvent that right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is, the defendants contend that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language is an attempted amendment of R.C. 1.58(B) that fads by virtue of its procedural shortcomings. Claiming that the General Assembly failed to comply with Ohio\u2019s constitutional requirements in an unsuccessful attempt to limit R.C. 1.58(B) by amendment, the defendants argue that R.C. 1.58(B) governs this sentencing controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion, R.C. 1.58(B) does not create a vested right to be sentenced according to amended laws: it is a general rule of statutory construction. R.C. 1.58(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cIf the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced by a reenactment or amendment of a statute, the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the statute as amended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Prior to its effective date, the General Assembly amended Section 5 of S.B. 2 to emphasize that its provisions apply only to crimes committed on or after July 1, 1996, \u201cnotwithstanding division (B) of section 1.58 of the Revised Code[.]\u201d Section 3, Am.Sub.S.B. No. 269, 146 Ohio Laws Part VI, 11099 (\u201cS.B. 269\u201d). The defendants contend that this \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language is an unconstitutional attempt to amend R.C. 1.58(B) by frustrating its purpose. Because the defective language must be removed from the statute, the defendants argue that R.C. 1.58(B) applies to S.B. 2 despite the General Assembly\u2019s articulation otherwise. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Hinkle v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 145, 149, 580 N.E.2d 767, 770 (the \u201coffending portion\u201d of the bill is severed to cure the defect). See, also, Section 15(D), Article II, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The crux of this case, then, is whether the General Assembly\u2019s addition of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language effects an amendment of R.C. 1.58(B). It does not. Instead, it- is a clarification of the General Assembly\u2019s intent that the terms of S.B. 2 be applied only to those persons committing crimes on or after July 1, 1996. Furthermore, it was in fact an unnecessary clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that the General Assembly is lodged with the power to define, classify and prescribe punishment for crimes committed within the state.\u201d <em>State v. Young </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 370, 392, 16 O.O.3d 416, 429, 406 N.E.2d 499, 512 (Locher, J., dissenting). See, also, <em>State v. Morris </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 101, 112, 9 O.O.3d 92, 98, 378 N.E.2d 708, 715. It is the General Assembly, of course, that possesses authority to determine the effective dates of enactments passed pursuant to its legislative powers. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Ach v. Evans </em>(1914), 90 Ohio St. 243, 247, 107 N.E. 537, 538; <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Brown </em>(1965), 1 Ohio St.2d 121, 125-126, 30 O.O.2d 478, 481, 205 N.E.2d 377, 381-382. In the instant case, the original language expressed the General Assembly\u2019s intent that the provisions of S.B. 2 be applied only to crimes committed on or after its effective date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language added by Section 3 of S.B. 269 is no more than a redundant expression of this aim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The language at issue does not alter or modify R.C. 1.58(B). It eliminates uncertainty as to S.B. 2\u2019s effective date by distinctly resolving any perceived conflict between Section 5 of S.B. 2 and R.C. 1.58(B). The phrase \u201cnotwithstanding division (B) of section 1.58 of the Revised Code\u201d communicates the General Assembly\u2019s proactive purpose by arresting R.C. 1.58(B)\u2019s operation in this instance. The language defines the time, as chosen by the General Assembly, at which the new provisions of S.B. 2 are to be applied and prior to which they are of no effect. R.C. 1.58(B) remains operable and unchanged for future application.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">More important, however, this express statement by the General Assembly was unnecessary. R.C. 1.51 provides that if the conflict between a special provision and a general provision of the code is irreconcilable, the special provision \u201cprevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\u201d See, also, R.C. 1.52 (if irreconcilable conflict exists, the later enacted statute prevails). In this case, the irrefutable \u201cmanifest intent\u201d is that S.B. 2 prevail. Thus, the original language of Section 5 of S.B. 2, a later enacted specific provision, was sufficient to ensure that the sentencing terms of S.B. 2 would apply only to crimes committed on or after its effective date despite R.C. 1.58(B), a previously enacted general rule of construction. See, <em>e.g., Bellian v. Bicron Corp. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 517, 519, 634 N.E.2d 608, 610; <em>State ex rel. Dublin Securities, Inc. v. Ohio Div. of Securities </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 426, 429-431, 627 N.E.2d 993, 996-997; <em>State v. Chippendale </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 118,120-123, 556 N.E.2d 1134,1136-1137. The \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language later added to S.B.-2 is a thorough, yet superfluous, elucidation of the General Assembly\u2019s intent that the special provision control.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Based upon th\u00e9 foregoing, we hold that the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding division (B) of section 1.58 of the Revised Code,\u201d contained in Section 5 of S.B. 2 as amended by Section 3 of S.B. 269, cannot be construed as an attempt to amend R.C. 1.58(B). Because the General Assembly has expressly stated that the amended sentencing provisions of S.B. 2 are applicable only to those crimes committed on or after its effective date, R.C. 1.58(B) is inapplicable. The amended sentencing provisions of S.B. 2 apply only to those crimes committed on or after July 1,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>EX POST FACTO </em>AND RETROACTIVITY ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Mitchell and Rush also argue that the prospective application of S.B. 2\u2019s sentencing provisions is a violation of the constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>and retroactive legislation. See Section 10, Article I, United States Constitution; Section 28, Article II, Ohio Constitution. Although not properly-raised below, in criminal cases this court may \u201cconsider constitutional challenges to the application of statutes in specific cases of plain error or where the rights and interests involved may warrant it.\u201d <em>In re M.D. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 149, 527 N.E.2d 286, syllabus. Because Mitchell and Rush now present, albeit in tardy fashion, a constitutional argument in a criminal case that if correct would indicate that plain error occurred, we will address the issue. That it is an argument without merit further supports consideration of the matter in the interest of judicial economy. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 41, 630 N.E.2d 339, 345, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution forbids state legislatures from passing any \u201cex post facto Law.\u201d \u201c[T]he Clause is aimed at laws that \u2018retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 499, 504, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1601, 131 L.Ed.2d 588, 594, quoting <em>Collins v. Youngblood </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 37, 41-43, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2718-2719, 111 L.Ed.2d 30, 39. <em>Beazell v. Ohio </em>(1925), 269 U.S. 167, 169-170, 46 S.Ct. 68, 68-69, 70 L.Ed. 216, 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Contrary to what Rush and Mitchell maintain, our <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry does not focus \u201con whether a legislative change produces some ambiguous sort of \u2018disadvantage^]\u2019 \u201d <em>Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 506, 115 S.Ct. at 1602, 131 L.Ed.2d at 595, fn. 3. Legislation violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause if it makes a previously innocent act criminal, <em>increases </em>the punishment for a crime after its commission, or deprives the accused of a defense available at the time the crime was committed. <em>Collins </em>at 42,110 S.Ct. at 2719, 111 L.Ed.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Rush and Mitchell contend that by creating an exception to R.C. 1.58(B) and thereby making the terms of S.B. 2 <em>prospective </em>only, the General Assembly engaged in unconstitutional <em>retroactive </em>legislation. Bearing in mind the Supreme Court\u2019s clear explanation of what constitutes impermissible <em>ex post facto </em>lawmaking, however, the General Assembly\u2019s prescript that S.B. 2 apply only to crimes committed on or after its. effective date evades the prohibition. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 101, 684 N.E.2d 668, 683; <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 369, 371, 658 N.E.2d 1052, 1054 (applying <em>ex post facto </em>analysis to judicial precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The General Assembly did not increase the relevant criminal penalties by making S.B. 2 a prospective law. The penalties applicable to Rush, Mitchell, and Toler remain unchanged from the time each committed his crime. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>S.B. 2 does not, as Rush suggests, \u201cinflict[ ] a greater punishment than the law-annexed to the crime when committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The argument that prospective application of S.B. 2 violates the prohibition against retroactive legislation found in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution is equally untenable. As with their <em>ex post facto </em>argument, Rush and Mitchell claim that because S.B. 2 expressly applies only to crimes committed on or after its effective date, it retroactively extinguishes their R.C. 1.58(B) right to reduced sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201c[T]he issue of whether a statute may constitutionally be applied retrospectively does not arise unless the General Assembly has specified that the statute so apply.\u201d <em>Sturm v. Sturm </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 671, 673, 590 N.E.2d 1214, 1215, fn, 2, citing <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 106, 522 N.E.2d 489, 495. In this instance, the General Assembly has specified S.B. 2 to be a prospective law applicable only to those crimes committed on or after July 1, 1996. This choice of a bright-line, prospective-only operation is not constitutionally prohibited retroactive legislation that takes away a vested right or imposes a new disability. See <em>State ex rel. Matz v. Brown </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 279, 281-282, 525 N.E.2d 805, 807-808; <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 106, 522 N.E.2d at 495. \u201c[T]o adopt defendants\u2019] position would be to freeze law in time and to never allow amendments to the criminal justice system,\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 101, 684 N.E.2d at 682 (applying equal protection analysis to the constitutional amendment eliminating from the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals the review of capital appeals). Simply put, the legislation at issue falls outside the defined parameters of prohibited retroactive legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Accordingly, we hold that Section 5 of S.B. 2, as amended by Section 3 of S.B. 269, does not violate the constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>and retroactive legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">DISPOSITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In case No. 97-1778 (Johnnie D. Rush), the judgment of the Stark County Court of Appeals is reversed and the original sentence imposed by the trial court is reinstated. In case Nos. 97-2121 and 97-2123 (Brian K. Mitchell), the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Appeals is affirmed. In case No. 97-2266 (Nathaniel Toler), the judgment of the Hamilton County Court of Appeals is reversed and the original sentence imposed by the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"An\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in the syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AhB\">Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. The state contends that the provisions of S.B. 2 do not necessarily result in reduced sentences. While under the old sentencing scheme, a defendant might receive a longer term of incarceration, that longer term was often <em>indefinite </em>and could be reduced by \u201cgood time\u201d credit. See, <em>e.g., </em>former R.C. 2929.11 (143 Ohio Laws, Part 1,1433). See, also, former R.C. 2929.01(C) (145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2088-2089) and 2967.19(A) (145 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 6437) (reduction for good behavior). Under the new provisions, although a defendant\u2019s sentence may be shorter than the maximum indefinite sentence under the former scheme, it is a period of <em>actual </em>incarceration not subject to reduction for \u201cgood time\u201d and subject to extension for bad behavior. See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 2929.14 (extension for bad behavior). See, also, R.C. 2929.01(B) and 2967.11(B), as enacted by S.B. 2; R.C. 2967.19, repealed by S.B. 2 (reduction for good behavior). Thus, the state persuasively asserts that these variables will in many instances make it difficult, if not impossible, to calculate whether a defendant\u2019s sentence would truly be reduced under the terms of S.B. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. Rush states that he and others like him should be able to elect which law they wish to be sentenced under. Were we to hold R.C. 1.58(B) applicable in this case, the defendants would not be entitled to an \u201celection.\u201d R.C. 1.58(B) does not provide for a choice by the defendant. Rather, it states that the sentence <em>\u201cshall </em>be imposed according to the statute as amended.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As a result, the trial court would be <em>required </em>to impose sentences in accordance with S.B. 2 should the S.B. 2 terms constitute a reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">. In its original, unamended form, Section 5 of S.B. 2 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">\u201cThe provisions of the Revised Code in existence prior to July 1, 1996, shall apply to a person upon whom a court imposed a term of imprisonment prior to that date and to a person upon whom a court, on or after that date and in accordance with the law in existence prior to that date, imposed a term of imprisonment for an offense that was committed prior to that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">\u201cThe provisions of the Revised Code in existence on and after July 1,1996, apply to a person who commits an offense on or after that date.\u201d 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 7810.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">. Mitchell also contends that R.C. 2901.04(A), which states that criminal code sections defining offenses or penalties are to be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused, requires us to hold R.C. 1.58(B) applicable. This codified rule of construction is pertinent where statutory language is ambiguous and requires further interpretation: it is inapposite here. See, <em>e.g., State v. Flontek </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 10, 693 N.E.2d 767; <em>Freedom Rd. Found, v. Ohio Dept. of Liquor Control </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 202, 205, 685 N.E.2d 522, 525, fn. 1; <em>State v. Quisenberry </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 556, 634 N.E.2d 1009. In this case, there is no ambiguity. To the contrary, we are faced with two unambiguous provisions that appear to be in direct conflict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
