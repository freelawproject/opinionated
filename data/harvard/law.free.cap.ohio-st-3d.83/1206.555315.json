I believe we should, in accordance with our rules, resolve the conflict between the evidentiary rulings in this case and in <em>State v. Black </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 724, 622 N.E.2d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">The issue certified to this court by the Second District Court of Appeals is \u201c[w]hether a finding pursuant to Evid.R. 601(A) that a child under ten years of age is incompetent to testify at trial makes that child\u2019s testimony \u2018not reasonably obtainable\u2019 for purposes of Evid.R. 80[7](A)(2) under the standards set out in Evid.R. 807(B)(2) * * See <em>State v. Cordosi </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 1494, 678 N.E.2d 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">In <em>Black, </em>the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the state\u2019s application to present hearsay testimony pursuant to Evid.R. 807, by reasoning that admissibility of testimony under 807(A)(2) based on the child\u2019s testimony being \u201cnot reasonably obtainable\u201d is not triggered where there is a finding that the child-victim is incompetent to testify at trial. 87 Ohio App.3d at 728-729, 622 N.E.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">By contrast, in Cardosi\u2019s case the Second District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court admitting hearsay evidence of the child\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>ments, stating that \u201c[t]he condition of absence prescribed in [Evid.R. 807] * * * applies to any substantial impediment to the child\u2019s appearance as a witness in the proceeding. Certainly a finding of incompetency does just that. Therefore, when a court finds that a child is not competent to be a witness her testimony is \u2018not reasonably obtainable\u2019 pursuant to Evid.R. 807(B)(2).\u201d <em>State v. Cardosi </em>(Jan. 17,1997), Clark App. No. 95-CA-0126, unreported, 1997 WL 52924.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Because these two districts differ on the same legal point, this court should resolve that difference of opinion. Had we done so, my view would have been that the admissibility problem was properly analyzed by the <em>Black </em>court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
