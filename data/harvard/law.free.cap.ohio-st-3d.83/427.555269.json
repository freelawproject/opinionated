For the following reasons, however, the court of appeals properly-dismissed the habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">First, Childers has or had adequate remedies at law by appeal or postconviction relief to review the alleged sentencing error. <em>State ex rel. Massie v. Rogers </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 449, 450, 674 N.E.2d 1383, 1383. Sentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not cognizable in habeas corpus. <em>Majoros v. Collins </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 442, 443, 596 N.E.2d 1038, 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Second, Childers has already raised an analogous claim of sentencing error in his direct appeal. Where a plain and adequate remedy at law has been unsuccessfully invoked, extraordinary relief is not available to relitigate the same issue. See <em>State ex rel. Sampson v. Parrott </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 92, 93, 694 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Finally, <em>res judicata </em>barred Childers from filing successive habeas corpus petitions. <em>State ex rel. Brantley v. Ghee </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 287, 288, 685 N.E.2d 1243, 1244. Childers\u2019s previous habeas corpus petition had been dismissed by the court of appeals. See <em>VanBuskirk v. Wingard </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 659, 687 N.E.2d 776, where we affirmed the dismissal of Childers\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b632-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
