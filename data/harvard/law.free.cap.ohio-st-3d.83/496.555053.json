Burlew, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AkCo\">After review, we concur with the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the board, including finding that respondent\u2019s conduct \u201cwas sufficiently inappropriate, unprofessional, and improper\u201d to sustain a violation of DR 1-102(A)(6). We reject the objections filed by both relator and by respondent to the board\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We find that relator did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that respondent participated in an act intended to \u201chinder, delay, or defraud\u201d creditors or otherwise violated R.C. 1336.04. Daniels\u2019s enforcement action was for contempt, not to reduce the arrearage to judgment. Also, Bolin had lived in the Hunter Avenue property periodically since 1978, a lifelong connection known to Daniels and his ex-wife, and disclosed in Bolin\u2019s answers to the Namanworth interrogatories. Bolin\u2019s ownership in that property was also a matter of public record, and the transfer to Regina Bolin was done openly and publicly. Moreover, proceeds from the sale of that real estate were used to pay on the October agreed entry, as the parties contemplated. Finally, Bolin testified that Regina Bolin insisted on this transfer, and that he transferred the property to appease his wife. No evidence was introduced to contradict this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Nor did relator establish by clear and convincing evidence that respondent acted fraudulently or assisted her client in acting fraudulently by responding \u201cnone\u201d to the interrogatory. Before the interrogatory was received, respondent had already prepared, a deed to transfer the property, and a month before the interrogatory was returned, the property had been transferred. By analogy, the United States Supreme Court has found that the federal perjury statute does not reach a witness\u2019s literally true, but unresponsive answer, even if the witness intends to mislead the questioner by his answer. See <em>Bronston v. United States </em>(1973), 409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Contrary to respondent\u2019s claims, the board accorded her due process and she had fair notice that her professional conduct in representing Bolin, by preparing a quitclaim deed and assisting him in answering the interrogatories, had been challenged. See <em>In re Ruffalo </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 544, 88 S.Ct. 1222, 20 L.Ed.2d 117; <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Wood </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 166, 512 N.E.2d 671. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>fact that she was found to have violated DR 1-102(A)(6), in essence an included offense to the charged violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 7-102(A)(3), and DR 7-102(A)(5), was of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">On the basis of clear and convincing evidence, we find respondent\u2019s conduct to be improper and unprofessional, which adversely reflects on her fitness to practice law, a violation of DR 1-102(A)(6). <em>\u201c[AJll </em>attorneys who practice law in this state are required to maintain the utmost degree of integrity, honesty, and competence.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Disciplinary Counsel v. Columbro </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 195, 197, 611 N.E.2d 302, 304. Respondent knew that her conduct was improper because she repeatedly warned Bolin, who insisted on the transfer, that the transfer was \u201cstupid.\u201d At one point respondent asserted that she told Bolin this deed \u201cwas a fraudulent conveyance,\u201d but she later denied advising Bolin in those terms. Also, respondent\u2019s participation in returning the answered interrogatory, marked \u201cnone,\u201d shows a serious lack of the professionalism expected of those licensed to practice law. Abuses of an attorney\u2019s obligations during the discovery process will not be tolerated. See <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Marsick </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 551, 692 N.E.2d 991. Although respondent could not disclose client confidences, she could have disclosed the publicly recorded deed to opposing counsel, after advising her client of her intention to do so. For her misconduct in violation of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b704-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
