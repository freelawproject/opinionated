See <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. Because the present order satisfies both requirements, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Dr. Hanington\u2019s report, on which the commission relied, is \u201csome evidence\u201d of a medical ability to work, assessing a low fifteen percent impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Assessing the second element, we find the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis acceptable as well. The commission was within its prerogative to find that claimant\u2019s age was an asset that countered the obstacles imposed by claimant\u2019s education. The commission assessed conflicting evidence about claimant\u2019s literacy and elected in favor of that which demonstrated some ability to read and write. This takes the case outside <em>State ex rel. Hall v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 289, 685 N.E.2d 1245, and <em>State ex rel. Hartness v. Kroger Co. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 445, 692 N.E.2d 181, both of which held that illiteracy and a history of heavy labor can compel a PTD finding regardless of the claimant\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We find, therefore, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying PTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
