CSU challenges the court of appeals\u2019 determination that collective bargaining is a fundamental right and its application of a height<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ened level of equal protection scrutiny. Although AAUP seeks to defend the reasoning of the court of appeals, its primary focus is on arguing that the rationales advanced in support of R.C. 3345.45 cannot withstand any level of equal protection scrutiny. For the following reasons, we hold that both appeals have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides that \u201c[a]ll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit * * *.\u201d These two provisions are functionally equivalent, and the standards for determining violations of equal protection are essentially the same under state and federal law. <em>State ex rel. Dayton Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 44 v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 22 OBR 1, 5, 488 N.E.2d 181, 185; <em>Fabrey v. McDonald Village Police Dept. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 351, 353, 639 N.E.2d 31, 33. Accordingly, we will consider the propriety of R.C. 3345.45 under both of these constitutional provisions as a single question.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The standards for determining whether a law runs afoul of equal protection generally involve identifying the means and ends of the law at issue and examining the relationship between them. If the means employed by the law at issue create separate classes of persons who receive different treatment, the laws will be tested under the equal protection guarantee. Otherwise, if no distinctions are drawn and no classifications are created, there is no reason to subject the law to equal protection scrutiny. See <em>State ex rel. Doersam v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 115, 120, 543 N.E.2d 1169, 1174; <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 561, 664 N.E.2d 926, 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">There is no question that R.C. 3345.45 legislatively creates discrete classes of persons who receive differential treatment. The statute isolates university faculty members as the only public employees as defined in R.C. 4117.01(C) who are precluded from collectively bargaining over their workload.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">However, the mere fact that R.C. 3345.45 creates separate classes of persons does not render it suspect under the Equal Protection Clause. \u201cThe demand for \u2018equal protection\u2019 cannot be a demand that laws apply universally to all persons. By the very nature of the work of the legislature, it must, if it is to act at all, impose special burdens upon or grant special benefits to special groups or classes of individuals.\u201d <em>Doersam, supra, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 119, 543 N.E.2d at 1173. Instead, the fact of classification serves only to subject the statute to equal protection scrutiny, that is, whether the classification created bears \u201ca sufficient relationship to a required governmental purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 120, 543 N.E.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Generally, \u201c[a] statutory classification which involves neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d <em>Klepper v. Ohio Bd. of Regents </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 131, 133, 570 N.E.2d 1124, 1127. In other words, \u201c[w]here neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class is involved, a legislative classification passes muster if the state can show a rational basis for the unequal treatment of different groups.\u201d <em>Fabrey, supra, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 353, 639 N.E.2d at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">R.C. 3345.45 involves neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right. Although the court of appeals raised forceful arguments as to the value and importance of collective bargaining in Ohio, no authority of which we are aware has held the right of public employees to collectively bargain over their workload to be a fundamental right for equal protection purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In an effort to defend the court of appeals\u2019 analysis, AAUP claims that this court applied a heightened level of scrutiny to a statute denying certain Dayton municipal employees the collective bargaining rights enjoyed by other similarly situated municipal employees in <em>State ex rel. Dayton Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 44, supra. </em>AAUP argues that by framing the issue to be whether the Dayton exclusion \u201cbears a fair and substantial relation to the object of the Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act,\u201d we actually applied an intermediate level of scrutiny. 22 Ohio St.3d at 6, 22 OBR at 5, 488 N.E.2d at 186. However, our focus in that case was clearly on whether the created classification was <em>\u201crationally related to a legitimate government interest.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>22 Ohio St.3d at 6, 22 OBR at 5, 488 N.E.2d at 185. At no point, did we hold the right of collective bargaining to be a fundamental right or apply a heightened or intermediate level of equal protection scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The determinative issue in this case is, therefore, whether R.C. 3345.45 bears a rational relation to a legitimate governmental interest. In considering this issue, we are guided by the principles that all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality and that, under rational-basis scrutiny, a legislative distinction will be upheld if there exists any conceivable set of facts to justify it. See <em>Fabrey, supra, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 352-353, 639 N.E.2d at 33; <em>Denicola v. Providence Hosp. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 115, 119, 11 O.O.3d 290, 293, 387 N.E.2d 231, 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The goal of R.C. 3345.45, as set forth in Section 84.14 of Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152, is \u201cto ensure that no later than fall term 1994, a minimum ten percent increase in statewide undergraduate teaching activity be achieved to restore the reductions experienced over the past decade.\u201d The record suggests, and the parties agree, that the object of this legislation is not to increase total faculty workload, but to effect a change in the ratio between faculty activities in order to correct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>imbalance between research and teaching at four-year undergraduate state institutions created by a faculty reward system which prizes research over teaching. Intrinsically, this is a concern over the quality of undergraduate education and, therefore, is a legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The fact that the General Assembly chose to correct only the decline in teaching-related activity at this time, rather than attempt to address all at once the various factors that the record suggests have contributed to the instability of higher education in Ohio, does not diminish the legitimacy of its interest. \u201cIt is generally recognized that when a legislative body chooses to act to correct a given evil it need not correct all the evil at once, but it may proceed step-by-step.\u201d <em>State v. Buckley </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 128,134, 45 O.O.2d 469, 473, 243 N.E.2d 66, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">However, the existence of a legitimate governmental interest will not enable the legislative classification to pass constitutional muster if the party attacking the legislation can show that there is no rational basis for the differential treatment. Many of the arguments advanced by CSU and its supporting <em>amicus curiae, </em>Ohio Board of Regents, seek to establish a general relationship between faculty workload and quality of education, or to justify treating differently the faculty at two- and four-year institutions. Such arguments, however, miss the-mark, as they fail to address the essential question of whether there exists a rational basis for placing faculty members in a class by themselves <em>as the only public employees as defined in R.C. 4117.01(C) denied the right to collectively bargain over their workload.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">On this precise issue, CSU and the Ohio Board of Regents argue that in order to recoup the ten-percent decline in teaching, it is necessary to achieve uniformity, consistency, and equity in terms of faculty workload by university mission, and that collective bargaining produces considerable variation in faculty workload across the universities in departments having the same academic mission. In support of its position, CSU submitted as evidence to the trial court the following reports published prior and subsequent to the enactment of R.C. 3345.45: Report, Legislative Office of Education Oversight, The Faculty Reward System in Public Universities (July 1993); Report of the Managing for the Future Task Force, Challenges &amp; Opportunities for Higher Education in Ohio (July 1992); Report of the Regents\u2019 Advisory Committee on Faculty Workload Standards <em>&amp; </em>Guidelines (Feb. 18, 1994); Report of the Regents\u2019 Advisory Committee on Faculty Workload, The Evaluation <em>&amp; </em>Reward of Teaching (June 1994); A Report of the Ohio Board of Regents, Securing the Future of Higher Education in Ohio (Dec. 1992); and the Basic Data Series, a biennial publication of tables reflecting statistical data collected from Ohio colleges and universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>We have reviewed each of these reports, and all other evidence contained in the record, and can conclude with confidence that there is not a shred of evidence in the entire record which links collective bargaining with the decline in teaching over the last decade, or in any way purports to establish that collective bargaining contributed in the slightest to the lost faculty time devoted to undergraduate teaching. Indeed, these reports appear to indicate that factors other than collective bargaining are responsible for the decline in teaching activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The Legislative Office of Education Oversight Report, <em>supra, </em>at 12, explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cFACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO IMBALANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201cThe imbalance of research over teaching and service in the faculty reward system is due to a combination of three factors, and their effects on one another. These factors are embedded in the process of granting promotions and tenure to faculty at four-year institutions throughout the country. They include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201c1. A national competition among universities for prestige, funds, faculty, and students;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201c2. The perceived difficulty of assessing faculty work other than research; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201c3. The nationwide culture of universities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The Report of the Managing for the Future Task Force explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">\u201cIn Ohio, over the past ten years faculty time devoted to teaching and student advising has decreased somewhat, while time devoted to research has increased * * *. Faculty course sections assigned each term have not changed in the aggregate, but the average \u2018student credit hours taught\u2019 (credit hour value of the course times the number of students enrolled in the course) has decreased by 10% * * *. This would indicate either that faculty are teaching courses with fewer students than in the past and/or they are spending their time on the research and service contributions that make up the balance of their work assignment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The Report goes on to list a number of priorities and to make recommendations under each priority. \u201cPriority 3\u201d is entitled \u201cIncrease Productivity and Reduce Costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. Under this priority, the Task Force seeks in part to \u201c[ejnsure that faculty time is allocated in the most productive manner, consistent with institutional and departmental missions,\u201d and to accomplish this by having the Ohio Board of Regents require each public college and university to \u201c[develop an institutional faculty performance workload policy,\u201d and \u201c[d]evelop and implement a faculty performance evaluation and appropriate reward system consistent with institutional mission, goals and objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Although these concerns are strikingly similar to the arguments made by CSU and the Ohio Board of Regents, the Report itself does not support the elimination of collective bargaining rights in order to achieve consistency and uniformity. To the contrary, the Task Force specifically recommended under this priority an assurance that \u201c[t]he rights of employees to bargain collectively are protected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The 1990 Basic Data Series indicates that teaching workload, at least in terms of average \u201ccredit hours assigned\u201d and average \u201cweekly contact hours\u201d is generally higher at state universities where collective bargaining has occurred than at other universities. Indeed, the Legislative Office of Education Oversight Report, <em>supra, </em>at 10, indicates that \u201c71 percent of faculty report their interests lean toward or lay primarily in teaching,\u201d that \u201c78 percent of these professors [regarding research as essential for tenure] would prefer teaching to be essential for tenure,\u201d and that \u201c44 percent of faculty at public institutions felt that demands for research interfered with teaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In addition, Dr. Howard L. Gauthier, Executive Associate to the Chancellor for Planning of the Ohio Board of Regents and author of the Regents\u2019 Report, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201cQ. * * * I have gone through your report and response to that report, * * * and I couldn\u2019t find any recommendation in there on behalf of the Board of Regents that faculty not be allowed to bargain about their workload?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u201cQ. And in fact I found absolutely no reports anywhere in the exhibits that have been offered by the State that suggest before July 1, 1993, that faculty not be allowed to bargain about their workload. Are you aware of any reports to that affect [sic ]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201cA. I\u2019m not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\"><em>it </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">\u201cQ. And I take it that you have done no other study either before or after the enactment of Section 3345.45 that suggested that somehow or another collective bargaining caused a reduction in any workload by faculty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">In light of the foregoing, we cannot find any rational basis for singling out university faculty members as the only public employees as defined in R.C. 4117.01(C) precluded from bargaining over their workload. Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 3345.45 violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions, since the classification contained therein bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. We find further that, in light of this holding, it is unnecessary to address AAUP\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In light of all the foregoing, we conclude that AAUP is entitled to the declaratory judgment and injunctive relief that it has requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-6\">F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b442-7\">Douglas, J., concurs in the syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b442-8\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b442-9\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8DQ\">dissenting. Because I believe that a rational basis underlies R.C. 3345.45,1 respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">I agree with the majority that collective bargaining does not rise to the level of a fundamental right and, therefore, the proper inquiry in this case is whether R.C. 3345.45 bears a rational relation to a legitimate government interest. I depart, however, from the majority\u2019s ultimate conclusion that R.C. 3345.45 fails rational-basis scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">R.C. 3345.45 represents a legislative response to a decade-long trend of declining teaching activity at four-year undergraduate state institutions in favor of research. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152, Section 84.14, uncodified, 145 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4539. As noted by the majority, \u201cThe record suggests, and the parties agree, that the object of this legislation is not to increase total faculty workload, but to effect a change in the ratio between faculty activities in order' to correct the imbalance between research and teaching at four-year undergraduate state institutions created by a faculty reward system which prizes research over teaching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">The majority recognizes that R.C. 3345.45 is aimed at a legitimate government interest \u2014 the quality of undergraduate education. Nevertheless, it concludes that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clauses of our state and federal Constitutions because its means do not legitimately relate to its desired end. The majority supports its position by stating that \u201cthere is not a shred of evidence in the entire record which links collective bargaining with the decline in teaching over the last decade, or in any way purports to establish that collective bargaining contributed in the slightest to the lost faculty time devoted to undergraduate teaching.\u201d As I explain later in this dissent, however, that collective bargaining has not <em>caused </em>the decline in teaching proves nothing in assessing whether the faculty workload standards imposed pursuant to R.C. 3345.45 legitimately relate to that statute\u2019s purpose of restoring losses in undergraduate teaching activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Initially, it is important to recognize the strong presumption of validity in favor of legislative classifications that do not involve fundamental rights or suspect classifications. See, <em>e.g., Fed. Communications Comm. v. Beach Communications, Inc. </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 307, 314-315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 2101-2102, 124 L.Ed.2d 211, 222; <em>Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Schools </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 450, 462, 108 S.Ct. 2481, 2489, 101 L.Ed.2d 399, 412. Rational-basis scrutiny is intended to be a paradigm of judicial restraint, and where there are plausible reasons for the General Assembly\u2019s action, a court\u2019s inquiry must end. <em>Beach Communications, </em>508 U.S. at 313-314, 113 S.Ct. at 2101, 124 L.Ed.2d at 221. \u201c \u2018The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Vance v. Bradley </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 942-943, 59 L.Ed.2d 171,176.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Accordingly, to enact legislation that can withstand an equal protection challenge proceeding under rational-basis scrutiny, a legislature \u201cneed not \u2018actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\u2019 <em>Nordlinger </em>[v. <em>Hahn </em>(1992)], <em>supra, </em>[505 U.S. 1] at 15 [112 S.Ct. 2326, 2334, 120 L.Ed.2d 1, 16].

Bowers, </em>358 U.S. 522, 528 [79 S.Ct. 437, 441, 3 L.Ed.2d 480, 486] (1959). Instead, a classification \u2018must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\u2019 <em>Beach Communications, supra, </em>[508 U.S.] at 313 [113 S.Ct. at 2101, 124 L.Ed.2d at 221], See also, <em>e.g., Nordlinger, supra, </em>[505 U.S.] at 11 [112 S.Ct. at 2334, 120 L.Ed.2d at 13]; <em>Sullivan v.

See also, <em>e.g., Vance v. Bradley, supra, </em>[440 U.S.] at 111 [99 S.Ct. at 949, 59 L.Ed.2d at 184]; <em>Hughes v.

Co., </em>393 U.S. 129, 139 [89 S.Ct. 323, 328, 21 L.Ed.2d 289, 297] (1968). A statute is presumed constitutional, see <em>supra, </em>at 319 [113 S.Ct. at 2642, 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 270], and \u2018[t]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,\u2019 <em>Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 U.S. 356, 364 [93 S.Ct. 1001, 1006, 35 L.Ed.2d 351, 358] (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted), whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\u201d <em>Heller v. Doe </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 312, 320-321, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 2642-2643, 125 L.Ed.2d 257, 270-271.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Based on this standard, the majority does not demonstrate that R.C. 3345.45 is unconstitutional when it says that there is no evidence in the record linking collective bargaining to the decline in teaching, or cites statistical evidence tending to show that university faculty members are more interested in teaching than research and would prefer teaching to be the essential criterion for tenure. Under rational-basis scrutiny, \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, <em>see United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S.Ct. 453, 459, 461, 66 L.Ed.2d 368, 376, 378] (1980), the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the governmental decisionmaker, <em>see Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S.Ct. 715, 724, 66 L.Ed.2d 659, 669] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. </em>[1985], 473 U.S. [432], 446 [105 S.Ct. 3249, 3257, 87 L.Ed.2d 313, 324].\u201d <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1, 11, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 2332, 120 L.Ed.2d 1, 13. Because R.C. 3345.45 concerns a legitimate government interest, the only remaining question is whether the General Assembly rationally could have believed that imposing uniform workload standards would promote its objective. See <em>W. &amp; S. Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization of California </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 648, 671, 101 S.Ct. 2070, 2084-2085, 68 L.Ed.2d 514, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The evidence before the trial court tended to demonstrate that while the current imbalance between teaching and research is due to factors unrelated to collective bargaining, it is unlikely that the collective bargaining process will bring research and teaching into balance in the absence of legislative intervention. Research provides the primary basis for competition among universities for prestige, funds, faculty, and students. This emphasis on research, in turn, leads teachers to focus their efforts disproportionately on research in hopes of increasing their value to their respective universities and marketability to more prestigious institutions. Accordingly, neither the universities nor the faculty members would seem to have much incentive to bargain for an increase in the ratio of teaching to research.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">R.C. 3345.45 requires a joint effort between the board of regents and state universities to \u201cdevelop standards for instructional workloads,\u201d setting a \u201crange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of acceptable undergraduate teaching by faculty.\u201d It also removes that subject from collective bargaining in order to ensure that the workload standards are implemented consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The majority\u2019s concern that collective bargaining did not cause the decline in teaching activity that R.C. 3345.45 seeks to rectify is inconsequential to our rational-basis review. It matters not that the General Assembly fashioned R.C. 3345.45 to treat an undesirable symptom rather than to eliminate its cause. \u201c \u2018The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beach Communications, </em>508 U.S. at 316, 113 S.Ct. at 2102, 124 L.Ed.2d at 223, quoting <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc. </em>(1955), 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563, 573. Instead, once we have determined that the General Assembly acted with a legitimate government interest in mind, rational-basis scrutiny requires that we look only to the legislative action taken and determine whether it is arbitrary or irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201c[CJourts are compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature\u2019s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. A classification does not fail rational-basis review because it \u2018 \u201cis not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u201d \u2019 <em>Dandridge v. Williams, supra, </em>[397 U.S.] at 485 [90 S.Ct. at 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d at 501-502], quoting <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369, 377] (1911). \u2018The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations \u2014 illogical, it may be, and unscientific.\u2019 <em>Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, </em>228 U.S. 61, 69-70 [33 S.Ct. 441, 443, 57 L.Ed. 730, 734] (1913). See also, e.g., <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Ford, </em>504 U.S. 648, 651 [112 S.Ct. 2184, 2187, 119 L.Ed.2d 432, 438] (1992); <em>Vance v. Bradley, supra, </em>[440 U.S.] at 108 [99 S.Ct. at 948, 59 L.Ed.2d at 183] and n. 26; <em>New Orleans v. Dukes, supra, </em>[427 U.S.] at 303 [96 S.Ct. at 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d at 517]; <em>Schweiker v. Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 234 [101 S.Ct. 1074, 1082, 67 L.Ed.2d 186, 198] (1981).\u201d <em>Heller, </em>509 U.S. at 321, 113 S.Ct. at 2642-2643, 125 L.Ed.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The General Assembly\u2019s choice to \u201csingle out\u201d university faculty as the only class of public employees as defined in R.C. 4117.01(C) who are precluded from collectively bargaining over their workload is not arbitrary. R.C. 3345.45\u2019s goal of recovering recent decreases in teaching activity at state universities exclusively relates to the workload of university faculty members, providing a reasonable basis for the classification. Further, imposing uniform workload standards upon university faculty at state four-year institutions is not an irrational means of effecting an increase in teaching activity. In fact, it was probably the most direct means of accomplishing that objective available to the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Based on all of the foregoing, I believe that R.C. 3345.45 is rationally related to a legitimate government interest and must be upheld against today\u2019s equal protection challenge. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
