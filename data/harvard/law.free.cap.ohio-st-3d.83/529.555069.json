Go-Jo concedes that there was no power-disengagement device at the location where claimant was injured. At issue is the applicability of those provisions and the evidentiary support underlying the commission\u2019s determination that they were violated. For the reasons to follow, we find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in assessing these penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\n<em>Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(C)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201cAll conveyors, where exposed to contact, shall be equipped with means to disengage them from their power supply at such points of contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Go-Jo opposes, on two grounds, the commission\u2019s conclusion that the Jones Cartoner was a conveyor. Go-Jo initially argues that this conclusion was barred by the commission\u2019s March 2, 1994 order. Go-Jo contends that the March 2 order specifically found that the Cartoner was not a conveyor, and that the commission was subsequently bound by that determination. Appellees dispute the order\u2019s conclusive effect, describing the order as simply interlocutory. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The March 2, 1994 order was generated by Go-Jo\u2019s request for reconsideration, and was promulgated pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-20(G), which permits rehearing in two instances \u2014 one of which is where there has been an obvious mistake of fact. In what is perhaps an inartfully worded order, the commission follows its conclusion that the Cartoner was not a conveyor with language setting a rehearing \u2014 the latter articulating its intent to subject claimant\u2019s VSSR application to further review. We have previously held that such a clear indicium of intent supports a finding that an order was interlocutory. See <em>State ex rel. Brewer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 23, 12 OBR 20, 465 N.E.2d 389; <em>State ex rel. Draganic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 461, 663 N.E.2d 929. Indeed, to consider the SHO\u2019s finding on the character of the Cartoner to be anything but nonbinding is irreconcilable with the SHO\u2019s grant of rehearing. A binding determination that the Cartoner was not a conveyor would have automatically rendered Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(C)(2) inapplicable, eliminating the need for any further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">Our holding is further supported by the mechanics of Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-20(G) itself. If reconsideration is granted, the matter goes again to hearing. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>is the written order generated by <em>that </em>hearing which is, according to the express terms of Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-20(0(4), deemed final. We find, therefore, that the March 2, 1994 finding was interlocutory, and, pursuant to <em>Dragante, </em>not binding upon the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Further, Go-Jo argues that there is not \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the August 22, 1994 conclusion that the Cartoner was a conveyor. Go-Jo contends alternatively that even if the Cartoner was a conveyor, it was an internal conveyor, which exempts Go-Jo from liability. Neither assertion has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05 does not define \u201cconveyor.\u201d Interpretation of that term was, therefore, within the commission\u2019s final jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel Berry v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 193, 4 OBR 513, 448 N.E.2d 134. In this instance, the SHO adopted the definition of \u201cconveyor\u201d put forth by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Under that definition, \u201ca conveyor\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201c[A] horizontal, inclined, or vertical device for moving or transporting bulk material, packages, or objects, in a path predetermined by the design of the device, and having points of loading or discharge, fixed or selective. Included are skip hoists, and vertical reciprocating an[d] inclined reciprocating conveyors. Typical exceptions are those devices known as industrial trucks, tractors, trailers, tiering machines (except pallet load tierers), cranes, hoists, power shovels, power scoops, bucket drag lines, trenchers, platform elevators designed to carry passengers or an operator, manlifts, moving walks, moving stairways (escalators), highway or railway vehicles, cableways, tramways, dumbwaiters, pneumatic conveyors, robots, or integral transfer devices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">In finding that the apparatus at issue fell within this definition, the SHO relied on, among other things, photos of the Cartoner submitted at hearing. There was, therefore, \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the SHO\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Go-Jo alternately responds that even if the Cartoner was correctly found to be a conveyor, it was an \u201cinternal conveyor\u201d to which no liability attaches, citing <em>State ex rel. Ford v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Oct. 6, 1992), Franklin App. No. 91AP-253, unreported, 1992 WL 281232. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The <em>Ford </em>decision \u2014 which we affirmed at 67 Ohio St.3d 121, 616 N.E.2d 228\u2014 is distinguishable from this case. <em>Ford </em>involved an employee who worked in a plant powerhouse, which supplied steam to the rest of the plant by way of coal-fired boilers. Coal was carried to the boilers by a series of enclosed drag bucket conveyors. On the date of injury, Ford and a co-worker were repairing one of those conveyors.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">In order to determine which buckets were broken, Ford removed a hinged cover on top of the conveyor enclosure and observed the passing buckets as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>companion operated the conveyor. When a damaged bucket was finally spotted, Ford told his co-worker to stop the machine. Ford then climbed into the conveyor before his fellow employee had a chance to \u201clock out\u201d the machine\u2019s power source. Ford was killed when the conveyor was unknowingly reactivated from a remote location.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Ford\u2019s widow alleged a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201405(C)(2). Neither the commission nor the court of appeals found a violation of that section, and we affirmed that judgment. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cOhio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201405(C)(2) mandates a disengagement device at points \u2018exposed to contact.\u2019 An object is\u2018exposed to contact\u2019 when its location, \u2018during the course of operation, is accessible to an employee in performance of his regular or assigned duty.\u2019 Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201405(B)(11). [Ohio Adm. Code] 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201405(C)(2), therefore, will not apply if the accident occurred in a spot that was not accessible during the course of operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201cBecause neither \u2018accessible\u2019 nor \u2018course of operation\u2019 is defined in the Revised or Administrative Code, the interpretation of these terms is within the commission\u2019s final jurisdiction. * * * In this case, decedent was killed inside an enclosed conveyor. If the conveyor and its attached drag buckets had been moving at the time, decedent could not have entered the enclosure. <em>Only </em>if the conveyor was <em>first </em>stopped could decedent have gained access to the area in which he died. Given the commission\u2019s duty to strictly construe specific safety requirements in the employer\u2019s favor * * *, the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that a location which is accessible only during cessation of operation was not \u2018accessible\u2019 in the \u2018course of operation,\u2019 and was not made so merely because the conveyor <em>subsequently </em>started running.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 122-123, 616 N.E.2d at 229-230.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The basis for our decision in <em>Ford </em>is inapplicable here. The decision in <em>Ford </em>did not rest on the mere fact that the conveyor was enclosed. Our decision instead was based on the inaccessibility of the disengagement device during the course of operation. Here, the location of the accident was readily accessible to claimant during the course of the Cartoner\u2019s operation. Thus, the circumstances that excused a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05(0(2) in <em>Ford </em>do not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Considering all of the above, we rule that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05(0(2). .</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">\n<em>Ohio Adm.Code I121:l-5-05(D)(l)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">\u201cMeans shall be provided at each machine, within easy reach of the operator, for disengaging it from its power supply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>In response to the finding of noncompliance, Go-Jo asserts two defenses: (1) that claimant was not the Cartoner\u2019s \u201coperator,\u201d and (2) the practical impossibility of compliance. We find neither contention to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Go-Jo initially argues that because the Cartoner was automated, it had no \u201coperator,\u201d thereby removing claimant from the scope of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05(D)(l)\u2019s protection. This contention, however, is undermined by our recent decision in <em>State ex rel. Scott Fetzer Co., Halex Div. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 462, 692 N.E.2d 195. In <em>Fetzer, </em>the claimant, as here, had several responsibilities related to the employer\u2019s machine. During the course of those duties, claimant was severely injured when the machine\u2019s dies closed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">His employer asserted the automated nature of the machine as a defense \u2014 a defense that we rejected, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201cFetzer also argues that claimant was not entitled to the protection of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(D)(6) because he was the \u2018tender,\u2019 not the \u2018operator\u2019 of the machine. This contention fails as well. Regardless of what Fetzer chose to call claimant, he was actively involved in the machine\u2019s operation. Claimant started, inspected, and cleaned the die. He operated the linkage mechanism and set die heights. He oiled the die and checked for defective parts. He was responsible for lodged parts and correcting malfunctions. He was not, therefore, a casual observer with no responsibility for or participation in the machine\u2019s function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 692 N.E.2d at 197-198.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The same principles are equally applicable here. Neither the Cartoner\u2019s automation nor the necessity for mobility in claimant\u2019s performance of his job duties precludes a finding that he was indeed the machine\u2019s \u201coperator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Go-Jo also cites <em>State ex rel. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 145, 16 O.O.3d 165, 404 N.E.2d 140, to support its position. In <em>Owens-Corning, </em>the claimant worked on an assembly line, folding fiberglass batts as they passed by on a conveyor belt. The next employee removed the fiberglass batts and stacked them, whereupon a third worker transferred the fiberglass batts to an adjacent packing machine. While claimant was working at a separate conveyor, he somehow placed his foot onto the packing machine and was hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">In alleging a violation of the same specific safety requirement now before us, claimant in <em>Owens Corning </em>alleged that he was the operator of the packing machine. We disagreed with claimant\u2019s argument that the term \u201coperator\u201d applied to everyone \u201cwho work[s] at a machine and whose activity is necessary for [the machine\u2019s] operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 16 O.O.3d at 166, 404 N.E.2d at 141. Stressing that claimant was working at a conveyor separate from the packing machine, we found that claimant was not covered by the safety provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Go-Jo\u2019s reliance on <em>Owens Corning </em>is misplaced. In the case at bar, claimant was working <em>at </em>the machine which injured him \u2014 the Jones Cartoner. This is not a situation where claimant was injured by equipment apart from that at which he was working. <em>Owens Corning </em>does not, therefore, compel a finding that claimant was not the \u201coperator\u201d of the Cartoner. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Finally, Go-Jo directs us to the following passage from <em>State ex rel. Harris v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 152, 154, 12 OBR 223, 225, 465 N.E.2d 1286, 1288:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cIt would be impossible to comply with Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(D)(l) if the controls had to be -within easy reach of all possible positions in which the operator could find himself around the machine. The commission acted reasonably in interpreting the rule to refer to the position in which the operator is normally situated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\"><em>Harris </em>articulates an important workers\u2019 compensation ruling. However, where \u2014 as here \u2014 there is \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the conclusion that claimant\u2019s presence at the site of injury was not abnormal, irregular, or unusual in the performance of his duties, the commission did not abuse its discretion in distinguishing <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">For all of these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b741-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
