Bruner v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 243, 673 N.E.2d 1278, and <em>State ex rel. Mann v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 656, 687 N.E.2d 773. <em>Mann </em>and <em>Bruner </em>involved claimants with a work history akin to that seen here \u2014 unskilled and nonsedentary. The commission denied PTD in both cases after determining that the claimant possessed job skills that would transfer to other positions. In neither case did the commission identify what these perceived \u201cskills\u201d were, and only in <em>Mann </em>did the commission even hint at what these potential new jobs might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">We twice found <em>Noll </em>noncompliance and pointedly admonished the commission for its hollow orders in both cases. In <em>Bruner, </em>we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u2018We are disturbed by the increasing frequency with which the commission has denied permanent total disability compensation based on \u2018transferable skills\u2019 that the commission refuses to identify. This lack of specificity is even more troubling when those \u2018skills\u2019 are derived from traditionally unskilled jobs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 673 N.E.2d at 1280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>In <em>Mann, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cThe commission, in finding claimant capable of work, relies overwhelmingly on claimant\u2019s past employment. Its discussion is flawed because, despite excessive verbiage, it is no more than a recitation of claimant\u2019s nonmedical profile. The commission lists claimant\u2019s work history three times but never explains how those nonsedentary jobs equip claimant for a sedentary position. Moreover, the commission\u2019s reference to \u2018sedentary low stress positions in the food service industry\u2019 merits further explanation. While the commission is generally not required to enumerate the jobs of which it believes claimant to be capable, its assertion that claimant could do low stress sedentary work in an industry that is traditionally considered neither low stress nor sedentary requires further exploration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 687 N.E.2d at 776.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\"><em>Mann </em>and <em>Bruner </em>establish that the present claimant, at a minimum, is entitled to a <em>Noll </em>\u201cremand.\u201d Claimant, however, urges us to go one step further and order PTD pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Claimant\u2019s position is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Our decision to order a <em>Noll </em>remand in <em>Bruner </em>does not control, due to significant factual distinctions between this case and <em>Bruner. </em>Unlike Bruner, this claimant does not have a GED and must rely on her eighth grade education. Moreover, Bruner had a low twenty-five percent impairment. The present claimant\u2019s impairment is more than double that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The present claimant has also been described as a poor candidate for retraining or rehabilitation by the doctor on whom the commission expressly relied. This distinguishes this case from <em>Mann, </em>in which the vocational consultant who assessed Mann said that there were jobs for which she was medically and vocationally qualified. This factor, combined with Mann\u2019s possession of a GED, sets the present case apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">It is difficult, in this case, to view without skepticism the commission\u2019s ability to accomplish anything meaningful upon a return for further consideration. The commission cannot identify something that does not exist, and the existence of any significant \u201cskills\u201d as derived from a cashier or mailroom clerk position is very dubious. The same can be said of the \u201cmany\u201d jobs that the claimant can purportedly do. Because claimant\u2019s education, unskilled work history, and poor candidacy for retraining limit her to unskilled labor, we question how many of those jobs realistically exist in the low stress light/sedentary realm. For these reasons, we find <em>Gay </em>relief to be the more appropriate remedial option.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">That portion of the appellate judgment which found <em>Noll </em>noncompliance is affirmed. That portion which returned the cause for further consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>pursuant to <em>Noll </em>is reversed, and a writ of mandamus consistent with <em>Gay </em>is hereby granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals returning the case pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. This is not a case of vocationally unfavorable evidence paired with a high degree of physical impairment \u2014 the usual <em>Gay </em>relief profile. See <em>State ex rel. Domjancic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 693, 635 N.E.2d 372.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
