For the following reasons, however, Orr\u2019s assertion lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">First, as the court of appeals held, habeas corpus is not available to attack the validity or sufficiency of the charging instrument. <em>State ex rel. Beaucamp v. Lazaroff </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 237, 238, 673 N.E.2d 1273, 1274. The manner by which an accused is charged with a crime is procedural rather than jurisdictional, and after a conviction for crimes charged in an indictment, the judgment binds the defendant for the crime for which he was convicted. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Wells v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 198, 200, 22 O.O.2d 147, 148, 188 N.E.2d 160, 161, and <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 522-523, 18 O.O.2d 58, 61, 178 N.E.2d 800, 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">Second, Orr had an adequate legal remedy by direct appeal to challenge the validity or sufficiency of the complaint and indictment. <em>State ex rel. Simpson v. Lazaroff </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 571, 664 N.E.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Finally, Orr did not verify his petition as required by R.C. 2725.04. <em>State ex rel. Ranzy v. Coyle </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 109, 110, 689 N.E.2d 563, 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-15\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
