The essence of MIB\u2019s contention is that because the members do not have direct control of the main computer where information is stored, the members do not receive access to its computer equipment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Although the tax at issue is the use tax, R.C. 5741.02(C)(2) excepts from the application of the use tax the acquisition of tangible personal property and services \u201cwhich, if made in Ohio, would be a sale not subject to the tax imposed by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code.\u201d Therefore, we will discuss only whether MIB\u2019s transactions with its members are subject to the sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">During the audit period, R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201c(B) \u2018Sale\u2019 * * * include[s] all of the following transactions for a consideration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">:|: * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">\u201c(3) All transactions by which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\"><em>(( </em>* <em># </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">\u201c(e) Automatic data processing or computer services are or are to be provided for use in business when the true object of the transaction is the receipt by the consumer of automatic data processing or computer services rather than the receipt of personal or professional services to which automatic data processing or computer services are incidental or supplemental.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">In addition, former R.C.- 5739.01(Y)(1) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-17\">\u25a0 \u201c \u2018Automatic data processing' and computer services\u2019 means: * * * processing Of others\u2019 data, including keypunching or similar data entry services together with verification thereof; providing access to computer equipment for the purpose of processing data or examining or acquiring data stored in or accessible to such computer equipment * * *. \u2018Automatic data processing, and computer services\u2019 shall not include personal or professional services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>In support of its argument, MIB cites Tax Commr. Op. No. 92-0007 (Apr. 30, 1992), and <em>PNC Bank, Ohio, N.A. v. Tracy </em>(July 7, 1995), BTA No. 93-T-1316. After reviewing these cases, we find them not helpful or persuasive because neither is analogous to the fact pattern presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In <em>Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 447, 584 N.E.2d 658, customers were able to access Quotron\u2019s computers to receive current pricing information on securities and commodities. In <em>Amerestate, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 222, 648 N.E.2d 1336, customers were able to contact Amerestate\u2019s computer to download and print the information desired. In both of these cases, we held that the services provided were taxable as automatic data processing and computer services.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">MIB attempts to distinguish its factual situation from <em>Quotron </em>and <em>Amerestate </em>by pointing out that in those cases the customers had direct access to the database where the information was stored. However, the wording of the statute does not require that the members have direct access to search MIB\u2019s host computer before their transactions can be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Prior to the audit period in this case, the definition of \u201cautomatic data processing and computer services\u201d in former R.C. 5739.0100 did require the vendor to provide \u201cdirect access to computer equipment.\u201d 140 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2872, 3220. However, in 1985 the General Assembly amended the definition to remove the word \u201cdirect.\u201d 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 225, 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">During the audit period, former R.C. 5739.0100(1) defined \u201cautomatic data processing and computer services\u201d as \u201cproviding <em>access </em>to computer equipment for the purpose of processing data or examining or <em>acquiring </em>data stored in or accessible to such computer equipment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See 142 Ohio Laws, Part 1,1435, 1496.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The two words in R.C. 5739.0100(1) that are key to our decision are \u201caccess\u201d and \u201cacquiring.\u201d R.C. 1.42 provides that \u201c[wjords and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Words and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">The word \u201caccess,\u201d as defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986), at 11, has several meanings, but the ones most appropriate to the context of this statute are \u201cpermission, liberty, or ability to enter, approach, communicate with\u201d and \u201cfreedom or ability to obtain or make use of.\u201d According to these definitions of \u201caccess,\u201d MIB\u2019s members had \u201caccess\u201d to MIB\u2019s computer because they had the ability to communicate with and enter and make use of MIB\u2019s computer equipment to retrieve the data stored therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The second word of importance in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(1) is \u201cacquiring.\u201d Again, the word \u201cacquiring\u201d is not defined in the statute; however, the definition for \u201cacquire\u201d set forth in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary at 18 is \u201cto come into possession, control, or power of disposal of often by some uncertain or unspecified means.\u201d The facts in this case clearly show that MIB\u2019s members do come into possession of information from MIB\u2019s computers. The primary purpose of the members for making an. inquiry is to acquire the information stored in MIB\u2019s computers concerning applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Despite the inability of MIB\u2019s members to search directly the data stored in MIB\u2019s computer, the members had access to MIB\u2019s computers. Members were able to access MIB\u2019s computer equipment using the equipment in their offices provided by MIB. Despite the inability of the members to search MIB\u2019s data files directly, and despite the members\u2019 requests being routed through several computers, the members had access to MIB\u2019s computers for the purpose of examining and acquiring the data stored therein. As the BTA so aptly put it, \u201cthe computers utilized by MIB\u2019s members worked in direct concert with the computers at MIB to provide that member with access to the information sought by that member.\u201d Thus, the transactions between MIB and its members qualify as automatic data processing and computer services,</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">MIB argues next that it is rendering a personal service. In support of this argument,. MIB cites three cases: <em>Credit Bur. of Miami Cty. v. Collins </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 270, 4 O.O.3d 439, 364 N.E.2d 27; <em>Avco Broadcasting Corp. v. Bindley </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 64, 7 O.O.3d 145, 372 N.E.2d 350; and <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Bindley </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 295, 20 O.O.3d 280, 421 N.E.2d 525. MIB contends that its activities are similar to those granted exemption in these three cases. We disagree with MIB\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The three cases cited by MIB were all decided prior to the enactment of the tax on automatic data processing and computer services in 1983. 140 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2872, 3215. The definition of \u201cautomatic data processing and computer services\u201d contained in former R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e) includes as a taxable sale a transaction in which the \u201ctrue object of the transaction is the receipt by the consumer of automatic data processing and computer services rather than the receipt of personal or professional services to which automatic data processing or computer services are incidental or supplemental.\u201d The term \u201cpersonal or professional services,\u201d as used in R.C. 5739.01(B)(3)(e), is defined in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2). In <em>ComTech Sys., Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 96, 98, 570 N.E.2d 1089, 1092, we agreed with the Tax Commissioner\u2019s statement that if there are automatic data processing and computer services involved, then we have to look to the definition of \u201cpersonal and professional services\u201d found in former R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2) to determine whether the services are personal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>professional. See, also, <em>CCH Computax, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 86, 623 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2) contains a nonexclusive listing, in subparagraphs (a) through (j), of general and specific examples of personal and professional services. However, except for credit information, which we will discuss later, MIB does not refer us to any personal or professional service listed in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2) as an example of the type of service it provides for its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The general description of personal and professional services contained in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(a) states that these are situations \u201cwhere the service provider receives data or information and studies, alters, analyzes, interprets, or adjusts such material.\u201d The data gathered and reported by MIB are that provided by its members. MIB has not cited any evidence showing that it alters, analyzes, interprets, or adjusts the data provided by its members. The BTA found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that the members are given an interpretation or analysis of that information.\u201d Thus, MIB\u2019s activities did not provide personal or professional services within the meaning of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">MIB\u2019s last contention is that its computer services should be exempted as personal or professional services under R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i), which defines as an exempt personal or professional service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201c(i) Providing <em>credit information </em>to users of such information by a consumer reporting agency, as defined in the \u2018Fair Credit Reporting Act,\u2019 84 Stat. 1114, 1129 (1970), 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), or as hereafter amended, including but not limited to gathering, organizing, analyzing, recording, and furnishing such information by any oral, written, graphic or electronic medium[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The Tax Commissioner contends that in order to qualify for the exemption set forth in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i), MIB must show both (1) that it is a consumer reporting agency and (2) that the information it provides is credit information. The Tax Commissioner further contends that MIB does not qualify for the exemption because MIB does not provide access to credit information. We agree with the Tax Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Although R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i) specifically exempts as a personal or professional service providing \u201ccredit information,\u201d it does not define the latter term. Likewise, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), Section 1681 <em>et seq., </em>Title 15, U.S.Code, which is referred to in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i), uses the term \u201ccredit information,\u201d but also fails to define it.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">MIB contends that the term \u201ccredit information\u201d was defined in the context of the FCRA in <em>Fed. Trade Comm. v. TRW, Inc. </em>(N.D.Tex.1991), 784 F.Supp. 361. However, review of that case does not confirm MIB\u2019s contention. <em>TRW </em>involved a consent order agreed to by the parties without trial adjudication of any issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>fact or law. In the consent order the parties stated that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this Order * * * \u2018Credit Information\u2019 means the information TRW maintains bearing on any of the characteristics listed in Sec. 603(d) of the FCRA [See Section 1681a(d), Title 15, U.S.Code] with respect to' any Consumer that TRW obtains from Subscribers, court records or any other source and from which TRW creates Consumer Reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">By its own terms the definition of \u201ccredit information\u201d set forth in <em>TRW </em>is limited to the consent order. The facts recited in the <em>TRW </em>case do not describe what type of information TRW maintained, or for what purpose the information was used. <em>TRW </em>does not establish a definition of \u201ccredit information\u201d for purposes of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">MIB further contends that it is a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d as defined by FCRA. For purposes of discussion we are willing to accept MIB\u2019s assertion. Section 1681a(f), Title 15, U.S.Code defines as a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d \u201cany person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating <em>consumer credit information or other information </em>on consumers for the purpose of furnishing <em>consumer reports </em>to third parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In turn, FCRA defines a \u201cconsumer report\u201d in .Section 1681a(d)(l), Title 15, U.S.Code as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201c[A]ny written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">\u201c(A) credit or insurance * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">From the above it can be seen that being a consumer reporting agency does not mean that the information being reported is credit information. A credit reporting agency can provide consumer reports to third parties on \u201ccredit information or other information.\u201d To determine whether MIB is dealing with credit information we must look at the word \u201ccredit.\u201d Because \u201ccredit\u201d is not defined in R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i), we again follow R.C. 1.42. \u201cCredit\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary at 532, as \u201cthe balance in a person\u2019s favor in an account; <em>also: </em>an amount or limit to the extent of which a person may receive goods or money for payment in the future\u201d; \u201can amount or sum placed at a person\u2019s disposal by a bank : a loan of money\u201d; and \u201ctime given for payment for goods or services sold for future payment.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990), at 367, defines \u201ccredit\u201d as \u201c[t]he ability of a business or person to borrow money, or obtain goods on time, in consequence of the favorable opinion held by the particular lender as to solvency and past history of reliabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ty.\u201d All of these definitions of \u201ccredit\u201d relate in some way to money. The evidence in this case fails to show that MIB\u2019s reports were related to money or credit as opposed to insurance. The information reported by MIB related solely to medical or lifestyle matters, not money matters. One of MIB\u2019s witnesses, an underwriter from a member company, was asked if any financial information is communicated, and he said he could not think of any financial information communicated to MIB.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The evidence clearly established that the information provided by MIB to its members was used to help determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for insurance, not credit. The information provided by MIB to its members was not \u201ccredit information\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Accordingly, we find the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals to be reasonable and lawful, and we therefore affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Amz\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b365-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b365-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Atzq\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I would find that MIB is exempt from taxation on information that it provides to its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">MIB contends that it is a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), Section 1681 <em>et seq., </em>Title 15, U.S.Code, and therefore is exempt from taxation pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i). The majority, \u201c[f]or purposes of discussion,\u201d accepts \u201cMIB\u2019s assertion.\u201d However, the majority concludes that MIB is not a consumer credit agency for tax purposes because \u201c[t]he information provided by MIB to its members was not \u2018credit information\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i).\u201d I find that the majority\u2019s analysis is incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">As the majority notes, a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d is \u201c[a]ny person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or <em>other information </em>on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports <em>to third parties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 1681a(f), Title 15, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Also consistent with the majority\u2019s conclusions, a \u201cconsumer report\u201d communicates consumer credit or other information regarding the consumer for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of establishing the consumer\u2019s <em>eligibility for </em>\u201ccredit or <em>insurance.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 1681a(d)(l), Title 15, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In determining whether MIB issues a consumer report, as defined in Section 1681a(d)(l), the majority focuses exclusively on the definition of \u201ccredit\u201d in a financial sense only and finds that MIB\u2019s reports were not related to credit. The majority ignores the fact that a consumer report may also transmit \u201cother information\u201d for the purpose of \u201cfurnishing consumer reports to third parties\u201d in order to \u201cestablish] the consumer\u2019s eligibility for * * * insurance.\u201d This is precisely what MIB does. MIB assembles' and disseminates information that contains medical and lifestyle information to allow its members to determine an individual\u2019s insurance eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Thus, I would find that MIB is a consumer reporting agency which is exempt from taxation pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(Y)(2)(i). Accordingly, I would reverse the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
