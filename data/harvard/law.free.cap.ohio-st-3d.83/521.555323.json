For the following reasons, however, Brantley\u2019s contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">As the court of appeals correctly held, at the time Brantley filed his motion, neither former Ohio Adm.Code 5120:1-1-17 nor Ohio Adm.Code 5120:1-1-31 required the APA to cancel the detainer. Former Ohio Adm.Code 5120:1-1-17, as cited by Brantley, did not impose any duty to cancel detainers. Ohio Adm.Code 5120:1-1-31(E) authorizes the APA to choose to initiate revocation proceedings in lieu of canceling a detainer. Brantley conceded in his motion that he was ultimately convicted of the new criminal charges that were the basis for the detainer. The APA has no legal duty to hold a final parole revocation hearing for Brantley during the time he is incarcerated on new criminal charges. <em>State ex rel. Taylor v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 121, 609 N.E.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">In addition, original actions for extraordinary relief like a writ of mandamus must be commenced by filing a complaint or petition rather than a motion. <em>State ex rel. Simms v. Sutula </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 110, 111, 689 N.E.2d 564; <em>Myles v. Wyatt </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 191, 580 N.E.2d 1080, 1081. Brantley erroneously filed a motion rather than a complaint or petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Finally, contrary to Brantley\u2019s claims, no additional discovery was necessary for the court of appeals to resolve appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. See <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. </em>Hancock <em>Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 134, 136, 684 N.E.2d 1222, 1224 (\u201cIn order to be entitled to dismissal under Civ.R. 12[C], it must appear beyond doubt that relator can prove no set of facts warranting the requested relief, after construing all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>material factual allegations <em>in the complaint </em>and all reasonable inferences therefrom in relator\u2019s favor.\u201d [Emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
