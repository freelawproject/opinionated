Trydle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 257, 61 O.O.2d 488, 291 N.E.2d 748, paragraph one of the syllabus. Moreover, because a VSSR is an employer penalty, the specific safety requirement \u201cmust be strictly construed, and all reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the safety standard are to be construed against its applicability to the employer.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216,1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">The commission found that claimant\u2019s job did not present a clear foot hazard, rendering Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-17(E) inapplicable. Claimant \u201cdoes not dispute that, in and of itself, the operation of a binding machine does not present a clear foot hazard.\u201d She nevertheless argues that there were other potential foot hazards that mandated compliance with the safety requirement. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Claimant\u2019s proposed foot hazards are too nebulous. It is not that they are not possible. To the contrary, using claimant\u2019s examples, they exist everywhere. That claimant could drop a book on her foot or that something else conceivably could fall on it is assuredly not the type of hazard envisioned by the Administrative Code\u2019s authors as requiring protection. If it were, <em>every </em>employer would be required to supply its employees with safety shoes should a drawer fall from a desk or a desk chair roll over toes.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Turning to <em>Trydle, </em>we cannot envision how an employer would be plainly apprised that the possibility of a foot injury that exists as a part of everyday life \u2014 both at and away from work \u2014 imposed upon it the legal obligation to provide safety shoes. Coupled with <em>Burton\u2019s </em>underlying strict construction directive, we hold that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-17(E) was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
