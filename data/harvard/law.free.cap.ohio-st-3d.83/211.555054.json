However, because we find one contention to be dispositive, we will not discuss the other contentions raised by Visicon. The dispositive contention raised by Visicon is that the state of Ohio has no jurisdiction to assess a real property tax on the Hotel because such tax is not authorized by the United States Constitution, federal case law, or Section 2667(e), Title 10, U.S.Code. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Visicon claims that the tax in this case is not permitted under the United States Constitution. Clause 17, Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, permits the United States to obtain exclusive jurisdiction over lands within a state. Specifically it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">\u201cThe Congress shall have Power * * * [t]o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever * * * over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buddings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The essence of Clause 17, Section 8, Article I is that when land owned by the United States becomes subject to its exclusive jurisdiction, the state retains only such jurisdiction as it reserves when the land is ceded to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The record in this case includes a letter to Visicon from the Assistant to the base Commander of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, stating that the Hotel is located on exclusive-jurisdiction land, within the confines of Wright-Patterson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>In addition, the Lease in paragraph 9d represents that the \u201cUnited States presently exercises exclusive Federal jurisdiction over the leased premises.\u201d The Attorney General apparently does not dispute Wright-Patterson\u2019s exclusive-jurisdiction status. The appendix attached to the Attorney General\u2019s brief submitted to the BTA contains a letter to an Assistant Attorney General from an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate at Wright-Patterson concerning the exclusive jurisdiction over the base. Attached to the letter is a copy of a 1980 letter from the Air Force to the Governor of Ohio, stating that it updates a 1948 letter from the Air Force giving notice to the Governor that the United States has accepted exclusive jurisdiction over Wright-Patterson. The 1980 letter sets forth an acknowledgment of receipt and acceptance of the exclusive jurisdiction by the Governor. Thus, it is not disputed that the land occupied by the Hotel is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The terms of Clause 17, Section 8, Article I are recognized and implemented by the state of Ohio in R.C. Chapter 159. R.C. 159.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u201cThe consent of the state is given, in accordance with clause 17, Section 8, Article I, United States Constitution, to the acquisition, between May 6,1902, and the effective date of this amendment [March 14, 1980], by the United States, by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise, of any land in this state required for sites for custom houses, courthouses, post offices, arsenals, or other public buildings whatever, or for any other purposes of the government.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">R.C. 159.04. then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201c(A) <em>Exclusive jurisdiction </em>in and over any land acquired by the United States under section 159.03 of the Revised Code is hereby ceded to the United States, <em>for all purposes </em>except the service upon such sites of all civil and criminal process of the courts of this state.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Finally, R.C. 159.05 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\u201cAs long as the lands whose acquisition is consented to by section 159.03 of the Revised Code remain the property of the United States they are <em>exempt and exonerated from all state, county, and municipal taxation, assessment, </em>or other charges which may be levied or imposed under the authority of this state.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">In <em>S.R.A., Inc. v. Minnesota </em>(1946), 327 U.S. 558, 562-563, 66 S.Ct. 749, 753, 90 L.Ed. 851, 856, the Supreme Court stated, regarding lands over which the United States has exclusive jurisdiction, \u201c[N]ot only is the federal property immune from taxation because of the supremacy of the Federal Government but state laws, not adopted directly or impliedly by the United States, <em>are ineffective to tax or regulate other property </em>or persons upon that enclave.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Likewise in <em>Evans v. Comman </em>(1970), 398 U.S. 419, 426, 90 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>L.Ed.2d 370, 376, fn. 4, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[ejxcept for a lessee\u2019s interest in property leased from the United States, see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2667(e), Congress has not provided that States may apply their property taxes to federal enclaves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Thus, unless Congress specifically waives the immunity from taxation, property located on exclusive jurisdiction land is not taxable. For instance in <em>Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook </em>(1930), 281 U.S. 647, 50 S.Ct. 455, 74 L.Ed. 1091, Arkansas levied a personal property tax against a quantity of blankets that had been purchased from the United States by a New York company a few days prior to the tax listing date. On the tax listing date most of the blankets were still located at the Army\u2019s Camp Pike. After reviewing the status of Camp Pike, as exclusive-jurisdiction land, the Supreme Court held that consistent with the United States Constitution, Arkansas\u2019 tax laws could not be applied to personal property located within Camp Pike.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In a more recent case, <em>Humble Pipe Line Co. v. Waggonner </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 369, 84 S.Ct. 857, 11 L.Ed.2d 782, Louisiana sought to levy an ad valorem tax upon property owned by Humble and located upon Barksdale Air Force Base. The Louisiana taxing authorities contended that by granting an oil and gas lease to lay a pipeline, the government had lost its power to exclusive jurisdiction over those parts of the base. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that it had previously held that exclusive federal jurisdiction was not lost by lease of property for commercial purposes within an enclave. The Supreme Court pointed out that \u201c[w]hen Congress has wished to allow a State to exercise jurisdiction to levy certain taxes within a federal enclave it has specifically so stated, as in the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 104 \u2014 110.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 84 S.Ct. at 860-861, 11 L.Ed.2d at 787. The Buck Act permits states to impose sales, use, and income taxes within an area of exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Moreover, Section 2667(e), Title 10, U.S.Code does not allow taxation of this property. In this statute, Congress has granted to state and local governments the right to tax a lessee\u2019s interest in property leased from the United States. Section 2667(e), Title 10, U.S.Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\"><em>\u201cThe interest of a lessee of property leased under this section may be taxed by State or local governments. A </em>lease under this section shall provide that, if and to the extent that the leased property is later made taxable by State or local, governments under an Act of Congress, the lease shall be renegotiated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Under Section 2667(e), Title 10, U.S.Code, a state is permitted to tax the \u201cinterest of a lessee of property leased under this section.\u201d Thus, Congress has granted permission to tax the lessee\u2019s leasehold interest. The only property leased from the Air Force in this case was the land. For the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>discussion we will treat Visicon\u2019s leasehold interest as real property for consideration of the real property tax at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In <em>Franklin Cty. v. Lockbourne Manor, Inc. </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 286, 6 O.O.2d 489, 154 N.E.2d 147, the United States leased land on the Lockbourne Air Force Base to a lessee who was to build housing to be rented to military and government contractors\u2019 personnel. The contract provided that as the housing was completed it became part of the land and part of the property leased from the Air Force. The lessee\u2019s leasehold interest in <em>Lockbourne </em>included both the land and the buildings. The county sought to impose a real property tax upon both the land and buildings. The lessee filed an application for exemption. The issue that we considered in <em>Lockbourne </em>was whether the lessee\u2019s leasehold interest could be subjected to the county real property tax. We stated that \u201cin states which tax leaseholds the government has consented to such a tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 6 O.O.2d at 489, 154 N.E.2d at 148. However, we held that the lessee\u2019s interest was not subject to the Ohio real property tax because \u201c[t]he present law of Ohio does not provide for a tax on leaseholds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 6 O.O.2d at 490,154 N.E.2d at 148. With one exception, R.C. 5705.61, which is not relevant here, Ohio law still does not impose a real property tax upon leaseholds. Thus no real property tax can be assessed against Visicon\u2019s leasehold interest, whether or not it includes the Hotel as part of the leasehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We are aware that the Supreme Court has upheld the imposition of state and county personal property taxes upon a lessee in <em>Offutt Hous. Co. v. Cty. of Sarpy </em>(1956), 351 U.S. 253, 76 S.Ct. 814, 100 L.Ed. 1151. The lease in <em>Offutt </em>was between the Air Force and a lessee who was to construct housing on the land. The lease provided that as the housing was completed it became real estate and part of the leased land. The lease further provided that at the expiration or termination of the lease all improvements remained the property of the government. Therefore in <em>Offutt, </em>the leasehold included both the land and the buildings. The Nebraska tax at issue was a personal property tax imposed on the buildings, improvements, appliances, and furniture. The Supreme Court reviewed the predecessor to the current Section 2667(e), Title 10, U.S.Code, which stated, \u201cThe lessee\u2019s interest, made or created pursuant to the provisions of this Act, shall be made subject to State or local taxation.\u201d 61 Stat., Part I, 774, 775, Section 6. The Supreme Court acknowledged that the legislation did not refer specifically to property in an area of \u201cexclusive Legislation.\u201d However, the Supreme Court held that the legislation permitted the taxation of private interests in these types of housing projects. The primary differences between <em>Offutt </em>and the present case are that in <em>Offutt </em>both the land and the buildings were part of the leased property and that Nebraska imposed a tax which apparently reached the leasehold property.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>For all the foregoing reasons we find the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals to be unreasonable and unlawful, and we therefore reverse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-5\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
