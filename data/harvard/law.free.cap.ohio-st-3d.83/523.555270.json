For the reasons that follow, however, Burnes\u2019s contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">First, the court of appeals properly denied the writ. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in Civ.R. 56, the nonmoving party may not rest on the mere allegations of her pleading, but her response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Civ.R. 56, must set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine triable issue. <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197, 1199; Civ.R. 56(E). The clerk supported her summary judgment motion with an affidavit, which established that all of Burnes\u2019s documents were properly docketed and filed. Burnes rested on the mere allegations of her complaint, and she failed to file Civ.R. 56 evidence setting forth specific, material facts supporting her claimed entitlement to extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Second, Burnes\u2019s request for reconsideration was a nullity because her mandamus action was an original action filed in the court of appeals, thus rendering App.R. 26(A) inapplicable. <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Lile </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 220, 221, 685 N.E.2d 535, 536; <em>State ex rel. Pajestka v. Faulhaber </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 41, 42, 4 O.O.3d 113, 113-114, 362 N.E.2d 263, 263-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">Finally, unlike criminal litigation, there is no general right of counsel in civil litigation. See, generally, <em>State ex rel. Jenkins v. Stern </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 515 N.E.2d 928, 930-931. Burnes has also not specified any pertinent statute or rule entitling her to appointed counsel in this appeal. See <em>State ex rel. Karmasu v. Tate </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 199, 206-207, 614 N.E.2d 827, 832; cf. <em>State ex rel. Asberry v. Payne </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 44, 693 N.E.2d 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b729-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

We deny Burnes\u2019s motion for \u201crestraint and injunction\u201d to prevent the clerk from \u201cinvading [her] privacy.\u201d We lack jurisdiction to issue relief in the nature of a prohibitory injunction. <em>State ex rel.
