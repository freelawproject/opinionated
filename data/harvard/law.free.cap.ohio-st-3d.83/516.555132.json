Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 351, 662 N.E.2d at 318, determined that appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel lacked merit. In his instant appeal before this court, appellant simply argues the same errors that we rejected in his original death penalty appeal. Therefore, that decision is <em>res judicata. </em>Application of the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine in this case is not unjust. See <em>State v. Murnahan, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 66, 584 N.E.2d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that this court failed to separately consider and decide each and every instance of claimed ineffective assistance in that appeal is plainly wrong. As we noted in appellant\u2019s capital appeal, \u201cthis court is not required to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised by the parties in a death penalty appeal. See, <em>e.g., State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 267, 643 N.E.2d 524, 528.\u201d <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 351, 662 N.E.2d at 318. Moreover, we stated that \u201c[w]e have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law * * *. * * * [Ajppellant received * * * competent representation both at trial and on appeal. <em>We address, in opinion form, only those matters that merit some discussion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The judgment of the- court of appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b722-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
