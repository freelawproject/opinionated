Soukup claims that where a movant in domestic relations court seeks to modify an order that has become final without alleging a change of circumstances, <em>res judicata </em>bars the court from exercising jurisdiction. For the following reasons, Soukup\u2019s contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">First, Soukup invited any error by the court of appeals in not granting the writ based on the <em>res judicata </em>claim he raises here because he asserted in the court of appeals that <em>res judicata </em>was inapplicable, \u201c \u2018Under the invited-error doctrine, a party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which he himself invited or induced the court to make.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. O\u2019Beirne v. Geauga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 176,181, 685 N.E.2d 502, 506, quoting <em>State ex rel. Bitter v. Missig </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 249, 254, 648 N.E.2d 1355, 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Second, <em>res judicata </em>is not a basis for prohibition because it does not divest a trial court of jurisdiction to decide its applicability and it can be raised adequately by postjudgment appeal. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Smith v. Smith </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 418, 420, 662 N.E.2d 366, 369; <em>State ex rel. Lipinski v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Probate Din. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 19, 21, 655 N.E.2d 1303, 1305-1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">Finally, because Judge Celebrezze did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the postdecree motion, prohibition does not lie for Soukup\u2019s claims. \u201c \u2018Absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy at law by appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Red Head Brass, Inc. v. Holmes Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 149, 152, 684 N.E.2d 1234, 1237, quoting <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Enyart v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 655, 656, 646 N.E.2d 1110, 1112. Under Civ.R. 75(1), the continuing jurisdiction of a court that issues a domestic relations decree \u201cmay be invoked by the filing of any motion by a party.\u201d <em>Blake v. Heistan </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 84, 87, 649 N.E.2d 1304, 1305-1306. A postdecree show-cause motion filed by \u00bf party invokes both the inherent power of a domestic relations court to enforce its own orders and the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction under Civ.R. 75(1). See, generally, 2 Sowald &amp; Morganstern, Domestic Relations Law (1997) 164, Section 25.44.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In fact, every case cited by Soukup to support his claim to a writ was resolved by appeal rather than extraordinary writ. See, <em>e.g., Panzarello v. Panzarello </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 364, 572 N.E.2d 803; <em>Austin v. Payne </em>(Feb. 11, 1998), Lorain App. No. 97CA006777, unreported, 1998 WL 78694.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b755-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-15\">. We need not consider the main argument raised by Soukup below, which relied on <em>Rice </em>and <em>Easterday, </em>because Soukup does not raise this argument here, instead choosing to rely on <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
