Prac.R. IX(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">We deny Lee\u2019s request for the following reasons. First, S.CiPrac.R. IX(2) does not mandate that the court order oral argument in this case. S.Ct.Prac.R. IX(2)(A) provides that in \u201can appeal that is not scheduled for oral argument pursuant to Section 1 of this rule, the Supreme Court <em>may </em>order oral argument on the merits either sua sponte or in response to a request by any party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, Lee neither established nor asserted any of the usual factors that might warrant oral argument. See <em>State ex rel. McGinty v. Cleveland City School Disk Bd. of Edn. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 283, 287, 690 N.E.2d 1273, 1276. Third, Lee does not even specify why oral argument would be beneficial here.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Based on the foregoing, we proceed to the merits of Lee\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Prohibition</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">Lee asserts in his propositions of law that the court of appeals erred in granting the probate court\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing his prohibition action. The court of appeals converted the probate court\u2019s untimely Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted to a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings. See <em>State ex rel. Pirman v. Money </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 591, 592, 635 N.E.2d 26, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In order to be entitled to dismissal under Civ.R, 12(C), it must appear beyond doubt that Lee can prove no set of facts warranting the requested relief, after construing all material factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom in Lee\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Hancock Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 134, 136, 684 N.E.2d 1222, 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Lee requested a writ of prohibition, which'required him to establish that the probate court is about to exercise judicial power, that the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and that denial of the writ will cause injury for which no other legal remedy exists. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Garfield Hts. Mun. Court </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 447, 448, 674 N.E.2d 1381, 1382. Lee sufficiently alleged that the probate court had exercised jurisdiction by appointing Neuman administrator of Isaly\u2019s estate and that it was continuing to exercise jurisdiction over the administration of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Regarding the remaining requirements for a writ of prohibition, the general rule is that absent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal. <em>State ex rel. Kaylor v. Bruening </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 142, 144-145, 684 N.E.2d 1228, 1231. If, on the other hand, the inferior court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over the cause, prohibition will lie to prevent the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction as well as to correct the results of previous jurisdictionally unauthorized actions. <em>State ex rel. Litty v. Leskovyansky </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 97, 98, 671 N.E.2d 236, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Because the probate court is a court of limited jurisdiction, probate proceedings are restricted to those actions permitted by statute and by the Constitution. <em>State ex rel. Lipinski v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Probate Div. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 19, 22, 655 N.E.2d 1303, 1306; <em>Corron v. Corron </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 75, 531 N.E.2d 708, paragraph one of the syllabus. Under R.C. 2101.24(A)(1)(b) and (c), probate courts have general, exclusive jurisdiction \u201c[t]o grant and revoke letters testamentary and of administration\u201d and \u201c[t]o direct and control the conduct and settle the accounts of executors and administrators and order the distribution of estates.\u201d These provisions, however, do not bestow specific subject-matter jurisdiction to administer Isaly\u2019s estate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In this regard, the probate court claimed in its dismissal motion that it had properly assumed jurisdiction over Isaly\u2019s estate pursuant to R.C. 2107.11 and 2113.01. But neither of these statutes confers jurisdiction on the probate court to administer Isaly\u2019s estate. R.C. 2107.11 does not apply because it merely addresses the jurisdiction of probate courts to probate a will. The probate court specifically found that Isaly died intestate. R.C. 2113.01 does not apply because it empowers the probate court to grant letters of administration only \u201c[u]pon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>death of a <em>resident </em>of this state intestate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Despite the probate court\u2019s contention that Isaly was domiciled in Trumbull County at the time of her death, this is irrelevant for purposes of R.C. 2113.01 because \u201cdomicile\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cresidence.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Overlander v. Brewer </em>(1947), 147 Ohio St. 386, 397-398, 34 O.O. 338, 343, 72 N.E.2d 84, 90; <em>In re Guardianship of Fisher </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 212, 215, 632 N.E.2d 533, 535. It is uncontroverted here that Isaly was a resident of Hong Kong at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The court of appeals did not rely on either of the statutes cited by the probate court in its motion to dismiss. Instead, the court of appeals held that because the probate court \u201cfound that assets of the estate in question were located within Trumbull County, its exercise of jurisdiction was warranted * * The court of appeals relied on our decision in <em>Howard v. Reynolds </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 214, 59 O.O.2d 228, 283 N.E.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The court of appeals erred in holding that the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction was warranted based on <em>Howard. </em>In <em>Howard, </em>30 Ohio St.2d at 215, 59 O.O.2d at 228, 283 N.E.2d at 630, we expressly limited the scope of the Ohio probate court\u2019s jurisdiction to proceed with the administration of a nonresident, nondomiciliary\u2019s estate to property located in Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cIt is abundantly clear that <em>\u2018the power to regulate the transmission, administration, and distribution of * </em>* * <em>personal property on the death of the owner rests with the state of its situs </em>* * *.\u2019 * * * Accordingly, this state, as the situs state, may either transfer the property to the jurisdiction of the domicile state for probate or subject it to its own administration and processes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Similarly, R.C. 2129.04 provides that probate court jurisdiction in ancillary administration proceedings of nonresident decedents extends only to Ohio property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\"><em>\u201cWhen a nonresident decedent leaves property in Ohio, ancillary administration proceedings may be had upon application of any interested person in any county in Ohio in ivhich is located property of the decedent, </em>or in which a debtor of such decedent resides. Such applicant may or may not be a creditor of the estate. <em>The ancillary administration first granted shall extend to all the estate of the deceased within the state, </em>and shall exclude the jurisdiction of any other court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Therefore, neither <em>Howard </em>nor R.C. 2129.04 permits an Ohio probate court to exercise jurisdiction over an intestate decedent\u2019s non-Ohio property. The probate court here concluded that Isaly, a nonresident, had died intestate but granted full administrative powers to Neuman, permitting the court to exercise jurisdiction over Isaly\u2019s non-Ohio property, <em>e.g., </em>Isaly\u2019s Michigan, California, and Massachusetts property.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Based on the foregoing, after construing the allegations of Lee\u2019s prohibition complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom most strongly in his favor, it does not appear beyond doubt that he can prove no set of facts warranting the requested relief. \u2022 It is possible that Lee could prove a set of facts entitling him to a writ of prohibition insofar as the probate court is attempting to exercise jurisdiction over Isaly\u2019s non-Ohio property because it might patently and unambiguously lack such jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Lee also argues that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his prohibition action because the probate court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction over Isaly\u2019s estate due to the prior Hong Kong proceeding. Lee contends that comity requires that the probate court acknowledge the Hong Kong proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Lee\u2019s latter argument lacks merit. Comity, which refers to an Ohio court\u2019s recognizing a foreign decree, is a matter of courtesy rather than of right. <em>Carlin v. Mambuca </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 500, 506, 645 N.E.2d 737, 740; <em>State v. Ramos </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 88, 90, 534 N.E.2d 885, 887; <em>Yoder v. Yoder </em>(1970), 24 Ohio App.2d 71, 72, 53 O.O.2d 193,194, 263 N.E.2d 913, 914. In addition, Ohio need not give full faith and credit to wills proved and allowed in foreign countries. Cf. R.C. 2129.06 and 2129.07; see, generally, 1 Maag, Troy, &amp; Barlow, Ohio Probate Practice and Procedure 1998 (1997) 439, Section 25.01; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Smith </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 418, 420, 662 N.E.2d 366, 369, where we held that under R.C. 3107.18, a state probate court need not recognize a foreign adoption decree if the decree is repugnant to Ohio laws. Lee is also not entitled to application of the jurisdictional priority rule based on the Hong Kong proceeding because the rule applies only to <em>state </em>courts of concurrent jurisdiction. See <em>State ex rel. Red Head Brass, Inc. v. Holmes Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 149, 151, 684 N.E.2d 1234, 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Accordingly, because the court of appeals did not consider the merits of Lee\u2019s prohibition action when it erroneously dismissed it under Civ.R. 12(C), we reverse its judgment and remand the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings, including the submission of evidence and briefs. This comports with the general rule that reversal of a court of appeals\u2019 erroneous dismissal of a complaint requires a remand for further proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. McGee Brown </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 408, 410-411, 686 N.E.2d 1126, 1128, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 163, 656 N.E.2d 1288, 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b578-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
