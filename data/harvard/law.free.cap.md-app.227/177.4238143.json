BSC presents these questions for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">1. Whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment that BSC had breached the \u201cright to participate\u201d provision of the 2004 License Agreement despite genuine dispute of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">2. Whether the circuit court erred in its interpretation of the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision of the 2004 License Agreement and in arriving at such an interpretation despite determining that the provision was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">3. Whether the circuit court erred in allowing the unsubstantiated testimony of Roderick McKelvie in support of MFV\u2019s Improper Agreement claim and in denying BSC\u2019s JMOL and JNOV motions as to that claim, which were made on the ground that the claim depended on Mr. McKelvie\u2019s unsubstantiated testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">4. Whether the circuit court erred in excluding evidence of St. Jude\u2019s invalidity defenses in the St. Jude Delaware litigation and whether, as result, the jury\u2019s verdict in damages award on the Delaware component of MFV\u2019s Improper Agreement claim should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">5. Whether the circuit court erred in allowing the \u201creasonable settlement\u201d damages opinion of Dr. Mohan Rao, which failed to take into account St. Jude\u2019s settlement positions in the St. Jude Indiana and St. Jude Delaware Litigations; and whether, as a result, the jury\u2019s damages awards for the Improper Agreement claim should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>6. Whether the jury\u2019s damages award for the Improper Agreement claim should be vacated because they relied on premises that contradicted the historical record of the St. Jude Indiana and St. Jude Delaware Litigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">7. Whether judgment should be entered in BSC\u2019s favor with respect to MFV\u2019s Accrued Royalties claim because the primary theory on which MFV relied was legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">8. Whether the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to MFV\u2019s Accrued Royalties claim should be vacated because of the circuit court\u2019s erroneous rulings on the patent law issues on which MFV\u2019s alternative theories depended, including the circuit court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on issues of patent law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">9. Whether the circuit court erred in deciding as a matter of law prior to trial that MFV was entitled to \u201caccrued royalties\u201d for overseas sales of ICDs in contravention of Federal Circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">I. Patent origins and the BSC license agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Dr. Michel Mirowski developed an implantable cardiac defibrillator (\u201cICD\u201d), a device that is implanted in the body and capable of preventing sudden cardiac death. Since the first patient received the ICD in 1980, millions of others have had the device implanted. Later on, cardiac resynchronization therapy (\u201cCRT\u201d), building on the ICD technology, was invented to treat congestive heart failure. Dr. Mirowski, and through what later became MFV, owned the patents to both inventions: the ICD<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is covered by patent 4,407,288 (\u201cthe \u2018288 patent\u201d), and the CRT technology is covered by patent RE38,119 (\u201cthe \u2018119 patent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>MFV originally licensed the two patents exclusively to Guidant, a corporate entity later acquired by BSC, in 1973 (\u201c1973 License Agreement\u201d). The licenses were then restated in 2004 (\u201c2004 License Agreement\u201d). The licenses gave Guidant (and subsequently BSC) the rights to sublicense any or all of the MFV patents on its own terms, as long as MFV received a 3% royalty on the initial sale as well as the sale of covered products. Guidant also received \u201cthe right to bring and conduct suit or actions in its name against others for infringement of any [licensed] patent ..., the same as if such patent were the exclusive property of GUIDANT.\u201d Importantly, the license agreement reserved for MFV certain litigation rights:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (1) BSC must obtain MFV\u2019s \u201cmutual agreement\u201d to \u201cbring or conduct\u201d litigation;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) MFV has the \u201cright to participate\u201d in litigation; and (3) MFV and BSC must \u201cdivide [ ] equally\u201d any proceeds of infringement litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">II. Lawsuits against St. Jude</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">a. St. Jude litigation in Indiana regarding the \u2018288 patent</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In 1996, Guidant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and MFV, as joint plaintiffs, through mutual agreement, sued St. Jude in Indiana federal court for selling ICD devices without a sublicense for the patents (\u201cSt. Jude Indiana Litigation\u201d). The jury returned a verdict in favor of Guidant and MFV for the sum of $140 million, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>that St. Jude had infringed the \u2018288 patent. The trial judge reversed the jury verdict on motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), ruling that the patent was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Guidant and MFV mutually agreed to appeal the court\u2019s decision as to a key \u201cmethod claim\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the \u2018288 patent (\u201cClaim 4\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the St. Jude Indiana Litigation was on appeal, Guidant and MFV entered into an agreement (\u201cthe 2004 Royalty Agreement\u201d) in which Guidant \u201csuspended payment of royalties on products covered by the \u2018288 Patent pending the outcome of the appeal.\u201d The agreement then outlined: (1) if there is a \u201cfinal non-appealable judgment\u201d that the \u2018288 patent was valid and St. Jude did infringe upon it, Guidant would pay MFV \u201ca sum equal to all royalties that accrued pursuant to the License Agreement on products covered by any such claims\u201d from the date the royalties were suspended until they became reinstated, along with interest at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the prime rate;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) if the Federal Circuit found that St. Jude did not infringe the \u2018288 patent, Guidant would pay MFV a flat sum of $15 million. In August 2004, the appellate court remanded the St. Jude Indiana case, holding that the \u2018288 patent was not invalid. On remand, the district court found that at least some St. Jude devices were used according to the patented method, but limited damages to only those devices that were proved to have infringed on the patented method, not on every device capable of performing the patented method.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">b. St. Jude Litigation in Delaware Regarding the \u2018119 Patent</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Guidant and MFV brought a second suit against St. Jude in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for allegedly infringing the \u2018119 patent (\u201cthe St. Jude Delaware case\u201d) in 2004. After two years, the parties completed fact discovery but the issues in dispute had not been considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">III. BSC acquires Guidant and Settles with St. Jude</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In April 2006, BSC completed its purchase of Guidant and became the exclusive licensee to the MFV patents. BSC then began discussing a settlement with St. Jude (\u201cthe BSC-St. Jude Settlement\u201d) that included not only unresolved issues from the St. Jude Delaware case and the St. Jude Indiana Litigation, but also \u201ca number of other cases in which BSC was adverse to St. Jude.\u201d MFV asserts that these were cases \u201cthat presented a serious risk to BSC and had nothing to do with Mirowski.\u201d The parties disagree as to whether MFV was given sufficient notice of the BSC-St. Jude Settlement discussions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although MFV claims the BSC-St. Jude Settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ment discussions were held in secret, MFV also met with St. Jude to discuss the Indiana and Delaware cases, but a settlement was never reached between the two parties. MFV maintains that as a result of its failed negotiations with St. Jude, it \u201cbelieved settlement with St. Jude was off the table,\u201d and was thus surprised to hear of the BSC-St. Jude Settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The BSC-St. Jude Settlement dismissed four pending litigations by St. Jude against BSC in exchange for the value of the Indiana and Delaware cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> MFV claims that a BSC expert valued the damages in the St. Jude Delaware case at at least $131 million before the BSC-St. Jude Settlement, and then after the settlement at only $16.8 million. MFV asserts that the \u201c87% drop in damages [ ] was directly attributable to the BSC-STJ Settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">MFV continued with the Delaware and Indiana cases against St. Jude. In July 2007, MFV and St. Jude settled the Delaware case for $35 million dollars. The Indiana case continued until 2009, when the Federal Circuit again concluded that the \u2018288 patent was not invalid and that St. Jude had infringed it, and MFV settled the remnants for $1.9 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">IV. Litigation between BSC and MFV</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">After learning of the BSC-St. Jude Settlement, MFV informed BSC that BSC had breached the 2004 License Agreement because (1) the separate negotiations deprived MFV of the \u201cright to participate\u201d in the St. Jude litigations and caused damages, and (2) BSC failed to obtain MFV\u2019s \u201cmutual agreement\u201d before entering into the BSC-St. Jude settlement. Further, BSC did not pay MFV the amount of \u2022royalties agreed upon in the 2004 Royalty Agreement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>determined what BSC owed MFV at the end of the St. Jude Indiana Litigation. Because the \u2018288 patent was deemed valid and St. Jude found to have infringed upon it, BSC owed MFV \u201ca sum equal to all royalties that accrued\u201d between 2002-2003, plus interest. While both parties agreed that \u201cthe sum\u201d plus interest equaled over $86.5 million dollars, BSC paid MFV only $6.7 million of this amount. BSC based this amount on its interpretation that royalties were due only the percentage of St. Jude devices that allegedly infringed the \u2018288 patent in the St. Jude Indiana Litigation, excluding royalties on devices and accessories that BSC had paid in the past pursuant to the 2004 License Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">i. BSC sues MFV for declaratory judgment in Indiana Federal Court</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">On May 31, 2011, Boston Scientific filed its \u201cComplaint for Declaratory Judgment\u201d seeking declaratory judgments that, among other things, the payments it had made to MFV satisfied its royalty obligations under the 2004 License Agreement. After several pre-trial motions, BSC brought to the court\u2019s attention <em>Gunn v. Minton, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1059, 185 L.Ed.2d 72 (2013), a Supreme Court decision handed down while the parties were preparing for trial. <em>Gunn </em>limited the jurisdiction of federal courts to hear certain cases pertaining to patent law. BSC \u201csuggested that, pursuant to [the] holding [in <em>Gunn </em>], the [Indiana District] Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case.\u201d <em>Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC v. Bos. Sci. Corp., </em>958 F.Supp.2d 1009, 1010 (S.D.Ind.2013).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court agreed and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ii. MFV commences litigation in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">MFV filed the suit from which this appeal arises in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County after BSC argued that the Indiana District Court lacked jurisdiction, and the Montgomery County case proceeded after the federal case was dismissed. Prior to trial, the circuit court granted MFV\u2019s motion for summary judgment that BSC breached MFV\u2019s \u201cright to participate\u201d as outlined in the 2004 Royalty Agreement. After three weeks of trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of MFV. On the claim of royalties owed, the jury awarded MFV the full stipulated value of $86.5 million; on the claim for breach of the 2004 License Agreement related to the BSC-St. Jude Settlement, the jury returned a verdict for less than MFV requested, but still amotmting to $222 million for both the Delaware and Indiana cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Additional facts will be included in the discussion as they become relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">I. The circuit court committed no errors with respect to the \u201cImproper Agreement\u201d claim,</p>\n<p id=\"AJi\">a. The circuit court appropriately granted partial summary judgment in favor of MFV that BSC breached the \u201cright to participate\u201d provision of the 2004 License Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">BSC avers that the circuit court wrongly granted partial summary judgment in MFV\u2019s favor when it ruled that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the July 2006 Agreement between BSC and St. Jude violated MFV\u2019s contractual \u201cright to participate.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The reviewing court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>conducting \u201can independent review of the record to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>if there is a dispute of material fact.\u201d <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund v. Orient Exp. Delivery Serv., Inc., </em>190 Md.App. 438, 450-51, 988 A.2d 1120 (2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In our review of the granted summary judgment, we must \u201cexamine the same information from the record and determine the same issues of law as the trial court.\u201d <em>La Belle Epoque, LLC v. Old Europe Antidue Manor, LLC, </em>406 Md. 194, 209, 958 A.2d 269 (2008) (citation omitted). We therefore \u201conly look to the evidence submitted in opposition and support of the motion for summary judgment in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In its brief, however, BSC relies entirely on the evidence presented during the trial. Because we must examine the information the circuit court relied on to make its decision, evidence from the trial is not relevant to our review. While the volumes of record extract contain the transcript of the hearing before the circuit court regarding summary judgment as well as BSC\u2019s opposition brief to MFV\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, those extracts alone do not place us in an adequate position to review the record <em>de novo. See Boland v. Boland, </em>423 Md. 296, 366, 31 A.3d 529 (2011) (explaining that an appellate court must \u201cindependently review the record to determine whether\u201d a dispute of material fact exists). BSC, as the appellant, is tasked with the responsibility of directing this Court to the portions of the record relevant to its challenge. As we have previously stated, the reviewing court \u201ccannot be expected to delve through the record to unearth factual support favorable to [the] appellant.\u201d <em>Rollins v. Capital Plaza Assocs., L.P., </em>181 Md.App. 188, 201, 955 A.2d 869 (2008) (citing <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 271, 282, 356 A.2d 277 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Even if we could consider BSC\u2019s argument on the merits based on the evidence on which it relies, we would nevertheless affirm the circuit court\u2019s granting of partial summary judgment. BSC claims that a dispute of material facts exists regarding the \u201cright to participate\u201d provision because BSC and MFV disagree on whether MFV did, in fact, participate. BSC maintains that MFV had an equal chance to participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>in its dealings with St. Jude because 1) MFV had its own settlement negotiations with St. Jude, and 2) MFV knew that BSC was having discussions with St. Jude but never asked to join in those discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">While MFV does not dispute that those two things are true, BSC neglects to note the <em>timing </em>of the two 2006 settlement discussions: MFV\u2019s discussions with St. Jude occurred in June of 2006 and concluded without reaching an agreement, whereas the BSC-St. Jude discussions took place through June and July of 2006, leading to the BSC-St. Jude Settlement on July 29, 2006. While MFV knew that BSC was negotiating with St. Jude in June, it was unaware that negotiations between the two carried into July.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> BSC offers no evidence to show that MFV knew of the July discussions. Thus, the <em>material </em>facts \u2014 MFV\u2019s lack of knowledge about the BSC-St. Jude Settlement \u2014 are undisputed. No evidence at trial showed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">b. The circuit court did not err in allowing the jury to decide whether BSC violated the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision of the 2004 License Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Next, BSC argues that \u201cthe circuit court erred by allowing the jury to find that BSC breached the \u2018mutual agreement\u2019 provision.\u201d The provision reads: \u201c[BSC] shall, subject to mutual agreement between [BSC] and MIROWSKI, bring and conduct suit or actions against any infringer____\u201d BSC moved for summary judgment on the issue, which the circuit court denied, finding the term unambiguous. At trial, the circuit court instructed the jury on its interpretation of the term.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> BSC challenges this interpretation as well as the jury\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sion on the issue. On review, we find that the circuit court did not err in interpreting the provision and in allowing the jury to determine whether BSC breached it, and we will not overturn the findings of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">i. The circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Again, we review the circuit court\u2019s decision of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>190 Md.App. at 450-51, 988 A.2d 1120. When reviewing the denial of summary judgment, we look to see if there existed a genuine dispute of material facts. <em>Id. </em>When reviewing contract construction, the circuit court may grant summary judgment if a contract is unambiguous. <em>GMG Capital Invs., LLC v. Athenian Venture Partners I, L.P., </em>36 A.3d 776, 778 (Del.2012). Our review of the court\u2019s determination of whether the contractual language is ambiguous is also <em>de novo. Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 435, 727 A.2d 358 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">BSC relies heavily on the Indiana contract proceedings, in which the federal district judge found the \u201conly reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u2018subject to mutual agreement\u2019 in the contract is that [BSC] <em>must </em>bring and conduct suit against infringers with sales exceeding $75,000, <em>unless </em>Mirowski and [BSC] agree that suit should not be brought.\u201d <em>Boston Scientific Corp. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC (\u201cBSC 2012\u201d), </em>No. 1:11-CV-736-WTL-DKL, 2012 WL 5996482 (S.D.Ind., Nov. 30, 2012) (emphasis in original). What this means, the district judge explained, is that \u201c \u2018mutual agreement\u2019 applies not to [BSC\u2019s] subsequent decisions in the course of litigation, but rather explains the circumstances under which [BSC] is relieved of its obligation to bring suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge, therefore, found the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision inapplicable to the BSC-St. Jude Settlement. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, as the circuit court observed, the Indiana district court\u2019s construction leaves the \u201cright to participate\u201d provision as \u201cthe only ground for potential contractual liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We are not bound to afford any weight to the decisions and findings of the Indiana district court deciding the contractual dispute between MFV and BSC. <em>See Cates v. State, 21 </em>Md.App. 363, 372, 320 A.2d 75 (1974) (explaining that rulings from other jurisdictions are persuasive authority, and \u201c[i]f the reasoning which supports them fails to persuade, they are no authority at all\u201d). Unlike the Indiana district court, the circuit court found \u201cmutual agreement\u201d to be an unambiguous term meaning:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">BSC must consult with and advise Mirowski of its intentions at such a time and under such circumstances that would enable Mirowski to take action to protect itself, if it chooses to do so. Whether that occurred in this case, is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The circuit court stated that the contract term is an \u201cexpress promise\u201d made by BSC to MFV that is not irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A contract is not ambiguous merely \u201cbecause the parties disagree as to its proper construction,\u201d <em>Trustees of Indiana Univ. v. Cohen, </em>910 N.E.2d 251, 257 (Ind.Ct.App.2009), but rather is ambiguous \u201conly if reasonable persons would differ as to the meaning of its terms.\u201d <em>Oxford Fin. Grp., Ltd. v. Evans, </em>795 N.E.2d 1135, 1142 (Ind.Ct.App.2003) (citations omitted). When interpreting an unambiguous contract, \u201ca court gives effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in the four corners of the instrument and clear, plain, and unambiguous terms are conclusive of that intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). However, \u201cthe court is under an obligation to read the agreement in a manner which harmonizes its provisions as a whole and to give effect to the parties\u2019 expressed intent.\u201d <em>Trustees of Indiana Univ., </em>910 N.E.2d at 257 (citations omitted); <em>see also Oxford Fin. Grp., Ltd., </em>795 N.E.2d at 1142 (\u201cParticular words and phrases cannot be read alone and the parties\u2019 intentions must be determined by reading the contract as a whole.\u201d) (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Looking at the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision in the context of the 2004 License Agreement \u201cas a whole,\u201d <em>id., </em>we agree that the term is unambiguous because reasonable persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>would not differ as to its meaning when the provision is read as a whole rather than examining each phrase therein in isolation. <em>Oxford Fin. Grp., Ltd., </em>795 N.E.2d at 1142. The 2004 License Agreement overall outlines the rights and responsibilities of BSC and MFV individually and to each other with regard to the \u2018299 patent. It affords BSC the exclusive license to MFV\u2019s patents and the right to bring suit to protect them. MFV, as the patent holder, therefore, has a serious stake in the outcome of any potential dispute or litigation between BSC and infringers. Thus, construing the portion of the contract that calls for \u201cmutual agreement\u201d to \u201cbring and conduct suit or action against infringers\u201d to mean anything short of the obligation BSC has to inform and seek MFV\u2019s advice on its actions in a suit would require reading the contract to mean that MFV reserved no authority for itself to have a say or impact the status of its patents once litigation commenced. Such a reading of the contract, as the circuit court and MFV point out, would permit BSC to act in bad faith by settling without MFV\u2019s permission. No reasonable person could read the agreement that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Furthermore, the interpretation of the Indiana district court, which BSC urges us to adopt, is that the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision merely \u201cexplains the circumstances under which Boston Scientific is relieved of its obligation to bring suit,\u201d but does not apply to BSC\u2019s \u201csubsequent decisions in the course of litigation.\u201d However, the language of the agreement reads that \u201c[BSC] shall, subject to mutual agreement between [BSC] and MIROWSKI, bring and <em>conduct </em>suit or actions____\u201d (Emphasis added). The Indiana district court\u2019s construction completely disregards the term \u201cconduct,\u201d which immediately follows the provision \u201csubject to mutual agreement.\u201d A reading of the plain language of the agreement urges the circuit court\u2019s interpretation. Accepting the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the provision, we also conclude that it appropriately instructed the jury as to what \u201cmutual agreement\u201d means.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ii. The matter was appropriately considered by the jury, whose factual finding was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">BSC next argues that the jury did not have sufficient evidence to find that BSC violated the \u201cmutual agreement\u201d provision, even as interpreted by the circuit court, and asks us to overturn the jury\u2019s factual finding. We disagree with BSC and see no reason to overturn the jury\u2019s finding. A case must be submitted to the jury for consideration if there exists \u201cany evidence, no matter how slight, that is legally sufficient to generate a jury question.\u201d <em>Publish Am., LLP v. Stem, </em>216 Md.App. 82, 97, 84 A.3d 237 (2014) (citation omitted). There was ample evidence presented at trial to present the question to the jury. The jury heard testimony on the issue from: Sidney Silver, MFV\u2019s counsel; Ginat Mirowski; and four of BSC\u2019s in-house counsel. BSC also presented its own fact witnesses. There being \u201csufficient\u201d evidence to send the question to the jury, \u201cthe jury and the jury only has the power to assess the weight of the evidence, a power which passes to the trial judge\u2019s discretion upon motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 521, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996) (citation omitted). The reviewing court \u201cdo[es] not review the weight of the evidence after it has been passed upon by the jury.\u201d <em>Benkoe v. Plastic Assembled Prods., Inc., </em>231 Md. 419, 420, 190 A.2d 638 (1963) <em>{per curiam). </em>Because the question was appropriately presented to the jury, and the jury properly made its determination, we will not disturb its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II. The jury appropriately found \u201ccausation\u201d in the breach of contract claim between BSC and MFV.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cUnder Indiana law ..., causation is an essential element of liability in a breach of contract claim.\u201d <em>Shepard v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>463 F.3d 742, 744 (7th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). The aggrieved party in a contract claim \u201cmust prove that the alleged breach of contract was a cause in. fact of his loss, which requires a showing that the breach was a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 in bringing about the plaintiffs damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). BSC argues that MFV failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>such \u201ccausation\u201d for its damages in this case because MFV had a \u201cchoice\u201d regarding whether to accept the terms of the BSC-St. Jude Settlement. Because of this choice, BSC suggests that its actions were not a \u201ccause in fact\u201d in MFV\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">BSC asks for a remand and new trial on the basis of \u201ccausation\u201d because the circuit court should not have admitted the MFV-St. Jude Stipulation Agreement (\u201cthe stipulation\u201d),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> also signed by BSC, that the \u2018119 patent was not invalid.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> BSC contends first that the admission of the stipulation is in violation of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and thereby Md. Rule 5^08,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, therefore, constitutes reversible error. Second, it argues that the stipulation in not binding on BSC. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 408 states: \u201c(a) The following evidence is not admissible to prove the validity, invalidity, or amount of a civil claim in dispute: ... (3) Conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations or mediation.\u201d BSC, invoking Md. Rule 5-408 in this context, requires that the stipulation of validity be a statement \u201cmade in compromise negotiations or mediation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>BSC notes, however, that the stipulation was entered into <em>\u201cfollowing </em>a good-faith mediation.\u201d (Emphasis added). As we have previously noted about the admission of settlements as subsequent evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The purpose of Rule 5-408 is to encourage the settlement of lawsuits by ensuring that parties need not fear that their desire to settle pending litigation and their offers to do so will be construed as admissions. But that rule is plainly not applicable to the instant case because the evidence at issue concerned previously settled claims and not promises to settle an existing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><em>Bittinger v. CSX Transp. Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 262, 276-77, 932 A.2d 1243 (2007) (internal citation omitted). As in <em>Bittinger, </em>Md. Rule 5-408 is equally inapplicable here because the \u2018119 patent validity stipulation was part of a \u201cpreviously settled claim[ ],\u201d not a \u201cpromise[ ] to settle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Talks and discussions taking place during mediation and negotiation meetings are part of the \u201cpromises to settle,\u201d and it is the statements made during these discussions that are barred by Md. Rule 5-408, not the finished product coming out of them. \u201c[T]he admission of evidence is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court\u201d and will not be disturbed in the absence of abuse of that discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 273, 932 A.2d 1243. We see no such abuse here, and therefore will not remand on this basis. The properly admissible stipulation operated like a \u201cconsent judgment and adjudication on the merits.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In the alternative, accepting that the stipulation has <em>res judicata </em>effect, BSC argues that the stipulation nevertheless is not binding in the contract dispute between BSC and MFV because it was part of a settlement agreement between only MFV and St. Jude. BSC asserts that \u201cwhile BSC (as a party to the litigation) signed the St. Jude stipulation ... BSC agreed only to the fact that St. Jude entered into a stipulation.\u201d Having \u201cnot itself enter[ed] into or approve[d] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>stipulation,\u201d BSC should have been allowed to raise St. Jude\u2019s invalidity defenses in its defense against MFV.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">BSC\u2019s argument fails because BSC was, in fact, a party to the stipulation of the validity stipulation for the T19 patent for the purposes of preclusive effect. The language of the stipulation points us to that understanding. The stipulation states:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Mirowski plaintiff and the defendants [St. Jude], having entered into a confidential settlement of their dispute following a good-faith mediation, it is now stipulated and agreed by and among <em>the parties to this action, </em>represented by their attorneys ...</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(Emphasis added). At the time, BSC and MFV were still co-plaintiffs in the Delaware case. Thus, even though the settlement negotiations may have involved only MFV and St. Jude, the \u201cparties to this action\u201d are MFV, BSC, and St. Jude, with the \u201caction\u201d being the Delaware litigation. BSC, represented by attorneys, appropriately signed the stipulation as a party to the action, doing more than merely acknowledging that MFV and St. Jude entered into the stipulation, as it contends. By signing the agreement, BSC also approved the stipulation. Therefore, the language of the stipulation does not constrict it as applying only between MFV and St. Jude, but as to <em>all </em>three parties and their relationship with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Importantly, we must note that BSC\u2019s argument that the admission of the stipulation was wrong because it prevented BSC from presenting evidence of the patent\u2019s invalidity throughout the trial is without merit. BSC had the opportunity to present such evidence throughout the trial. The jury heard and considered testimonial evidence put on by BSC about St. Jude\u2019s defenses in the Delaware litigation from a number of witnesses: Peter Gafner, a BSC attorney who spoke to St. Jude\u2019s \u201cthree defenses\u201d in Delaware; Tom Filarski, a patent attorney who spoke to the \u201cno error defense St. Jude asserted in the Delaware case;\u201d and David Benditt, a medical doctor and professor who testified as to his opinion testimony in support of St. Jude\u2019s defenses in the Delaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>case. The evidence is clear that the jury heard ample evidence about the St. Jude Delaware defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">III. The jury appropriately decided the 2004 Royalties Agreement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">At trial, MFV presented \u201cthree independent reasons\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to support the 2004 Royalty Agreement claim (or \u201cCount One\u201d). In Count One, MFV asserted that BSC owed the full amount of the royalties on ICDs sold in 2002-2003 pursuant the 2004 Royalties Agreement. First, MFV posited that the royalties had already accrued in the normal course of business under the 1973 license in the amount of $55.6 million, and that MFV relied on this amount when it signed the 2004 Royalties Agreement (or \u201caccrual argument\u201d). Second, MFV argued that it is owed the full amount because all ICD sales, not just ICDs known to have performed the patented method, are royalty bearing because MFV, as the owner of the patented method, has the power to legally enjoin all ICD sales <em>capable </em>of performing the infringed method. Third, MFV argued before the jury that it was owed the full amount of the royalties under the 2004 Royalty Agreement because, even under BSC\u2019s interpretation, there is evidence that 98% of the ICDs during the 2002-2003 time frame performed, and thus infringed, the patented method. The jury assessed the evidence presented and awarded MFV $86.5 million for the royalties on all devices as a result of BSC\u2019s breach of the 2004 Royalty Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">BSC argues that the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of MFV on the 2004 Royalties claim must be vacated because it may have rested on MFV\u2019s first reasoning, which BSC deems to be a \u201clegally erroneous\u201d theory of liability based \u201con evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>never should have been admitted.\u201d The other two reasons MFV presented are cause for remand as well, BSC claims, because they \u201cimplicated patent law issues\u201d on which the jury was not instructed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">a. MFV\u2019s accrual argument is not legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">BSC alleges that the accrual argument is \u201clegally erroneous\u201d because it \u201cturned on\u201d evidence that should have never been admitted. At trial, the circuit court admitted as evidence BSC memoranda that discussed its obligations under the 2004 Royalty Agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The memoranda were admitted along with other forms of parol evidence on both sides to shed light on the interpretation of the 2004 Royalty Agreement, including the ambiguous phrase \u201call royalties that accrued pursuant to the License Agreement on products covered by any such claim of the \u2018288 patent.\u201d BSC supports its argument that the memoranda should have been excluded by referencing only the decision made by the Indiana district court during the Indiana proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Rulings made by the Indiana court, as mentioned earlier, carry no weight in our review. It further has no bearing in the instant case because the Indiana court, unlike the circuit court, found that the operative phrase was <em>not </em>ambiguous, making any parol evidence irrelevant in the case before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Although the memoranda was properly admitted, the court curbed any prejudice the evidence may have had on BSC issuing a limiting instruction on the evidence, at BSC\u2019s request and which BSC drafted. Where admitted evidence \u201cis admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>instruct the jury accordingly.\u201d Md. Rule 5-105. The instructions to the jury provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">[Y]ou may hear during the trial, either testimony or see documents relating to Boston Scientific\u2019s accrual of royalties potentially payable to the Mirowksi family pending the outcome of the St. Jude Indiana litigation. I instruct you that evidence of Boston Scientific\u2019s accrual of potential royalties payable to the Mirowski family pending the St. Jude Indiana litigation is not to be considered by you an admission of liability by Boston Scientific. You must determine, based on all of the evidence whether Boston Scientific did or didn\u2019t fail to pay all of the royalties due covered by claim four of the 288 patent. In other words, whether or not they did or didn\u2019t [bjreach the January 2004 agreement [Royalty Agreement] to pay the royalties for 2002 and 2003 based on all the evidence you hear at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">BSC contends that this limiting instruction was insufficient because it \u201ccannot cure an erroneous decision to admit evidence that has no legitimate purpose.\u201d However, the memorandum had a \u201clegitimate purpose:\u201d the circuit court admitted the memoranda as parol evidence to clarify what it found to be an ambiguous phrase in the 2004 Royalty Agreement. <em>See, e.g., Tricot Indus., Inc. v. Harper, </em>131 Md.App. 89, 107, 748 A.2d 48 (2000) (explaining that \u201cparol evidence is admissible when the written words are sufficiently ambiguous\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We, therefore, will not disturb the jury\u2019s verdict with regard to Count One on the basis of a \u201clegally erroneous\u201d theory because the evidence was appropriately admitted and the jury properly considered it to make its determination.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>b. The circuit court did not commit error by not instructing the jury on patent law issues regarding MFV\u2019s second and third arguments for Claim One.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">MFV presented two other alternative evidentiary bases for recovering under the 2004 Royalty Agreement. The jury did not need to be instructed on issues of patent law because the relevant information it needed to make a decision as to the breach of contract were presented before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">i. Circuit court did not err in refusing to construe the term \u201ccardioversion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">BSC claims that the circuit court erred in refusing to construe the term \u201ccardioversion\u201d and instead left it to the jury to determine the meaning. Claim 4 involved the patented methodology of treating an abnormal heartbeat using \u201cmultimode therapy,\u201d with one mode being \u201ccardioversion.\u201d Thus, whether the ICDs performed \u201ccardioversion\u201d was significant in whether they were covered by the patented method and, therefore, whether MFV could collect royalties on their sales. BSC argues that the circuit court erred in refusing to re-construe the term and leaving \u201cit to the jury to resolve any disputes about the meaning of the [ ] claim\u2019s construction\u201d by the Indiana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In the St. Jude Indiana Litigation, the Indiana district court interpreted \u201ccardioversion\u201d to mean \u201cthe application of non-pacing electrical pulses designed to stimulate sufficient heart tissue to correct an arrhythmia, with energy levels generally below those used for defibrillation.\u201d <em>Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude Med., Inc., </em>381 F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2004). During this litigation, MFV and BSC were not adverse to each other and together supported this definition.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>is what MFV presented to the jury in circuit court. Now, BSC claims that the term \u201ccardioversion\u201d required clarification by the circuit court because each side accused the other of applying the incorrect definition of the term at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The circuit court appropriately denied BSC\u2019s request for further claim construction and accepted the Indiana district court\u2019s definition of the term, finding the construction of the term to be \u201cjudicial admissions [by BSC and MFV], binding both clients not only for [the St. Jude Indiana Litigation] but in other litigation as well.\u201d <em>Campfield v. Crowther, </em>252 Md. 88, 100, 249 A.2d 168 (1969) (\u201cA judicial admission by an attorney in the presence of his client is admissible in subsequent litigation.\u201d). BSC mistakenly asserts that the circuit court left the construction of the term to the jury. In its order, the circuit court adopted the undisputed construction of the Indiana district court, leaving to the jury only the <em>application </em>of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">ii. MFV\u2019s argument for recovery based on obtaining potential injunctions on sales of ICDs is not legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Next, BSC contends that MFV\u2019s argument that it was entitled to royalties on ICD sales during 2002-2003 because it could have obtained an injunction on the sales of all those ICDs is \u201clegally erroneous under applicable patent law.\u201d When used in patent licenses, the term \u201ccovered,\u201d BSC argues, applies only to the product or technology that actually infringes the claim; the terms \u201ccovers\u201d and \u201cinfringes\u201d are \u201csynonymous\u201d according to BSC. In support, BSC provides a list of cases where products were both covered by and infringed the claims in question. <em>See Hoechst-Roussel Pharm., Inc. v. Lehman, </em>109 F.3d 756, 764 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201cSince the registered product would directly infringe the claims during use, the product is covered by the claims[.]\u201d); <em>Mitsubishi Chem. Corp. v. Barr Labs., Inc., </em>718 F.Supp.2d 382, 390 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (\u201cThe defendants concede that their proposed generic product is covered by and would infringe all four claims of the \u2018052 patent.\u201d); <em>Rambus Inc. v. Hynix Semicon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>ductor Inc., </em>254 F.R.D. 597, 602 (N.D.Cal.2008) (\u201c[T]he patentee must show that the marketed product embodies (that is infringes or is covered by) the patent claim.\u201d). However, BSC misreads these cases. None stand for the proposition that a product or technology is <em>only </em>covered by a patent <em>if </em>it infringes the patented method or technology, as BSC suggests. Rather, these opinions merely include language where a claim was both covered by a patent <em>and </em>infringed the patent. Notably, the citation to <em>Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation v. Barr Labs, Inc. </em>references the facts section of the opinion, which states merely the independent agreement of the parties in the case, not a discussion of pertinent law governing patents, providing no persuasive authority for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Furthermore, looking at the merits of MFV\u2019s argument, we conclude that MFV did not err in its reasoning that because it legally could have stopped the sale of all ICDs, it was entitled to royalties on those ICDs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is the only appellate-level court with the jurisdiction to hear patent case appeals, has affirmed injunctions against sales of all products where the product\u2019s label \u201cwould inevitably lead consumers to practice the claimed method.\u201d <em>AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex, Inc., </em>633 F.3d 1042, 1060 (Fed.Cir.2010). It has also found liability for induced infringement when an entity \u201coffers a product with the object of promoting its use to infringe, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement.\u201d <em>DSU Med. Corp. v. JMS Co. Ltd., </em>471 F.3d 1293, 1305-06 (Fed.Cir.2006). The sale of a product specifically labeled for use in a patented method constitutes inducement to infringe that patent, and usually is also contributory infringement. <em>See AstraZeneca, </em>633 F.3d at 1060. Under this applicable patent law, because BSC (1) was designing and manufacturing ICDs to perform cardioversions, (2) instructed its sales representatives to program ICDs to perform cardioversions, (3) included directions with each ICD with instructions on how to program the ICD to perform cardioversions, and (4) admitted that if cardioversions were performed according to the products\u2019 label, the \u2018288 patent covered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ICD, the ICDs were covered by the patent and thus the jury\u2019s award for royalties was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">iii. The circuit court did not err by not providing patent law instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">BSC contends that because \u201cMFV\u2019s second and third theories of liability under Count One raised a number of complex issues particular to patent law,\u201d the circuit court should have instructed the jury on the patent law governing these issues. BSC reminds us in their argument that \u201c[t]he party arguing that an instruction should have been given bears the burden of proving prejudice and error.\u201d <em>See Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 47, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">However, as the party bearing the burden of proof, BSC merely provides that the prejudice and error are \u201cself-evident,\u201d with no other explanation or support. We will not make the argument for BSC. An appellate court is not required to address an argument on appeal when the appellant has failed to adequately brief his argument. <em>Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, </em>150 Md.App. 604, 618, 822 A.2d 551 (2003) (citing Md. Rule 8-504(a), requiring that a brief contain an \u201c[argument in support of the party\u2019s position\u201d); <em>see also Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 552, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (stating that an appellate court need not consider \u201carguments not presented in a brief or not presented with particularity\u201d). We fail to see how the prejudice to BSC is \u201cself-evident,\u201d and because BSC fails to provide any support to that claim, this Court need not address this issue. <em>See Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994) (refusing to address appellants\u2019 questions where appellants failed to offer substantial argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">c. The circuit court did not err in finding that the overseas sales of the ICDs were royalty bearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In its final argument, BSC claims that the circuit court erred in deciding that MFV was entitled to royalties on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ICDs sales made abroad during 2002-2003 on top of its sales within the United States. Pre-trial, MFV argued that sales made abroad were covered by Claim 4 under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(f), at least in the time they were made. Section 271(f)(1) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The parties made the same argument during the St. Jude Indiana Litigation. During that time period, MFV and BSC were both plaintiffs on the same side, arguing the position that MFV asserts here. In 2009, however, the Federal Circuit reviewing the St. Jude Indiana Litigation decided that Section 271(f) does not apply to method or process patents (specifically Claim 4 of the \u2018288 patent). <em>Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude Med., Inc., </em>576 F.3d 1348, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2009). In other words, the 2009 Federal Circuit changed the law so that method patents cannot be enforced on overseas sales, which would have allegedly resulted in lower damages on Count One for MFV.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The circuit court, however, relied on state contract law and judicial estoppel to rule on the issue, instead of patent law. It did not err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">First, the circuit court determined that the law in place at the time the parties entered the 2004 Royalty Agreement governed royalties of overseas sales for the pertinent period, 2003-2004. In looking at what law governs in contracts between parties, we note:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">It is well settled in Indiana that generally, unless the contract provides otherwise, all applicable law in force at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>time the agreement is made impliedly forms a part of the agreement without any statement to that effect, but laws enacted subsequent to the execution of the agreement are not deemed part of the agreement unless the contractual language clearly indicates such to have been the intention of the parties; the parties are presumed to have had the law in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Ethyl Corp. v. Forcum-Lannom Associates, Inc., </em>483 N.E.2d 1214, 1220 (Ind.Ct.App.1982) (citations omitted); <em>see also Julian v. Christopher, </em>320 Md. 1, 10, 575 A.2d 735 (1990) (refusing to \u201crewrite\u201d the contract between the parties because \u201cwe should assume\u201d that parties executing contracts when certain laws govern the subject of their contract \u201cwere aware of [the law at the time] and the implications drawn from the words they used\u201d). Thus, the 2009 holding of the Federal Circuit has no bearing on BSC\u2019s responsibility to pay royalties for 2002-2003 sales pursuant the 2004 Royalties Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Second, the circuit court determined that the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevented BSC from arguing to the jury that overseas sales were not covered. During the St. Jude Indiana Litigation, BSC argued that overseas sales <em>were </em>covered. We have previously identified three factors that inform whether there is judicial estoppel in a particular case: first, \u201cwhether the party\u2019s later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position;\u201d second, \u201cwhether the party succeeded in persuading the court in the earlier matter to accept its position, so that judicial acceptance of the contrary position in the later matter would create the perception that one of the courts had been misled;\u201d and third, \u201cwhether the party seeking to assert the inconsistent position in the later matter would derive an unfair advantage, or would impose an unfair detriment on the other party, from being permitted to do so.\u201d <em>Abrams v. Am. Tennis Courts, Inc., </em>160 Md.App. 213, 225-26, 862 A.2d 1094 (2004) (citation omitted). While these factors are not \u201cinflexible prerequisites,\u201d they do provide guidance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Applying the <em>Abrams </em>factors to the instant case, we agree with the circuit court that BSC is barred by judicial estoppel from raising the overseas sales claim. First, BSC\u2019s current position is \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with its position during the St. Jude Indiana Litigation; BSC has switched sides from arguing that overseas sales were covered to overseas sales are not covered. Second, BSC did succeed in the St. Jude Indiana Litigation, at least on the trial level, in persuading the court of its position. <em>Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude Med., Inc., </em>418 F.Supp.2d 1021, 1044 (S.D.Ind.2006) (\u201c[Tjhis court cannot conclude as a matter of law that [35 U.S.C.] section 271(f) does not apply to the method claim at issue here.\u201d). Third, BSC \u201cwould derive an unfair advantage\u201d in switching its position. BSC used the winning argument in the St. Jude Indiana Litigation, that overseas sales were covered, in its subsequent negotiations with St. Jude that led to the BSC-St. Jude Settlement later on, which resulted in St. Jude dropping several pending litigations against BSC. After obtaining that benefit, BSC now wants to avoid the approximately $17 million in royalties from overseas sales that it contractually owed to MFV. With all three factors weighing heavily against BSC, we are persuaded that BSC is judicially estopped from bringing this claim. If not, \u201cBSC would reap the benefit of \u2018blowing hot and cold.\u2019 The law does not countenance that result.\u201d <em>Vogel v. Touhey, </em>151 Md.App. 682, 722, 828 A.2d 268 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">IV.

Both BSC and MFV invoked the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338, which gave the federal courts <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over claims whose resolutions turned on patent law issues, even where the underlying claims were based in contract or tort law. <em>Gunn, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1068, held that \u00a7 1338 does not deprive state courts of subject matter jurisdiction, thereby eliminating the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts over cases involving patent claims. Without \u00a7 1338, a federal court could not hear the case between MFV and BSC because there was no federal question nor diversity of citizenship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\">.

MFV alleged that BSC represented that settlement talks would continue up until June 30, 2006. It claims that it relied on this as a deadline for the discussions with St. Jude, and therefore was surprised to hear of discussions continuing into July 2006. MFV was left with the impression that negotiations with St. Jude would not progress further between it or BSC, and they were going to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\">.

BSC mischaracterizes MFV\u2019s three evidentiary arguments as \"legal theories.\u201d We disagree with this characterization. MFV merely presented three types of evidentiary support for one single legal theory: the breach of the 2004 Royalty Agreement.

BSC argues that because one of MFV\u2019s arguments in Count One is \"legally erroneous,\u201d the whole verdict must be vacated. BSC supports its assertion by citing several cases standing for the proposition that if there are multiple potential grounds for a jury\u2019s verdict and one is legally erroneous, the verdict must be vacated. <em>See Flowers v.
