Our attachment law has a number of exemptions. In this case, we must decide whether one such exemption is available in child support enforcement actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">The chain of events giving rise to this appeal began in 2014 when the Montgomery County Office of Child Support Enforcement (the \u201cOffice\u201d) sought to collect a judgment of $9,866.80 against Byron Alexander Kelly for unpaid child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>support. At the request of the Office, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County issued a writ of garnishment against Capital One Bank, N.A. There were two accounts in Kelly\u2019s name at the bank with a combined balance of $2,705.05. The bank reported this information to the court and suspended activity in the accounts pending a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Kelly then filed a motion to release the two accounts from the levy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He based his motion on Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 11 \u2014 504(b)(5), which permits a judgment debtor under certain circumstances to elect to exempt up to $6,000 in cash or other property from a levy to satisfy a money judgment. After an evidentiary hearing, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied Kelly\u2019s motion and separately ordered Capital One to pay the account proceeds to the Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Kelly has appealed both orders and presents four questions to us. We have consolidated and reworded them as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">(1) Did the trial court correctly interpret the exemption contained in CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b)(5) to be inapplicable in actions to collect child support arrears?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">(2) Were the trial court\u2019s findings as to the source of the funds in the accounts clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">1. Were the account proceeds exempt from garnishment?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">1.1. The Applicable Rules of Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">In resolving the issues in this appeal, we will pay heed to the following guidelines of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>(1) Our purpose is to \u201cascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys. of City of Baltimore v. Dorsey, </em>430 Md. 100, 112 [59 A.3d 990] (2013);</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">(2) In this context, \u201cintent\u201d means \u201cthe legislative purpose, [that is] the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied\u201d by the statute in question, <em>id.;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">(3) We usually identify the legislative purpose by considering the plain language of the statute \u201cwithin the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 421-22 [2 A.3d 368] (2010); and</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">(4) In the process of discerning the \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d to which a particular statute belongs, we bear in mind that, laws passed by the General Assembly are usually written so that no provision of any statute is superfluous or meaningless. <em>Moore v. State, </em>424 Md. 118, 127 [34 A.3d 513] (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Finally, \u201c[an] examination of interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction, or as a principle of avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading, grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.\u201d <em>Town of Oxford v. Koste, </em>204 Md.App. 578, 586, 42 A.3d 637 (2012), <em>aff'd, </em>431 Md. 14, 63 A.3d 582 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">1.2. Two Statutes and Two Statutory Schemes</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The question before us is how to reconcile two apparently conflicting statutes. The first is CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201cstatutory scheme\u201d which contains \u00a7 11-504 sets out means by which judgments can be enforced by judgment creditors. Section 11 \u2014 504(b) lists various exemptions that judgment debtors may exercise to shelter assets from being seized to pay the judgment. Section 11 \u2014 504(b)(5) states (emphasis added):</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The following items are exempt from execution on a judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">(5) Cash or property of any kind equivalent in value to $6,000 is exempt, if within 30 days from the date of the attachment or the levy by the sheriff, <em>the debtor </em>elects to exempt cash or selected items of property in an amount not to exceed a cumulative value of $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The second statute is Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) \u00a7 10-108.3(b)(1). It provides in pertinent part (emphasis added):</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>If <em>an obligor </em>[who is more than $500 in arrears in child support payments] has not paid child support for more than 60 days, the Administration may institute an action to attach and seize the amount of the arrearage in one or more of the accounts of <em>the obligor </em>with a financial institution to satisfy the amount of arrearage <em>owed by the obligor.[</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Additionally, and of significance to this appeal, FL \u00a7 10-108.3(h)(4) permits an obligor to \u201cchallenge the [collection] actions of the [Office] based on an exemption in [CJP] \u00a7 11\u2014 504 ... or for any other good cause[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Section 10-108.3 inhabits a \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d which establishes the Child Support Enforcement Administration and grants to that agency broad powers to collect overdue child support payments. Among other things, Subtitle 10 of the Family Law Article authorizes the Motor Vehicle Administration to suspend the driver\u2019s license of persons who are 60 days or more behind in their support obligation (FL \u00a7 10-119); authorizes other licensing agencies to suspend licenses for professional occupations for individuals who are 120 days behind in child support payments (FL \u00a7 10-119.3); grants the Child Support Enforcement Administration, and its local surrogates such as the Office, the authority to obtain orders withholding up to 25% of salaries and wages in order to satisfy unpaid child support obligations (FL \u00a7\u00a7 10-120-138); and criminalizes the wilful failure to pay child support (FL \u00a7 10-203). Read together, the provisions of Title 10 of the Family Law Article demonstrate a strong public policy to provide multiple enforcement tools by which child support orders can be enforced. These orders are enforced to \u201cpreserve and promote the best interests of the child\u201d for whom support is to be paid (FL \u00a7 10-118).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">1.3. The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Kelly\u2019s argument is quite simple: he concedes that the Office has the authority to garnish bank accounts but, pointing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>to FL \u00a7 10-108.3(h)(4), he asserts that he is entitled to exempt up to $6,000 of personal property pursuant to CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b)(5). However, we conclude that the exemption in CJP \u00a7 11 \u2014 504(b)(5) does not apply to efforts to collect unpaid child support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Our conclusion is based on a subtle, but very significant, difference in terminology between CJP \u00a7 11-504 and FL \u00a7 10 \u2014 108.3(b)(1). CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b) permits a <em>\u201cdebtor\u201d </em>to claim an exemption of up to $6,000. In contrast, FL \u00a7 10\u2014 108.3 authorizes the Child Support Enforcement Administration to collect unpaid child support from <em>\u201cobligors.\u201d </em>In the purview of FL \u00a7 10-108.3, Kelly is certainly an \u201cobligor.\u201d Does this make him a \u201cdebtor\u201d for the purposes of CJP \u00a7 11\u2014 504? The answer to the question is \u201cno.\u201d Maryland courts have long distinguished between a \u201cdebtor,\u201d that is, someone who simply owes money to another, and an \u201cobligor\u201d who must pay money arising out of a separate, and separately enforceable, legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">This principle was first applied in Maryland in <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Robertson, </em>192 Md. 653, 662-63, 65 A.2d 292 (1949). At issue in that case was whether income generated by a spendthrift trust could be attached to collect unpaid alimony. The Court recognized that income from a spendthrift trust was not subject to attachment for the beneficiary\u2019s debts, but the Court drew a distinction between the obligation to pay a debt and the obligation to support a spouse or minor child. The latter obligation \u201cis a <em>duty, </em>not a <em>debt </em>.... We think the rule that gives legal effect to spendthrift provisions as against contract creditors should not be extended to claims for support or alimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The distinction between an individual\u2019s debts \u2014 owed to third parties \u2014 and his or her duty to support dependent children and spouses has been repeatedly recognized in different legal and factual contexts by the Court of Appeals. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>279 Md. 673, 678, 370 A.2d 1134 (1977) (Military retirement pay is not subject to attachment for payment of a debt but is subject to attachment for unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>alimony because \u201cthe underlying obligation is for intra-familial support and the very purpose of the statutory exemptions is to protect a family from being deprived of all support by attachment proceedings brought by an outsider.\u201d) (citing Md.Code Ann. (1975, 2013 Repl.) \u00a7 15-602 of the Commercial Law Article); <em>Pope v. Pope, </em>283 Md. 531, 537, 390 A.2d 1128 (1978) (Unemployment benefits are not subject to attachment for payment of a debt but are attachable for payment of alimony because \u201cthe legislative purpose underlying such statutes [prohibiting attachment of various benefits] is the protection of the various types of benefits involved from the claims of creditors not from the claim of a former wife for alimony, which often, as in Maryland, is not considered a debt.\u201d) (citing what was then Md.Code (1957, 1969 Repl.), Art. 95A, s 16(c); substantively recodified as Md.Code Ann. (1991, 2008 Repl.) \u00a7 8-106 of the Labor and Employment Article).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The outcome of most of these cases turned upon the Court\u2019s interpretation of statutes authorizing or limiting the enforcement of various types of monetary obligations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In each case, the Court of Appeals distinguished between \u201cdebtors\u201d and \u201cobligors\u201d in the process of construing the statute in question. These decisions lead us to conclude that, when the General Assembly used the term \u201cdebtor\u201d in CJP \u00a7 10-504(b)(4), the Legislature did not intend to permit persons who were obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>gated to pay child support to escape their legal duty. <em>See Pye v. State, </em>397 Md. 626, 635, 919 A.2d 632 (2007) (\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Our interpretation of the subsection is consistent with other provisions of CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b), which extend protections not only to the debtor but the debtor\u2019s family as well. For example, \u00a7 ll-504(b)(3) (emphasis added) exempts \u201c[pjrofessionally prescribed health aids for the debtor <em>or any dependent of the </em>debtor[;]\u201d (b)(4) protects up to $1,000 of household items of the debtor <em>or any dependent of the debtor; </em>(b)(6) protects money designated for payment of child support; and (b)(7) protects money designated for payment of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Our interpretation of CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b)(5) is similarly in harmony with FL \u00a7 10-108.3(b)(l). Title 10 of the Family Law Article establishes a broad panoply of collection techniques that are unavailable to those who collect debts, such as suspending drivers\u2019 and professional licenses. Indeed, a court may even incarcerate a recalcitrant obligor for unpaid child support as part of a contempt proceeding \u2014 a remedy that is specifically denied to those who seek to collect debts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It would be anomalous, to say the least, for the General Assembly to give the Office such far-reaching powers to collect unpaid child support from a delinquent parent but to allow that same parent to place $6,000 beyond the reach of the Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Finally, Kelly cites <em>Rosemann v. Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder &amp; Adkins, LLC, </em>412 Md. 308, 987 A.2d 48 (2010), in support of his argument. <em>Rosemann </em>specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>pertained to a child support enforcement action, where the obligor relied on the personal injury compensation exemption contained in CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b)(2)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to claim that the Administration could not collect child support arrears from her settlement proceeds from a personal injury action. 412 Md. at 313, 987 A.2d 48. In that case, the Court concluded that the reasoning in the <em>Williams </em>line of cases did not apply to this exemption, because the exemptions discussed in those cases were enacted to \u201cprotect a family from being deprived of all support by attachment proceedings brought by an outsider[,]\u201d while the exemption in CJP \u00a7 11 \u2014 504(b)(2) was enacted to \u201cmake the injured person whole.\u201d <em>Rosemann, </em>412 Md. at 325, 987 A.2d 48. The Court reasoned that the money from the personal injury settlement was \u201cnot meant to support directly the injured party\u2019s family,\u201d but to \u201cpay medical bills and compensate for loss of future earnings and pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it concluded that the exemption was applicable to claims for intra-familial support. <em>Id. </em>at 326-37, 987 A.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">We do not believe the reasoning in <em>Rosemann </em>is applicable to the exemption contained in CJP \u00a7 ll-504(b)(5) for two reasons. First, the $6,000 exemption in \u00a7 ll-504(b)(5) is available only to debtors. There is no similar limitation in subsection (b)(2), the provision at issue in <em>Rosemann. </em>Second, the General Assembly amended CJP \u00a7 11 \u2014 504(i)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in 2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>in response to <em>Rosemann, </em>authorizing the execution of up to 25% of a personal injury award to be applied to child support arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">2. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Kelly presents two arguments concerning the trial court\u2019s factual conclusions. We review the court\u2019s findings for clear error and give deference to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to gauge the credibility of witnesses. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">At the hearing, Kelly testified that he was not employed. The trial court stated that it did not believe his testimony on this issue. We defer to the trial court\u2019s credibility assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Kelly also asserts that the funds in the two accounts in question did not entirely belong to him, but were commingled with his mother\u2019s funds. It was his burden to prove that all or a portion of the funds in the accounts were his mother\u2019s by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. v. Andrews, </em>225 Md.App. 181, 189, 123 A.3d 640 (2015). Kelly\u2019s evidence on this point consisted of his testimony but the trial court found him not to be a credible witness. Again, we defer to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Finally, Kelly argues that the Office withheld \u201ccrucial evidence\u201d from the trial court. He does not specify what that evidence was and we will not speculate on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>3. Additional Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Kelly has filed a motion pursuant to Rule 1-341 to request an award of costs and expenses. Rule l-341(a) states the circumstances in which this Court may award costs and expenses to a party when the opposing party acted in bad faith or without substantial justification. Normally, this determination is made by the trial court but we can save a step in this case. There is absolutely no basis to impute bad faith to the Office and it certainly acted with substantial justification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.

The distinction is not significant. All three cases, although specifically pertaining to alimony, framed their analyses in terms of \"intra-familial support,\u201d <em>see Pope, </em>283 Md. at 536, 390 A.2d 1128 (\"[T]he underlying obligation is for intra-familial support....\u201d); <em>Williams, </em>279 Md. at 678, 370 A.2d 1134 (same); <em>Blum, </em>295 Md. at 142, 453 A.2d 824 (describing the obligation to provide contractual alimony as a duty to provide intra-familial support).
