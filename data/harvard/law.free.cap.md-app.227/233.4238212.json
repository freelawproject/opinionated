KENNEY, III (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Appellant, Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe County\u201d), appeals the decision of the Circuit Court for Charles County that reversed the decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) regarding the payment of attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>fees to the attorney for appellee Frederick Minor (\u201cMr. Minor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The County presents a single question for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"Aie\">Whether the circuit court erred when it determined that the County is responsible for payment of Mr. Minor\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On September 3, 2008, Mr. Minor, a deputy sheriff with the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation stemming from an injury he sustained when his right middle-finger became caught in his canine partner\u2019s collar and twisted sideways. The Commission, on October 15, 2008, found that he \u201csustained an accidental injury ... arising out of and in the course of employment on 7/08/2008 and that the average weekly wage was $1,500.00 and that the nature and extent of the disability sustained, if any, [could not be] determined at [that] time.\u201d A hearing on the nature and extent of disability was held, and the Commission, on December 8, 2009, entered the following award:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Disability leave in lieu of temporary total disability from November 7, 2008 to November 28, 2008 inclusive; based on an average weekly wage of $1,500.00 for an accidental injury sustained on July 8, 2008. <em>PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY: </em>Resulting in 20% loss of use of the right hand, due to the accident of July 8, 2008; at the rate of $293.00, payable weekly, beginning November 29, 2008 for a period of 50 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">In the award, the Commission noted that \u201cNo Claimant\u2019s Consent to Pay Attorney Fee and Doctor Fees [was] Submitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel wrote the Commission on December 7, 2009, and \u201cattached Claimant\u2019s Consent to Pay Attorney Fee and Doctor Fee which was mistakenly not turned in at the time of the hearing.\u201d The consent form, signed by Mr. Minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>on December 8, 2009, certified that counsel had \u201cexplained to [him] the amounts allowable by the Commission as counsel fee under the Schedule of Fees and [he] consented] to the Award of a Fee to [his] attorney in accordance with the Commission\u2019s Fee Schedule.\u201d Both the County\u2019s counsel, Antonia St. John, and the senior claims specialist for the County\u2019s third party claim administrator, Melissa Casselman, were copied on the letter, but neither acknowledged receiving it. The Commission docketed the letter and accompanying consent form on December 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On December 15, 2009, Ms. Casselman, emailed Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel\u2019s office<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regarding the attorney\u2019s fees: \u201cI have received the Award Order on Fred Minor. What are the fees so I can deduct them?\u201d When there was no response to the email inquiry, the County, on December 22, 2009, wrote a check for $14,650.00 (the full amount of the award) made payable to \u201cFrederick Minor C/O John Hall, Esquire\u201d and mailed it to Mr. Minor\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. Counsel delivered the check to Mr. Minor, who cashed or deposited it on January 6, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">On January 11, 2010, the Commission rescinded its December 8, 2009 compensation award and entered a new award that included Mr. Minor\u2019s consent to pay counsel \u201cin the amount of $2,930.00, plus reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $24.46 [and medical expenses] in the amount of $410.85.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On May 23, 2013, Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel filed issues with the Commission for the County\u2019s \u201cnon compliance of award dated 1/11/10 in which the atty and doctor fees have not been paid to the respective parties.\u201d A hearing was held on September 13, 2013, and, on September 20, 2013, the Commission issued its order that:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">the [appellant], Prince George\u2019s County Maryland, is not responsible for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. The fee is approved and is payable by [Mr. Minor]. The fee may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>collected from [Mr. Minor] or shall constitute a lien against the payment of any future benefits to [him].</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On October 15, 2013, Mr. Minor filed for judicial review of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">A hearing was held in the circuit court on June 6, 2014. Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cby issuing [the] lump sum check to [Mr. Minor, the County] created a situation where they overpaid [him]. The[ County\u2019s] remedy is that should [he] come back for additional benefits in the future [it] may have a credit for an overpayment.\u201d But, according to counsel, the County was not relieved of the obligation to pay any attorney\u2019s fees awarded in the case. Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel further argued that the Commission order stating that fees may be collected from Mr. Minor is a violation of workers\u2019 compensation law, and requested that the circuit court vacate the September 2013 Commission order.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The County responded that the law requires that any fee shall be paid from an award of compensation in the manner stated by the Commission, and in this case, no fee was provided for in the initial award because no fee consent form was filed. Moreover, if the County had held payment and did not submit payment to Mr. Minor within fifteen days of the award, it would have been subject to a penalty. According to the County, it did not receive a copy of counsel\u2019s December 7, 2009 letter, and Mr. Minor\u2019s Counsel did not respond to Ms. Casselman\u2019s December 15 email, and therefore, the Commission order should be affirmed. To do otherwise, it asserted, would impose a burden on the County not provided for in existing law. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court, commenting that it was \u201cobvious that steps could have been taken on either side to avoid this problem,\u201d took the case under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">On September 16, 2014, the circuit court filed an \u201cOpinion and Order\u201d finding that \u201cthe Commission\u2019s September 20, 2013 order placing responsibility on Mr. Minor was an incorrect construction of the law and facts\u201d and that the County is \u201crequired to pay $2,930.00\u201d to Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The record reflects that the County and its agents should have known that a fee petition was filed with the Commission on December 9, 2009 and that the Commission\u2019s approval of the fee was pending. First, the December 7, 2009 letter and attached fee petition from Counsel for Mr. Minor was copied to the County\u2019s attorney and Ms. Casselman. This letter put the County and Ms. Casselman on notice of the fee petition three weeks before the check was issued. Second, the fee petition was docketed the day after the First Award was issued, and the County and Ms. Casselman easily could have checked the Commission\u2019s dockets for any updates. Third, Ms. Casselman\u2019s email indicates her knowledge that the issue of counsel fees was still outstanding. While Counsel for Mr. Minor concedes that there was some communication between Ms. Casselman and counsel for Mr. Minor\u2019s office, Ms. Casselman, as the County\u2019s agent, should have acted more diligently by following up with Counsel for Mr. Minor, checking to see if anything new was docketed with the Commission, directly inquiring of the Commission to determine the requested amount of attorney\u2019s fees, or making the check payable to both Mr. Minor and Counsel for Mr. Minor. Instead, Ms. Casselman took no further action in the seven days before payment was due. As the individual responsible for processing Mr. Minor\u2019s compensation award, Ms. Casselman was responsible for ensuring she had all the necessary information to make a proper payment, and the information was readily available from the Commission\u2019s public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Notwithstanding the fact that 20% of the award was not reserved in escrow, on January 11, 2010, a lien attached to the Revised Award approving attorney\u2019s fees. The revised award was notice to the County to reserve the $2,930.00 fee in an escrow account. Although the County paid Mr. Minor in full under the First Award, the Commission expressly rescinded the First Award and the County has not been discharged from its liability under the revised award....</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Furthermore, the Court accepts the argument by Counsel for appellee that an attorney cannot collect legal fees direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ly from a claimant in a worker\u2019s compensation case. The Commission\u2019s attorney fee approval system is such that an attorney cannot collect any legal fees unless approved by the Commission....</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Given these policies and considerations and the principles [espoused in the relevant case law], the County is responsible for paying attorney\u2019s fees in the event of an overpayment to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">(Internal citations and footnotes omitted). On October 14, 2014, appellant filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">A party can petition for judicial review of a Commission decision pursuant to Md.Code (1991, 2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-737 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E. \u00a7 9-737\u201d). In that review, \u201cthe decision[ ] of the Commission ([is]) entitled to [a presumption of] prima facie correctness[,]\u201d <em>Frank v. Balt. Cnty., </em>284 Md. 655, 658, 399 A.2d 250 (1979) (quoting <em>Md. Bureau of Mines v. Powers, </em>258 Md. 379, 382, 265 A.2d 860 (1970)), but a court \u201cmay reverse a commission ruling only upon a finding that its action was based upon an erroneous construction of the law or facts.\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 658, 399 A.2d 250. In addition, \u201c[Reviewing courts should give special deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations because the agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating those regulations.\u201d <em>Brunson v.

State Bd. of Physicians, </em>196 Md.App. 362, 372, 9 A.3d 534 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The County relies on its compliance \u201cwith the Dec. 2009 Award as ordered,\u201d and argues that \u201cno lien attached to the Dec. 2009 Award because no fee was approved [by the Commission] at that time,\u201d and, in the absence of an approved fee, it was not required to take steps \u201cin furtherance of securing or paying attorney fees.\u201d It takes issue with the circuit court\u2019s statement that it \u201cshould have expected [that] a fee petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>... would be filed and approved,\u201d and argues that the circuit court\u2019s decision was inconsistent with the Code of Maryland Regulations, which places an employer/insurer on notice of attorney\u2019s fees by a Commission award. In its view, it \u201creached out beyond its obligation to [Mr. Minor]\u2019s attorney in an attempt to put him on notice of the fee issue,\u201d and the Commission correctly found that the \u201clast clear chance\u201d to correct any oversight rested with Mr. Minor and his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Mr. Minor responds that the County \u201cessentially made an over payment\u201d by writing a check made payable to Mr. Minor without reserving the appropriate attorney\u2019s fees, and that an \u201cover payment of worker\u2019s compensation benefits can not be recouped from the claimant.\u201d Mr. Minor relies heavily on the reasoning of the circuit court in the discussion section of that court\u2019s \u201cOpinion and Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A brief overview of the relevant workers\u2019 compensation law will inform our discussion. L.E. \u00a7 9-731 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">(a)(1) <em>Unless approved by the Commission, </em>a person may not charge or collect a fee for:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">(1) legal services in connection with a claim under this title;</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">(ii) medical services, supplies, or treatment provided under Subtitle 6, Part IX of this title; or</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">(iii) funeral expenses under Subtitle 6, Part XIII of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">(2) <em>When the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a fee shall be paid from an award of compensation only in the manner set by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">This provision has a twofold purpose: one is to protect attorneys by imposing a statutory lien on a portion of any compensation award; the other is to protect injured workers by limiting the amount of allowable attorney\u2019s fees so that awards will not be exhausted by excessive fees. <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>282 Md. 413, 418, 384 A.2d 742 (1978); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>Chanticleer Skyline Room, Inc. v. Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 699-700, 319 A.2d 802 (1974). \u201cTo balance the need to protect claimants from excessive legal fees against the need of workers to retain competent counsel, the legislature delegated to the Commission, an administrative agency with special expertise in worker\u2019s compensation law, the authority over attorney\u2019s fees in worker\u2019s compensation cases, including the power to promulgate rules governing such fees.\u201d <em>Brunson, </em>221 Md.App. at 592-93, 110 A.3d 713. To that end, the Commission has adopted the following regulation:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">A. Request for Fee Not in Excess of Schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">(1) An attorney seeking approval of an attorney\u2019s fee that does not exceed the maximum amount set forth in Regulation .03 of this chapter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may request approval of the fee by filing the Claimant\u2019s Consent to Pay Attorney and Doctor Fee form.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">(2) A completed Claimant\u2019s Consent to Pay Attorney and Doctor Fee form shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">(a) Be signed by the claimant;</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">(b) Include the amount of any medical evaluation fee requested to be approved;</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">(c) Include any amount of costs advanced by claimant\u2019s attorney for which the attorney is seeking payment; and</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">(d) Include any appeal fee requested under Regulation .03B(9) of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">(3) An attorney shall substantiate a request for medical evaluation fee, costs or a fee under Regulation .03B(9) of this chapter by:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">(a) Submitting medical bills, receipts, or other evidence of costs; ...</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">(5) <em>An award by the Commission approving an attorney\u2019s fee under this regulation shall be notice to the party </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>responsible for payment to reserve in escrow the amount of fee approved.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">COMAR 14.09.04.02 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Commission\u2019s control over the amount of fees payable and when attorney\u2019s fees are paid is plenary. <em>See Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 319 A.2d 802. For example, COMAR 14.09.04.03 provides formulas for calculating the maximum allowable attorney\u2019s fees in a particular case, and several statutes determine when an award should be paid, and impose penalties on employers/insurers for late payments. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-727 (\u201cThe employer or its insurer shall begin paying compensation to the covered employee within 15 days after the later of the date: (1) an award is made; or (2) payment of an award is due.\u201d); L.E. \u00a7 9-728 (\u201cIf the Commission finds that an employer or its insurer has failed, without good cause, to begin paying an award within 15 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, the Commission shall assess against the employer or its insurer a fine not exceeding 20% of the amount of the payment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Prior to the late 1980\u2019s, there was a two-step process in regard to requesting attorney\u2019s fees in cases that went to a hearing before the Commission. Theodore B. Cornblatt et al., Workmen\u2019s Compensation Manual 63 (1985 Revised Ed. Cum. Supp.1987). The first step was the Commission\u2019s compensation award; the second, which followed the award, was the claimant\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201cpetition for fee and [its submission] to the Commission for approval.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At that time, the \u201cfiling of a petition for a fee\u201d was notice to the employer and insurer to reserve in escrow the amount requested in the fee petition until the Commission approved the fee. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.01.21.F (1983); Volume 9, Issue 26 of the Md. Register at 2593 (Dec. 23, 1982) (adopted without change in Volume 10, Issue 12 of the Md. Register at 1073 (June 10, 1983)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Later, however, the Commission initiated a new procedure to streamline the fee approval process. <em>Compare </em>Theodore B. Cornblatt et al, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Manual 56-57 (1981 with Supp. 1982-83), <em>with </em>Theodore B. Cornblatt et al., Workmen\u2019s Compensation Manual 63 (1985 Revised Ed. with Cum.Supp. 1987). Rather than filing a petition for fees after the award of compensation, the claimant\u2019s attorney submitted a \u201cconsent to pay attorney fee and doctor fees\u201d (signed by the claimant) at the hearing, and the Commission would then incorporate the approved fees directly into the compensation award. Theodore B. Cornblatt et al, Workers\u2019 Compensation Manual 97-98 (5th Ed.1988). The regulations were amended to reflect the change in procedure by stating that \u201c[a]n award by the Commission approving an attorney\u2019s fee under this regulation shall be notice to the party responsible for payment to reserve in escrow the amount of the fee approved.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.01.24.A.(4) (1991); Volume 18, Issue 3 of the Md. Register at 325-26 (Feb. 8,1982) (adopted without change in Volume 18, Issue 11 of the Md. Register at 1189 (May 31, 1991)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of this change, the employer/insurer had no obligation to withhold an amount for fees when no consent form was submitted. Theodore B. Cornblatt et al., Workers\u2019 Compensation Manual 2-16 (7th Ed. with 1995 Supp.). The current regulations contain the same provision, <em>see </em>COMAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>14.09.04.02, and, as Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel acknowledges, consent forms are ordinarily submitted at the Commission hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">As these procedures and the relevant law and regulations make clear, a claim for fees by an attorney representing a workers\u2019 compensation claimant is not a claim against either the Commission or the employer/insurer. <em>See Feissner, </em>282 Md. at 418-19, 384 A.2d 742. Instead, \u201cthe money to be paid the attorney remains part of the fund to which the employee is entitled as compensation,\u201d and, \u201cthe payment of legal fees ... remains at all times the personal responsibility of the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, employers/insurers \u201care obligated to pay an approved attorney\u2019s fee only out of compensation awarded to the claimant,\u201d when there is an attached lien for such fees, and not \u201cout of their own funds, unless it be for failure to respect a lien lawfully attached.\u201d <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>37 Md.App. 124, 135, 377 A.2d 1185 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">For whatever reason, Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel failed to file a consent form at the hearing before the Commission, and no award for attorney\u2019s fees was included in the Commission\u2019s first award. Therefore, no lien attached to the fund established by the award. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-731 (\u201cWhen the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.\u201d). It follows that the County, prior to disbursing the ordered award to Mr. Minor, was not, as a matter of law, on notice to reserve in escrow a portion of the award because there was no approved fee. <em>See </em>COMAR 14.09.04.02.A.(5) (\u201cAn award by the Commission approving an attorney\u2019s fee under this regulation shall be notice to the party responsible for payment to reserve in escrow the amount of fee approved.\u201d). No fee was approved until January 11, 2010. The County, however, was obligated to pay the compensation award in the compensation order within fifteen days of the date that it was issued, i.e., December 8, 2009. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-727.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To be sure, Ms. Casselman inquired as to attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>fees prior to paying the award by emailing someone in the office of Mr. Minor\u2019s counsel. But, even if her email indicated her knowledge that a consent to fee form had been filed, that effort exceeded any obligation imposed by the statute or the regulations. Receiving no response from counsel, the County paid the award to Mr. Minor to meet the fifteen day deadline imposed by the statute and to avoid a possible penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It was not until January 11, 2010, when the Commission passed its second award approving the fee request, that a lien could attach to the compensation award. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-731(a)(1)\u00ae, (a)(2). Only then could there have been \u201can interception of the money in the hands of the insurer\u201d that would bar payment to the claimant of a portion of the compensation award. <em>Hoffman v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>232 Md. 51, 55, 191 A.2d 575 (1963). Simply put, when the fee was approved on January 11, 2010, there was no \u201cmoney in the hands of the insurer,\u201d no fund left to which a lien could attach, and the entire compensation award had already been paid to Mr. Minor in accordance with the first award.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">This case is factually different than <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Staley v. Bd. Of Educ. of Washington Cnty., </em>308 Md. 42, 517 A.2d 349 (1986), on which both Mr. Minor and the circuit court relied. In <em>Hoffman, </em>the question before the Court was \u201cwhether an insurance carrier may defeat the statutory lien of an attorney for his fee by applying funds held in escrow, pursuant to an order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, to satisfy an overpayment made to a claimant.\u201d 232 Md. at 52, 191 A.2d 575. The Court of Appeals concluded that it could not because \u201c[t]he lien of the fee attached at the time of the Commission\u2019s original order [approving the attorney\u2019s fee], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and, as stated above, the only effect of the new modified award and order was to change the amount of the fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 191 A.2d 575. In other words, the lien remained in effect, and the employer/insurer was deemed to be holding the amount of the fee in escrow. <em>Id. </em>at 56-57, 191 A.2d 575. Therefore, the carrier could not claim the money specifically set aside for fees to satisfy its overpayment to the claimant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In <em>Staley, </em>the issue again was \u201cwhether the [employer/insurer was required to] pay ... legal fees to the claimant\u2019s attorney even though the amount already paid to the claimant exceeded the total sum due her under the modified award.\u201d <em>Staley, </em>308 Md. at 45, 517 A.2d 349. Ms. Staley was injured in the course and scope of her employment, and the Commission ordered the employer/insurer to pay disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 517 A.2d 349. The employer/insurer appealed, but continued to pay her benefits during the pendency of the appeal. Before the appeal was decided, her attorney filed a fee petition with the Commission in accordance with the prevailing practice at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 44-45, 517 A.2d 349. The petition was approved. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 517 A.2d 349. When the disability award was subsequently reduced, claimant\u2019s attorney filed a revised petition for attorney\u2019s fees, which the Commission also approved. <em>Id. </em>Both orders specified that the legal fees were to be paid from the final weeks of compensation due the claimant. <em>Id. </em>The employer/insurer refused to pay counsel claiming that there was no fund to which the attorney\u2019s lien could attach because they \u201cwere to accumulate funds for the escrow account only from the final weeks of compensation due the claimant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 517 A.2d 349. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument and reiterated that the \u201clien attached to the funds held in escrow when the Commission issued its initial fee order. The insurer was compelled at all times to keep in the escrow account an amount equal to the ultimate fee. The appeal did not affect the existence of either the lien or the funds in the account.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In both <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Staley, </em>there was an established lien on attorney\u2019s fees in effect when the revised awards were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>issued. Here, the award funds were paid out to the claimant prior to the lien being established.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Unlike some other states, Maryland \u201cdoes not treat [workers\u2019 compensation] attorney\u2019s fees as an \u2018add-on\u2019 or \u2018double\u2019 benefit which the employer must pay injured employees in addition to the compensation award itself.\u201d <em>Feissner, </em>282 Md. at 418, 384 A.2d 742. The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">[T]he lien attaches when the fee is approved by the Commission, but the money to be paid the attorney remains part of the fund to which the employee is entitled as compensation. <em>Liability for payment of counsel fees continues to rest with the employee. </em>Since the employer remains obligated to pay the compensation award from which the fee is to be paid, he may, in part, fulfill his responsibility to the claimant by paying the employee\u2019s debt to the attorney. <em>The statuto't'y lien merely alters the manner in which the employer discharges his liability for the compensation award.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 419, 384 A.2d 742 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">We are mindful that the purpose of the lien provided in L.E. \u00a7 9-731 and COMAR 14.09.04.02 is the \u201cprotection of attorneys who represent claimants in Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases.\u201d <em>Staley, </em>308 Md. at 48, 517 A.2d 349. But, the statute and regulations will only protect those attorneys who protect themselves. In this case, that purpose would have been served if the attorney had timely filed a petition for fees or even, perhaps, if there had been a timely response to Ms. Casselman\u2019s inquiry. The circuit court observed that the County could have avoided this situation by \u201cchecking to see if anything new was docketed with the Commission, directly inquiring of the Commission to determine the requested amount of attorney\u2019s fees, or making the check payable to both Mr. Minor and Counsel for Mr. Minor.\u201d But, checking the docket would not have revealed an approved fee until January 11, 2010, when there was no fund to which a lien could have attached. And, we see nothing in the law that imposes on the County any further obligation to protect an attorney\u2019s fees in the absence of an established lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>That does not mean, however, that counsel is not entitled or can never be paid for his services. The Commission stated in its September 18, 2013 order, the fee is \u201cpayable by [Mr. Minor]\u201d and \u201cmay be collected from [Mr. Minor] or shall constitute a lien against the payment of any future benefits to [him].\u201d <em>See also Greer, </em>271 Md. at 701, 319 A.2d 802.
