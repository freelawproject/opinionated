On November 13, 2014, the court sentenced Sgt. Riley to twenty years in prison with all suspended except for five years to be served without the possibility of parole, for use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence; a concurrent twenty-year sentence, with all but three years suspended, for assault in the first degree;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to a concurrent three years in prison for misconduct in office. The court also placed Sgt. Riley on five years of supervised probation. On November 17, 2014, Sgt. Riley noted this appeal, presenting a single question for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Was the evidence insufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">This case stems from an on-duty police shooting. On September 6, 2012, shortly after 5:17 p.m., twenty-five year old Calvin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kyle (\u201cKyle\u201d) was riding a stolen motorcycle on Marlboro Pike in the District Heights municipality of Prince George\u2019s County. Kyle\u2019s friends were driving ahead of him in a gold Chevrolet Tahoe (the \u201cSUV\u201d) on the way to a repair . shop to swap a flat tire on the motorcycle. Sgt. Riley was on patrol in an unmarked Ford Crown Victoria when the SUV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>and the motorcycle made illegal left turns onto Scott Key Drive before splitting up and going different ways. The SUV continued straight onto Scott Key Drive and the motorcycle turned onto Foster Street and traveled the wrong way down the one-way street.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">After observing the traffic violations, Sgt. Riley activated his emergency lights and began a pursuit of the motorcycle. Kyle, the motorcyclist, did not stop when he saw Sgt. Riley behind him and instead attempted to merge onto County Road but was impeded by heavy traffic. After pulling Kyle over, Sgt. Riley approached him and informed him that he had been riding the wrong way down a one-way street. When asked for his name, Kyle, who had no license, identified himself as \u201cKalvin Paterson.\u201d A license check revealed no records for a \u201cKalvin Paterson.\u201d Kyle did not comply with Sgt. Riley\u2019s requests to shut off the motorcycle and dismount. When Sgt. Riley heard a change in the engine, he believed that Kyle was \u201cgetting ready to run.\u201d Sgt. Riley then lowered the kickstand and took Kyle off of the motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">After police dispatch informed Sgt. Riley that the motorcycle had been reported as stolen, Sgt. Riley advised Kyle that he was under arrest. Sgt. Riley searched Kyle\u2019s pockets, handcuffed him, and sat him on a curb. Sgt. Riley removed Kyle\u2019s shoes, hoping to find some form of identification but found none. Sgt. Riley then placed Kyle in the front passenger seat of his police vehicle for transport to the jail, securing him with a seat belt, before locking the door. By then, Officer Douglas McMillan had arrived as backup, but Sgt. Riley told him to return to service after hearing dispatch calls for Ofc. McMillan over the radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Kyle\u2019s phone rang seven times while he waited with Sgt. Riley in the police vehicle for a tow truck to pick up the motorcycle. When asked by Sgt. Riley if he was with the SUV, Kyle said \u201cno.\u201d At one point, while waiting in the car, Kyle uttered, \u201cthere\u2019s the gold Tahoe.\u201d When Sgt. Riley looked up, he saw the SUV making a right turn from Foster Street onto Blazer Drive. Sgt. Riley then \u201cstarted packing up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>everything\u201d and walked to County Road to photograph the motorcycle in order to document the missing ignition. At that time, the SUV traveled towards Sgt. Riley at 10-15 miles per hour with the driver staring at the cruiser and hanging his arm and torso outside of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Sgt. Riley realized that Kyle had taken off and spotted him running on Foster Street towards Scott Key Drive. Sgt. Riley began a pursuit on foot. Sgt. Riley lost sight of the SUV and assumed that it had turned onto Elmhurst Street, which intersects with Scott Key Drive. Sgt. Riley then tried to get on the radio to request additional units, but the radio was \u201ctied up\u201d with other dispatch calls. During his foot chase with Kyle, Sgt. Riley\u2019s expandable baton became fully extended and restricted his running. In \u201can act of desperation,\u201d Sgt. Riley threw the baton at Kyle, adding that \u201ceverything became intense\u201d at that point. Sgt. Riley said he believed that the SUV was there to pick up Kyle, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">At that point I started formulating that he\u2019s going to make it around the corner; we\u2019re going to be exposed. Then I\u2019m fearing for myself, because I know once I turn that corner with Mr. Kyle, that I might be hurt. I might be put into a possible ambush. I\u2019m not just dealing with Mr. Kyle on foot; now I got to deal with the two suspects in the car \u2014 the two unknown people in the truck, and I got to deal with the truck itself as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Sgt. Riley yelled four times, \u201cstop or I\u2019ll shoot,\u201d before firing two shots as he ran. One of the shots hit a parked vehicle. Sgt. Riley then stopped and turned, and fired a third shot hitting Kyle. According to Sgt. Riley, five or six seconds passed from when he saw Kyle running to when he fired his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Sgt. Riley testified that when he walked up to Kyle following the shooting, he \u201cwas surprised [to see] that Mr. Kyle was still cuffed.\u201d Sgt. Riley immediately reported the shooting to the dispatcher saying, \u201cshots fired, shots fired. County Road and Foster. Suspect down. I shot my suspect.\u201d Officer Joseph Angle, who had just cleared a robbery a mile away, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>and Wendell Brantley, a Deputy Chief of Police for the District Heights Police Department, both responded to the scene, where they saw Sgt. Riley administering aid to Kyle. As a result of being shot, Kyle\u2019s spine was severed, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">State\u2019s witnesses, Adena Davis, Andrea Brown, and Latoya Cannon, said that they saw an officer chasing an individual who was running. Brown said that she saw the individual escape from the officer\u2019s vehicle as the officer photographed the motorcycle, while Davis stated that the individual \u201ckept looking back\u201d at the officer. Both Brown and Davis testified to seeing the officer throw his baton at the individual, and they estimated that the officer was 25-80 feet from the individual when he fired his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The State presented two experts on the use of force by police. Sergeant William Gleason, a member of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, testified that he did not believe that Sgt. Riley used a reasonable use of force. Specifically, Sgt. Gleason noted that Kyle was running away from Sgt. Riley for a relatively unserious offense while restrained in handcuffs behind his back. As such, Kyle did not pose any imminent threat of harm because \u201cno reasonable person would believe that [Kyle] was armed at the time,\u201d particularly since Sgt. Riley had already searched Kyle\u2019s person twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Craig Dickerson, a thirty-year veteran of the Montgomery County Police Department, testified and based on the information presented, he believed it was a \u201ctactical error in judgment.\u201d According to Dickerson, an officer is permitted to use deadly force \u201cbased on the threat and ... the seriousness of the crime,\u201d but that Kyle posed a minimal threat as he was handcuffed and running away. Dickerson also added that a \u201cbetter or more reasonable action\u201d would have been to \u201ccall and ask for assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The defense presented its own expert on the use of force. David G. Bolgiano, a retired military officer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>because the officers confront tense and rapidly evolving situations, the deadly force policy is \u201cdeliberately vague\u201d and not subject to \u201cbright-line rules.\u201d Bolgiano testified that \u201cinattentional blindness\u201d and loss of fine motor skills caused by the fear of death impacted Sgt. Riley\u2019s actions. According to Bolgiano, \u201cviewed from the perspective of a reasonable police officer and the information that officer possessed at the time he made the decision to use deadly force and all the preassaultive indicators[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] that were present, his actions were objectively reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">After deliberating for eight hours, the jury acquitted Sgt. Riley of attempted murder in the second degree, but convicted him of assault in the first and second degree, use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence, and misconduct in office. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Additional facts will be included below as they become relevant to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">On a claim that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction, the standard of review is whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Gerald v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 295, 308, 768 A.2d 140 (2001) (citation omitted). \u201cOur concern is not with whether the trial court\u2019s verdict is in accord with what appears to us to be the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>of the evidence, but rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence \u2014 that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336 (1994) (internal citations omitted). In that regard, we defer to the fact finder\u2019s \u201cresolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Svddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 430, 842 A.2d 716 (2004) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201cthe judgment of the trial court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Manion, </em>442 Md. 419, 431, 112 A.3d 506 (2015) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">I. Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Sgt. Riley first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for assault. Specifically, Sgt. Riley contends that \u201c[bjecause there was no evidence presented to support a finding that [he] acted with malice in using his service weapon, the State failed to prove that he was criminally liable under \u00a7\u00a7 3-202, 3-203 ... of the [Md.Code (2002, 2012 RepLVol.),] Criminal Law Article [ (\u201cCL\u201d) ].\u201d In support of his argument, Sgt. Riley emphasizes that \u201cfor criminal liability there must be \u2018concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 251, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case in the circuit court, counsel for Sgt. Riley moved for judgment of acquittal, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">With respect to the assault counts, because of my client\u2019s position as a police officer, I still think the State \u2014 because an officer has some degree of immunity for his actions, the State still has to prove that these acts were done with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>I\u2019ve submitted a requested jury instruction on malice that I would call to the Court\u2019s attention ____ I believe I submitted \u2014 that they\u2019d have to show that he acted knowingly and deliberately for an improper motive and without legal justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Mere errors of judgment, whether occasioned by negligence o[r] otherwise, are not crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Similarly, an act that is done merely because of mistake, accident, carelessness, or other innocent reason is not done maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Defense counsel renewed his argument at the conclusion of the entire case, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The State is trying to argue to the Court that a police officer, for actions which the subsequent statute assigns, actions for which he could not be civilly liable for a nickel, he\u2019s criminally liable. And I don\u2019t think that that is what any case says. I don\u2019t think that makes sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The legislature is saying when an officer is acting in the course of his duties, there\u2019s a level of governmental immunity that applies, and that would also carry over to the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">In response, the State argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">I disagree ... that the case law in any way has the added burden of the State showing malice on the part of the defendant in the context of a criminal case. I believe that the case law clearly will show, and there are statutes to the effect that affirm this, malice is a required element in the civil context; however, it is not in the criminal context.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">Ultimately, the circuit court agreed with the State and denied the motion for judgment of acquittal stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">I see nothing in the definition of battery ... or in the definition of assault that talks about malice. I mean, it\u2019s very clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">Battery, if you look at the instruction \u2014 this is the assault count that would lie ... which is at [Maryland Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Pattern Jury Instructions] 4:01(c), \u201cassault is causing offensive physical contact to another person. The State must prove, one, that the defendant caused the physical harm; two, that the contact was the result of an intentional or reckless act and was not accidental; and, three, that the contact was either not consented to or not legally justified.\u201d That\u2019s not complex. That\u2019s the state of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">And then to add first degree to it means that it was done causing serious permanent \u2014 and permanent or serious protracted injury and that it was done by a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"A95\">Subsequently, the State, in its rebuttal closing argument, contended that even if the jury found no intent to kill, Sgt. Riley was guilty of assault \u201cbecause he inflicted a very serious sort of physical injury on [C]alvin Kyle that wasn\u2019t consented to in any way by Mr. Kyle[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We agree with the State and the circuit court that Sgt. Riley\u2019s reliance on <em>Morissette </em>is misplaced. The substantive elements of assault do not change based on the identity of the defendant. In this case, Sgt. Riley was convicted of assault, a general intent crime, <em>Genies v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 590, 601, 10 A.3d 854 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>426 Md. 148, 43 A.3d 1007 (2012), that does not require malice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Johnson v. State, </em>223 Md.App. 128, 147, 115 A.3d 668, <em>cert. denied, </em>445 Md. 6, 122 A.3d 975 (2015). \u201cBecause it lacks the element of malice, [ ] assault cannot be reduced by the defense of provocation into some lesser offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA provocation defense ... serves only to mitigate the presence of malice and cannot absolve an individual of all criminal liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 115 A.3d 668 (citations omitted). Nonetheless, as the State correctly notes, Sgt. Riley was \u201centitled to raise the affirmative defense of law-enforcement justification, which he in fact did\u201d and which, according to the verdict, the jury did not accept. <em>See generally Tavakoli-Nouri v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 716, 731, 779 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>992 (2001) (recognizing \u201cthat police officers, when arresting a suspect, have the right to take reasonably necessary measures to make the arrest in a manner that protects both the public and themselves,\u201d including the use of force) (citation omitted); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 512, 520, 590 A.2d 562 (1991) (\u201cWe hold that a police officer, from the perspective of a reasonable police officer, may use only that amount of force reasonably necessary under the circumstances to discharge his duties.\u201d) (Citation omitted); <em>see also 2 </em>Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 10.7 at 173 (West 2d ed. 2003) (\u201cA police officer, or a person aiding him, is justified in using reasonable force to make a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of one already arrested.\u201d); 2 Paul H. Robinson, 2 Criminal Law Defense \u00a7 142 (West 1984, updated July 2015) (discussing the \u201cpublic authority\u201d forms of \u201cjustification defenses\u201d to criminal culpability).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Sgt. Riley cites <em>Elonis v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015), and <em>State v. Pagotto, </em>361 Md. 528, 762 A.2d 97 (2000), to support his contention, but those cases are inapposite. The portion of <em>Elonis </em>that Sgt. Riley relies on instructs that strict-liability crimes are disfavored and, when appropriate, a court will impute a <em>mens rea </em>element to avoid them. 135 S.Ct. at 2009. But, battery is not a strict-liability crime. Rather, it requires proof that the offensive physical contact the defendant made with the victim was the result of reckless or criminal negligence. <em>Elias v. State, </em>339 Md. 169, 184, 661 A.2d 702 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Meanwhile, <em>Pagotto </em>is factually distinguishable. In that case, Pagotto, a police officer, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment following an incident in which a bullet from his handgun killed a motorist who was driving a vehicle that Pagotto was attempting to stop while on duty. <em>Pagotto, </em>361 Md. at 534-38, 762 A.2d 97. The Court of Appeals later vacated Pagotto\u2019s convictions after concluding that \u201cthe evidence presented at trial, as a matter of law, was insufficient\u201d as \u201cSergeant Pagotto\u2019s behavior simply did not evidence a \u2018wanton or reckless disregard for human life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 762 A.2d 97. Sgt. Riley, however, provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>no argument to indicate why we should apply the elements of involuntary manslaughter or reckless endangerment to a case involving assault. More importantly, we note that unlike in this case, the <em>Pagotto </em>Court concluded that \u201c[t]he State produced no evidence that [Sergeant] Pagotto was aiming his gun at [the victim] when it discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 762 A.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Here, a rational trier of fact could have found that: (1) Sgt. Riley caused Kyle physical harm; (2) the contact was the result of an intentional or reckless act and was not accidental; and (3) the contact was not consented to by Kyle. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support Sgt. Riley\u2019s conviction for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">II. Use of a Handgun</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Next, Sgt. Riley argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence pursuant to CL \u00a7 4-204. In pertinent part, this section states: \u201cA person may not use a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, as defined in \u00a7 5-101 of the [Md.Code (2003, 2011 RepLVol.),] Public Safety Article [ (\u201cPS\u201d) ], or any felony, whether the firearm is operable or inoperable at the time of the crime.\u201d CL \u00a7 4-204(b). According to Sgt. Riley, \u201c\u00a7 4-204 is not intended to deter a police officer who is required to carry a firearm and [who is] permitted to use [it] in the course of carrying out his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In response, the State contends that Sgt. Riley did not preserve this issue for our review because he never argued it below. Alternatively, the State asserts that Sgt. Riley\u2019s argument fails on the merits because: (1) the Legislature did not intend to limit CL \u00a7 4-204 to a \u201cpreexisting subset of citizens against whom the statute would operate[;]\u201d (2) Sgt. Riley\u2019s construction of the statute is dependent upon his view that he \u201cact[ed] in accord with his sworn duty to enforce the State\u2019s criminal laws when he used his service weapon,\u201d which is inconsistent with the jury\u2019s factual findings; and (3) his interpretation of CL \u00a7 4-204 \u201cwould lead to an absurd result ... [as] any person with a clean record could violate the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>with impunity because that person would not be a criminal yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Assuming without deciding that Sgt. Riley preserved this issue for our review, we agree with the State that his argument nonetheless has no merit. \u201cIn construing a statute, one begins with the \u2018plain meaning\u2019 of the statutory language and may end there if the meaning is plain enough.\u201d <em>State v. Roshchin, </em>446 Md. 128, 140, 130 A.3d 453 (2016) (footnote omitted). A plain reading of the relevant portion of CL \u00a7 4-204 prohibits a person from using a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence. CL \u00a7 4-204(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In turn, PS \u00a7 5-101(c)(3) includes second-degree assault as a crime of violence. Had the Legislature intended to exempt police officers from the prohibition imposed by CL \u00a7 4-204, it could have specified as such. <em>Cf </em>CL \u00a7 4 \u2014 203(b)(1) (specifically creating an exception for police officers with regard to the crime of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926B (same). Here, it is undisputed that Sgt. Riley is a person who used his service weapon to shoot Kyle, and he resultantly, was found guilty of second-degree assault. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support Sgt. Riley\u2019s conviction for use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence under CL \u00a7 4-204.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Sgt. Riley cites <em>State v. White, </em>29 N.E.3d 939, 949-50 (Ohio 2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 73, 193 L.Ed.2d 207 (2015), but his reliance on that case is misplaced. Although Sgt. Riley correctly recognizes the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s statement that \u201cit is neither just nor reasonable to apply a firearm specification to a police officer involved in an on-duty shooting based only on a showing of poor judgment or negligence in using force,\u201d he fails to acknowledge the following clarification made by the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>[T]he statute requires that a distinction be drawn between a police officer who acts in accord with the duty to uphold the law and one who abandons that duty by committing a criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The firearm specification may apply if the facts of a given case demonstrate that the actions of the officer display criminal misconduct constituting a departure from the course and scope of official duties, as police officers have no license to commit crimes under color of office. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ramos, </em>537 F.3d [439,] 458 [ (5th Cir.2008) ] (upholding application of a firearm specification to border patrol officers convicted of criminal offenses for <em>shooting a fleeing suspect when there was no phgsical threat to the officers or to </em>others); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>363 F.3d 631, 641 (7th Cir.2004) (upholding application of a firearm specification to police officers \u201chired to use their status as police officers, with all the trappings, to protect Silky\u2019s drug couriers,\u201d even though the officers\u2019 service weapons had not been brandished or used); <em>United States v. Contreras, </em>950 F.2d 232, 241-242 (5th Cir.1991) (upholding application of a firearm specification to a police officer who conducted a traffic stop and then sexually assaulted a passenger in the vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 949 (emphasis added). Where, as here, there was testimony that Sgt. Riley shot Kyle as Kyle was handcuffed and running away, and therefore, did not pose any imminent threat of harm, we hold that CL \u00a7 4-204 applied. <em>See Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (\u201cThe use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable .... Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">III. Misconduct in Office</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Finally, Sgt. Riley challenges his conviction for misconduct in office, arguing that \u201cmere errors in judgment did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>come within the conduct proscribed by this offense.\u201d In support of his argument, Sgt. Riley cites <em>Leopold v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 586, 604-05, 88 A.3d 860 (2014), where we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u201cIn Maryland, misconduct in office is a common law misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Duncan v. State, </em>282 Md. 385, 387, 384 A.2d 456 (1978) (footnote omitted). It has been defined as \u201ccorrupt behavior by a public officer in the exercise of the duties of his office or while acting under color of his office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Perkins on Criminal Law 485 (2d ed. 1969); <em>Hitzelberger v. State, </em>174 Md. 152, 197 A. 605 (1938)). The corrupt behavior may be: (1) the doing of an act which is wrongful in itself, or \u201cmalfeasance;\u201d (2) the doing of an act otherwise lawful in a wrongful manner, or \u201cmisfeasance;\u201d or (3) the omitting to do an act which is required by the duties of the office, or \u201cnonfeasance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Acts that qualify as misconduct in office include:</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">neglect or non-performance of any positive duty imposed by law; <em>oppressive and wilfljful abuse of authority </em>(to be distinguished from mere error of judgment); extortion; fraud or breach of trust affecting the public, such as rendering, passing or procuring false accounts, or wil[l]fully neglecting to account for money received, or corruptly retaining money found upon a prisoner; grossly indecorous conduct, such as sitting as a justice while drunk, or getting drunk during time of service as a grand juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>Chester [v. State], </em>32 Md.App. [593,] 606, 363 A.2d 605 [ (1976) ] (citation omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">(Italicized emphasis in original; bolded emphasis added). According to Sgt. Riley, because \u201cthe State\u2019s experts plainly opined that appellant\u2019s act of shooting Kyle was \u2018a tactical error in judgment,\u2019 \u201d then the evidence does not support the State\u2019s contention that Sgt. Riley \u201c \u201cwillfully disregarded\u2019 the standard for using deadly force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We reiterate that, in reviewing a claim for insufficiency of evidence, the standard of review is whether, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Gerald, </em>137 Md.App. at 308, 768 A.2d 140 (citation omitted). The flaw in Sgt. Riley\u2019s argument on appeal is that he focuses on the portion of the State\u2019s experts\u2019 testimonies wherein Sgt. Gleason and Dickerson opined that Sgt. Riley made an \u201cerror in judgment.\u201d Sgt. Riley, however, disregards the portion where both experts stated that he acted unreasonably. For example, Sgt. Gleason went on to testify that Sgt. Riley \u201cused unnecessary force and unreasonable force[,]\u201d while Dickerson stated that \u201cno reasonable person is going to use deadly force in this incident with [the victim\u2019s hands] handcuffed behind his back.\u201d Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have found \u2014 and did, in fact, find \u2014 that Sgt. Riley exercised a willful abuse of his authority and not simply a mere error in judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Thus, for all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Riley\u2019s reasoning rooted in CL \u00a7 4-202 (legislative findings), PS \u00a7 3-201 (defining \"police officer\u201d), Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-101 of the Criminal Procedure Article (same), and COMAR 12.04.01.12(B)(1) (listing \"Annual Police Officer Firearms Training and Qualification Requirements\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-5\">. Although not from this jurisdiction, <em>State v. Lore, </em>197 N.J.Super. 277, 484 A.2d 1259 (App.Div.1984), is instructive. In that case, an on-duty police officer fired a shot at an individual whom he was attempting to arrest, while the individual was fleeing. <em>Id. </em>at 1261. In affirming the officer\u2019s convictions for simple assault and misconduct in office, the Superior Court of New Jersey stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">It is undisputed that defendant came upon the scene of a fight or scuffle and attempted to arrest Molowitz. The duties of a public servant, such as a police officer, are those which are cast by law upon that public servant or those which are inherent in and naturally arise from the nature of the office. It is also clear that a police officer has the responsibility of investigating and arresting suspected violators of the law. He is permitted, however, to use only such force as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the arrest. We, therefore, have no doubt that defendant was engaged in an official function of his office as a police officer when he arrested Molowitz. The jury found that in the course of effectuating that arrest, defendant used excessive force injuring Molowitz which constituted a simple assault upon Molowitz. The assault therefore became \"an act relating to his office\u201d which was committed \"with purpose ... to injure\" Molowitz and that assault constituted \"an unauthorized exercise of his official functions.\u201d The use of excessive force while arresting Molowitz also means that defendant performed an official function in \"an unauthorized manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1262 (citations omitted). Comparably, in the case before us, the jury found Sgt. Riley guilty of second-degree assault. Thus, the assault became an act \"by a public officer in the exercise of the duties of his office\u201d which was \"corrupt,\u201d and that assault constituted an \"oppres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>sive and willful abuse of authority.\u201d <em>See Leopold, </em>216 Md.App. at 604-05, 88 A.3d 860.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
