California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2484, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">This case presents a Fourth Amendment issue of first impression in this State: whether a cell phone \u2014 a piece of technology so ubiquitous as to be on the person of practically every citizen \u2014 may be transformed into a real-time tracking device by the government without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">On the evening of May 5, 2014, the Baltimore City Police Department (BPD) used an active cell site simulator, without a warrant, to locate Appellee Kerron Andrews who was wanted on charges of attempted murder. The cell site simulator, known under the brand name \u201cHailstorm,\u201d forced Andrews\u2019s cell phone into transmitting signals that allowed the police to track it to a precise location inside a residence located at 5032 Clifton Avenue in Baltimore City. The officers found Andrews sitting on the couch in the living room and arrested him pursuant to a valid arrest warrant. The cell phone was in his pants pocket. After obtaining a warrant to search the residence, the police found a gun in the cushions of the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Andrews successfully argued that the warrantless use of the Hailstorm device was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court suppressed all evidence obtained by the police from the residence as fruit of the poisonous tree. The State, pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2013 RepLVol., 2015 Supp.), Courts and Judicial Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), \u00a7 12 \u2014 302(c)(4), now appeals the court\u2019s decision to suppress that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The specific questions before us, as framed by the State, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">1) Did the motions court err in finding that the use of a cellular tracking device to locate Andrews\u2019s phone violated the Fourth Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">2) Did the motions court err in finding that Andrews did not have to show standing before challenging the search of the home where he was arrested?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">3) Did the motions court err in finding that the search warrant for the home where Andrews was located was invalid?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">4) Did the motions court err in excluding the items recovered in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">We conclude that people have a reasonable expectation that their cell phones will not be used as real-time tracking devices by law enforcement, and \u2014 recognizing that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not simply areas \u2014 that people have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in real-time cell phone location information. Thus, we hold that the use of a cell site simulator requires a valid search warrant, or an order satisfying the constitutional requisites of a warrant, unless an established exception to the warrant requirement applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">We hold that BPD\u2019s use of Hailstorm was not supported by a warrant or an order requiring a showing of probable cause and reasonable limitations on the scope and manner of the search. Once the constitutionally tainted information, obtained through the use of Hailstorm, was excised from the subsequently issued search warrant for 5032 Clifton Avenue, what remained was insufficient to establish probable cause for a search of that residence. Because the antecedent Fourth Amendment violation by police provided the only information relied upon to establish probable cause in their warrant application, those same officers cannot find shelter in the good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>exception, and the evidence seized in that search withers as fruit of the poisoned tree. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Andrews was positively identified via photographic array as the person who shot three people on April 27, 2014, as they were attempting to purchase drugs on the 4900 block of Stafford Street in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was charged with attempted first-degree murder and attendant offenses in connection with the shooting, and a warrant for his arrest was issued on May 2, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Pen Register and Trap &amp; Trace Order</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Unable to locate Andrews, Detective Michael Spinnato of the BPD confirmed Andrews\u2019s cell phone number through a confidential informant, and then submitted an application in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a pen register/trap &amp; trace order for Andrews\u2019s cell phone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Det. Spinnato requested authorization for the \u201cinstallation and use of device known as a \u201cPen Register\\Trap &amp; Trace and Cellular Tracking Device to include cell site information, call detail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>without geographical limits, which registers telephone numbers dialed or pulsed from or to the telephone(s) having the number(s).... \u201d The application stated that Andrews was aware of the arrest warrant, and that to hide from police</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqQ\">suspects will contact family, girlfriends, and other acquaintances to assist in their day to day covert affairs. Detective Spinnato would like to track/monitor Mr. Andrews\u2019[s] cell phone activity to further the investigation an [sic] assist in Mr. Andrews\u2019[s] apprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Your Applicant hereby certifies that the information likely to be obtained concerning the aforesaid individual\u2019s location will be obtained by learning the numbers, locations and subscribers of the telephone number(s) being dialed or pulsed from or to the aforesaid telephone and that such information is relevant to the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On May 5, 2014, Det. Spinnato\u2019s application was approved in a signed order stating, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">[T]he Court finds that probable cause exists and that the applicant has certified that the information likely to be obtained by the use of the above listed device(s) is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation, To wit: Attempted Murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">(Emphasis in original). And, as requested in the application, the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">ORDERED, pursuant to Section 10-4B-04 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article ... [Applicants] are authorized to use for a period of sixty (60) days from the date of installation, a Pen Register \\ Trap &amp; Trace and Cellular Tracking Device to include cell site information, call detail, without geographical limits ...</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">ORDERED, ... [t]he Agencies are <em>authorized to employ surreptitious or duplication of facilities, technical devices </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>or equipment to accomplish the installation and use of a Pen Register </em>\\ <em>Trap &amp; Trace and Cellular Tracking Device, </em>unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference to the service of subscriber(s) of the aforesaid telephone, and <em>shall initiate a signal to determine the location of the subject\u2019s mobile </em>device____</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Cell Phone in a Hailstorm</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">As soon as Det. Spinnato obtained the pen register\\trap &amp; trace order on May 5, he sent a copy to the BPD\u2019s Advanced Technical Team (the \u201cATT\u201d). The ATT then issued a form request to the service provider (Sprint) for the following: subscriber information; historical cell site location information (\u201cCSLI\u201d) for the period from April 5 to May 5, 2014; pen register data for 60 days; and precision GPS data from Andrews\u2019s phone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An additional request followed for \u201cGPS Precise Locations and email.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Later on the same day \u2014 May 5 \u2014 Det. Spinnato began receiving emails from ATT with GPS coordinates for Andrews\u2019s cell phone (within a range of a 200 to 1600 meter radius). Det. Spinnato and officers from the Warrant Apprehension Task Force (\u201cWATF\u201d) proceeded to the general area and waited until they received information from ATT that the cell phone was in the area of 5000 Clifton Avenue, Baltimore City. They proceeded to an area where there were approximately 30 to 35 apartments around a U-shaped sidewalk. Detective John Haley from ATT arrived and, using a cell site simulator known by the brand name \u201cHailstorm,\u201d was able to pinpoint the location of the cell phone as being inside the residence at 5032 Clifton Avenue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Det. Spinnato knocked on the door and, after obtaining the consent of the woman who answered, entered the residence along with several other officers. They found Andrews seated on the couch in the living room with the cell phone in his pants pocket. Det. Spinnato arrested Andrews and secured the location until a search warrant could be obtained. Once they had the warrant, the BPD searched the home and found a gun in the couch cushions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Initial Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Andrews was indicted by a grand jury on May 29, 2014, on numerous charges related to the April 27, 2014 shooting. On July 1, 2014, the Assistant Public Defender representing Andrews filed an \u201comnibus\u201d motion including requests for discovery and the production of documents. The State responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>with an initial disclosure and supplemental disclosure on July 9 and 11, respectively. Those disclosures, however, failed to reveal the method used to locate Andrews on the date of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">On November 3, 2014, defense counsel filed a supplemental discovery request seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]ll evidence indicating how Andrews was located at 5032 Clifton Avenue.\u201d The State\u2019s response to that request, dated January 8, 2015, stated, \u201c[a]t this time the State does not possess information related to the method used to locate [Andrews] at 5032 Clifton Avenue.\u201d However, five months later defense counsel received an email from the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney (\u201cASA\u201d) assigned to the case indicating that it was her understanding that \u201cthe ATT used a stingray to locate[ ] your client via his cell phone,\u201d but she was waiting for \u201cthe paperwork.\u201d The next day, May 7, the ASA also notified defense counsel of exculpatory evidence in the form of a negative photo array that was conducted the previous January.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On May 12, 2015, defense counsel requested that the court dismiss the case based on discovery violations and moved for suppression of evidence, including the gun, phone records, and identification testimony. A few days later, on May 15, the State filed a supplemental disclosure, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">WATF did not have the Clifton Ave address as a possible location until ATT provided that information. Det. Spinnato recalls that he was in touch with Det. Haley from ATT. ATT was provided that information from Sprint in the form of GPS coordinates, Det. Spinnato received the same information either from Sprint directly, or forwarded from ATT. Det. Spinnato provided ATT with the phone number associated to Defendant from the shooting investigation and, [redacted in original]-Det. Spinnato recalls that ATT gave Det. Spinnato the Clifton Ave address in the afternoon/early evening on May 5, 2014____</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The State\u2019s supplemental disclosure also identified a second negative photo array conducted on May 4, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Andrews\u2019s initial motions were heard in the circuit court on May 12, 21, and June 4, 2015. At the conclusion of the hearing on June 4, the circuit court found that one of the lead investigators intentionally withheld exculpatory evidence \u2014 including both negative photo arrays. As a result, the circuit court partially granted the pending defense motion for sanctions and excluded that detective\u2019s testimony from trial. The court declined to dismiss the case and denied the motion to exclude the gun and cell phone on the basis of the State\u2019s withholding of discoverable materials. However, as a consequence of the State\u2019s failure to timely disclose information concerning Hailstorm surveillance technology that was used by the BPD, the Court granted the defense additional time to file a motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Andrews filed a Motion to Suppress \u2014 over 50 pages including exhibits \u2014 on June 30, 2015, in which he challenged the BPD\u2019s surreptitious use of the Hailstorm cell site simulator to search Andrews\u2019s phone, without a warrant, under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Andrews moved to suppress all evidence obtained from 5032 Clifton Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">During the ensuing hearing on the motion to suppress, held August 20, 2015, the State suggested, and the defense agreed, that the circuit court rely on the transcripts and exhibits from the earlier motions hearings for an understanding of the function of the Hailstorm device and its use by the BPD: [STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... The exact testimony that we\u2019re going to hear about with regard to the Fourth Amendment issue Counsel heard as it related to the discovery issue because the discovery issue bled into the Fourth Amendment issue. So there is nothing new. There is nothing \u2014 Counsel\u2019s aware that the equipment is called Hailstorm not Stingray because of the testimony that Counsel heard and extracted from the detective as it relates to this very case. So there simply is, there is nothing new. We\u2019re at the exact same issue that we were two months ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>THE COURT: So do we even need, do you need to call the witness or can I just rely on the transcript?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: It would seem to me to rely on the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">THE COURT: ... So the State is indicating that the testimony that the State would present today is the same testimony that was presented\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">THE COURT: \u2014there.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">THE COURT: And that\u2019s in the transcript, and the Court can just rely on the transcript to rule on your motion.</p>\n<p id=\"ACI\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">THE COURT: You\u2019re fine with that?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yep.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">The court took a recess for several hours to review the motions and transcripts. The following excerpts from the June 4th hearing, entered as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1C, pertain to the function of the cell site simulator:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: What happened in this case was, Detective Sp[innato] from our WATF, which is the Warrant Apprehension Unit, apparently interviewed somebody \u2014 got a phone number. He then responds down here to the Circuit Court ... and gets a Court Order signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">He then sends the Court order down to our office, depending on what the carrier is, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, AT &amp; T. We then send it to them. I ask for subscriber information, call-detail records.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">They provide us with GPS locations, in this case. And once we get all the information, then we have equipment that we can go out and locate cell phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. When you say, we have equipment that we can locate cell phones, you\u2019re talking about the Stingray equipment, is that what was used in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yeah, it\u2019s called the Hailstorm. It used to be \u2014 Stingray is kind of first generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Tell me what the Hailstorm does.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: What we get from the phone company is the subscriber information. So, when we get the subscriber information, it has a [sic] identifier on there, if you will, a serial number. We put that into the Hailstorm equipment. And the Hailstorm equipment acts like a cell tower. So, we go into a certain area, and basically, the equipment is looking for that particular identifier, that serial number.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. And so, if a person is inside of a home, that equipment peers over the wall of the home, to see if that cell phone is behind the wall of that house, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And it sends an electronic transmission through the wall of that house, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you get a separate search warrant for that search into the home?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: You\u2019d have to talk to Detective Spinnato about that. Because he\u2019s the one that got the Court Order signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you do the search? You conducted the equipment in this \u2014 you operated\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014the equipment?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Tell me all of the information the Hailstorm can retrieve from a phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>[DETECTIVE HALEY]: It\u2019s going to retrieve, like I said before, the serial number of the phone, depending on what kind of phone it is. It\u2019s going to \u2014 there\u2019s [sic] different identifiers. Like for Sprint, in this case, it\u2019s called the MSID. And that\u2019s like a ten-digit \u2014 like a ten-digit number. So, it\u2019s retrieving that. And there\u2019s also the electronic serial number. It\u2019s retrieving that. And that\u2019s really it.</p>\n<p id=\"APu\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Can you capture the telephone calls as they\u2019re being made?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And how do you know where the phone \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t capture any data on the phone?</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Are you sure?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, how do you get information about where the phone is on the machine?</p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Because when it captures that identifier that you put into the machine or the equipment, it then tells you \u2014 it looks like a clock on the equipment. And it tells you where the signal\u2019s coming from, like 12, 1, 2, 3 o\u2019clock (indicating). And it will give you like a reading. Like if it says 1:00 at like an 80, well, then you know that you\u2019re kind of close to it. But if it says 1:00 at like a 40, then you know that you\u2019re probably within, I don\u2019t know, probably, you know, 20 yards of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The person doesn\u2019t have to be using their phone for you to get that information, do they?</p>\n<p id=\"AIY\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Actually, if they\u2019re on their phone, then they\u2019re already connected to \u2014 in this case, the Sprint network. And we\u2019re not going to be able to pull them off of that until they\u2019re \u2014 until they hang \u2014 until they hang the call up.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, they hang the call up. And the phone can be in their pocket, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And then you\u2019re reaching in to grab an electronic signal about where that phone is? It\u2019s not pinging, in other words, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">MR. HALEY: Like I said, our equipment acts like a cell tower. So, it draws the phone to our equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"An2\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But you just said, if the person\u2019s on the phone, your equipment won\u2019t work, right?</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, it doesn\u2019t act like a cell tower, because you can find the phone only when they are not on the phone, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Well, I would say it does act like a cell tower, because the only time that you\u2019re going to connect \u2014 the only time that you\u2019re going to connect to the network, or to a tower is when you go to try to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQE\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But you\u2019re connecting to where the phone is, when they\u2019re not on the phone, didn\u2019t you just say that</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Maybe I\u2019m getting confused, or I\u2019m not understanding what you\u2019re asking me.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My question to you was, for example, I have my phone in my pocket. And I\u2019m sitting in my house, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And you want to know where I am, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When I am not on my phone, you will drive by my house, and you will get a signal from my phone indicating where I am, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If I am using the phone, you won\u2019t get that signal, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, the phone cannot be in use. You are searching for my phone as you\u2019re driving through my neighborhood, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And in order to get to my phone, you are sending an electronic signal into my house, right?</p>\n<p id=\"ABT\">[DETECTIVE HALEY]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">When the hearing resumed, the court made several preliminary findings, and invited counsel to respond. In regard to the pen register/trap &amp; trace order, the court observed:</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">I don\u2019t find that Judge Williams\u2019 order is invalid as a pen register or trap and trace, but I do find that the order does not authorize the use of Hailstorm and I ... invite the State to tell me otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">So this is very different from an order authorizing, for example, GPS or cell site information, because that is information that\u2019s generated by the phone. And my understanding of this equipment is essentially that it\u2019s forcing the .phone to emit information, or its taking information from the phone that the phone is not sort of on its own generating at the time which is very different.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">On the issue of whether Andrews\u2019s arrest was lawful, the parties acknowledged that a valid warrant was outstanding for his arrest. However, the court questioned whether, as argued by defense counsel, Andrews\u2019s presence at 5032 Clifton Avenue \u201cor the warrant they got as a result of him being there is fruit of the poisonous tree because there was a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights by [Det. Haley] using the Hailstorm on this phone to locate him at that residence in the first place.\u201d Looking then to the application for the warrant to search 5032 Clifton Avenue, the court noted that there was no independent corroboration for the warrant because, \u201call it says he was located at this address and so we want to search this address. I mean that\u2019s really all it says.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>After hearing argument, the circuit court found that \u201cthe use of the Hailstorm violates the Defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights,\u201d and \u201cany information generated from the use of the Hailstorm [must] be suppressed.\u201d The court continued on the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">And so just so that I\u2019m clear, it means that the jury cannot hear any testimony or evidence about information obtained from the Hailstorm, obtained through the Hailstorm device. And just so that I\u2019m clear, it\u2019s my understanding that the Hailstorm device is what told the police that the Defendant was at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">And so that includes any testimony or evidence then that the Defendant was at that location, if that\u2019s what \u2014 because that\u2019s what the Hailstorm told the police. And so the jury would be prohibited from hearing evidence or testimony of that. It does not invalidate the arrest or the search [incident to] the arrest with the phone that\u2019s in his pocket.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Now anything that came off the phone, again if it came through the Hailstorm device it is suppressed. There can be no evidence or testimony about it. And then again, any police knowledge that the Defendant was at that location again also suppressed, so the jury would not be able to hear any evidence or testimony of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">So then that leaves us with the fruit of the poisonous tree argument for the search and seizure warrant. I reviewed the warrant and it literally says the Defendant was in there so now we need a warrant. And information generated from the use of the Hailstorm be suppressed, that\u2019s all that it is. And so I analyze this different, a little bit different from a normal sort of motion to suppress a search and seizure warrant or even <em>Franks </em>in terms of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>I don\u2019t \u2014 I understand the State\u2019s argument in terms of standing and this not being his residence, and the Defense\u2019s argument that he was at a minimum an overnight guest and has some reasonable expectation of privacy. I don\u2019t think I need to reach those issues because the warrant is really just fruit of the poisonous tree of the illegally obtained information about the Defendant\u2019s location. That\u2019s what it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">And so I am granting the suppression of that for that very reason. And so that the record is clear \u2014 and I know that the State is asking to take an appeal, the record is clear. The ruling of the Court is that the government violated the Defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by essentially using the Hailstorm to locate him at that residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The State noticed its appeal on September 3, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Before turning to the merits, we must address Andrews\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was defective, and therefore, not filed within the time prescribed by Rule 8-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The State filed its notice of appeal on September 3, 2015; however, the signed certificate of service \u2014 indicating that a copy of the notice was \u201cmailed first \u2014 class, postage prepaid\u201d on that same day \u2014 failed to list the party that was served. Andrews acknowledges that a copy of the notice was delivered to the Office of the Public Defender on September 4, 2015. Nevertheless, Andrews argues that the State\u2019s notice did not comply with the certificate of service requirements of Maryland Rule 1-323, and that the clerk should not have accepted the filing. Consequently, according to Andrews, no valid notice of appeal was filed in this case. The State concedes that the failure to name the party to be served was a defect in the certificate of service, but maintains the clerk was required to accept the filing because the certificate complied with the literal requirements of Rule 1-323. The State urges that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>would be improper to dismiss the appeal because there is no dispute that the opposing party was served in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Maryland Rule 1-323 directs that the court clerk may not accept for filing a pleading or other paper requiring service, unless it is accompanied by \u201can admission or waiver of service or a signed certificate showing the date and manner of making service.\u201d In <em>Director of Finance of Baltimore City v. Harris, </em>this Court addressed whether a certificate of service that failed to identify all the persons upon whom service was required should have been rejected for filing by the court clerk. 90 Md.App. 506, 513-14, 602 A.2d 191 (1992). Looking to the 1984 revision of the Maryland Rules that produced the current Rule 1-323, this Court observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Under the old Rule, the clerk may have had some obligation to determine whether the certificate actually showed service on the \u201copposite party.\u201d But, as noted, that obligation, if ever did exist, has been eliminated____The obligation of the clerk under the current Rule is simply to assure that there is, in fact, an admission, a waiver, or a certificate showing the date and manner of service. If such a certificate attached to the paper, the clerk must file the paper, leaving it then to the parties or the court to deal with any deficiency.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>More recently, in <em>Lovero v. Da Silva, </em>this Court clarified that, by mandating that proof of service (or a waiver of service) appear on each pleading or paper, \u201cRule 1-323 assures the court ... that each party has been duly notified before action is taken by the court in response to or as a result of the subject pleading or paper.\u201d 200 Md.App. 433, 446, 28 A.3d 43 (2011). We determined that Lovero\u2019s notice of appeal should have been rejected by the clerk, explaining that</p>\n<p id=\"AjB\">[wjhere, as in the instant case, the notice of appeal contains no proof of service whatsoever, we have no basis upon which to conclude that the notice of appeal was served on the opposing party or parties. Indeed, it is undisputed here that the Notice of Appeal was never served on Da Silva.</p>\n<p id=\"AWO\"><em>Id. </em>at 449, 28 A.3d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In the present case, there is no dispute that the notice was served on defense counsel. Indeed, the State made it clear at the August 20 hearing that it would be filing an appeal as reflected in the court\u2019s ruling; \u201cand so that the record is clear \u2014 and I know that the State is asking to take an appeal, the record is clear.\u201d It is also clear now that, although the omission in the certificate of service is a defect, the certificate met the literal requirements of Rule 1-323 \u2014 it provided the date and manner of service. Where there is no evidence that Andrews was prejudiced or that the course of the appeal was delayed by a defect, \u201cit is the practice of this Court to decide appeals on the merits rather than on technicalities.\u201d <em>Bond v. Slavin, </em>157 Md.App. 340, 352-53, 851 A.2d 598 (2004). <em>Cf. Williams v. Hofmann Balancing Techniques, Ltd., </em>139 Md. App. 339, 356-57, 776 A.2d 4 (2001) (holding that the appellant\u2019s failure to identify one of the appellees on his notice of appeal did not deprive this Court of jurisdiction). To be sure, the Court of Appeals has observed that \u201c[o]ur cases, and those of the Court of Special Appeals, have generally been quite liberal in construing timely orders for appeal.\u201d <em>Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. 364, 386, 550 A.2d 959 (1988); <em>see also Lovero, </em>200 Md.App. at 450-51 n. 8, 28 A.3d 43 (and the cases cited therein) (recognizing that where a challenged notice of appeal was timely filed the courts of Maryland construe the notice in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>favor of deciding the appeal on the merits).

Effects of the Nondisclosure Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Before we examine the reasonableness of the State\u2019s intrusion <em>in context, </em>we address the nondisclosure agreement entered into between the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in early August 2011 as a condition of BPD\u2019s purchase of certain \u201cwireless collection equipment/technology manufactured by Harris [Corporation].\u201d The nondisclosure agreement provided, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">[T]o ensure that [ ] wireless collection equipment/technology continues to be available for use by the law enforcement community, the equipment/technology and any information related to its functions, operation, and use shall be protected from potential compromise by precluding disclosure of this information to the public in any manner including b[ut] not limited to: in press release, in court documents, during judicial hearings, or during other public forums or proceedings. Accordingly, the Baltimore City Police Department agrees to the following conditions in connection with its purchase and use of the Harris Corporation equipment/technology:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">5. The Baltimore City Police Department and Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City shall not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, use or provide any information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology, its associated software, operating manuals, and any related documentation (including its technical/engineering description(s) and capabilities) beyond the evidentiary results obtained through the use the equipment/technology including, but not limited to, during pre-trial matters, in search warrants and related affidavits, in discovery, in response to court ordered disclosure, in other affidavits, in grand jury hearings, in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, rebuttal, or on appeal, or in testimony in any phase of civil or criminal trial, without the prior written approval of the FBI....</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">(Emphasis added). The agreement directs that in the event of a Freedom of Information Act request, or a court order directing disclosure of information regarding Harris Corporation equipment or technology, the FBI must be notified immediately to allow them time to intervene \u201cand potentially] compromise.\u201d If necessary \u201cthe Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore will, at the request of the FBI, seek dismissal of the case in lieu of using or providing, or allowing others to provide, any information concerning the Harris Corporation wireless collection equipment/technology[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We observe that such an extensive prohibition on disclosure of information to the court \u2014 from special order and/or warrant application through appellate review \u2014 prevents the court from exercising its fundamental duties under the Constitution. To undertake the Fourth Amendment analysis and ascertain \u201cthe reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security,\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), it is self-evident that the court must understand why and <em>how </em>the search is to be conducted. The reasonableness of a search or seizure depends \u201c \u2018on a balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u2019\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 109, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>L.Ed.2d 607 (1975)). The analytical framework requires analysis of the functionality of the surveillance device and the range of information potentially revealed by its use. A nondisclosure agreement that prevents law enforcement from providing details sufficient to assure the court that a novel method of conducting a search is a reasonable intrusion made in a proper manner and \u201cjustified by the circumstances,\u201d obstructs the court\u2019s ability to make the necessary constitutional appraisal. <em>Cf. King, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1970 (\u201cEven if a warrant is not required, a search is not beyond Fourth Amendment scrutiny; for it must be reasonable in its scope and manner of execution. Urgent government interests are not a license for indiscriminate police behavior.\u201d). In <em>West v. State, </em>this Court stated that \u201cto assure that the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is upheld, police officers must provide details within affidavits when attempting to acquire search warrants, even if such information would seem to the police officer of trivial consequence at the time.\u201d 137 Md.App. 314, 331, 768 A.2d 150 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As discussed further in Section III <em>infra, </em>it appears that as a consequence of the nondisclosure agreement, rather than apply for a warrant, prosecutors and police obtained an order under the Maryland pen register statute that failed to provide the necessary information upon which the court could make the constitutional assessments mandated in this case. The BPD certified to the court that pursuant to the order \u201cthe information likely to be obtained concerning the aforesaid individual\u2019s location will be obtained by learning the numbers, locations and subscribers of the telephone number(s) being dialed or pulsed from or to the aforesaid telephone----\u201d However, the suppression court, having the benefit of Det. Haley\u2019s testimony (reproduced above), learned that the BPD actually employed the Hailstorm device, which is capable of obtaining active real-time location information \u2014 far different from a pen register (a device or process that records and decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument) or track and trace device (a device or process that captures the incoming electronic or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>other impulses that identify the originating number). <em>See </em>fn.2 <em>swpra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">We perceive the State\u2019s actions in this case to protect the Hailstorm technology, driven by a nondisclosure agreement to which it bound itself, as detrimental to its position and inimical to the constitutional principles we revere.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">b. What Constitutes a \u201cSearch\u201d \u2014 Level of Intrusion and Expectation of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The State argues that the use of a cell site simulator does not constitute a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. The State maintains that the circuit court\u2019s decision \u201cwas based upon both factually unreasonable conclusions about how the cell site simulator worked in this case, and legally incorrect determinations about what constitutes a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d The State acknowledges that the factual bases for the circuit court\u2019s rulings are found in the June 4, 2015 testimony of Det. Haley. However, the State argues that Det. Haley\u2019s testimony \u201cwas necessarily rather summary,\u201d and does not support the factual conclusions of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">According to the State, the cell site simulator \u201cacts like a cell tower, and waits to receive a signal bearing the target IMSI\u201d [International Mobil Subscriber Identity]. The State maintains that, properly construed, Det. Haley\u2019s testimony reveals that \u201cthe process of a cell phone sending its identifying information to a cell tower was indistinguishable from the process of a cell phone sending its identifying information to a cell site simulator.\u201d The State asserts that the Hailstorm device \u201cmerely reads the ID number regularly transmitted by activated cell phones as part of their ordinary use\u201d and \u201c[w]hen the device detects a signal from the target phone, it notifies the operator the direction of the signal and the relative strength, allowing the operator to estimate the probable location of the phone.\u201d Therefore, the State argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>no reasonable expectation of privacy existed in the information obtained by the Hailstorm device and no intrusion or \u201csearch\u201d occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Andrews countercharges that there was ample, explicit support in the record for the circuit court\u2019s finding that the Hailstorm device operated by emitting a signal \u201cthrough the wall of a house\u201d and \u201cinto the phone\u201d triggering the phone to respond to the device. Andrews argues that, through the use of an \u201cactive cellular surveillance device,\u201d the State violated his reasonable expectation of privacy in the personal information contained and generated by his cell phone, without which the government would not have been able to discover his location inside the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Presumably because of the nondisclosure agreement discussed above, the State provided limited information regarding the function and use of the Hailstorm device. And presumably, the State would have limited itself in this manner regardless of whether it relied on testimony from the prior hearing or produced live testimony before the suppression court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Notwithstanding this, it is clear from Det. Haley\u2019s testimony that \u201cthe Hailstorm equipment acts like a cell tower,\u201d but, unlike a cell tower awaiting incoming signals, the Hailstorm is an active device that can send an electronic signal through the wall of a house and \u201cdraw[ ] the phone to [the] equipment.\u201d Based on the direction and strength of the signal the Hailstorm receives from a cell phone in response, law enforcement can pinpoint the real-time location of a cell phone (and likely the person to whom it belongs) within less than 20 yards.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">These points from Det. Haley\u2019s testimony regarding the function of the Hailstorm device are consistent with what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>other courts and legal scholars have been able to discern about the device. Hailstorm, along with the earlier-model cell site simulator known as \u201cStingRay,\u201d to which Det. Haley referred, are far from discrete, limited surveillance tools. Rather, as described in a recent article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology cited by Appellee and the <em>amici:</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">This technology, commonly called the StingRay, the most well-known brand name of a family of surveillance devices known more generically as \u201cIMSI catchers,\u201d is used by law enforcement agencies to obtain, directly and in real time, unique device identifiers and detailed location information of cellular phones \u2014 data that it would otherwise be unable to obtain without the assistance of a wireless carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">By impersonating a cellular network base station, a StingRay \u2014 a surveillance device that can be carried by hand, installed in a vehicle, or even mounted on a drone \u2014 tricks all nearby phones and other mobile devices into identifying themselves (by revealing their unique serial numbers) just as they would register with genuine base stations in the immediate vicinity. As each phone in the area identifies itself, the StingRay can determine the location from which the signal came.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Stephanie K.

If the stingray is within the cell phone\u2019s signal range, the stingray measures signals from the phone, and based on the cell phone\u2019s signal strength, the stingray can provide an initial general location of the phone. By collecting the cell phone\u2019s signals from several locations, the stingray can develop the location of the phone quite precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"><em>State v.

We cannot say that the factual findings of the circuit court, in this case, were erroneous; they are firmly grounded in the testimony before that court, and the State has provided no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">In determining then whether a Fourth Amendment \u201csearch\u201d occurred, we apply the court\u2019s factual findings to the test pronounced in <em>Katz, supra. </em>Rather than limit the constitutional appraisal to a trespass analysis,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the <em>Katz </em>test requires a two-fold showing: \u201cfirst that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u2018reasonable.\u2019\u201d 389 U.S. at 361, 88 S.Ct. 507 (Harlan, J., concurring).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even under the more flexible <em>Katz </em>test, however, rapid advancements in technology make ascertaining what constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment ever more challenging.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Charles Katz was charged with transmitting wagering information by telephone in violation of federal law. <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 348, 88 S.Ct. 507. He objected during his trial to the government\u2019s introduction of evidence collected by FBI agents who overheard and recorded his end of telephone conversations from inside a public telephone booth. <em>Id. </em>The agents had placed a recording device on the outside of the phone booth from which Katz placed his calls. <em>Id. </em>The government contended on appeal that their surveillance did not constitute a search prohibited by the Fourth Amendment because Katz was in a public location that was not constitutionally protected and because the technique they employed involved no physical penetration of the telephone booth. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 88 S.Ct. 507. Writing for the majority, Justice Stewart rejected the formulation of the issues by the parties, premised on whether the telephone booth was a \u201cconstitutionally protected area,\u201d and instructed that \u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places ... what [Katz] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 88 S.Ct. 507 (citations omitted). The Court continued, stating that \u201conce it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people \u2014 and not simply \u2018areas\u2019 \u2014 against unreasonable searches and seizures it becomes clear that the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350, 353, 88 S.Ct. 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Almost 20 years after establishing in <em>Katz </em>that an examination of intrusiveness under the Fourth Amendment is not simply measured by physical invasion, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the government\u2019s surreptitious use of a radio transmitter to track the movements of a container to and inside a private residence. <em>United States v. Karo, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 709-10, 104 S.Ct. 3296. The physical installation of the transmitter was not at issue; rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>question before the Court was \u201cwhether the monitoring of a beeper in a private residence, not open to visual surveillance, violates the Fourth Amendment rights of those who have a justifiable interest in the privacy of the residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714, 104 S.Ct. 3296. Although the Court noted that the monitoring of an electronic device is \u201cless intrusive than a full-scale search,\u201d it, nevertheless, reveals information about the interior of the residence that the government \u201ccould not have otherwise obtained without a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 104 S.Ct. 3296. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We cannot accept the Government\u2019s contention that it should be completely free from the constraints of the Fourth Amendment to determine by means of an electronic device, without warrant and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, whether a particular article \u2014 or a person, for that matter \u2014 is in an individual\u2019s home at a particular time. Indiscriminate monitoring of property that has been withdrawn from public view would present far too serious a threat to privacy interests in the home to escape entirely some sort of Fourth Amendment oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 716, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (footnote omitted). Notably, the Court also soundly rejected the government\u2019s contention that it should be able to engage in warrantless monitoring of an electronic device inside a private residence \u201cif there is the requisite justification in the facts for believing that a crime is being or will be committed and that monitoring the beeper wherever it goes is likely to produce evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (emphasis added). The Court recognized limited exceptions to the general rule, such as in the case of exigency, but explained why in its view the government exaggerated the difficulties associated with obtaining a warrant:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The Government argues that the traditional justifications for the warrant requirement are inapplicable in beeper cases, but to a large extent that argument is based upon the contention, rejected above, that the beeper constitutes only a minuscule intrusion on protected privacy interests. The primary reason for the warrant requirement is to interpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>a \u2018neutral and detached magistrate\u2019 between the citizen and \u2018officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Government contends that it would be impossible to describe the \u2018place\u2019 to be searched, because the location of the place is precisely what is sought to be discovered through the search. [ ] However true that may be, it will still be possible to describe the object into which the beeper is to be placed, the circumstances that led agents to wish to install the beeper, and the length of time for which beeper surveillance is requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (citing <em>Johnson v. United, States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In <em>Kyllo, supra, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a Fourth Amendment search had occurred when the government used a thermal imaging device to detect infrared radiation inside a home. 533 U.S. at 29-30, 121 S.Ct. 2038. Federal agents, suspecting that Danny Kyllo was growing marijuana inside his home, were able to confirm areas of heat coming from high intensity lamps used to grow marijuana plants indoors. <em>Id. </em>At the threshold of his analysis, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">It would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the Fourth Amendment has been entirely unaffected by the advance of technology.... The question we confront today is what limits there are upon this power of technology to shrink the realm <em>of </em>guaranteed privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 33-34, 121 S.Ct. 2038. The Court then noted that, although the <em>Katz </em>test \u2014 \u201cwhether the individual has an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable\u201d \u2014 may be difficult to apply to some locations, such as telephone booths and automobiles \u2014 the expectation of privacy in the home had \u201croots deep in the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 121 S.Ct. 2038.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In support of the use of its thermal imaging technology, the government in <em>Kyllo </em>argued that there was no \u201csearch\u201d because the device detected \u201c \u2018only heat radiating from the external surface of the house[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 121 S.Ct. 2038. The Supreme Court, however, cast aside this contention as the kind of mechanical interpretation rejected in <em>Katz </em>and stated, \u201cso also a powerful directional microphone picks up only sound emanating from a house \u2014 and a satellite capable of scanning from many miles away would pick up only visible light emanating from a house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather than abandon <em>Katz </em>and take such a mechanical approach, the Court sought to adopt a rule \u201ctak[ing] account of more sophisticated [surveillance] systems that are already in use or in development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the Court held that \u201c[w]here ... the Government uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore the details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a \u2018search\u2019 and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 121 S.Ct. 2038. Furthermore, the Court repeated the caveat of <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>that the \u201cprotection of the home has never been tied to the measurement of the quality or quantity of information obtained\u201d for any invasion of the home, \u201c \u2018by even a fraction of an inch\u2019 [is] too much.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (quoting <em>Silverman v. U.S., </em>365 U.S. 505, 512, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">From <em>Katz </em>to <em>Kyllo, </em>the Supreme Court has firmly held that use of surveillance technology not in general public use to obtain information about the interior of a home, not otherwise available without trespass, is a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. These decisions resolved to protect an \u201cexpectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d After <em>Kyllo, </em>however, the question remained whether electronic tracking or surveillance outside the home could constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed the use of a GPS tracking device affixed to the undercarriage of a vehicle to track the movements of the defendant over a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>of 28 days. \u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 945, 948, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012). The Court unanimously affirmed the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s holding that the electronic location surveillance over a period of 28 days was a search and that admission of evidence obtained by the warrantless use of the GPS device violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court was unable, however, to reach full agreement as to the basis for its decision. <em>See id. </em>at 953 (majority opinion); 954 (Sotomayor, J., concurring); 967 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment). Justice Scalia\u2019s majority opinion found that a search occurred under the traditional, <em>pre-Katz </em>\u201ctrespass\u201d rationale, but acknowledged that \u201c[situations involving merely the transmission of electronic signals without trespass would <em>remain </em>subject to <em>Katz </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 953 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Agreeing with Justice Brennan\u2019s concurrence in <em>Knotts v. United States, </em>Justice Scalia expounded that \u201c \u2018when the Government <em>does </em>engage in physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information, that intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 951 (quoting <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 286, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983)). When law enforcement placed the GPS tracking system on Jones\u2019s vehicle, without a warrant, the government physically invaded a constitutionally protected area, <em>id. </em>at 949, 952, and factors beyond trespass need not be considered to find there was a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Id. </em>at 953-54. Justice Scalia explained that the common-law trespass test was essentially a minimum test and that the <em>Katz </em>test was <em>\u201cadded to, </em>not <em>substituted for, </em>the common-law trespassory test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Justice Sotomayor revisited the <em>Katz </em>analysis in her concurring opinion, stating that, \u201ceven in the absence of a trespass, \u2018a Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 954-55 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (citations omitted). Recognizing that \u201c[i]n cases of electronic or other novel modes of surveillance that do not depend upon a physical invasion on property, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>opinion\u2019s trespassory test may provide little guidance[,]\u201d Justice Sotomayor opined that the unique attributes of GPS location surveillance will require careful application of the <em>Katz </em>analysis. <em>Id. </em>She urged the Court to update its understanding of peoples\u2019 expectations of privacy in the information age:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\u2019s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations. <em>See, e.g., People v. Weaver, </em>12 N.Y.3d 433, 441-442, 882 N.Y.S.2d 357, 909 N.E.2d 1195, 1199 (2009) (\u201cDisclosed in [GPS] data ... will be trips the indisputably private nature of which takes little imagination to conjure: trips to the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and on and on\u201d). The Government can store such records and efficiently mine them for information years into the future. <em>[United States v.] Pineda-Moreno, </em>617 F.3d [1120,] 1124 [ (9th Cir.2010) ] (opinion of Kozinski, C.J.). And because GPS monitoring is cheap in comparison to conventional surveillance techniques and, by design, proceeds surreptitiously, it evades the ordinary checks that constrain abusive law enforcement practices: \u201climited police resources and community hostility.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Lidster, </em>540 U.S. 419, 426, 124 S.Ct. 885, 157 L.Ed.2d 843 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Awareness that the Government may be watching chills associational and expressive freedoms. And the Government\u2019s unrestrained power to assemble data that reveal private aspects of identity is susceptible to abuse. The net result is that GPS monitoring \u2014 by making available at a relatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate information about any person whom the Government, in its unfettered discretion, chooses to track \u2014 may \u201calter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to democratic society.\u201d <em>United States v. Cuevas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Perez, </em>640 F.3d 272, 285 (C.A.7 2011) (Flaum, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">I would take these attributes of GPS monitoring into account when considering the existence of a reasonable societal expectation of privacy in the sum of one\u2019s public movements. I would ask whether people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on. I do not regard as dispositive the fact that the Government might obtain the fruits of GPS monitoring through lawful conventional surveillance techniques. See <em>Kyllo, </em>533 U.S. at 35, n. 2, 121 S.Ct. 2038; <em>ante, </em>at 954 (leaving open the possibility that duplicating traditional surveillance \u201cthrough electronic means, -without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy\u201d). I would also consider the appropriateness of entrusting to the Executive, in the absence of any oversight from a coordinate branch, a tool so amenable to misuse, especially in light of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s goal to curb arbitrary exercises of police power to and prevent \u201ca too permeating police surveillance,\u201d <em>United States v. Di Re, </em>332 U.S. 581, 595, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 955-56 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Justice Alito, concurring only in the judgment, disagreed with the majority\u2019s reliance on a trespassory theory. <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 958. Instead, Justice Alito found the appropriate inquiry to be \u201cwhether respondent\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy were violated by the long-term monitoring of the movements of the vehicle he drove.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Alito stated that the majority\u2019s reasoning \u201cdisregarded] what is really important (the <em>use </em>of a GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking)\u201d and \u201cwill present particularly vexing problems in cases involving surveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as opposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>From the above precedent, we glean two broad principles regarding the Fourth Amendment analysis of surveillance technology. First, where surveillance technology is used without a warrant to obtain information about the contents of a home, not otherwise discernable without physical intrusion, there has been an unlawful search. <em>See Kyllo, </em>533 U.S. at 34-35, 121 S.Ct. 2038. Second, where the government has engaged in surveillance using \u201celectronic signals -without trespass[,]\u201d the intrusion will <em>\u201cremain </em>subject to <em>Katz </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 953 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that cell phones present novel privacy concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In <em>Riley, supra, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that a search of the information contained in a cell phone is subject to the warrant requirement regardless of its location. 134 S.Ct. at 2489-91. The Court held that even during a search incident to arrest, the government must first obtain a warrant before searching the digital contents of a cell phone found on the person being arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 2485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Chief Justice Roberts described the modern cell phone as much more than a phone:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be kept on an arrestee\u2019s person. The term \u201ccell phone\u201d is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone. They could just as easily be called cameras, video players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">One of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cell phones is their immense storage capacity. Before cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical realities and tended as a general matter to constitute only a narrow intrusion on privacy. Most people cannot lug around every piece of mail they have received for the past several months, every picture they have taken, or every book or article they have read \u2014 nor would they have any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>reason to attempt to do so. And if they did, they would have to drag behind them a trunk of the sort held to require a search warrant in <em>[U.S. v.] Chadwick, supra </em>[433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977) ], rather than a container the size of the cigarette package in <em>[U.S. v.] Robinson </em>/414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) <em>].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 2489.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The State argues that its use of the Hailstorm here should be analogized to <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct. 1081, wherein the Supreme Court upheld law enforcement officers\u2019 use of a radio transmitter to track the movements of a container, by automobile, to a defendant\u2019s home. In <em>Knotts, </em>the Court noted that \u201c[t]he governmental surveillance conducted by means of the beeper in this case amounted principally to the following of an automobile on public streets and highways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 103 S.Ct. 1081. The Court concluded that:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">A person travelling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another. When [the defendant] travelled over the public streets he voluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look the fact that he was travelling over particular roads in a particular direction, the fact of whatever stops he made, and the fact of his final destination when he exited from public roads onto private property.</p>\n<p id=\"Axj\"><em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 103 S.Ct. 1081. Here, the State argues that because Andrews\u2019s cell phone was \u201cconstantly emitting \u2018pings\u2019 giving its location to the nearest cell tower, ... there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in [that] information\u201d under <em>Knotts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Knotts, </em>however, is misplaced. In <em>Karo, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that in <em>Knotts </em>the electronic device \u201ctold the authorities nothing about the interior of Knotts\u2019 cabin.\u201d 468 U.S. at 715, 104 S.Ct. 3296. Rather, the information obtained in <em>Knotts </em>was \u201cvoluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. at 281, 103 S.Ct. 1081), and the subsequent search warrant was also supported by \u201cintermittent visual surveillance\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>cabin, <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. at 279, 103 S.Ct. 1081. As noted in <em>Kyllo, </em>the Supreme Court has long recognized that \u201c[vjisual surveillance [i]s unquestionably lawful because \u2018the eye cannot by the laws of England be guilty of a trespass.\u2019 \u201d 533 U.S. at 31-32, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (quoting <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 628, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886)).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Here, there was no visual surveillance. The mere fact that police <em>could </em>have located Andrews within the residence by following him as he travelled over public thoroughfares does not change the fact that the police did not know where he was, so they could not follow him. Unlike <em>Knotts, </em>the information obtained in this case did reveal at least one critical detail about the residence; i.e., that its contents included Andrews\u2019s cell phone, and therefore, most likely Andrews himself. Further, \u201cpings\u201d from Andrews\u2019s cell phone to the nearest tower were not available \u201cto anyone who wanted to look.\u201d We find the surreptitious conversion of a cell phone into a tracking device and the electronic interception of location data from that cell phone markedly distinct from the combined use of visual surveillance and a \u201cbeeper to signal the presence of [the defendant\u2019s] automobile to the police receiver\u201d to track a vehicle over public roads. <em>See Knotts, </em>460 U.S. at 282, 103 S.Ct. 1081. Put simply, the information obtained by police in this case was not readily available and in the public view as it was in <em>Knotts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Cell site simulators, such as Hailstorm, can locate and track the movements of a cell phone and its user across both public and private spaces. Unchecked, the use of this technology would allow the government to discover the private and personal habits of any user. As Justice Sotomayor predicted in her concurring opinion in <em>Jones, supra, </em>we are compelled to ask \u201cwhether people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on.\u201d 132 S.Ct. at 956 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). We conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>We agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>United States v.

We also accept the circuit court\u2019s finding in this case that \u201cno one expects that their phone information is being sent directly to the police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ment on their apparatus.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Recognizing that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not simply areas, <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 353, 88 S.Ct. 507, we conclude that people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in real-time cell phone location information.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Moreover, because the use of the cell site simulator in this case revealed the location of the phone and Andrews inside a residence, we are presented with the additional concern that an electronic device not in general public use has been used to obtain information about the contents of a home, not otherwise discernable without physical intrusion. <em>See Kyllo, </em>533 U.S. at 34-35, 121 S.Ct. 2038. Under the applicable precedent, this is undoubtedly an intrusion that rises to the level of a Fourth Amendment \u201csearch.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Indeed, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Although we recognize that the use of a cell site simulator to track a phone will not always result in locating the phone within a residence, we agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s observation that \u201cthe government cannot know in advance of obtaining this information how revealing it will be or whether it will detail the cell phone user\u2019s movements in private spaces.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>796 F.3d at 350 (citation omitted). The United States District Court for the District of Maryland articulated the same concern when addressing the government\u2019s use of a particular cell phone as a tracking device to aid in execution of an arrest warrant. The district court stated: Location data from a cell phone is distinguishable from traditional physical surveillance because it enables law enforcement to locate a person entirely divorced from all visual observation. Indeed, this is ostensibly the very characteristic that makes obtaining location data a desirable method of locating the subject of an arrest warrant. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>also means, however, that there is no way to know before receipt of location data whether the phone is physically located in a constitutionally-protected place. In other words, it is impossible for law enforcement agents to determine prior to obtaining real-time location data whether doing so infringes upon the subject\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore constitutes a Fourth Amendment search.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>In re Application of United States for an Order Authorizing Disclosure of Location Info, of a Specified Wireless Tel., </em>849 F.Supp.2d 526, 540 (D.Md.2011) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It would be impractical to fashion a rule prohibiting a warrantless search only retrospectively based on the fact that the search resulted in locating the cell phone inside a home or some other constitutionally protected area. <em>See, e.g., Kyllo, </em>533 U.S. at 38-39, 121 S.Ct. 2038 (declining to adopt a Fourth Amendment standard that would only bar the use of thermal imaging to discern \u201cintimate details\u201d in the home because \u201cno police officer would be able to know <em>in advance </em>whether his through-the-wall surveillance picks up \u2018intimate\u2019 details \u2014 and thus would be unable to know in advance whether it is constitutional.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>cf. Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 718, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (\u201cWe are also unpersuaded by the argument that a warrant should not be required because of the difficulty in satisfying the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d). Such a rule would provide neither guidance nor deterrence, and would do nothing to thwart unconstitutional intrusions. <em>Cf. In re the Application of the United States for an Order (1) Authorizing the Use of a Pen Register and a Trap and Trace Device, </em>396 F.Supp.2d 294, 323 (E.D.N.Y.2005) (\u201cBecause the government cannot demonstrate that cell site tracking could never under any circumstance implicate Fourth Amendment privacy rights, there is no reason to treat cell phone tracking differently from other forms of tracking ... which routinely require probable cause.\u201d (Internal quotations and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We determine that cell phone users have an objectively reasonable expectation that their cell phones will not be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>as real-time tracking devices through the direct and active interference of law enforcement. We hold, therefore, that the use of a cell site simulator, such as Hailstorm, by the government, requires a search warrant based on probable cause and describing with particularity the object and manner of the search, unless an established exception to the warrant requirement applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We turn to consider whether such an exception applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">c. The Third Party Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The State maintains that the \u201cThird Party Doctrine\u201d exception to the warrant requirement applied to the BPD\u2019s use of Hailstorm to track down Andrews\u2019s cell phone. The doctrine \u2014 providing that an individual forfeits his or her expectation of privacy in information that is turned over to a third party \u2014 finds its strongest expression in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435, 96 S.Ct. 1619, 48 L.Ed.2d 71 (1976) and <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>the Supreme Court was presented with the issues of whether the warrantless installation and use of a pen register to collect the telephone numbers dialed from a telephone at the petitioner\u2019s home constituted a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. 442 U.S. at 736-37, 99 S.Ct. 2577. The Court described the function of pen registers, stating that they \u201c \u2018disclose only the telephone numbers that have been dialed \u2014 a means of establishing communication. Neither the purpose of any communication between the caller and the recipient of the call, their identities, nor whether the call was even completed is disclosed by pen registers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741, 99 S.Ct. 2577 (quoting <em>United States v. New York Tel. Co., </em>434 U.S. 159, 167, 98 S.Ct. 364, 54 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977)). Accordingly, the Court narrowed the issue before it, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Given a pen register\u2019s limited capabilities, therefore, petitioner\u2019s argument that its installation and use constituted a \u201csearch\u201d necessarily rests upon a claim that he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d regarding the numbers he dialed on his phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 742, 99 S.Ct. 2577. In <em>United States v. Miller, </em>the Supreme Court held that no reasonable expectation of privacy existed once the owner of financial checks turned financial instruments over to a bank and \u201cexposed [them] to [bank] employees in the ordinary course of business.\u201d 425 U.S. at 442, 96 S.Ct. 1619.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The State argues that the cell site simulator used in this case merely \u201cdetects the signal emitted by the cell phone, just as a regular cell tower would[,]\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe police used data that Andrews voluntarily shared with third parties \u2014 specifically his cell phone provider \u2014 to locate his phone.\u201d The State maintains that, under <em>Smith </em>no Fourth Amendment \u201csearch\u201d occurred because Andrews had no reasonable expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily transmitted to a third party. The State contends that, by carrying and using a cell phone that regularly communicates with nearby cell towers, Andrews assumed the risk that the information transmitted to the cell towers would be revealed to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">According to Andrews, the third-party doctrine of <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>is inapplicable because \u201ca cell phone user takes no conscious, voluntary action to constantly share location information with a third party.\u201d Andrews maintains that the Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>reached its conclusion using a specific line of reasoning, recognizing that \u201ctelephone subscribers \u2018realize\u2019 that they send dialed numbers to the telephone company\u201d and by virtue of those numbers appearing on their monthly bills \u201csubscribers \u2018realize\u2019 that the dialed numbers are recorded by the telephone company.\u201d Andrews contends that the same cannot be said in the instant case. As Andrews points out, the Court in <em>Smith </em>focused on the actual knowledge attributed to telephone users and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">All telephone users realize that they must \u201cconvey\u201d phone numbers to the telephone company, since it is through telephone company switching equipment that their calls are completed. All subscribers realize, moreover, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>phone company has facilities for making permanent records of the numbers they dial, for they see a list of their long-distance (toll) calls on their monthly bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 742, 99 S.Ct. 2577. In that context, the court determined that because the \u201cpetitioner voluntarily conveyed to [the telephone company] information that it had facilities for recording and that it was free to record[,] ... petitioner assumed the risk that the information would be divulged to police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, 99 S.Ct. 2577.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Although the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith </em>has been applied broadly, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Bynum, </em>604 F.3d 161, 162-64 (4th Cir.2010) (upholding the government\u2019s use of a subpoena to obtain a website user\u2019s name, email address, telephone number, and physical address \u2014 all information that the user entered on the website when he opened his account\u2014 from a website operator), it remains that a party must voluntarily convey information to a third-party, before there is no longer a reasonable expectation of privacy in that information. <em>Cf. Jones, </em>132 S.Ct. at 957 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (\u201cThis approach [in <em>Smith </em>] is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.... I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d (citation omitted)). Recently, in <em>United States v. Graham, supra, </em>the Fourth Circuit addressed the application of the third-party doctrine to CSLI and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">[The precedents] simply hold that a person can claim no legitimate expectation of privacy in information she voluntarily conveys to a third party. It is that voluntary conveyance \u2014 not the mere fact that the information winds up in the third party\u2019s records \u2014 that demonstrates an assumption of risk of disclosure and therefore the lack of any reasonable expectation of privacy. We decline to apply the third-party doctrine in the present case because a cell phone user does not \u201cconvey\u201d CSLI to her service provider at all \u2014 voluntari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ly or otherwise \u2014 and therefore does not assume any risk of disclosure to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">796 F.3d at 354 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We agree, once again, with the <em>Graham </em>court and join in the view shared by other courts that, \u201c[t]he fiction that the vast majority of the American population consents to warrant-less government access to the records of a significant share of their movements by \u2018choosing\u2019 to carry a cell phone must be rejected.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>796 F.3d at 355-56 (quoting <em>In re United States for an Order Authorizing the Release of Historical Cellr-Site Info., </em>809 F.Supp.2d 113, 127 (E.D.N.Y.2011)). Cell phone users do not actively submit their location information to their service provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In the present case, there was no affirmative act like \u201cdialing.\u201d This is made abundantly clear by Det. Haley\u2019s testimony stating that \u201cif they\u2019re on the phone, then they\u2019re already connected to ... the [ ] network[, a]nd we\u2019re not going to be able to pull them off of that until ... they hang up the call.\u201d Det. Haley\u2019s testimony reveals that, in the event that an individual is actively using the cell phone to knowingly transmit signals to nearby cell towers, the cell site simulator will not be able to access the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The pin-point location information that led to finding Andrews was obtained directly by law enforcement officers and not through a third-party. It is not the case that Andrews\u2019s cell phone transmitted information to the service provider that was then recorded and shared with law enforcement. Thus, it cannot be said that Andrews \u201cassumed the risk\u201d that the information obtained through the use of the Hailstorm device would be shared by the service provider as in <em>Smith. </em>The function of the Hailstorm device foreclosed that possibility. When asked \u201chow do you get information about where the phone is on the [Hailstorm] machine,\u201d Det. Haley responded: \u201c[W]hen [Hailstorm] captures that identifier that you put into the machine or the equipment, it then tells you ... where the signal\u2019s coming from[.]\u201d Under the facts of this case, the ultimate location data relied on by the police was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>transmitted to a third party voluntarily by Andrews. Because there was no third-party element to the use of the Hailstorm by the BPD to locate Andrews, <em>Smith </em>is inapposite. We conclude the Third Party Doctrine does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">One of the State\u2019s primary arguments on appeal is that Andrews lacks standing to challenge the search of 5032 Clifton Avenue. The State argues that once it challenged Andrews\u2019s standing to protest the search of 5032 Clifton Avenue, the burden was on Andrews to put on evidence during the suppression hearing to establish Andrews\u2019s \u201cbasis for claiming he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of someone else\u2019s home.\u201d The. State posits the suppression court erred in \u201cfinding that there was no need to prove standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Certainly, \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to show standing; it is not on the State to show non-standing.\u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>170 Md.App. 149, 177, 906 A.2d 1054 (2006). In Savage, however, this Court clarified that standing \u201c[i]s exclusively a threshold question of applicability, concerned only with the coverage by the Fourth Amendment of the defendant who seeks to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 906 A.2d 1054. Thus, the burden on a proponent of a motion to suppress is to establish <em>\u201cthat his own Fourth Amendment rights were violated </em>by the challenged search or seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 906 A.2d 1054 (emphasis in Savage) (quoting <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 130 n. 1, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Andrews points out that the State \u201cfailed to respond in any meaningful way\u201d to his motion to suppress, and did not raise the issue of standing to challenge the search of 5032 Clifton Avenue until well into the June 4, 2015 suppression hearing. Andrews asserts that it was the State\u2019s suggestion that the parties stipulate that the issues before the court be decided based on the transcripts, the arrest warrant, the pen regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ter\\trap &amp; trace application, and the search warrant. Andrews contends the State did not raise the standing issue until after the fact-finding portion of the hearing had concluded. At that time, the court requested that Andrews address the issue, and defense counsel made a proffer that Andrews was an overnight guest at 5082 Clifton Avenue and offered to put him on the stand to provide supporting testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Andrews argues that the State waived any argument regarding standing, pointing to the State\u2019s delay, its failure to challenge his proffer, and its concession that its trial theory was the fact \u201cthat [Andrews] has some interest [in 5032 Clifton Avenue] and that is why the gun from this crime, the murder weapon, was there with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We need not pursue the nuances of the parties\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d argument as they have framed the issue. We have already determined that Andrews had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his aggregate and real-time location information (CSLI) contained in his cell phone. <em>See Rakas, </em>439 U.S. at 139-140, 99 S.Ct. 421 (stating that \u201cthe better analysis forthrightly focuses on the extent of a particular defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined concept of standing[,]\u201d and \u201c[t]hat inquiry in turn requires a determination of whether the disputed search and seizure has infringed an interest of the defendant which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.\u201d). The search warrant search for 5032 Clifton Ave<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>nue was based solely on constitutionally tainted information. As the suppression court explained, \u201cI reviewed the warrant and it literally says the Defendant was in there so now we need a warrant. And information generated from the use of the Hailstorm [is to] be suppressed, that\u2019s all that it is.\u201d Because the Fourth Amendment violation of Andrews\u2019s privacy in his real-time CSLI provided the only nexus to 5032 Clifton Avenue, Andrews was entitled to challenge that search. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-88, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963) (stating that, in determining whether evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree, \u201cthe more apt question in such a case is whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). For the foregoing reasons, Andrews had standing to challenge the \u201csearch\u201d of 5032 Clifton Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Warrant Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Having determined that the government\u2019s use of a cell site simulator to obtain location information directly from an individual\u2019s cell phone is a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment, and, therefore, requires a warrant based on probable cause, we now examine the state\u2019s reliance on the pen register\\trap &amp; trace order issued by the circuit court. First, we examine whether the Maryland pen register statute authorized the use of a cell site simulator. Second, we examine whether the putative pen register\\trap &amp; trace order in this case operated as the equivalent of a warrant as the State contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">a. The Maryland Pen Register Statute Does Not Authorize the Use of Cell Site Simulators Such as Hailstorm</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The function of the Hailstorm device, as illuminated by testimony before the suppression court, places it outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>statutory framework of the Maryland pen register statute. The statute authorizes the use of the following surveillance methods defined in CJP \u00a7 10-4B-0.1:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Pen register</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">(c)(1) \u201cPen register\u201d means a device or process that records and decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">(2) \u201cPen register\u201d does not include any device or process used:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">(1) By a provider or customer of a wire or electronic communication service for billing, or recording as an incident to billing, for communications services provided by the provider or any device used by a provider or customer of a wire communication service for cost accounting or other similar purposes in the ordinary course of its business; or</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">(ii) To obtain the content of a communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Trap and trace device</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">(d)(1) \u201cTrap and trace device\u201d means a device or process that captures the incoming electronic or other impulses that identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">(2) \u201cTrap and trace device\u201d does not include a device or process used to obtain the content of a communication.</p>\n<p id=\"A2p\">Wire communication, electronic communication, and electronic communication service</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">(e) \u201cWire communication\u201d, \u201celectronic communication\u201d, and \u201celectronic communication service\u201d have the meanings stated in \u00a7 10-401 of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The statute specifies that any order issued must identify, if known, \u201cthe person to whom is leased or in whose name is listed the telephone line or other facility to which the pen register or trap and trace device is to be attached or applied.\u201d CJP \u00a7 10-4B-04(b)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Construing the plain language of CJP \u00a7 10-4B-01, we determine that it does not, on its face, apply to the use of cell site simulators. A \u201cpen register\u201d is \u201ca device or process that records ... signaling information transmitted by an instrument ... from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted.\u201d CJP \u00a7 10-4B-01(c)(l) (emphasis added). As discussed above, the Hailstorm device does not passively intercept an electronic communication that has been transmitted. Rather, it initiates contact with a cell phone and traces the signal received in response. A \u201ctrap and trace device\u201d is a \u201cdevice or process that captures the incoming electronic or other impulses that identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication.\u201d CJP \u00a7 10-4B-01(d)(l) (emphasis added). The function of the Hailstorm device \u2014 to shower an electronic barrage of signals into a target area to actively engage the target cell phone \u2014 goes well beyond the bounds of the pen register statute which by its terms is limited to authorizing devices that record or identify the source of a communication or capture an originating number.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The Maryland pen register statute has been examined in only one reported opinion by a Maryland appellate court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See Chan v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 287, 293, 552 A.2d 1351 (1989) (upholding the use of a trap and trace device pursuant to a court order to obtain data from over 5,000 calls over an eighty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>day period). In <em>Chan, </em>although this Court determined that the newly enacted Maryland pen register statute was not applicable because it did not take effect until July 1, 1988, it stated that the new statute \u201cunquestionably cover[ed]\u201d the \u201ctrap and trace\u201d of incoming calls and observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In response to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 passed by the Federal Congress, the Maryland General Assembly moved for the first time to regulate \u201cpen registers\u201d and \u201ctrap and trace\u201d devices by Chapter 607 of the Acts of 1988. The new regulation is not part of the \u201cWiretapping and Electronic Surveillance\u201d subtitle but is a separate subtitle of its own, 4B, dealing with the distinct subject matter of \u201cPen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices.\u201d Its provisions and its wording are virtually verbatim with those of its Federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 308, 552 A.2d 1351 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In 2001, Congress amended the definition of the term \u201cpen register\u201d in the federal counterpart as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. <em>See </em>PL 107-56, October 26, 2001,115 Stat. 272. Subsequently, in 2002, the Maryland pen register statute was also amended to the current versions, reproduced above. 2002 Md. Laws, ch. 100 (H.B. 1036). Notably, since <em>Chan </em>was decided in 1989, the wording of the Maryland statute remains virtually verbatim with its federal counterpart. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3127; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Looking then, at the federal statutory scheme, we note that the federal Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (\u201cCALEA\u201d), which delineates a telecommunications carrier\u2019s duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for law enforcement purposes, provides that \u201cwith regard to information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section 3127 of Title 18), such call-identifying information shall not include any information that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber (except to the extent that the location may be determined from the telephone number).\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (2015) (emphasis added). Thus, federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>specifies that the federal equivalent to the Maryland pen register statute does not authorize location information. Rather, the federal scheme allows the government to use a mobile tracking device through warrant or other order as contemplated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Although there are no reported opinions that address whether the collection of real-time cell site location information (CSLI) is authorized under the Maryland\u2019s pen register statute, numerous federal courts construing the virtually identical federal statutes have found no statutory authorization for obtaining such information without demonstrating probable cause. In 2005, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas held that the government must demonstrate probable cause and obtain a search warrant to obtain real-time CSLI. <em>In re Application for Pen Register &amp; Trap/Trace Device with Cell Site Location Auth., </em>396 F.Supp.2d 747, 759 (S.D.Tex.2005). Construing the federal statutes, the district court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Tracking device information such as cell site data is plainly not a form of electronic communication at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">This type of surveillance is.unquestionably available upon a traditional probable cause-'showing under Rule 41 [for a mobile tracking device]. On the other hand, permitting surreptitious conversion of a cell phone into a tracking device without probable cause raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, especially when the phone is monitored in the home or other places where privacy is reasonably expected. \u2018,</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 759, 765. <em>See also In re Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing Installation &amp; Use of a Pen Register, </em>415 F.Supp.2d 211, 2l9 (W.D.N.Y.2006) (holding that the government was not entitled to real-time CSLI by statute and thus, was required to make a \u201cshowing that there exists probable cause to believe that the data sought will yield evidence of a crime.\u201d). Directly addressing the use of a cell</p>\n<p id=\"AeI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>site simulator (such as Stingray or Hailstorm) to obtain real-time CSLI for tracking purposes, the District Court for the Southern District of Texas determined that, rather than merely capturing signaling information as contemplated in the federal pen register statute, the use of a cell site simulator constituted a mobile tracking device. <em>In re the Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing the Installation &amp; Use of a Pen Register &amp; Trap &amp; Trace Device, </em>890 F.Supp.2d 747, 752 (S.D.Tex.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We acknowledge that law enforcement has long relied on pen register\\trap &amp; trace orders for valid and vital investigative purposes. They will continue to do so. The pen register statute, however, is limited by its terms and is not intended to apply to other, newer technologies. Thus we hold that a pen register\\trap &amp; trace order is not sufficient to authorize use of the Hailstorm.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Criminal Procedure \u00a7 1-203.1</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Although at the time Andrews was arrested Maryland did not have a corollary to the provision in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 that specifically authorizes issuance of a warrant for a mobile tracking device, Maryland has since enacted a statute authorizing law enforcement to obtain real-time CSLI, effective October 1, 2014. Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2014 Supp.) Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) \u00a7 1-203.1. The statute provides that a court may issue an order allowing an officer to obtain real-time location information from an electronic device based on probable cause that:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(i) a misdemeanor or felony has been, is being, or will be committed by the owner or user of the electronic device or by the individual about whom location information is being sought; and</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">(ii) the location information being sought:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">1. is evidence of, or will lead to evidence of, the misdemeanor or felony being investigated; or</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">2. will lead to the apprehension of an individual for whom an arrest warrant has been previously issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">CP \u00a7 l-203.1(b)(l). The Fiscal and Policy Note prepared by the Department of Legislative Services for the General Assembly concerning this statute when it was first proposed, recognized that law enforcement officers were using the Maryland pen register statute to obtain cell phone-related information. It explained that the proposed statute would specifically authorize the capture of CSLI in accord with several recent federal court decisions finding that probable cause was needed to obtain such information. Fiscal and Policy Note (Revised), Senate Bill 698, Criminal Procedure \u2014 Electronic Device Location Information \u2014 Order (2014). The fiscal and policy note also contemplated the use of cell site simulators and stated: While cell phone records are usually obtained from a cell phone provider, technology is making it possible for law enforcement to bypass these companies altogether. Certain devices allow law enforcement to obtain location data by imitating a cell phone tower, getting a phone to connect with it, and measuring signals from the phone to pinpoint its location. The device, which is being used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the military, and local law enforcement, is known by several trade names, including StingRay, KingFish, and LoggerHead.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Notably, CP \u00a7 1-203.1 contains safeguards and limitations not found in the Maryland pen register statute, including a thirty-day durational limit on the collection of location information unless an extension is sought on continuing probable cause, and a provision requiring notice to the user or owner of the monitored device within 10 days absent a showing of good cause to delay. CP \u00a7 l-203.1(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The parties have briefed extensively their view of the meaning and application of CP 1-203.1. Other than to provide context for the history of the Maryland pen register statute and our conclusion that it was not intended to cover cell site simulators, we do not address the application of CP 1-203.1 and decline to opine as to whether an order under CP 1-203.1 will suffice to satisfy the requirements of a warrant based on probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In sum, we conclude that the purpose of Maryland\u2019s pen register statute is to capture information resulting from two-way, electronic or wire communications. Nothing in the plain language of CJP \u00a7 10-4B-01 <em>et seq. </em>suggests that it was ever intended to allow surveillance technology that can exploit the manner in which a cell phone transmits data to convert it into a mobile tracking device. Accordingly, an order issued pursuant to CJP \u00a7 10^tB-04 cannot authorize the use of a cell site simulator, such as Hailstorm. Because there was no statutory authorization for the BPD\u2019s use of the Hailstorm cell site simulator, we hold that the BPD should have sought a warrant or a specialized order upon a particularized showing of probable cause, and based on sufficient information about the technology involved to permit the court to contour reasonable limitations on the scope and manner of the BPD\u2019s use of the device.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., In re Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing Installation &amp; Use of a Pen Register, </em>415 F.Supp.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">b. The Order Obtained by the State Was Not Equivalent to a Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The State insists that its use of the Hailstorm device to track Andrews\u2019s cell phone was authorized by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>order. In the absence of a specific statute that would have authorized the use of a cell site simulator at the time Andrews was arrested, the State presses that \u201cthe police erred on the side of caution and obtained a court order specifically authorizing the use of a cellular tracking device to find Andrews\u2019s phone[,]\u201d pursuant to the \u201cnearest analog\u201d \u2014 the Maryland pen register statute. The State acknowledges that the court order described in the Maryland pen register statute does not use the words \u201cwarrant\u201d or \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Nevertheless, the State argues that, in this case, the BPD\u2019s application and the resulting order \u201cwent far beyond the requirements of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The State points out that the BPD application was for an order allowing the police</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">to employ surreptitious or duplication of facilities, technical devices or equipment to accomplish the installation and use of a Pen Register\\Trap &amp; Trace and Cellular Tracking Device [... ] and shall initiate a signal to determine the location of the subject\u2019s mobile device on the service provider\u2019s network or with such other reference points as may be reasonably] available ...</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The State also notes that the resultant order states that probable cause exists to authorize the use of a \u201cCellular Tracking Device.\u201d Thus, the State contends that because the pen register\\trap &amp; trace order stated that it was based upon a finding of probable cause, it was, therefore, \u201cthe functional equivalent of a warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Andrews emphasizes that the order may issue on just a showing \u201cthat the information likely to be obtained by the installation and use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d CJP \u00a7 10-4B-04(a)(l). In addition to the fact that a pen register\\trap <em>&amp; </em>trace order does not contemplate the use of a cell site simulator, Andrews points out that it also does not satisfy the requirements that a warrant based on probable cause be attached to a specific suspected crime, be confined in scope, or describe with particularity the place to be searched or the person to be seized. Andrews contends that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>moment BPD conducted surveillance with something other than a pen register, it exceeded the purview of the pen register order.\u201d Further, Andrews contends that BPD\u2019s application \u201cFor an Order Authorizing the Installation and Use of a Device Known as a Pen Register/Trap &amp; Trace,\u201d was intentionally captioned to ensure that the circuit court scrutinized it according to the statutory pen register factors. Andrews argues that BPD\u2019s \u201cdisingenuous efforts\u201d hid from the circuit court \u201cthe scope, intensity, [and] nature of the search,\u201d and prevented the court from conducting a proper probable cause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We begin with our appraisal that an order issued under the pen register statute is not the equivalent of a warrant based on probable cause \u2014 a fact the State implicitly concedes in its argument that it \u201cwent beyond the requirement of the statute.\u201d The applicable requirements of the statute are contained first in \u00a7 10 \u2014 4B-03:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">(b) <em>Contents. </em>\u2014 An application under subsection (a) of this section shall include:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">(1) The identity of the State law enforcement or investigative officer making the application and the identity of the law enforcement agency conducting the investigation; and</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">(2) A statement under oath by the applicant that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Additionally, 10-4B-04(a) states that an order may issue if the court finds the information likely to be obtained by the device is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation, and the order must:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">(3)Specify the attributes of the communications to which the order applies, including the number or other identifier and, if known, the location of the telephone line or other facility to which the pen register or trap and trace device is to be attached or applied, and, in the case of a trap and trace device, the geographic limits of the trap and trace order;</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>(4) Contain a description of the offense to which the information likely to be obtained by the pen register or trap and trace device relates[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">CJP \u00a7 lCM:B-04(b)(8) and (4). Plainly, this limited showing falls short of the particularity required for the issuance of a search warrant. <em>See Illinois v. </em>Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (\u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d); <em>Nero v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 333, 345-46, 798 A.2d 5 (2002) (\u201cGeneral warrants, of course, are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. ... [T]he problem [posed by the general warrant] is not that of intrusion per se, but of a general, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings____ [The Fourth Amendment addresses the problem] by requiring a \u2018particular description\u2019 of the things to be seized.\u201d (quoting <em>Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 480, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976))).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Moving to the State\u2019s argument that the order was sufficient because it went beyond the requirements of the statute, we start by rejecting the State\u2019s contention that the words \u201cprobable cause\u201d contained in the pen register application and order converted the overreaching order into a warrant. The \u201cprobable cause\u201d articulated in the resulting order is merely that \u201cinformation likely to be obtained ... is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Certainly, while this reflects the standard required for issuance of an order under CJP \u00a7 10-4B-04, it falls far short of the particularity required to support a search warrant. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317; <em>Nero, </em>144 Md.App. at 345-46, 798 A.2d 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In the information \u201coffered in support of probable cause\u201d the application states:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Your Applicant hereby certifies that the information likely to be obtained concerning [Andrews\u2019s] location will be obtained by learning the numbers, locations and subscribers of the telephone number(s) being dialed or pulsed from or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the aforesaid telephone and that such information is relevant to the ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Plainly, the State\u2019s use of the Hailstorm device extended far beyond this certification as to how information concerning Andrews\u2019s location would be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Here, the State inserted language into its application and proposed order attempting to, without being specific, obtain court authorization for more than a pen register\\trap &amp; trace order. Although the application does request authorization to use a \u201cCellular Tracking Device,\u201d it fails to name or describe any cell site simulator. In fact, there is absolutely nothing in the application or order that identifies the Hailstorm device, or provides even a rudimentary description of cell site simulator technology. The application also failed to identify any geographical limitation to the BPD\u2019s use of the undisclosed surveillance technology, and did not explain what was to be done with the information collected. Nor did the application disclose the possibility that the technology employed may capture the cell phone information (unique serial numbers) of innocent third parties in range of the target area. Finally, we are troubled that the application for a pen register\\trap &amp; trace order did not fully apprise the circuit court judge from whom it was sought of the information that it would yield. Based on the application that he received, the circuit judge was entitled to expect that the results would be a list of telephone numbers that Andrews called and that called Andrews \u2014 not a real-time fix on his location.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">We determine that the pen register\\trap &amp; trace order in this case failed to meet the requirements of a warrant. To allow the government to collect real-time location information on an unknown number of private cell phones, without any geographic boundaries, without any reporting requirements or requirements that any unrelated data be deleted, and without a showing of probable cause that contraband or evidence of a particular crime will be found through the particular manner in which the search is conducted would certainly run afoul of the Fourth Amendment. As stated in our holding above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>unless a valid exception to the warrant requirement applies,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the government may not use a cell phone simulator without a warrant or, alternatively, a specialized order that requires a particularized showing of probable cause, based on sufficient information about the technology involved to allow a court to contour reasonable limitations on the scope and manner of the search, and that provides adequate protections in case any third-party cell phone information might be unintentionally intercepted. To hold otherwise would be to abandon the Fourth Amendment by assuming, without any foundation, that the citizens of Maryland have forfeited their reasonable expectation of privacy in their personal location.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The Exclusionary Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">a. The Search Warrant Does Not Survive Removal of the Constitutionally Tainted Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The State contends that the search warrant that was obtained for 5032 Clifton Avenue was valid because probable cause existed once \u201cAndrews was found in the home.\u201d Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>cording to the State, Andrews was arrested pursuant to a valid arrest warrant and the police had \u201cthe consent of the apparent owner of the home to enter the home to take Andrews into custody.\u201d Thus, the State argues, \u201c[n]othing about the way in which Andrews was located negated the probable cause to believe that there could be evidence of the crimes at that address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In riposte, Andrews avers that without the location data provided by the cell site simulator, \u201cthe BPD possessed no nexus between the criminal activity at hand and 5032 Clifton Avenue.\u201d Andrews asserts that, \u201c[b]ecause the search warrant relied entirely on that nexus, it withers as fruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">First, we note that where entry into a protected space \u201cwas demanded under color of office\u201d and \u201cgranted in submission to authority,\u201d that submission does not equate to a waiver of a constitutional right. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>333 U.S. at 13, 68 S.Ct. 367 (citing <em>Amos v. United States, </em>255 U.S. 313, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654 (1921)). Thus, the existence of an arrest warrant and the consent of the owner of the residence do not, in themselves, diminish Andrews\u2019s protection under the Fourth Amendment. Nor do they render the later-acquired search warrant unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Second, the courts of Maryland have recognized that where a search warrant relies on information obtained in violation of the constitution, the question is \u201cwhether \u2018after the constitutionally tainted information is excised from the warrant, the remaining information is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redmond v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 163, 191-92, 73 A.3d 385 (2013) (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>372 Md. 386, 419, 813 A.2d 231 (2002)). <em>See also Karo, </em>468 U.S. at 720-21, 104 S.Ct. 3296 (stating that in determining whether evidence seized pursuant to a contested warrant remains admissible, one of the pertinent questions is whether \u201cthe warrant affidavit, after striking the [constitutionally tainted] facts ... contained sufficient untainted information to furnish probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant.\u201d) Here, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>can be no doubt that the only information linking Andrews and 5023 Clifton Avenue was the fruit of the Fourth Amendment violation. The State presents no credible argument that evidence of Andrew\u2019s presence in the home was obtained by independent lawful means.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>Redmond v. State, </em>the BPD were investigating an armed robbery in which a cell phone was stolen. 213 Md.App. at 169, \u25a073 A.3d 385. During their investigation, detectives contacted the victim\u2019s mobile service provider and, \u201cby triangulating the signal from cell phone towers in the area, determined that the stolen cell phone was in the proximity of 3303 Round Road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 73 A.3d 385. Thereafter, detectives began moving from house to house in the area, speaking to residents using a ruse that they were \u201clooking for a pedophile named \u2018Leroy Smalls.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 73 A.3d 385. After obtaining consent to enter the appellant\u2019s residence under those false pretenses, one of the detectives surreptitiously dialed the number of the stolen cell phone, heard it ringing upstairs, and then walked through the entire house conducting a \u201cprotective sweep\u201d including opening closet doors and checking under beds. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 73 A.3d 385. Officers then sought a search warrant for the home on the basis of what they had discovered in the home. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 73 A.3d 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">After a careful analysis, we determined that \u201c[b]y dialing the number of the stolen cell phone and walking upstairs to locate it, the police exceeded the scope of any consent that was given to their presence inside 3303 Round Road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-90, 73 A.3d 385. Applying the exclusionary rule, we noted that \u201call the information ... attested to in applying for the search warrant (and on which the search warrant was granted) ... was discovered during the initial illegal entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 73 A.3d 385. We determined that the search warrant was not issued based on an independent lawful source and the unlawfully obtained evidence should be suppressed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>we soundly rejected the argument that evidence in a warrant application was obtained by independent lawful means \u201c(1) where the officer\u2019s decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry; and (2) where information obtained during that entry was presented to the [judge] and affected his [or her] decision to issue the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 73 A.3d 385 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in Redmond) (quoting <em>Kamara v. State, </em>205 Md. App. 607, 627-28, 45 A.3d 948 (2012)). <em>See also Murray v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 534, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988) (\u201cThe ultimate question is whether the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely independent source of the information and tangible evidence at issue. This would not have been the case if the agents\u2019 decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry or if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">As in <em>Redmond, </em>here, the evidence that forms the only basis for probable cause in the State\u2019s search warrant application\u2014 that Andrews was at 5032 Clifton Avenue \u2014 was that obtained through an unlawful search \u2014 in this case, the BPD\u2019s use of the Hailstorm device. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s determination that there was no independent lawful source to establish a nexus between Andrews and the residence. <em>Cf. Agurs v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>State, </em>415 Md. 62, 84, 998 A.2d 868 (2010) (stating that \u201cpolice should have been aware that there must be a nexus between criminal activity and the place to be searched.\u201d). Accordingly, once the constitutional taint is removed from the search warrant in this case, what remains is insufficient to establish probable cause for a search of 5032 Clifton Avenue and, as discussed further <em>infra, </em>the evidence seized in that search withers as the fruit of the poisoned tree. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978) (stating that if \u201cthe affidavit\u2019s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.\u201d). Therefore, we affirm the suppression court\u2019s exclusion of all evidence found at 5032 Clifton Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">b. The State Cannot Rely on the Good Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Finally, the State argues that BPD\u2019s relied in good faith on the search warrant issued for 5032 Clifton Avenue after locating Andrews inside that address. The State asserts that police officers relied on, first, the pen register\\trap &amp; trace order, and, second, on the later issued search warrant for the premises. The State maintains that \u201c[t]his is good faith squared[,]\u201d and there is \u201csimply no officer misconduct to deter in this case.\u201d Thus, the State contends that the exclusionary rule should not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Andrews contends that without the location information provided by the cell site simulator the BPD possessed no nexus between him and 5032 Clifton Avenue, and, \u201c[b]ecause the search warrant relied entirely on that nexus, it withers as the fruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d Andrews asserts that where the information relied on to obtain a warrant is the product of a Fourth amendment violation, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine trumps the good faith exception. Moreover, Andrews argues that good faith cannot apply where \u201claw enforcement officers, from the outset, dealt dishonestly with the judiciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>In <em>United States v.

The Supreme Court cautioned, however, that</p>\n<p id=\"AEl\">[t]he good-faith exception for searches conducted pursuant to warrants is not intended to signal our unwillingness strictly to enforce the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, and we do not believe that it will have this effect. As we have already suggested, the good-faith exception, turning as it does on objective reasonableness, should not be difficult to apply in practice. When officers have acted pursuant to a warrant, the prosecution should ordinarily be able to establish objective good faith without a substantial expenditure of judicial time.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>Fitzgerald v. State, </em>this Court aptly summarized the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Because the only purpose of the Exclusionary Rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), is to deter unreasonable police behavior, <em>Leon </em>and <em>[Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984) ] held that a mistake made by a judge in issuing a warrant should not be' attributed to the police officer who executes it. Because the officer has been reasonable in relying on the judge\u2019s legal expertise, it would serve no deterrent purpose to exclude otherwise competent, material, and trustworthy evidence. See <em>Connelly v. State, </em>322 Md. 719, 720-21, 589 A.2d 958 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">153 Md.App. 601, 655-56, 837 A.2d 989 (2003) <em>aff'd, </em>384 Md. 484, 864 A.2d 1006 (2004). However, this Court observed that in <em>Karo, supra, </em>the Supreme Court instructed that, if the information obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation \u201cproved critical to establishing probable cause for the issuance of the warrant,\u201d it would invalidate the subsequent search warrant for the house. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 837 A.2d 989 (citing <em>Karo, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 719, 104 S.Ct. 3296). Accordingly, \u201cthe conclusion may readily be drawn that in the case of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>antecedent Fourth Amendment violation which contributes to a warrant application, the \u2018fruit of the poisoned tree\u2019 doctrine \u2018trumps\u2019 the officer\u2019s \u2018good faith\u2019 reliance under <em>Leon </em>and <em>Sheppard.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Here, as we noted above, the BPD submitted an overreaching pen register\\trap <em>&amp; </em>trace application that failed to clearly articulate the intended use, i.e., to track Andrews\u2019s cell phone using an active cell site simulator. The ensuing order did not support the use of the Hailstorm device, nor did it, in any way, serve as a de facto warrant for the use of the Hailstorm device. As the State\u2019s May 15, 2015 supplemental disclosure made clear, \u201cWATF did not have the Clifton Ave address as a possible location until ATT provided that information.\u201d Only after receiving that information through the use of the Hailstorm device and arresting Andrews at the premises did the same BPD officers who submitted the pen register\\trap &amp; trace application then apply for a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">As Andrews points out, without the antecedent Fourth Amendment violation the nexus between the residence to be searched and the alleged criminal activity could not have been established. <em>Cf. Agurs, </em>415 Md. at 84, 998 A.2d 868 (stating that \u201cpolice should have been aware that there must be a nexus between criminal activity and the place to be searched.\u201d). In the present case, the antecedent Fourth Amendment violation was the only basis upon which the search warrant application stood, and the fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine does, indeed, trump alleged good faith reliance on the part of BPD. <em>See Fitzgerald, </em>153 Md.App. at 656, 837 A.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Leon, </em>was clear that \u201cthe officer\u2019s reliance on the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination and on the technical sufficiency of the warrant he issues must be objectively reasonable.\u201d 468 U.S. at 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405. <em>See, e.g., Spence v. State, </em>444 Md. 1, 12-13, 118 A.3d 864 (2015) (wherein the police officer, in searching a cell phone and reading text messages during a search incident to arrest, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>acting in good faith reliance on then-controlling authority in Maryland); <em>Agurs, </em>415 Md. at 83, 998 A.2d 868 (concluding that the good faith exception did not apply where \u201cno reasonably well-trained police officer could have relied on the warrant that authorized the search of Agurs\u2019 home.\u201d). We cannot say the BPD officers in this case reasonably relied on the warrant obtained through their own misleading order application and unconstitutionally intrusive conduct. To do so would allow law enforcement to insulate its own errors merely by presenting limited information to a magistrate, obtaining a warrant post-intrusion, and then re-entering the place to be searched. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule seeks to avoid \u201c[p]enalizing the officer for the magistrate\u2019s error, rather than his own.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S at 921, 104 S.Ct. 3405. That is, however, not that case here. <em>See id. </em>at 919, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (\u201cThe deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right.

Two broad categories of CSLI may be sought from the service provider. The first is historical CSLI, which is used to look back through service provider records to determine a suspect\u2019s location at a given point in the past. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Graham, </em>796 F.3d 332, 343 (4th Cir.2015) (\"Historical CSLI identifies cell sites, or 'base stations,' to and from which a cell phone has sent or received radio signals, and the particular points in time at which these transmissions occurred, over a given timeframe....

Law enforcement frequently uses historical CSLI to prove that a defendant was in the area where a crime of which he is accused occurred. The second category of CSLI is real-time data, used to track the whereabouts and movements of a suspect by using the cell phone as a tracking device. <em>See, e.g., Tracey v. State, </em>152 So.3d 504, 507 (Fla.2014), <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>(Dec. 8, 2014). Here, the BPD obtained real-time location information from the service provider when it received the GPS coordinates associated with the cell phone from Sprint. Andrews\u2019s motion to suppress, however, was focused primarily on the BPD\u2019s ensuing use of a cell site simulator to directly obtain pin-point location data.

Rather, his testimony was that the ATT detectives confirmed the precise location of the cell phone by use of ordinary police investigatory tactics: speaking to the occupants of two houses, dialing the number of the stolen cell phone, listening for it to ring, and, ultimately, physically observing the stolen cell phone lying on a dresser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">Thus, to the extent that the averments in the search warrant application represent that the ATT detectives used \"sophisticated\u201d means to locate the stolen cell phone while at the scene on the afternoon of March 2, 2010, they are simply inaccurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">213 Md.App. at 193, 73 A.3d 385. The defendant in <em>Redmond </em>did not challenge the use of any such device or the use of cell tower information. Accordingly, in <em>Redmond </em>we did not address the use of sophisticated mobile surveillance systems, as we must in the matter <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
