(\u201cMidatlantic\u201d); St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. (\u201cSJMC\u201d); and Mark G. Midei, M.D. (\u201cDr. Midei\u201d), based upon the implantation of an allegedly unnecessary stent in Crystal\u2019s left anterior descending coronary artery (which we shall, as the parties do, refer to as the \u201cLAD.\u201d) When arbitration was waived, Crystal filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, alleging medical malpractice, fraud by intentional misrepresentation, and fraud by concealment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claim of medical malpractice was alleged as to all three health care providers, but the claim of fraud by misrepresentation was brought against only Dr. Midei, and the claim of fraud by concealment was directed at only SJMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">After discovery was concluded by the parties, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>eluding that there was no evidence to support Crystal\u2019s claim of fraud by intentional misrepresentation, against Dr. Midei, or his claim of fraud by concealment, against SJMC. It, then, as a consequence of having disposed of Crystal\u2019s fraud claims, granted summary judgment as to his remaining medical malpractice claims against Midatlantic, SJMC, and Dr. Midei, as Crystal\u2019s fraud claims, having been disposed of on summary judgment, could no longer be deemed to have tolled the statute of limitations, which had long since run on his medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">From those rulings, Crystal noted this appeal, contending that the court had erred in granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment as to all of his claims, and thus his claims of fraud and medical malpractice should be resurrected by this Court. For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In October of 2004, after experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, and a feeling of tightness in his chest, Crystal underwent a \u201ccardiac catheterization,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a procedure used to evaluate and diagnose cardiovascular conditions. During that procedure, it was discovered that there was a \u201cstenosis\u201d \u2014 that is, an abnormal narrowing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 of Crystal\u2019s LAD. The level of stenosis in that artery had reached 95%. To address that condition, a stent was placed in Crystal\u2019s LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Yet, notwithstanding the successful completion of that procedure, Crystal continued to experience shortness of breath. Consequently, his cardiologist recommended that he undergo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>another cardiac catheterization. That second catheterization was to be performed by appellee, Dr. Midei, a cardiologist with appellee, Midatlantic.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Before undergoing this procedure, however, Crystal signed, on November 4, 2004,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a \u201cCardiac Catheterization Laboratory Procedure Consent Form,\u201d which authorized Dr. Midei \u201cto perform one or more\u201d of a number of medical procedures, including a \u201cheart catheterization,\u201d a \u201ccoronary angiography,\u201d and a \u201cstent implantation.\u201d Specifically, it stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">I consent to and authorize Dr. Mark Midei and his/her assistants to perform one or more of the following procedures:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Heart catheterization and coronary angiography, possible coronary angioplasty-type procedures (angioplasty, atherectomy, stent placement ...), and possible peripheral angiography. Please read the explanations below.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Heart catheterization with coronary angiography is a diagnostic procedure to define the presence, nature, and extent of heart disease. The physician inserts a small tube or catheter into an artery and/or vein in the leg or arm and advances it to the heart. The physician will inject dye through the catheter, take pictures of the arteries or grafts to the heart, and measure pressures in the heart. The results of this test will help determine if medication, an angioplasty-type procedure, or bypass surgery is the best treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Coronary or peripheral angioplasty-type procedures (angioplasty, atherectomy, stent placement) are therapeutic procedures to open blockages in coronary or peripheral arteries or bypass grafts. The physician will perform coronary or peripheral angiography, then advance a thin guidewire across the blockage and then select the most appropriate procedure(s) to open the blockage____ Stent implantation is a procedure where the physician inserts a metal stent (mesh-like tube) at the site of the blockage which is left in place to hold the artery open.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">* * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Notably, the form did not contain any requisite degree of blockage that would require or preclude the implantation of a stent, but instead left the decision, of whether to place a stent, to the medical judgment of Dr. Midei.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Notwithstanding Crystal\u2019s pre-operative consent to the procedure, it was Crystal\u2019s claim that Dr. Midei, though not required to do so, informed him, during the course of the procedure, but before the implantation of the stent, of the level of stenosis in his LAD. According to Crystal, Dr. Midei, before placing the stent, advised him, as he lay on the operating table, that the stenosis in question had reached 70% (though the laboratory report he later prepared suggested an even higher level of stenosis, that is, 80%) and that he would need a stent to avoid a complete blockage of the artery. Dr. Midei then placed another stent in Crystal\u2019s LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">At his deposition, nearly ten years later, Crystal, in recalling the deliverance of that advisement by Dr. Midei, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">[Counsel]: Prior to the beginning of the cardiac catheterization procedure that [Dr. Midei] performed on November 22, do you remember talking to him?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">[Crystal]: Just in the lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">[Counsel]: I understand. On that morning before he started the catheterization procedure, do you remember talking to Dr. Midei?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">[Crystal]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>[Counsel]: Do you remember someone going over a consent form with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">[Crystal]: I don\u2019t recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">[Counsel]: Do you know if you signed a consent form?</p>\n<p id=\"Ax0\">[Crystal]: I don\u2019t recall. I am sure I had to, but I don\u2019t recall.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">[Counsel]: What do you remember Dr. Midei saying during the procedure, if anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">[Crystal]: He pretty much started the same way that Dr. Brinker did. I\u2019m going to do this. You\u2019re going to feel that. And it wasn\u2019t long into the procedure that he told me I had a 70 percent blockage in my LAD. Now those letters sounded pretty familiar to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">[Counsel]: Okay you remember him saying anything else? [Crystal]: You would need this stented to keep it from blocking completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">[Counsel]: Are you paraphrasing what you remember that he told you or are those Dr. Midei\u2019s exact words?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">[Crystal]: I can\u2019t remember back 10 years. So I\u2019m assuming. I\u2019m paraphrasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Five years after the stent implantation at issue, in 2009, Crystal read a newspaper article suggesting that Dr. Midei had been performing \u201cunnecessary\u201d stent implantation procedures. That article led Crystal to contact an attorney. Two years later, in 2011, almost seven years after the stent implantation procedure had been performed by Dr. Midei, Crystal filed a claim, with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office, against the three appellee health-care providers. Crystal filed, with that claim, a certificate of qualified expert, naming Herbert Fischer, M.D., as that expert, and Dr. Fischer\u2019s report. In both the certificate and his report, Dr. Fischer opined that Dr. Midei had breached the standard of care applicable to stent implantation procedures by implanting a stent when there had been \u201cinsufficient evidence to justify\u201d such a procedure. Arbitration was thereafter waived, and the case was transferred to the Baltimore County circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Summary Judgment Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In the Baltimore County circuit court, appellees subsequently moved for summary judgment, contending that Crystal had failed to generate a dispute of material fact as to his claims of fraud by intentional misrepresentation and fraud by concealment. And, because, in their view, there was no evidence of fraud, the five-year medical malpractice statute of limitations, which had long since run on Crystal\u2019s medical malpractice claims, had not been tolled by those fraud claims and, therefore, those medical malpractice claims should be dismissed, by the court, as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Crystal responded to appellees\u2019 motions by asserting that there was a dispute of material fact as to, at least, his claim of fraud by intentional misrepresentation because there was evidence that Dr. Midei had \u201cdeliberately misled\u201d Crystal to induce him to undergo the stent implantation procedure in question. That evidence, Crystal pointed out, was Dr. Fischer\u2019s deposition testimony that, at the time Dr. Midei implanted the second stent, the level of arterial stenosis was \u201cabout a 30 percent stenosis at the maximum,\u201d though, at the same deposition, he later increased that estimate of stenosis to 30-40%.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And that testimony, noted Crystal, contradicted Dr. Midei\u2019s statement that Crystal had a 70% stenosis in his artery, as well as Midei\u2019s subsequent description of an 80% stenosis in his laboratory report. \u201cA jury could readily conclude\u201d from that \u201clarge discrepancy,\u201d avowed Crystal, that Dr. Midei \u201cknew at the time of the stent implantation that there was nowhere near\u201d a 70% or 80% stenosis and that he \u201cdeliberately misled\u201d Crystal by so stating and thereby inducing Crystal to undergo the stent implantation procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Such evidence, Crystal further asserted, created a \u201cjury question\u201d as to whether Dr. Midei committed fraud, by mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>representing the actual level of stenosis in Crystal\u2019s LAD, which, if proved, would toll the statute of limitations as to his medical malpractice claim. Crystal then urged the court to deny summary judgment as to his claim of fraud by concealment, which was alleged solely as to SJMC, because the medical center was, he claimed, \u201c[vicariously] liable for the fraudulent concealment acts of Dr. Midei.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The circuit court, following a hearing on appellees\u2019 motions, granted summary judgment, as to all three counts. In so doing, the court explained that, as to the claim of fraud by misrepresentation against Dr. Midei, it was not persuaded by Crystal\u2019s contention that the \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d between Dr. Fischer and Dr. Midei, regarding the level of stenosis in his LAD, constituted evidence that Dr. Midei had, knowingly or with reckless indifference, made a false statement to Crystal with respect to that level. It therefore granted summary judgment as to that count, because Crystal, in its view, had \u201cfailed to proffer evidence of a genuine issue for trial on: whether Dr. Midei knowingly made a false representation; whether he intended to defraud Mr. Crystal; and/or whether Mr. Crystal relied on misrepresentations by Dr. Midei in consenting to the procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The court also explained that it was granting summary judgment as to the claim against SJMC for fraud by concealment because: First, it was \u201cnot aware of any authority for the proposition that SJMC or any health care provider, generally, has a duty to disclose to patients prior instances of medical malpractice,\u201d and, second, \u201ceven if [SJMC] had a duty to disclose this information, there is no evidence that [SJMC] had information to disclose at the time of Crystal\u2019s procedure.\u201d Then, given \u201cthe absence of sufficient evidence of fraud,\u201d the court determined that the five-year statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>limitations period had run on Crystal\u2019s medical malpractice claims, having not been tolled by fraud, and dismissed those claims as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Maryland Rule 2-501 provides that summary judgment shall be entered \u201cin favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In other words, the circuit court must first determine \u201cwhether there is a dispute as to a material fact sufficient to require the issue to be tried.\u201d <em>Frederick Rd., Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 93, 756 A.2d 963 (2000). If there is no such dispute and if the nonmoving party has \u201cfailed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element\u201d of its claim, for which it has the burden of proof, summary judgment is then appropriate in favor of the movant. <em>Cent. Truck Ctr., Inc. v. Cent. GMC, Inc., </em>194 Md.App. 375, 386, 4 A.3d 515 (2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In assessing the propriety of a grant of summary judgment, we apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>River Walk Apartments LLC v. Twigg, </em>396 Md. 527, 541, 914 A.2d 770 (2007). In conducting that assessment, we consider the facts and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts, in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Frederick Rd., Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>360 Md. at 93-94, 756 A.2d 963. Our review is limited, however, solely to the grounds upon which the circuit court granted summary judgment. <em>River Walk Apartments, </em>396 Md. at 541-42, 914 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Fraud By Intentional Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Crystal contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment as to his claim of fraud by intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>misrepresentation against Dr. Midei. Specifically, he maintains that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Dr. Midei had deliberately misstated, or had done so with reckless indifference, the degree of stenosis in Crystal\u2019s LAD, so as to induce Crystal to agree to the stent implantation procedure that was ultimately performed. In support of that claim, he suggests that there was \u201ctoo great a discrepancy\u201d between Dr. Midei\u2019s and Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinions about the percentage of stenosis in Crystal\u2019s LAD for Dr. Midei\u2019s statement, that there was a 70% stenosis, to have been anything but an intentional misrepresentation of the level of stenosis to induce Crystal to undergo the stent implantation procedure at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">To prevail on a claim of fraud, a plaintiff must show, \u201cby clear and convincing evidence,\u201d the following elements, the second of which we have bolded as it is central to this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">1. That the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff;</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">2. That its falsity was either known to the defendant or that the representation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth;</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">3. That the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff;</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">4. That the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it; and</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">5. That the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\"><em>E.g. VF Corp. v. Wrexham Aviation Corp., </em>350 Md. 693, 703-04, 715 A.2d 188 (1998) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">It is, as noted, the second element (or the \u201cknowledge element\u201d) of fraud that is at issue here. Thus, the question before us is: Did Crystal present sufficient evidence to generate a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Dr. Midei knew that the statement he made to Crystal was false or that Dr. Midei was \u201crecklessly indifferent\u201d with respect to the truthfulness of that statement. In addressing that question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>we are guided by the principle that \u201c[njegligence or misjudgment, however gross, does not satisfy the knowledge element\u201d of fraud. <em>VF Corp., </em>350 Md. at 704, 715 A.2d 188 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Crystal\u2019s claim of fraud by intentional misrepresentation rests entirely on the competing diagnoses of Dr. Midei, Crystal\u2019s treating cardiologist, and Dr. Fischer, Crystal\u2019s \u201cqualified expert.\u201d In both the certificate of qualified expert and the report, accompanying that certificate, which were filed with Crystal\u2019s claim, Dr. Fischer opined that Dr. Midei had breached the standard of care by placing a stent \u201cwithout reasonable evidence that [it] was medically necessary.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, Dr. Fischer reviewed Crystal\u2019s medical file \u201cregarding the catheterization and stent placement by Dr. Midei,\u201d including the angiogram for that procedure. He deponed that, in reviewing the angiogram, he did not \u201csee anything that would even come close\u201d to the percentage of stenosis Dr. Midei had recorded. According to Dr. Fischer, Crystal\u2019s LAD had about a 30 to 40% stenosis, not the 70% indicated by Dr. Midei. \u201c[Y]ou never treat coronary artery disease with stents,\u201d Dr. Fischer declared, \u201cunless there is severe stenosis.\u201d But, at no time did he specify what level of stenosis constitutes \u201csevere stenosis\u201d or what a reasonable margin of error might be in reading an angiogram with the naked eye, the only available tool for making such an assessment at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A \u201cplaintiff obviously does not establish\u201d fraud by merely showing that \u201cobjectively false representations about the diagnosis and treatment\u201d were made. <em>Geisz v. Greater Balt. Med. Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 330, 545 A.2d 658 (1988). Fraud, as noted, does not \u201cencompass liability for negligent or grossly negligent representations.\u201d <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav., F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216, 238-39, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995). Similarly, the Court of Appeals has instructed that \u201cthe fraud exception\u201d to the statute of limitations, upon which Crystal relies in support of his contention that the limitations on his medical malpractice claims had been tolled, \u201ccannot be satisfied by evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>which demonstrates no more than negligence.\u201d <em>Geisz, </em>313 Md. at 328, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Crystal has provided no evidence that Dr. Midei knew his assessment of stenosis, whether it be 70 or 80%, was incorrect. The disparity between Dr. Fischer\u2019s testimony and the statements made by Dr. Midei suggests, at most, that Dr. Midei may have been negligent, perhaps even grossly negligent, in his diagnosis. And, as observed earlier, \u201ca difference of opinion concerning the applicable standard of care\u201d is insufficient to establish fraud. <em>Geisz, </em>313 Md. at 330, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Crystal further suggests that an inference of fraud can be drawn from the discrepancy between Dr. Midei\u2019s statement during catheterization, when he stated there was a 70% steno-sis, and his laboratory report, which stated that the level of stenosis was 80%. The difference in the two evaluations by Dr. Midei was evidence, Crystal claims, that Dr. Midei knew that his assessment of 70% was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">But there was no evidence that that discrepancy reflected anything more than a mistake made by Dr. Midei in recalling the level of stenosis shown by the angiogram, or a transcription or dictation error, or a misunderstanding by Crystal about what Dr. Midei had originally said, during the procedure, regarding the level of stenosis, or, perhaps, a lapse in memory when, during his deposition, Crystal \u201cparaphrased\u201d what Dr. Midei had said to him many years before. In any event, the mere difference between Dr. Midei\u2019s statement to Crystal during the procedure and the number recorded in the report does not, without more, permit a reasonable inference to be drawn that Dr. Midei knew his assessment of 70% stenosis was too high. In fact, it may suggest that Dr. Midei believed the level of stenosis in Crystal\u2019s LAD was at least 70 percent if not more.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Unable to show that Dr. Midei knew his assessment of 70% stenosis was false, Crystal\u2019s only remaining option was to present evidence showing that Dr. Midei was recklessly indifferent to the truth of his assessment. In our view, there was no evidence that he was. The difference of opinion, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>explained, may have been the result of a mistake or of a misjudgment amounting to negligence or even gross negligence, but there was no evidence of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">But, Crystal cites <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Med. Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 545 A.2d 658 (1988), for a contrary proposition. Steven Geisz had been diagnosed with \u201cHodgkin\u2019s disease,\u201d a form of cancer. <em>Geisz, </em>313 Md. at 305, 545 A.2d 658. His physician, George Richards, M.D., directed that Geisz receive several courses of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. <em>Id. </em>at 309, 545 A.2d 658. Unfortunately, after receiving those treatments, Geisz succumbed to that disease. <em>Id. </em>at 304, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Nearly ten years after his death, Geisz\u2019s former wife<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> read a newspaper article, detailing medical malpractice actions that had been filed, by other patients of Dr. Richards, against him. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 545 A.2d 658. \u201cAs a result of her having read [this] newspaper article,\u201d Geisz\u2019s former wife brought a wrongful death action, on behalf of their son, against Dr. Richards and the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, alleging medical malpractice, for courses of treatment that were \u201cimproperly conceived and administered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304-07, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Although the limitations period, on its wrongful death claim, appeared to have run, the estate maintained that it had not because it had been tolled by fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 545 A.2d 658. The fraud alleged by the estate was that Dr. Richards had misrepresented to Geisz and his former wife that \u201che had given [Geisz] every treatment available in the country, the best of treatments,\u201d but for some reason Geisz had not responded to those remedial measures, when, in fact, the courses of treatment received by Geisz \u201cfrom technicians acting at the direction of, and under the supervision of Dr. Richards, courses of treatment which the plaintiffs allege were improperly conceived and administered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306-11, 545 A.2d 658. This statement, Geisz\u2019s estate claimed, \u201ckept [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>estate] in ignorance of the cause of action\u201d that it may have had against Dr. Richards and the medical center. <em>Id. </em>at 307-OS, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The defendant doctor and the medical center then moved for summary judgment, contending that the claim was time-barred and that the statement at issue, made by Dr. Richards, did not amount to fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 545 A.2d 658. In response, the estate, in an attempt to show that the statement was made fraudulently, presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Richards, from another malpractice case pending against him. <em>Id. </em>at 311-12, 545 A.2d 658. In that deposition, Dr. Richards made statements suggesting, by implication, that \u201cportal films,\u201d that he had requested, may not have been done in the course of Mr. Geisz\u2019s treatment, which were necessary in determining whether the dispensed radiation had \u201creach[ed] into the.areas ... intended for radiation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Geisz\u2019s estate also presented reports, from its medical experts, stating that, in Geisz\u2019s case, the \u201ctreatment plans, calculations of dosages, and portal films were not done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 545 A.2d 658. This evidence, the estate suggested, showed that Dr. Richards had no factual basis for his statement to Steven Geisz and his former wife, assuring them that he had given Geisz the best possible treatment \u2014 a statement the estate relied upon in contending that the statute of limitations had been tolled on their claims by fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">After the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, the Court of Appeals reversed that judgment, holding that the estate\u2019s evidence generated a \u201cfact question\u201d of \u201cwhether Dr. Richards had a basis for representing that the particular cancer in Geisz had been treated, but for some inexplicable reason had withstood treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 545 A.2d 658. The Court observed that the estate had presented evidence that it was \u201cimpossible for Dr. Richards to determine whether the desired treatment had actually been received,\u201d despite his statements to Geisz that he had given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>him every available treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 333-34, 545 A.2d 658. That evidence, if believed, \u201ccould support,\u201d declared the Court, \u201ca finding of reckless indifference to the truth\u201d and thus a claim of fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 545 A.2d 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">But <em>Geisz </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant case. Unlike what occurred in Geisz, Dr. Midei did not tell Crystal that he had a 70% stenosis in his LAD without the appropriate test, nor did Dr. Midei make that statement while foregoing other necessary tests to establish the level of stenosis. Instead, Crystal\u2019s claim of reckless indifference rests entirely on the supposition that Dr. Midei was wrong \u2014 perhaps very wrong \u2014 in his assessment of the level of stenosis. But, as stated previously, evidence of negligence, \u201chowever gross,\u201d does not rise to the level of reckless indifference necessary to establish fraud. <em>VF Corp., </em>350 Md. at 704, 715 A.2d 188 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Moreover, it is worth noting several ways in which Dr. Fischer\u2019s testimony clearly stops short of crossing the threshold from negligence into gross negligence, let alone fraud. First, Dr. Fischer did not explain what the boundaries of stent-requiring stenosis are, that is, at what percentage of blockage should a doctor begin to consider placing a stent. Thus, while Dr. Fischer did opine that Dr. Midei\u2019s assessment of the stenosis fell below the standard of care, it is unclear exactly how unreasonable that assessment was. Second, although Dr. Fischer stated that \u201cyou never treat coronary artery disease with stents unless there is severe stenosis,\u201d he never indicated what minimum percentage of blockage constitutes \u201csevere\u201d stenosis. Third, there is presumably a margin of error involved when a doctor estimates the percentage of stenosis in an artery from an angiogram, particularly where that evaluation is performed, as was the case here, by the naked eye.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But, Dr. Fischer did not explain what that typical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>margin of error would be. Fourth and finally, Dr. Fischer offered no opinion as to Crystal\u2019s prior medical history and whether his prior instances of severe stenosis would lower the level at which a doctor would recommend the implantation of a stent.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In sum, although the inference could be drawn, from the evidence presented below that negligence had occurred, that has no bearing on Crystal\u2019s fraud claim. Fraud requires knowledge of the falseness of the statement, or at least a reckless indifference as to the truthfulness of the statement made by the defendant, whereas negligence does not. And, \u2022without evidence that Dr. Midei knowingly misstated the percentage of stenosis in Crystal\u2019s LAD, or that he was recklessly indifferent to what that percentage of stenosis was, Crystal\u2019s claim of fraud by misrepresentation could not withstand summary judgment and thus the circuit court did not err in granting that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Fraud By Concealment</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We turn now to Crystal\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment, in favor of SJMC, on his claim that the medical center had committed fraudulent concealment by not disclosing Dr. Midei\u2019s purported history of negligence and fraud. In addressing this issue, we begin with a brief description of Crystal\u2019s inconsistent, and somewhat confusing, assertion of that claim. Crystal alleged, in his complaint, that SJMC was liable for fraud by concealment because, prior to his procedure in 2004, the medical center had \u201cactual knowledge that Dr. Midei was negligently and fraudulently advising his patients to undergo unnecessary stent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>procedures.\u201d Then, later in his complaint, Crystal stated that SJMC had a \u201cduty to disclose\u201d such information to Crystal, but failed to do so. After discovery, however, Crystal, in his response to appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment, offered a different theory of liability, stating that \u201cSJMC is liable for the fraudulent concealment acts of Dr. Midei.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The circuit court properly granted summary judgment as to the claim of fraud by concealment. In so doing, the court understandably chose to address only the theory of liability in Crystal\u2019s complaint, because, as that court put it, it was \u201cnot aware of any authority for the proposition that SJMC or any health care provider, generally, has a duty to disclose to patients prior instances of medical malpractice.\u201d It then added that \u201ceven if [SJMC] had a duty to disclose this information, there is no evidence that [SJMC] had information to disclose at the time of Crystal\u2019s procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On appeal, Crystal concedes, in his brief, that \u201cthe court properly found that there was no evidence that SJMC was on notice of Dr. Midei\u2019s pattern of negligence or fraud prior to [his] surgery\u201d and that the court was correct in stating that \u201cthere is no evidence that [SJMC] engaged in any misconduct, should have known about misconduct, or should have investigated any misconduct at the time of [the 2004 procedure].\u201d Nevertheless, Crystal now contends, as he did in his response to the motion for summary judgment but not in his complaint, that the circuit court erred in granting of summary judgment as to the claim of fraud by concealment because \u201cthe asserted basis of liability by SJMC under [fraud by concealment] was the vicarious liability of SJMC for its employee, Dr. Midei,\u2014 not SJMC\u2019s own failure to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We decline to address Crystal\u2019s suggestion, on appeal, that SJMC was vicariously liable for Dr. Midei, as that theory of liability contradicts what Crystal stated in his complaint. Instead, we review the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based upon the grounds relied upon in the record. To prevail on a claim of fraudulent concealment, a plaintiff must show that</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(I) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff to disclose a material fact; (2) the defendant failed to disclose that fact; (3) the defendant intended to defraud or deceive the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff took action in justifiable reliance on the concealment; and (5) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><em>Lloyd v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>397 Md. 108, 138, 916 A.2d 257 (2007) (internal citations omitted). \u201cA fraudulent concealment claim is caused, in part,\u201d the Court of Appeals has said, \u201cby the intentional failure to warn.\u201d <em>Lloyd, </em>397 Md. at 138-39, 916 A.2d 257. It is clear that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment because there was no evidence, as even Crystal concedes, that SJMC knew or should have known about Dr. Midei\u2019s alleged prior misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Medical Malpractice</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Finally, we turn to Crystal\u2019s remaining contention that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment as to his medical malpractice claims. Although, Crystal concedes that he did not file his complaint within the required five-year statute of limitations period,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he believes that his claim, contrary to the circuit court\u2019s finding, was not time-barred because it was tolled by a showing of fraud under \u00a7 5-203, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">That tolling provision provides: \u201cIf the knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. and Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203. The alleged fraud, Crystal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>maintains, was Dr. Midei\u2019s purported misrepresentation, during the procedure, about the 70% level of stenosis in Crystal\u2019s LAD. But, as previously discussed, Crystal did not present any evidence that Dr. Midei made what could be found to be a fraudulent statement to induce the stent implantation at issue. Therefore, without any evidence of fraud that would toll the statute of limitations, the circuit court was impelled to find, as it did, that Crystal\u2019s remaining medical malpractice claims were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.
