Phillip Martin (\u201cMartin\u201d or \u201cAppellant\u201d) was a minority owner and assumed management of Best &amp; Brady\u2019s daily operations under a two-year employment contract. Immediately after its formation Best &amp; Brady encountered numerous problems and began losing money. Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady was never profitable, and, by May 2011, ran out of cash. Shortly thereafter, TWP Enterprises, Inc., (\u201cTWP\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d) bought the ephemeral company\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">On October 7, 2013, Martin filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, against Best &amp; Brady and TWP seeking unpaid wages and compensation under his employment contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After obtaining a default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>judgment against Best &amp; Brady,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Martin pursued TWP for satisfaction of the judgment. The circuit court held a bench trial on August 5 and 6, 2014, on the sole issue of TWP\u2019s successor liability. Martin claimed that TWP was a mere continuation of Best &amp; Brady and, therefore, liable under the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception to the general rule that successor corporations do not assume the liabilities of selling corporations. The circuit court disagreed, finding that TWP is not a mere continuation of Best &amp; Brady and, therefore, was not liable for the default judgment against Best &amp; Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Maryland law establishes that the function of the \u201cmere \u2022 continuation\u201d exception is to prevent corporations from purchasing assets solely for the purpose of placing those assets out of the reach of the predecessor\u2019s creditors. We hold that a court may consider the purpose of the asset sale and the adequacy of consideration as additional factors in its analysis of whether the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception should apply. We affirm the circuit court\u2019s determination in this case that TWP is not a mere continuation of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Martin is the third-generation owner of a family lumber distribution business, Best Building Components, LLC (\u201cBBC\u201d). Headquartered in Maugansville, Maryland, BBC distributes lumber and sells home heating oil wholesale. Before 2010, BBC also manufactured roof trusses and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>engineered wood products (\u201cEWP\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> TWP, a Maryland stock corporation formed in 1999, is a retailer of lumber and hardware in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area and was a customer of BBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Prior Negotiations</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Martin testified during the trial held on August 5 and 6, 2014, that, in 2009, he entered into discussions with the President and CEO of TWP, Michael Cassidy (\u201cCassidy\u201d), and the Treasurer, James Twigg (\u201cTwigg\u201d), about forming a business partnership for the dual purpose of providing support for Martin, whose EWP business was not showing a profit following the 2008 collapse of the housing industry, and developing a reliable source of EWP and roof trusses for TWP. In early November 2009, the parties signed an \u201cOutline Letter,\u201d or letter of intent, which was amended to reflect that TWP and Martin had agreed to involve Jeff Brady, principal owner of Brady Fabrications, Inc., another roof truss manufacturer, in the discussions and negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">On December 7, 2009, the parties exchanged an \u201cAcquisition Term Sheet\u201d for TWP and BBC. The Acquisition Term Sheet evidenced TWP\u2019s intent to assemble assets purchased from BBC, assets of TWP, and \u201cpotentially others\u201d and combine them to form a new limited liability company that would eventually become Best &amp; Brady. TWP would contribute money to the venture through Truss Investors, LLC (\u201cTruss\u201d) \u2014 a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of TWP.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because a number of Martin\u2019s customers were lumber companies that competed with TWP, TWP \u201cdisguised\u201d its involvement in the business venture by creating Truss. Through its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>subsidiary, Truss, TWP would purchase certain assets from Martin and BBC, among others, and operate Best &amp; Brady out of Woodbine, Maryland, which was the location of Brady Fabrication, Inc. Truss would own the majority interest in Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, and Martin was to be an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Terms of Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The terms of Martin\u2019s employment with Best &amp; Brady were set out in an offer letter a few weeks before the company was formally created. The offer letter from Cassidy, TWP\u2019s President and CEO, was dated February 1, 2010, and was countersigned by Martin in March 2010. The letter guaranteed Martin\u2019s employment of a \u201cpart time nature\u201d for two years following \u201cclosing\u201d on the purchase of BBC\u2019s and Brady Fabrication\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Martin was to receive a monthly salary of $10,000.00 over the two-year period. Martin\u2019s principal objective was to integrate the roof truss manufacturing and EWP businesses of BBC and Brady Fabrications into Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady. Thus, his responsibilities included maintaining customer relationships, securing ongoing business, developing and growing ongoing sales relationships, maintaining ongoing distributor relationships, developing a marketing plan, supervising staff, and implementing an annual strategic business planning process. The offer letter also allowed Martin to act as a \u201cpurchasing agent\u201d and to supply wood from his wholesale lumber business for the roof truss plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The offer letter also addressed the requisites of a termination:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In the event that Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady Components terminates you prior to 24 months following the closing without cause, Best &amp; Brady will continue to pay the terminated individual a monthly amount of $10,000 less taxes and other withholding required by law, until such a time as the second year would have been completed. If you are terminated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>cause, which will be narrowly defined ... neither Best and Brady nor TW Perry will have any obligation to pay the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The offer letter further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">For the purposes of clarity, nothing in this letter, nor in any other written or unwritten policies or practices of the Company create, nor are they intended to create an express or implied contract, covenant, promise, or representation of continued employment, nor of any particular assignment or position, for any employee. Employment with the Company is \u201cat-will,\u201d which means that employment may be terminated at any time at the option of either the employee or the Company for any reason not prohibited by law. No officer, manager, supervisor, employee, or representative of the Company other than the President and the CEO, has the authority to change the at-will nature of the employment relationship and then, only in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">BBC Assets Purchase</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In March 2010, Martin, as sole shareholder of BBC, entered into an \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d for the purpose of selling BBC\u2019s assets to Best &amp; Brady. Best &amp; Brady agreed to purchase various assets of BBC, including trucks and equipment, inventory, intellectual property, and customer lists and records, for a sum of $139,570.00, payable in cash and a 7.5% membership interest in Best &amp; Brady. BBC would continue to operate, and Martin agreed to change BBC\u2019s name to one \u201cnot ... confusingly similar\u201d to \u201cBest Building Components, LLC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">As evidenced by the written integration plan provided on TWP letterhead, Best &amp; Brady was an integration of Brady Fabrications, Inc., and BBC. Martin testified that, following the integration Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady\u2019s \u201cback office\u201d operations\u2014 including accounting, hiring, IT, credit checks, and payroll\u2014 were conducted in large part by employees of TWP, who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>paid by TWP.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Martin managed Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady\u2019s sales force and occasionally referred to himself as \u201cPresident\u201d of Best &amp; Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Operating Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady\u2019s Operating Agreement, effective March 9, 2010, established two classes of members for Best &amp; Brady. \u201cClass A\u201d members consisted of Martin, Brady, and Dave Walstad (a third potential investor who later decided not to participate in the venture). Martin owned 7.5%, Brady owned 10%, and Walstad was to own 2.5% of Best &amp; Brady. Truss was the sole \u201cClass B\u201d member, owning an eighty percent interest in Best &amp; Brady. All class members agreed to contribute cash and assets to Best &amp; Brady in exchange for their membership interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Under the Operating Agreement Truss was authorized to set the number of managers of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, and had the \u201cexclusive right\u201d to designate or replace at-will managers. Advance written consent of Truss was required for any significant management decisions for Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, which Truss had \u201csole and absolute discretion\u201d to make. Best &amp; Brady\u2019s managers were Martin, Brady, Cassidy, Twigg, and Gary Bowman (\u201cBowman\u201d). Cassidy, Twigg, and Bowman were senior employees or officers of TWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Failing Fast</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Best &amp; Brady encountered a number of problems following its start up in March 2010.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Best &amp; Brady had difficulty completing orders on time and had to subcontract orders out to other distributors. On September 30, 2010, management met at TWP offices to discuss \u201cfirm revenue projections,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cplans to increase revenues,\u201d immediate cost-cutting options, and \u201coperational improvements.\u201d Best &amp; Brady brought in Henry Whitlow, a business consultant, to provide suggestions for improving sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Around this time, Best &amp; Brady\u2019s managers, including Martin, discussed a reduction in all salaries. On October 18, 2010, Martin sent Cassidy a chart showing, among other salary cuts, a 20% pay cut for his base salary. In October 2010, Martin\u2019s pay was cut $4,670.00 per month, and, although Martin attempted to negotiate a note for the deficit, no note was ever created. It is unclear from the record how long the pay cut lasted. However, in January 2011, Cassidy e-mailed Twigg and Martin stating that he talked to Martin that day about cutting Martin\u2019s pay again and allowing him to recoup the balance conditioned on Best &amp; Brady\u2019s ability to pay off its expenses. In response, Martin agreed to \u201csunset\u201d a portion of his salary, but he disagreed that recouping the balance could be made conditional on Best &amp; Brady\u2019s \u201c \u2018performance\u2019 issues.\u201d Martin cited his employment agreement and argued that the \u201cwording puts the ultimate payment of the 10,000 x 24 out of the reach of \u2018performance\u2019 issues as long as Best &amp; Brady exists to pay it, these payments (even if deferred) are the obligation of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In March 2011, Truss and several TWP senior employees lent Best &amp; Brady $425,000.00. Despite this loan, Best &amp; Brady ran out of cash by the end of May, and no party was willing to provide the company an additional infusion of capital. In May 2011, TWP began absorbing additional accounting and administrative costs, as well as a percentage of the labor costs. Around that time, the managers of Best &amp; Brady \u2014 including Martin, Brady, Cassidy, and Twigg \u2014 met to consider numerous options, including bankruptcy and orderly liquidation of the business. Martin was strongly opposed to filing for bankruptcy because Best &amp; Brady owed Martin approximately $300,000.00 as a trade creditor through his company BBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>On May 25, 2011, in order to cut costs further, Cassidy requested the names of Best &amp; Brady employees that could be let go. On May 31, after the above mentioned manager\u2019s meeting that Martin attended, a list was provided to Cassidy with Martin\u2019s name that stated he was \u201c[n]o [l]onger employed with Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady-Phil [Martin] is already aware of this.\u201d There is disagreement in the record as to whether Martin voluntarily resigned during the meeting or whether Martin, as he claims, was fired. Martin continued selling materials for Best &amp; Brady as a commissioned salesman and acting as its vendor. Martin testified that he no longer attended management meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Best &amp; Brady Assets Purchase</p>\n<p id=\"ABi\">A few months later Best &amp; Brady management made the decision to sell the assets of the failing company to TWP. On August 31, 2011, Martin and Brady both signed a \u201cCertificate and Consent of Members and Release.\u201d The document provided that Martin would resign as an officer and co-manager of Best &amp; Brady, transfer all of his membership interest to Truss, and that:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Organizational Documents, the Members hereby authorize the Company to (i) transfer all of its assets to [TWP] in exchange for TWP\u2019s assumption of all outstanding debt of the Company as set forth on Exhibit \u201cA\u201d attached hereto; and (ii) execute and deliver such assignments, bills of sale, documents and other agreements ... to effectuate the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The \u201cBill of Sale,\u201d effective August 31, 2011, signed by Cassidy, Martin, Brady, Twigg, and Bowman, encapsulated the parties\u2019 agreement to assign certain \u201cPurchased Assets\u201d from Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady to TWP. Among those purchased assets were equipment and tangible assets, rebates due from all vendors, all contracts, claims and rights relating to or arising out of the business, and all customer lists, customer records and information relating to the business. The \u201cLiabilities Assumed\u201d as set forth in \u201cSchedule A\u201d included accounts payable, line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>credit, taxes payable, accrued liabilities and note payable equipment. Ultimately, TWP assumed $1,162,160.00 in liabilities, including approximately $300,000.00 owed to Martin as a trade creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In its memorandum opinion, the court summarized what occurred next:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">TWP continued in the business of truss design and manufacture, operating from Woodbine, Maryland. For a time, it did business as \u201cBest and Brady\u201d or \u201cB &amp; B.\u201d Mr. Brady became an employee of TWP but not an owner. TWP continued to provide \u201cback office\u201d support. TWP no longer had an in-house sales staff for the truss business and relied on independent salesmen of which [Martin] was one. Mr. Butcher no longer supervised the independent salesmen. Some of BBC\u2019s former employees now worked for TWP. TWP sold to some of the same clients, some of whom had been transitioned to B <em>&amp; </em>B from BBC. TWP continued to use the same software as [Best &amp; Brady] and the same sales report format. Martin continued to be a vendor to TWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Martin\u2019s Compensation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">During his employment with Best &amp; Brady, Martin received $78,153.79 in regular salary in 2010, and $45,476.27 in regular salary in 2011. In 2011, Martin received an additional $20,005.52 from Best &amp; Brady as compensation for his commissioned sales. In 2012, Martin received an additional $20,080.34 from TWP as compensation for his commissioned sales.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Martin received a total of $163,715.92 in compensation from Best &amp; Brady or TWP from 2010 through 2012. However, Martin testified that he was only willing to credit Best &amp; Brady for compensation he received during the 24 month period outlined in his employment agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Martin\u2019s computations, the compensation he received during this time totaled to $147,169.51, leaving $92,830.49 remaining of his claim from the $240,000 compensation guaranteed in his employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">On October 7, 2013, Martin filed a complaint against Best &amp; Brady and TWP, alleging in Count I that Best &amp; Brady violated the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Act. Martin claimed that Best &amp; Brady violated the Act by (1) unilaterally reducing his wages without his written consent or any other authorization, and (2) failing to pay him the wages due to him under the Agreement. Martin sought treble damages amounting to $279,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In Count II Martin alleged Best &amp; Brady breached the Employment Agreement by failing to pay him the guaranteed compensation due and demanded $93,000.00 in compensatory damages. In Count III, Martin claimed that TWP was liable for Best &amp; Brady\u2019s violation of the Act under the \u201ctheory of successor liability\u201d because TWP was a mere continuation of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady. TWP filed an answer on December 10, 2013, denying any obligation to pay Martin and reserving the right to plead any defenses available to Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady if TWP was found liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Following notice from Montgomery County Circuit Court that Best &amp; Brady had not filed an answer or request for default \u2014 Martin filed a motion for an order of default against Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, which was granted by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on January 10, 2014. Following an <em>ex parte </em>hearing, the court entered an order of judgment on March 12, 2014, in favor of Martin against Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, in the principal sum of $278,490.00 with interest in the sum of $11,064.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>On March 14, 2014, TWP filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that TWP was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Martin filed an opposition to the motion on April 1, 2014 and the court denied summary judgment on April 8, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On June 13, 2014, TWP filed a memorandum before trial arguing that (1) TWP is not a mere continuation of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady and, therefore, is not liable to Martin, (2) Martin is estopped from pursuing his claim because he agreed to modify his contract when he actively participated in the sale of Best &amp; Brady, and (3) \u201cMartin is not entitled to treble damages under Md.Code, L &amp; E \u00a7 3-507.2 because the bulk of his claim is for breach of contract damages, not wages, and because the wage component was withheld in good faith.\u201d On July 28, 2014, Martin filed his own memorandum before trial, arguing that, because TWP continued operating Best &amp; Brady after the purchase from the same location, with the same employees, under the same trade name, that TWP was a mere continuation of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady and assumed the liabilities of Best &amp; Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">At trial Martin testified that after the completion of the sale he had no way of knowing what happened to Best &amp; Brady; however, he claimed there was no noticeable change in the operation of Best &amp; Brady. Martin offered the testimony of Gregory Martin (no relation to Martin), a self-employed roof truss salesman and co-owner of BBC. Gregory Martin was hired as an employee of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady in March of 2010 as a road salesman. He was employed by Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady as a commissioned salesman at the time of the asset sale between Best &amp; Brady and TWP. Gregory Martin testified that there was no announcement that Best &amp; Brady was under new ownership or management, operations of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady remained the same, Best &amp; Brady\u2019s name appeared on the vehicles used by the company, and all paperwork continued using the Best &amp; Brady name and logo. However, during cross-examination, Gregory Martin admitted that the checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>he received \u201chad a different name,\u201d and he began receiving tax forms from TWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Martin examined Edward Quinn, the majority owner and chairman of TWP, who had stated in his deposition that he thought Best &amp; Brady still existed. However, during testimony, Mr. Quinn clarified that \u201c[t]he line of business continues. The entity is different.\u201d Mr. Quinn testified that the ownership structure, operation, and management had changed, with Brady taking over as general manager. Cassidy further clarified that the roof truss business had become a \u201cnew division inside of [TWP].\u201d Cassidy and Brady acknowledged a change in management from Martin to Brady after the asset sale to TWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The trial judge entered her opinion and order on September 29, 2014, concluding that \u201cMartin has demonstrated no basis upon which to hold TWP liable for non-payment of wages or breach of contract by [Best &amp; Brady].\u201d After observing the general rule that a corporation that acquires the assets of another corporation is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the predecessor corporation, the court noted that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the \u2018mere continuation exception\u2019 applie[d] to affix liability on TWP.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion was based on its findings that (1) there was no evidence that the transaction was for the purpose of avoiding liability to Martin; (2) TWP provided Best &amp; Brady adequate consideration; and (3) while there was substantial overlap in management, control, and ownership, this overlap was not determinative \u201cgiven the degree of overlap that always existed between Best &amp; Brady and TWP.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Martin filed a notice of appeal on October 28, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Martin presents the following issues on appeal, which we have reworded slightly for clarity:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>I. Did the trial court err by applying the fraud exception rather than the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception to the general rule that a successor corporation is not liable for the debts and liabilities of its predecessor corporation?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">II. Did the asset purchase by TWP of its own subsidiary, Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, and continuation of TWP under the same or similar management as Best &amp; Brady, impose liability upon TWP for Best &amp; Brady\u2019s debts under the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">On appeal of an action tried without a jury, an appellate court is bound by the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Md. Rule 8-131 (c); <em>see also Cunningham, v. Feinberg, </em>441 Md. 310, 321-22, 107 A.3d 1194 (2015). The trial court\u2019s legal determinations and conclusions of law typically receive no deference and are reviewed <em>de novo. See Shih Ping Li v. Tzu Lee, </em>437 Md. 47, 57, 85 A.3d 144 (2014); <em>State v. Neger, </em>427 Md. 582, 595, 50 A.3d 591 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>(2012). However, where the mixed question of law and fact has a heavier factual component, as does the case at hand, it is subject to a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d review. <em>Farmers Bank of Maryland v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>163 Md.App. 158, 188, 877 A.2d 1145 (2005) (citing <em>State v. Jones, </em>103 Md.App. 548, 590, 653 A.2d 1040 (1995) <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Jones v.

In <em>Isle of Thye, </em>the articles of transfer evidencing the sale of all of the predecessor corporation\u2019s assets to the successor corporation was never filed with the State. <em>Id. </em>at 706, 279 A.2d 484.

This Court determined there was a fraudulent conveyance satisfying Comm. \u00a7 15-207, where, coupled with Mrs. Colandrea\u2019s intent to defraud, the predecessor corporation paid the operating expenses of the successor corporation for the first year without receiving any consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 401 A.2d 480.

Our common law directs that the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception applies to hold liable \u201cthe purchasing corporation [that] maintains the same or similar management and ownership but wears a \u2018new hat.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore Luggage, supra, </em>80 Md.App. at 297, 562 A.2d 1286 (quoting <em>Bud Antle, Inc. v.

We turn now to examine Appellant\u2019s questions and the theory of liability underlying this third exception as first applied in <em>Baltimore </em>Luggage,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and further developed in <em>Nissen Corporation v. Miller, </em>823 Md. 613, 594 A.2d 564 (1991), and <em>Academy of IRM v.

Martin argues that ascertaining the purpose of an asset sale is a function in applying the fraud exception \u2014 the fourth exception to the general rule against successor liability \u2014 and that, by examining the purpose, the circuit court improperly blended the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception with the fraud exception in this case. Further to this point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Martin argues that the circuit court erred by examining the consideration involved and by determining that TWP\u2019s purchase of Best &amp; Brady\u2019s assets was \u201cnot without adequate consideration.\u201d Martin contends that whether or not there was adequate consideration may be relevant in a fraudulent transaction exception analysis but should not be dispositive of whether the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception applies. Martin asserts that the circuit court should have instead focused solely on the \u201ccontinuation of the same or similar ownership and management of [Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady] after the asset sale to TWP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Defending the circuit court\u2019s decision, TWP argues that the court properly examined the purpose of the asset sale and accurately found that the sale was for the purpose of salvaging a failing business. TWP cites to <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md.App. at 297, 562 A.2d 1286, which held that failure to consider factors beyond common management and ownership \u201cis to disregard the separate identities of the corporation without the necessary considerations that justify such an action.\u201d Based on the holding in <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>TWP contends that the circuit court correctly looked beyond the mere continuation of management and ownership to find that TWP was not liable for Martin\u2019s employment agreement with Best &amp; Brady. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The Weight of Consideration and the Purpose of the Transaction Are Proper Factors in a \u201cMere Continuation\u201d Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In Maryland, only three cases have addressed the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception to the general rule against successor liability: <em>Academy of IRM, </em>344 Md. at 451-57, 687 A.2d 669; <em>Nissen Corp., </em>323 Md. at 619-33, 594 A.2d 564; and <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md.App. at 296-99, 562 A.2d 1286. In none did the Court conclude that the successor corporation was a mere continuation of the predecessor corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">In the leading case, <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>Judge Rosalyn Bell, writing for this Court, explained that \u201cthe underlying theory of the [\u201cmere continuation\u201d exception] is that, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>corporation goes through a mere change in form without a significant change in substance, it should not be allowed to escape liability.\u201d <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md.App. at 297, 562 A.2d 1286. Judge Bell instructed that the \u201cindicia of continuation\u201d are</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">common officers, directors, and stockholders; and only one corporation in existence after the completion of the sale of assets. While the two foregoing factors are traditionally indications of a continuing corporation, neither is essential. Other factors, such as continuation of the seller\u2019s business practices and policies and the sufficiency of consideration running to the seller corporation in light of the assets being sold may also be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citing 15 W. Fletcher, Cyc. Corp. (Cum. Supp. 1988). (Emphasis added)). Judge Bell emphasized that \u201c[t]o find that continuity exists merely because there was common management and ownership without considering other factors is to disregard the separate identities of the corporation without the necessary considerations that justify such an action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>much like the case on appeal, involved the question of whether the successor corporation assumed certain obligations contained in an employment agreement entered into between the predecessor corporation and its employee. <em>Id. </em>at 285-86, 562 A.2d 1286. This Court determined that the successor corporation was not a \u201cmere continuation\u201d of the predecessor corporation because there was a change in ownership and management, the predecessor corporation continued in existence after the sale, and there was sufficient consideration for the purchase.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 298-99, 562 A.2d 1286. Judge Bell observed that the fact that the owner of the predecessor corporation retained a minority interest in the successor corporation was not sufficient to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>successor corporation a mere continuation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 298, 562 A.2d 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In Nissen, a products liability case, the Court of Appeals analyzed whether a successor corporation can be held liable under the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception for injuries resulting from a defective treadmill manufactured by the predecessor corporation. 323 Md. at 615-20, 594 A.2d 564. The asset purchase agreement in <em>Nissen </em>expressly excluded assumption of liability for injuries arising from any product previously sold by the predecessor corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 594 A.2d 564. Writing for the Court, Judge Howard S. Chasanow observed that \u201c[tjhere is no reason to believe that [the transfer of assets] was not an arm\u2019s length transaction or that [the predecessor corporation] did not receive and retain full value for its assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, although the successor company did, for example, hire some of the predecessor corporation\u2019s employees, the circumstances surrounding the sale of assets in <em>Nissen </em>did not fall within any of the traditional exceptions to the rule of nonliability of corporate successors. <em>Id. </em>at 616, 620, 594 A.2d 564. The Court of Appeals was, therefore, urged to adopt a fifth exception under the \u201ccontinuity of the enterprise theory\u201d in order to hold the successor corporation liable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 621, 594 A.2d 564. The Court declined to adopt a fifth exception to the general rule of successor liability.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Judge Chasanow\u2019s explication of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>distinction between the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception and the \u201ccontinuation of the entity\u201d theory is instructive:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The mere continuation of continuity or entity exception applies where \u2018there is a continuation of directors and management, shareholder interest and, in some cases, inadequate consideration. The gravamen of the traditional \u2018mere continuation\u2019 exception is the continuation of the <em>corporate entity </em>rather than the continuation of the business operation.... This exception focuses on the continuation of management and ownership. In contrast, the continuity of <em>enterprise </em>theory focuses on continuation of the business operation or enterprise where there is not continuation in ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 618-20, 594 A.2d 564 (bold emphasis added) (quoting Frumer &amp; M. Friedman, Products Liability \u00a7 2.06[2][c] (1989); 1 <em>American Law of Products Liability, </em>\u00a7 7:14, at 30; 7:20 at 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The most recent Maryland case to examine the elements of the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception, <em>Academy of IRM v. LVI Environmental Services, Inc., supra, </em>added an additional factor to its analysis \u2014 the <em>purpose </em>of the asset sale. 344 Md. at 451, 687 A.2d 669. In <em>Academy of IRM, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the reversal of the circuit court, holding that a successor corporation that acquired the assets of the predecessor corporation through a foreclosure of <em>bona fide </em>security interests purchased for value was not liable for the debts of its predecessor where: (1) no former shareholder held any ownership in the successor, (2) no shareholder of the predecessor became a director of the successor, (3) only two employees of predecessor were now employed by the successor, but were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>not \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the transfer, and (4) adequate consideration was paid by the successor. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 457, 687 A.2d 669. The Court explained that the lower court erroneously applied the continuity of enterprise analysis rather than the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception by focusing on whether the successor corporation operated out of the predecessor corporation\u2019s old site using the predecessor\u2019s former employees and equipment, \u201cwithout examining whether there was a continuation of the entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451-52, 687 A.2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In addition to the factors analyzed in <em>Baltimore Luggage </em>and <em>Nissen, </em>the Court of Appeals also considered the purpose of the asset sale. <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 687 A.2d 669. The Court noted that \u201cthere [was] no finding by the circuit court that any aspect of the acquisition by [the successor] of the former assets of Debtor was fraudulent as to unsecured creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that, where the transaction was not fraudulent as to unsecured creditors, \u201csuccessor entity liability does not lie.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Academy of IRM, </em>the Court was guided by a decision of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, <em>Jackson v. Diamond T. Trucking Co., </em>100 N.J.Super. 186, 241 A.2d 471 (1968), employing \u201cfive criteria for imposing continuing entity liability.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 457, 687 A.2d 669. Although, in <em>Academy of IRM, </em>the Court of Appeals did not decide whether to endorse the five criteria, it did specifically apply two criteria\u2014 determining in that case that inadequate consideration and a common officer who was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the transfer were not demonstrated by the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">In <em>Jackson, </em>the Supreme Court of Rhode Island observed during its analysis of the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>... suppose that in <em>Parsons, </em>[successor corporation] had paid full consideration for the transfer of assets from [predecessor corporation] and further that [predecessor corporation] continued in existence as a holding company. In such case there would be no need or reason to pursue the new corporation despite the fact that there were common personnel and despite the fact the new corporation continued the business of the old.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In other words, the factual conclusion that the transferee corporation is a continuation of the transferor corporation does not inexorably lead to the legal conclusion that the transferee is therefore liable for its transferor\u2019s obligations. Many facts and policy factors must be weighed in the balance, most importantly, the policy protecting corporate creditors must be weighed against the equally important policy respecting separate corporate entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">241 A.2d at 476-77. We also find the Supreme Court of Rhode Island persuasive in its analysis of the purpose and effect of the transaction when deciding whether to apply the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception. It is clear that, even where a court has determined that the ownership and management of a corporation has continued, it may examine \u201cother factors\u201d to determine whether the policy reasons underlying the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception are served by finding successor liability. <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md.App. at 297, 562 A.2d 1286. \u201c[0]ther factors\u201d considered by this Court and the Court of Appeals in <em>Academy of IRM </em>have included an analysis of whether applying the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception would, in the transaction at issue, serve to prevent corporations from purposefully placing assets out of the reach of the predecessor\u2019s creditors. <em>See also </em>Md. Corp. L. \u00a7 9.10 (\u201cThe most important factors in determining whether the transferee is the \u201cmere continuation\u201d of the transferor are the ownership of the seller and the buyer and the <em>purpose of the transaction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The Court of Appeals and this Court, in <em>Baltimore Luggage, Nissen, </em>and <em>Academy of IRM, </em>looked beyond the traditional indications of continuation \u2014 whether the purchasing corporation maintained the same or similar management and ownership as the selling corporation \u2014 to other factors that not only evidence the continuation of the corporate entity, but also examine the underlying purpose of the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception. Taken together, these cases contain analysis of the following factors: (1) any change in ownership and management, (2) the continued existence of the selling corporation, (3) the adequacy of consideration, (4) the transfer of any \u201cinstrumental\u201d employees from the predecessor to the successor, and (5) the purpose of the asset sale. <em>Academy of IRM, </em>344 Md. at 452-57, 687 A.2d 669; <em>Nissen, </em>323 Md. at 616, 621, 594 A.2d 564; <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md.App. at 298-99, 562 A.2d 1286. In all three cases, the Courts assessed the adequacy of consideration as a factor and consistently found the exception did not apply where consideration was adequate, although none of the cited cases relied <em>solely </em>on the adequacy of consideration in their conclusions. <em>Academy of IRM, </em>344 Md. at 457, 687 A.2d 669; <em>Nissen, </em>323 Md. at 615-20, 594 A.2d 564; <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md.App. at 299, 562 A.2d 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In the case before us on appeal, the circuit court held that the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception did not apply to \u201caffix liability on TWP\u201d after examining the management, control and ownership of the two corporations, and finding that purpose of the transaction was not to prevent creditors from accessing Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady\u2019s assets and that there was adequate consideration (TWP assuming $1,162,160.00 of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady\u2019s liabilities). Indeed, the court noted that the decision to sell the assets to TWP, rather than declare bankruptcy, permitted Martin (a trade creditor for nearly a third of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady\u2019s outstanding liabilities) to receive approximately $300,000.00 in unpaid receivables. Although Best &amp; Brady was then unable to pay Martin the difference between the $163,175.92 in compensation that he actually received, from the $240,000.00 that was contained in his offer letter from Best &amp; Brady, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>record is clear that Martin, as a creditor, was protected by the decision to sell the assets to TWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We hold that the circuit court did not err in examining the adequacy of consideration and the purpose of the asset sale in its analysis of the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception to successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">A Mere Continuation?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Martin does not challenge the circuit court\u2019s factual findings, but contends that the court, considering all of the facts, erred when it failed to conclude that TWP was liable under the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Martin claims that TWP essentially owned Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady because its subsidiary, Truss, held 80% of the company\u2019s stock. Thus, TWP\u2019s purchase of Best &amp; Brady\u2019s assets amounted to a continuation of the entity through TWP\u2019s continued ownership and operation. To support this contention, Martin points to the following facts: (1) TWP continued to use the trade name \u201cBest &amp; Brady,\u201d (2) TWP continued to manufacture roof trusses and EWP at the Woodbine plant, (8) TWP retained the same employees and sold to the same customers, (4) TWP increased its ownership in the company from 80% to 100%, and, (5) TWP retained the same management, \u201cincluding Cassidy ... Brady ... Jackie Shirk ... and Thatcher Butcher.\u201d Martin asserts that the circuit court acknowledged these facts but \u201c[d]espite these findings, the court refused to recognize the continuation of the entity____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The circuit court found that TWP was not liable to Martin for any non-payment of wages or breach of contract by Best &amp; Brady for several reasons. The court examined the common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ality of the officers, directors, and stockholders, finding that: Mr. Brady became an employee of TWP but not an owner; TWP continued to provide \u201cback office\u201d support; TWP no longer had an in-house sales staff for the roof truss business and relied on independent salesmen of which [Martin] was one; and Mr. Butcher no longer supervised the independent salesmen. The court concluded that, because both \u201cbefore and after the asset sale\u201d Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady and TWP had \u201csubstantial overlap\u201d in management, control, and ownership, such overlap was not determinative because \u201cthis is not an instance in which management of one stand-alone entity uses its authority merely to change \u2018hats\u2019 and manage a new stand-alone entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Relying on <em>Baltimore Luggage </em>and <em>Academy of IRM, </em>the court trained on the purpose of the asset transfer and concluded that \u201c[t]he weight of the evidence shows that [Best &amp; Brady\u2019s] decision to sell its assets to TWP was not merely a change of form for the purpose of placing these assets beyond [Martin\u2019s] reach as he pursued his claim for what remained of the $240,000 in guaranteed payments. Rather the decision to sell was an attempt to salvage what could be salvaged from a failing business.\u201d The circuit court noted that Best &amp; Brady, a company that was never profitable, \u201cconsidered bankruptcy, devised a plan to increase revenue and operations, hired a consultant, cut salaries across the board, and infused cash into the business,\u201d before deciding to sell its assets to TWP. This decision, the court found, benefitted Martin where TWP assumed nearly $1.2 million dollars of Best &amp; Brady\u2019s liabilities, including approximately $300,000.00 owed to Martin as a trade creditor. And, the court found that by assuming nearly $1.2 million dollars of Best &amp; Brady\u2019s liabilities, TWP provided Best &amp; Brady adequate consideration for the asset transfer. Upon this factual predicate, the circuit court concluded that the \u201cmere continuation\u201d exception did not apply in this case where there was no evidence of fraudulent purpose or inadequate consideration. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Initially, the facts do not necessarily demonstrate that TWP\u2019s purchase of Best and Brady\u2019s assets resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>continuation of the same corporate entity. Although there was overlap, ownership and management had also changed following the asset sale. Martin, who had referred to himself as the \u201cPresident\u201d of Best &amp; Brady, was no longer an owner or manager, but continued on contract as a sales representative with TWP. Mr. Quinn testified that the ownership structure, operation, and management had changed, with Brady taking over as general manager of what Mr. Cassidy referred to as the \u201cnew division inside of [TWP].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">More importantly, the underlying purpose of the exceptions to the general rule would not be served if TWP were held .liable for Best &amp; Brady\u2019s obligations beyond what TWP had already agreed to assume under the Bill of Sale. The purpose of the exceptions to the general rule against successor liability is to protect the rights of creditors, enabling them to recover from the successor corporation. <em>Baltimore Luggage, </em>80 Md. App. at 297, 562 A.2d 1286. The evidence demonstrates that Martin, as owner of BBC, was protected by the decision to sell Best &amp; Brady\u2019s assets to TWP. At the threshold of the Best &amp; Brady joint-venture, the nascent company purchased assets from Martin\u2019s failing business, BBC, for the sum of $139,570.00. Martin then managed Best &amp; Brady\u2019s sales, but the company had difficulty completing orders on time. Even the $425,000.00 loan from TWP senior employees and Truss could not break the company\u2019s fall. Martin actively opposed bankruptcy and eventually consented to the asset sale to TWP. Had Best &amp; Brady filed for bankruptcy rather than sell its assets, Martin likely would never have received the approximately $300,000.00 that TWP paid him as a trade creditor as part of the asset purchase deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s finding that TWP is not a mere continuation of Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady, and, therefore, is not liable to Martin for the default judgment he obtained against Best <em>&amp; </em>Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-11\">. Martin\u2019s complaint included a claim for back wages and treble damages under the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Act, Maryland Code, Labor and Employment (\"L &amp; E\u201d), \u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq. </em>However, Martin does not raise a statutory wage issue in this appeal. Instead, he exclusively argues the merits of successor liability for failure to pay compensation due him for the alleged breach of his employment contract. In his brief, Martin states that \u201c[s]ince [his] termination was without cause, the employment agreement required Best &amp; Brady to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>continue paying Martin $10,000 per month.\" TWP nevertheless asserts on appeal that the guaranteed payments Martin seeks are not subject to the private remedies in L &amp; E \u00a7 3-507.2. Martin did not file a reply brief and, therefore, we do not reach the wage claim in this appeal. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>109 Md.App. 652, 674, 675 A.2d 1003 (1996) (stating that this Court will not generally decide issues that have not been raised on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\">. A State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) document contained in the record states that Best &amp; Brady is a limited liability company, formed on February 25, 2010, and was still in good standing \"on this February 28, 2014.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">.

Martin\u2019s complaint, filed in the circuit court on October 7, 2013, states that the Defendants (TWP and Best &amp; Brady) stopped paying Martin in \"the middle of 2012,\" which resulted in his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\">.

It is not clear in the record why Martin did not include the compensation he received for commissioned sales in March 2012 in his calculation of his wage claim against Best &amp; Brady.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">. The court did not make a factual finding on the issue of whether Martin resigned voluntarily or was fired, stating merely that Best &amp; Brady \"switched three employees, including Plaintiff, to commissioned sales status....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\">. TWP presents two additional issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>I. Whether Martin is equitably estopped from pursuing a claim of successor liability against TWP, where Martin participated in and benefitted from the sale of Best &amp; Brady\u2019s assets to TWP?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">II. Whether, if TWP is liable to Martin, Martin\u2019s claim is subject to enhanced damages and fee-shifting provisions of Md.Code Ann., L &amp; E \u00a7 3-507.2, where the bulk of his claim is for breach of contract damages, not past-due wages, and where TWP\u2019s asserted liability is based solely on the disputed mere-continuation theory?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO\">Martin does not raise the statutory wage issue on appeal and TWP did not file a cross appeal, therefore, we do not reach TWP's additional questions regarding estoppel and the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Act. We note that TWP asserts the following in its briefing regarding the wage claim, to which Martin filed no reply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">Assuming without conceding, that [Martin] was fired without cause effective May 31, 2011, he should have received nine additional months of guaranteed payments, or $90,000. Instead, he received commissions from Best &amp; Brady and TWP totaling $40,013.86. That leaves $49,986.14 as breach of contract damages for early termination of his contract, which is not subject to the private remedies in L &amp; E \u00a7 3-507.2.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b73-7\">. <em>See </em>1 Fletcher Cyc.
