The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the decision after Accokeek, Mattawoman, Piscataway Creeks Communities Council, Inc., a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization, petitioned for judicial review. On appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">A. <em>The Dominion Cove Point Liquef\u00eded Natural Gas Terminal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Dominion owns and operates a natural gas import terminal on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Cove Point in Calvert County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Cove Point terminal receives imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) from ocean-going tankers, vaporizes the LNG, and transports the gas by pipeline to an interstate transmission grid for consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>In 2011, Dominion announced plans to convert the Cove Point site from an import-only terminal to a bi-directional terminal. Proposed liquefaction facilities, covering approximately 49 acres, would liquefy natural gas from domestic sources, so that it could be stored in canisters, loaded onto vessels, and exported abroad. Dominion sought approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to construct the liquefaction facilities and approval from the federal Department of Energy to export LNG to foreign countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">As a major component of the project, Dominion planned to install combustion turbines to mechanically drive the refrigerant compressors used in the liquefaction process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dominion proposed a design that would repurpose waste heat from those turbines to generate much of the electricity required for the liquefaction process. This design called for the construction of an electricity generation station, closely integrated into the larger liquefaction facilities. The generating station, with a \u201cname-plate capacity\u201d of 130 megawatts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would not be linked to the larger power grid, as the generated electricity would be consumed exclusively on site.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">B. <em>Application for Certif\u00edcate of Public Convenience and Necessity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">At the same time that Dominion was pursuing federal approval for the liquefaction project, Dominion applied to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>authorities for permission to construct the generating station. Under Maryland law, a party may not begin construction on a generating station unless that party obtains a certif\u00edcate of public convenience and necessity from the Public Service Commission. PUA \u00a7 7-207(b)(l)(i). \u201cThe certificate may be granted only after other state agencies evaluate and comment upon the proposal, the [Commission] holds a public hearing which local governing bodies may attend,\u201d and the Commission considers the recommendation of the local governing body and various societal effects of the generating station. <em>See Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>80 Md.App. 107, 114, 560 A.2d 50 (1989), <em>aff'd sub nom. Howard Cnty. v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>319 Md. 511, 573 A.2d 821 (1990). For certain generating stations, the party must apply for the certificate at least two years before beginning construction. PUA \u00a7 7-208(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">On April 1, 2013, Dominion submitted an Application for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Dominion requested expedited treatment so that it could begin construction before February 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Commission initially delegated the matter to a public utility law judge, who set a procedural schedule. Multiple parties intervened, including two environmental organizations: the Sierra Club and Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN). The Commission later rescinded its delegation of the proceedings and set the matter for hearing by an en banc panel of commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In December 2013, Accokeek, Mattawoman, Piscataway Creeks Communities Council, Inc. (AMP), moved to intervene out-of-time. AMP, whose primary mission is to protect local waterways, asserted that the Sierra Club and CCAN, as national and regional environmental groups, would not adequately represent its interests in the proceedings. Over Dominion\u2019s objection, the Commission granted AMP\u2019s intervention request.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Through the Power Plant Siting and Research Act of 1971 and its subsequent revisions, the General Assembly has estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>lished a comprehensive process for evaluating the effects of proposed power generation facilities on surrounding communities. In accordance with the siting law, the Commission solicited a review from Maryland\u2019s Power Plant Research Program (PPRP). PPRP, a division of the Department of Natural Resources, is a \u201ccontinuing research program for electric power plant site evaluation and related environmental and land use considerations.\u201d Md.Code (1974, 2012 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-301(d) of the Natural Resources Article (\u201cNR\u201d). In coordination with other government agencies, PPRP studies the environmental and socioeconomic effects of electric power generation facilities in Maryland. NR \u00a7 3-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">PPRP submitted an environmental review report on behalf of seven Maryland agencies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> PPRP concluded \u201cthat the power plant site [wa]s suitable and that the generating facility c[ould] be constructed and operated in accordance with all applicable environmental regulations,\u201d provided that the Commission adopted an extensive list of conditions. First and foremost, PPRP recommended that the Commission require Dominion to obtain necessary federal approvals for the larger LNG facility before constructing the generating station. The majority of the proposed limitations related to air quality. The remaining requirements concerned terrestrial and aquatic ecology, stormwater management or erosion and sediment control, water supply, cultural resources, visual quality, emergency preparedness and security, traffic, and noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">C. <em>Evidentiary Hearing Before the Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The Commission received testimony and heard arguments at an evidentiary hearing on February 20, 21, and 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In support of its application, Dominion offered testimony from consultants and from company executives. Dominion asserted that the project would result in \u201csignificant economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>benefits in Maryland,\u201d in the form of temporary jobs for construction of the facilities, permanent jobs for the operation of the facilities, and increased tax revenue for Calvert County. Dominion admitted that the export of LNG would put upward pressure on energy prices, but Dominion argued that benefits to the local economy would outweigh the potential adverse effects on consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">AMP and the other environmental groups opposed the application, offering testimony from environmental experts and energy industry experts. AMP argued that the Commission could not consider benefits of the larger liquefaction project in determining whether to certify the generating station. AMP also argued that Dominion had provided inadequate information about the economic benefits of the generating station and that the application should be denied on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">PPRP submitted extensive testimony from experts in air quality, water management, geology, ecology, engineering, and economics. The program\u2019s deputy director testified that the power plant could be constructed and operated in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations as long as Dominion complied with PPRP\u2019s proposed conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Public Service Commission\u2019s staff presented its analysis of the effect of the generating station on the power grid. The Commission\u2019s staff concluded that the proposed station, as an \u201cislanded\u201d project that benefitted a single energy user, would not adversely affect the grid. The staff concluded that the Commission could approve the project, subject to a set of conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>D. <em>Post-Hearing Developments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The Commission presided over a public hearing in Lusby on March 1, 2014, in accordance with PUA \u00a7 7-207(d). Approximately 80 members of the community offered comments either in support of or in opposition to Dominion\u2019s proposals. A member of the Board of County Commissioners for Calvert County spoke at the hearing to announce the Board\u2019s \u201cunanimous support\u201d for the project. In a letter dated March 25, 2014, signed by the five county commissioners, the Board affirmed that it \u201cfully support[ed]\u201d Dominion\u2019s application for a certificate to construct the generating station.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">At AMP\u2019s request, the Commission extended the public comment period until April 2, 2014. In total, the Commission received over 60,000 written comments and letters. Most of the comments, from both proponents and opponents of the project, emphasized broader consequences of the LNG facility rather than direct effects of the construction and operation of the generating station.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In a post-hearing reply brief, Dominion stated that it would accept all conditions proposed by PPRP and by the Commission\u2019s staff, along with four \u201cadditional conditions developed at the suggestion of the [cjommissioners.\u201d As Condition J-8, Dominion offered to \u201cmake a one-time contribution in the amount of $400,000 to the Maryland Energy Assistance Program, or other low income energy assistance program to be specified\u201d by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">As a final condition, Condition J-4, Dominion offered to \u201cprovide $20.38 million in in-kind contributions and funding to support Maryland [Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act] goals.\u201d Under this proposal, Dominion would offer \u201c[a] $1 cost perpetual license of Dominion\u2019s EDGE\u00ae Energy Efficiency Program\u201d to Maryland electric distribution utilities and would \u201cservice, maintain and provide software updates at no cost for the first 4 years\u201d to each utility that adopted the program. Dominion agreed that, in the event that utility companies might decline to adopt its energy efficiency technology, Dominion would finance a trust or similar instrument with funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cnot to exceed $20.38 million,\u201d to support other greenhouse-gas reduction projects determined by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In a joint reply brief submitted on the same day as Dominion\u2019s reply brief, the Sierra Club and CCAN recommended that the Commission require Dominion to make a \u201csignificant investment in carbon-free Maryland-based renewables ... in order to help mitigate several of the most significant adverse impacts of the project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">After reviewing the final briefs, the Commission\u2019s staff submitted a comment on the additional conditions proposed by Dominion. The Commission\u2019s staff determined that it would be \u201cunworkable\u201d for utility companies to adopt Dominion\u2019s energy-efficiency software, as Dominion had proposed. The staff concluded that \u201cthe $20.38 million funding support ... would be more appropriately directed to the Strategic Energy Investment Fund in which these monies are allocated specifically to greenhouse-gas reduction-related activities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">E. <em>Approval from the Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On May 30, 2014, by Order No. 86372, the Commission granted the certificate of public convenience and necessity subject to a revised set of conditions. The Commission explained its findings and conclusions in an 83-page opinion and set forth the required conditions in a 64-page appendix. The Commission declared: \u201cif all conditions imposed under this Order are met to address environmental, economic, health and safety impacts demonstrated in this proceeding, the Generating Station can be built in conformity with applicable Maryland and Federal laws and standards, and in a way that will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>consistent with the public convenience and necessity standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">After a comprehensive summary of the testimony and arguments of the parties, the opinion discussed the required statutory considerations:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">(e) The Commission shall take final action on an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity only after due consideration of:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">(1) the recommendation of the governing body of each county or municipal corporation in which any portion of the construction of the generating station ... is proposed to be located; and</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">(2) the effect of the generating station ... on:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">(i) the stability and reliability of the electric system;</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">(ii) economics;</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">(iii) esthetics;</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">(iv) historic sites;</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">(v) aviation safety as determined by the Maryland Aviation Administration and the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration;</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">(vi) when applicable, air and water pollution; and</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">(vii) the availability of means for the required timely disposal of wastes produced by any generating station.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">PUA \u00a7 7-207(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">Addressing these factors, the Commission first noted that the local governing body had \u201cvoted unanimously to support this Project.\u201d The Commission agreed with findings of its staff that the generating station would have no adverse effect on the electric system. The Commission concluded that the conditions recommended by PPRP adequately addressed concerns as to the effect of generating station on aesthetics, historic sites, aviation safety, and waste disposal. In assessing the station\u2019s effect on air pollution, the Commission focused on whether the project would comply with federal and state clean air laws, an issue that had \u201ctaken up perhaps the largest amount of time and testimony in th[e] proceeding.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Commission concluded that the project would comply with the requisite air pollution and other standards if Dominion adopted the conditions proposed by PPRP.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">According to the Commission, Dominion had the burden \u201cto demonstrate that the benefits of the generating station, including economic benefits, outweigh[ed] the environmental, safety, and societal costs of siting the generating facility[.]\u201d The Commission explained that its task of analyzing the generating station was particularly difficult because much of the testimony had addressed the LNG project as a whole rather than the station itself. The Commission reasoned that the generating station was \u201clikely directly responsible for only a fraction of the air emissions, water impacts, and economic effects of the entire Project.\u201d Referring to estimates from Dominion and from PPRP, the Commission noted that the generating facilities \u201cmay account for between 5% and 20% of the overall effects of the Project,\u201d but the Commission commented that it had \u201cnothing beyond that to further refine the appropriate number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Commission highlighted the economic impact analysis from PPRP, which concluded that only a small fraction of overall economic benefits could be attributed to the generating station alone. PPRP\u2019s economist gave estimates indicating that the generating facility would account for approximately five percent of construction jobs and two percent of overall salary and wage costs. According to PPRP, once the facility was operational, the project would continue to have a significant revenue effect in the form of property taxes for Calvert County. The Commission cited various projections of the total property taxes for the overall LNG project, but it made no finding as to the portion of property taxes attributable to the generation station.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Commission concluded that the economic impacts of the project would not be uniformly positive. The Commission credited studies showing that Dominion\u2019s facility, by exporting LNG abroad, would increase gas prices for Maryland consumers. The Commission also concluded that the generating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>station\u2019s \u201c \u2018island mode\u2019 of electricity [wa]s not a positive factor in calculating its economic effects.\u201d To operate a power plant connected to the grid, a company ordinarily would be required to purchase carbon emission allowances as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Proceeds from the sale of those allowances are deposited in Maryland\u2019s Strategic Energy Investment Fund (SEIF) to finance investments in energy efficiency and conservation programs, renewable energy resources, low-income energy assistance, and other purposes. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2014 Repl.Vol., 2015 Supp.), \u00a7 9-20B-05 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). Instead of purchasing those allowances, however, Dominion planned to \u201cavail itself of a portion of the free Limited Industrial Exemption set-aside allowances to account for carbon emissions,\u201d which would reduce the supply of allowances for future projects. In summary, the Commission stated that \u201cthe \u2018costs\u2019 to Maryland ratepayers\u201d in the form of increased energy prices and lost compliance revenues \u201ccould be well in excess of $75 million by 2025.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Overall, the Commission identified the most significant negative effects of the generating station as: increased emissions of pollutants that would affect air quality and climate, Dominion\u2019s use of a limited supply of industrial greenhouse-gas emission allowances, increased noise, clear-cutting of trees, and the additional burden on the County\u2019s transportation infrastructure and the State\u2019s water resources. According to the Commission, Dominion had not demonstrated that these \u201cconsiderable\u201d negative impacts \u201cwould be offset by the relatively limited and short-lived monetary benefits accruing to Calvert County through construction employment or through the longer-term tax payments from the Generating Station.\u201d The Commission concluded that, even after implementing the conditions proposed by PPRP, the generating facility would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>not \u201cprovide sufficient economic and other benefits to residents of Maryland\u201d to justify granting the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The Commission determined that Dominion\u2019s \u201clast minute agreement\u201d to provide \u201ca $20.38 million \u2018in-kind\u2019 contribution and funding\u201d to advance greenhouse-gas reduction goals was \u201ctoo speculative and insufficient to provide the necessary offsetting economic benefits to Maryland residents.\u201d Adopting the recommendation of its staff, the Commission concluded that the offer \u201ccould be more effectively utilized through a direct contribution to the consumer side through the State\u2019s Strategic Energy Investment Fund (\u2018SEIF\u2019).\u201d As a new condition for approval of the generating station, the Commission directed that the $20.38 million in funds earmarked for Dominion\u2019s voltage reduction services be increased to $40 million, to be contributed directly to SEIF over five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The Commission also found Dominion\u2019s one-time contribution of $400,000 to the Maryland Energy Assistance Program or other low-income energy assistance program to be inadequate. To mitigate anticipated increases in gas prices for Maryland residents, the Commission directed Dominion to \u201cprovide this level of contribution for each of the expected 20 years that the plant is currently under contract to operate, for a total of $8 million.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">After the Commission issued the order, Dominion promptly notified the Commission that it had accepted all of the specified conditions. AMP petitioned for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City. After a hearing, the court denied the petition and entered an order affirming the Commission\u2019s decision on December 22, 2014. AMP noted a timely appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In this appeal, AMP raises several grounds for reversal of the Commission\u2019s order. AMP\u2019s brief presents four questions, which we quote:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">1. Did [the Commission] violate Petitioner\u2019s right to due process by failing to make sufficient findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>regarding the positive economic effects of the Generating Station?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">2. Was the [Commission\u2019s] calculation of economic effects under [PUA] \u00a7 7-207(e)(2)(ii) supported by substantial evidence in the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">8. Did the [Commission] act outside of its statutory authority by imposing $48 million dollars in taxes or, in the alternative, fees which it was not empowered to enact?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">4. Did the [Commission] act arbitrarily or capriciously in ignoring competent evidence that showed the [Board of County Commissioners\u2019] recommendation was based on the overall Liquefaction Project, and thus was outside of the [Commission\u2019s] statutory authority to consider?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">For the reasons explained in this opinion, we answer all four questions in the negative and conclude that the order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In an appeal from a circuit court\u2019s judgment in an action for judicial review, our task is to review the underlying decision of the agency. <em>See, e.g., Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>143 Md.App. 419, 432, 795 A.2d 160 (2002). The scope of judicial review over decisions of the Public Service Commission is limited by statute. A final decision or order of the Commission is \u201cprima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be: (1) unconstitutional; (2) outside the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission; (3) made on unlawful procedure; (4) arbitrary or capricious; (5) affected by other error of law; or (6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested proceeding after a hearing, unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d PUA \u00a7 3-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u201cA great deal of discretion is necessarily vested in the Commission in order that it may properly discharge its important and complex duties.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Pub.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. 715, 722, 451 A.2d 945 (1982). When the agency exercises discretion on a matter specific to its mandate and expertise, court review is generally limited to whether the agency exercised its discretion arbitrarily or capriciously or whether the action violated regulations, statutes, common-law principles, due process, and other constitutional requirements. <em>Communications Workers of America v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>424 Md. 418, 434, 36 A.3d 449 (2012). \u201cBecause the Commission is well informed by its own expertise and specialized staff,\u201d the reviewing court must affirm the Commission\u2019s decision as long as the matter is at least fairly debatable, meaning that \u201ca reasoning mind could have reached the same conclusion as the agency[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 36 A.3d 449. Therefore, in reviewing a factual determination of the Commission, the court \u201c \u2018should not examine the facts in any case further than to determine whether there was substantial evidence to sustain the order.\u2019\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. at 722, 451 A.2d 945 (quoting <em>Howard Sports Daily v. Weller, </em>179 Md. 355, 365, 18 A.2d 210 (1941)). Overall, the courts will not disturb a decision of the Commission \u201cexcept upon clear and satisfactory evidence that it was unlawful and unreasonable.\u201d <em>Town of Easton v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>379 Md. 21, 30, 838 A.2d 1225 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">As discussed below, AMP has failed to show that the Commission\u2019s decision was unconstitutional, unsupported by substantial evidence, outside of the Commission\u2019s authority or jurisdiction, or arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As its first ground for challenging the Commission\u2019s order, AMP contends that the Commission denied it due process of law by failing to articulate certain factual findings. Specifically, AMP argues that the Commission violated its \u201cright to due process by failing to name the value, or possible range of values, [the Commission] assigned to the economic benefit of the Generating Station.\u201d According to AMP, the Commission\u2019s failure to provide those numerical figures de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>prived AMP of a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to challenge \u201chow the [PUA \u00a7 7-207] balancing test was implemented\u201d in approving the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In a contested proceeding, the Public Service Commission is required to issue a written decision and order that \u201cstate[s] the grounds for the conclusions of the Commission^]\u201d PUA \u00a7 3-113(a). The requirement of written findings is essential for judicial review, because a court generally may not uphold an agency\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.

In that case, the Commission had approved a settlement agreement and implemented an electric utility restructuring plan. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 795 A.2d 160. This Court held that the order approving the agreement contained the required factual determinations and sufficiently set forth the basis for the Commission\u2019s conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 434-35, 795 A.2d 160. In its written opinion, the Commission had \u201creviewed each issue addressed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Agreement, liberally drawing from the testimony adduced by both sides, while discussing in detail the evidence presented and the applicable law,\u201d and \u201cmade findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were later summarized at the conclusion of the opinion[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 795 A.2d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The appellant in that case contended that the Commission\u2019s orders were deficient for failing to address requisite statutory factors. <em>Id. </em>at 437-38, 795 A.2d 160. The relevant statute, however, stated only that the Commission \u201cshall consider\u201d certain enumerated statutory criteria in making its determination. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 795 A.2d 160. The Court explained that \u201cthe words \u2018shall consider\u2019 in an administrative statute \u2018only require[] [an agency] to consider the listed factors\u2019 of the statute\u201d and do not require the agency \u201c \u2018to make written findings or findings on the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lussier v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>100 Md.App. 190, 213, 640 A.2d 259 (1994)). Consequently, in reviewing an administrative decision based on a statute that requires the Commission only to \u201c \u2018consider\u2019 certain enumerated factors ... \u2018it is sufficient if the record supports the conclusion that the Commission considered these factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v.

Expressly addressing this consideration, the Commission\u2019s opinion summarized testimony from Dominion\u2019s witnesses estimating the \u201cdollar impact\u201d of the generating station. The opinion recounted the testimony of PPRP\u2019s economist, who concluded that income effects attributable to construction of the generating station would be \u201csignificantly less\u201d than the estimates from Dominion. The Commission also referred to testimony that the overall project would result in \u201cup to $40 million per year in property taxes for Calvert County.\u201d The Commission noted other potential benefits, including highway improvements, re-establishment of oyster beds in an offsite area, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the possibility of additional land preservation. The Commission also analyzed potential negative economic effects from the LNG export facility, referring to estimates of likely increases in consumer gas prices and to decreased revenue associated with compliance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In sum, the opinion amply demonstrates that the Commission gave \u201cdue consideration\u201d to all of the required factors, including the economic effects of the generating station. This is by no means a case in which the Commission made conclusory findings on a central issue without articulating any evidentiary facts to support those findings. <em>Cf. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>75 Md.App. at 100, 540 A.2d 820. The opinion did more than enough to apprise the parties and the courts of the basis for the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>See Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Maryland Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>143 Md.App. at 435-36, 795 A.2d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">While ostensibly criticizing the Commission for allegedly failing to articulate its findings, AMP effectively seeks to use certain details from the Commission\u2019s thorough explanation as a basis for requiring even further explanation. In the Commission\u2019s opinion, it stated that Dominion had failed to show that monetary benefits from construction employment and longer-term tax payments would offset the potential negative effects of the power plant. For example, the Commission found that Dominion\u2019s proposal to contribute $20.38 million to advance greenhouse-gas reduction goals was \u201ctoo speculative and insufficient to provide the necessary offsetting economic benefits[.]\u201d On the other hand, the Commission found that it could approve the certificate if Dominion contributed $40 million over five years to the Strategic Energy Investment Fund and $8 million over 20 years to the Maryland Energy Assistance Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Based on this series of findings, AMP asserts that \u201cthe Order makes clear\u201d that the Commission \u201cassigned a specific value, or range of values, to the economic benefit\u201d of the generating station. AMP theorizes that the Commission reduced all of the considerations to two values: A, the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>economic benefits of the station, and B, the overall negative effects of the station. AMP asserts that the Commission then made the following \u201ccalculation\u201d: first that A was less than B; next that \u201cA + 20.38 million dollars is still less than B\u201d; and finally that \u201cA + $48 million dollars was greater than B.\u201d According to AMP, the Commission violated due process by failing to disclose \u201cA,\u201d the value or range of values for the generating station\u2019s net economic effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">AMP\u2019s argument is creative but unpersuasive. It is not at all \u201cclear\u201d that the Commission reduced, or could have reduced, its analysis to a single dollar-figure or range of figures. The Commission\u2019s discussion of economic factors covered the facility\u2019s effects on employment, government revenue, and consumer energy prices. Data regarding each of these effects can be expressed in dollar figures, but nothing obligates the Commission to give the same weight to a dollar in property taxes as it gives, for example, to a dollar in wages (which results in additional state and local taxes, as well as other economic benefits). Moreover, the Commission could not simply \u201cadd\u201d the positive economic contributions to Dominion\u2019s proposed $20.38 million contribution to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions, as those goals are not strictly economic. For similar reasons, the Commission could not simply \u201cadd\u201d $48 million, as an economic benefit, to account for the contributions that it required Dominion to make to the government funds that are designed to achieve environmental objectives and to assist low-income residents, as those goals, too, are not strictly economic.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Even if it were possible to reduce these qualitatively different costs and benefits into a single quantity or range of quantities (as AMP suggests the Commission did and was required to do), the Commission would need to compare those figures against the value of \u201cB\u201d on the other side of the scale. The negative effects identified by the Commission (increased emissions, use of a limited supply of greenhouse-gas allowances, increased noise, clear-cutting of trees, and burdens on transportation and water resources) were largely noneconom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ic. AMP, in seeking to challenge the Commission\u2019s balancing of the competing considerations, incorrectly reasons that this flexible multi-factor balancing can be reduced (and in fact was reduced) to mere \u201ccalculations.\u201d Like many other determinations that the General Assembly has entrusted to the Commission\u2019s discretion, however, the public convenience and necessity standard of PUA \u00a7 7-207(e) requires that the Commission consider all relevant facts and factors and exercise reasonable judgment, not that the Commission employ a particular formula or method. <em>See Potomac Edison Co. v. Pub. Serv.

The Commission\u2019s opinion here sufficiently demonstrates that the Commission did so. There is no need for the Commission to make further written findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In its first challenge, AMP criticized the Commission for failing to assign a specific numerical value for the overall economic benefits of the generating station. In its second challenge, AMP contends that this \u201cunnamed valuation of the economic benefit of the generating station is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d The focus of AMP\u2019s argument is that, although the Commission received some evidence about economic effects of the generating station, most of the economic evidence related to the larger LNG export facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">At the outset, we disagree with AMP\u2019s suggestion that evidence concerning effects of the overall liquefaction project was irrelevant in evaluating the effects of the power plant component. As explained in the Commission\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe sole purpose of the Generating Station would be to serve the proposed expanded LNG operations[.]\u201d The generating station was not only \u201clocated within\u201d the larger LNG facility, but was also \u201cvery closely intertwined with the components of the broader Liquefaction Project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Because the components were so inseparably integrated, Dominion encouraged the Commission to consider costs and benefits of the entire project. Experts from PPRP took similar approaches in their siting studies. PPRP\u2019s environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>mental review report concluded that the environmental effects of the power plant could not be separated from the larger liquefaction project. The economic impact analysis from PPRP isolated only some effects specific to the generating station, but at other times analyzed the effects of the entire facility. PPRP\u2019s economics expert reported that it was \u201cdifficult to segregate the generating station\u201d from the larger liquefaction project. Based on a comparison study to a \u201cgeneric 130 [megawatt] conventional gas combined cycle facility,\u201d he concluded that employment and income effects attributable to construction of the electric generation components would be \u201crelatively small\u201d in relation to the entire facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">During the hearing, the Commission attempted to elicit more specific information about economic effects attributable only to the generating station. One of the commissioners commented that it would be \u201chelpful\u201d if Dominion provided a separate personal and real property valuation for the generation station. An executive from Dominion later offered a \u201crough estimate\u201d of the \u201ccosts and benefits\u201d attributable to the generating station. Based on a comparison to a \u201cvery similar existing facility\u201d with the \u201csame configuration,\u201d Dominion\u2019s witness estimated that \u201cfrom both a man-hours to construct standpoint and a total dollar impact,\u201d the power generation components represented \u201capproximately 20 percent of the overall costs\u201d and \u201capproximately 20 percent of the overall value of the project.\u201d He summarized that \u201cfrom a tax standpoint, from a jobs standpoint\u201d the Commission could allocate 20 percent of costs and benefits to the generating station.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In response to questions about the reasonableness of Dominion\u2019s estimate, PPRP\u2019s economics expert explained that there were \u201clegitimate reasons why the generation component could not be separated from the liquefaction project,\u201d most notably the \u201ccommon elements\u201d used for both the liquefaction process and for electricity generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On appeal, AMP contends that the Commission lacked substantial evidence to reach a conclusion about isolated eco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>nomic effects of the generating station. More specifically, AMP asserts that the Commission could not consider property tax payments as a likely economic benefit unless the Commission received direct evidence about the specific portion of property taxes derived solely from the generating station. AMP also argues that the Commission was required to assign a specific numerical value to that portion of the property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">AMP seems to presume that the Commission must meet a high evidentiary standard for a court to uphold its factual determinations. In reality, the substantial evidence test is nowhere near as exacting as AMP\u2019s argument suggests. To determine whether the entire record contains substantial evidence to support an agency\u2019s findings, the ultimate question is whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the conclusion reached by the agency based on the record. <em>See, e.g., Spicer v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>152 Md.App. 151, 159, 831 A.2d 472 (2003) (citing <em>Rideout v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>149 Md.App. 649, 656, 818 A.2d 250 (2003)). The Commission need not rely on direct testimony to support every finding and conclusion, but its findings \u201cmay include inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the facts[.]\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>75 Md.App. at 97, 540 A.2d 820 (citing <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 515, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">For example, in <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 52 </em>Md.App. 715, 716-17, 451 A.2d 945 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>295 Md. 441 (1983), this Court held that substantial evidence supported a decision of the Commission setting taxicab rates. In that case, taxicab companies had petitioned for a rate increase, based largely on evidence of increases in gasoline price. <em>Id. </em>at 725, 451 A.2d 945. The companies \u201cpresented very little specific information about their own financial affairs and condition\u201d <em>(id.) </em>even though that information was necessary to justify the rate increase. The Commission relied on the findings of a hearing examiner who had \u201cdecried the lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of better evidence,\u201d but who nonetheless drew a \u201creasonable inference,\u201d based on testimony from the representatives of two companies who mentioned their declining revenues, that revenues were declining throughout the industry. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 451 A.2d 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Writing for this Court, Judge Wilner explained that \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded the kind of evidence presented at the two hearings, unsupported by audited financial statements, was for the Commission to determine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727, 451 A.2d 945. The Commission \u201cwas entitled to believe\u201d that the witnesses were \u201cpresenting an accurate depiction\u201d of the financial condition of taxicab licensees. <em>Id. </em>Even though the evidence was \u201cscanty and largely undocumented,\u201d the oral testimony offered by the companies was enough to support the Commission\u2019s conclusions about the overall financial condition of the taxicab industry. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Applying the substantial evidence test here, we conclude that the Commission had an evidentiary basis on which to reach a conclusion about tax revenues resulting from the generating station. The Commission named three sources of evidence: (1) testimony showing that the overall expansion of the LNG facility would produce up to $40 million per year in property taxes for the County; (2) an estimate from Dominion that the power plant represented \u201c20 percent of the overall value of the project\u201d; and (3) testimony from PPRP\u2019s economist that \u201conly a relatively small portion\u201d of other economic effects, with approximately five percent of temporary construction jobs, would be attributable to the electric generation component.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In explaining its decision, the Commission recognized that it was \u201cdifficult,\u201d but not impossible, to evaluate the generating station based on testimony that primarily addressed the overall liquefaction project. The Commission referred to Dominion\u2019s figure (of around 20 percent) as an estimate of \u201cthe \u2018dollar impact\u2019 from the Project [that] could be attributed to the Generating Station\u201d and PPRP\u2019s relatively smaller figure (of around five percent) as an estimate of \u201cthe economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>effects of the generating facility.\u201d The Commission characterized the two studies, not only as projections about the narrow issue of construction employment, but as approximations of the \u201coverall effects of the Project[.]\u201d Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for the Commission to infer that other economic effects, including property taxes based on the value of the generating station, likely accounted for \u201conly a fraction\u201d compared to the entire project, somewhere near that range of percentages. The Commission proceeded on those generalizations in the absence of a more refined estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Based on the evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence, a reasoning mind could conclude, as the Commission did, that \u201crelatively limited ... monetary benefits\u201d would \u201caccru[e] to Calvert County through ... longer-term tax payments from the Generating Station.\u201d Even though it may have been possible for the Commission to improve those general estimates by obtaining better evidence, the Commission did not require additional testimony before reaching its decision. <em>See People\u2019s Counsel v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. at 726-27, 451 A.2d 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As its next challenge, AMP contends that the Commission acted outside of its authority when it incorporated Conditions J-3 and J-4 into its order. Again, our analysis begins with the statutory directive that the Commission\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cprima facie correct </em>and shall be affirmed unless <em>clearly shawm </em>to be ... outside the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 3-203(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">As mentioned previously, when Dominion submitted its final brief in support of its application, Dominion agreed to adopt conditions proposed by PPRP and by the Commission\u2019s staff. Dominion proposed four additional conditions, including: Condition J-3, a one-time contribution of $400,000 to the Maryland Energy Assistance Program (MEAP); and Condition J-4, an offer to provide \u201c$20.38 million in in-kind contributions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>funding\u201d through grants to electric distribution utilities or through a trust to support other greenhouse-gas reduction projects determined by the Commission. The Sierra Club and CCAN similarly proposed that Dominion be required to offset environmental harms by making a \u201csignificant investment in carbon-free Maryland-based renewables[.]\u201d The Commission\u2019s staff commented that the proposed $20.38 million in funding \u201cwould be more appropriately directed\u201d to the State\u2019s Strategic Energy Investment Fund (SEIF) so that it would be \u201callocated specifically to greenhouse gas reduction-related activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Assessing these proposals, the Commission determined that it could not grant the certificate unless Dominion agreed to new conditions. The Commission wrote: \u201cIn developing additional conditions, we focus on actions that will benefit both the environmental and economic interests of the State by benefiting renewable and clean energy resources, reducing or mitigating climate change effects, and promoting beneficial changes in generation and electric usage by consumers.\u201d Reasoning that Dominion\u2019s proposal for services valued at $20.38 million was \u201cinsufficient\u201d and \u201ccould be more effectively utilized\u201d through a direct monetary contribution, the Commission changed Condition J-4 to require that Dominion contribute a total of $40 million over five years to the SEIF. Citing expected increases in consumer energy prices, the Commission also modified Condition J-3 to require that Dominion contribute $400,000 to MEAP for each of the expected 20 years of the plant\u2019s operation, for a total of $8 million. Dominion accepted those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On appeal, AMP now contends that the Commission \u201cenacted] $48 million in taxes\u201d by granting of the certificate subject to direct payments to specialized funds. AMP argues that the Commission lacks power to impose taxes absent explicit authorization from the legislature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The Commission agrees that it lacks the power to levy taxes. The Commission responds, however, that the payments to MEAP and SEIF are not \u201ctaxes\u201d but merely \u201cconditions\u201d that the Commission may impose. The Public Utilities Article not only vests the Commission with \u201cthe powers specifically conferred by law,\u201d but goes on to state that it also \u201chas the implied and incidental powers needed or proper to carry out its functions[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 2 \u2014 112(b). Moreover, the Commission\u2019s powers are \u201cconstrued liberally.\u201d PUA \u00a7 2-112(c). After a hearing on an application pursuant to PUA \u00a7\u00a7 7-207 and 7-208, the Commission has the option to \u201cgrant the certificate, subject to conditions the Commission determines to be appropriate^]\u201d PUA \u00a7 7 \u2014 208(f)(1)(ii). The Commission bases that determination of whether to grant, conditionally grant, or deny a certificate on the Commission\u2019s consideration of, among other things, \u201cthe effect of the generating station\u201d on \u201ceconomics\u201d and \u201cair and water pollution[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 7-207(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Based on these provisions, the Commission argues that it has authority \u201cto condition its approval, as appropriate, to ensure that applicants ... satisfy the economic and public interest needs of the State.\u201d The Commission characterizes the $48 million in contributions as \u201can adjustment of an amount voluntarily agreed to\u201d by Dominion. The Commission asserts that its modifications of Conditions J-3 and J-4 \u201craised the contribution amount to near the mid-point of the range of economic risks that the contribution was intended to mitigate\u201d and ensured that the contributions would mitigate economic risks and environmental harms resulting from the project.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>The Commission also informs this Court that it commonly imposes economic conditions, including direct payment conditions, in other contexts. A comparable provision of the Public Utilities law states that, before the Commission may approve an application for the acquisition of certain regulated public service companies, the Commission must find \u201cthat the acquisition is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, including benefits and no harm to consumers[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 6-105(g)(3)(i). \u201cThe Commission may condition an order authorizing the acquisition on the applicant\u2019s satisfactory performance or adherence to specific requirements.\u201d PUA \u00a7 6 \u2014 105(g) (3) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Commission has exercised this power to \u201ccondition\u201d the approval of mergers upon direct contributions from companies to consumer investment funds, so as to create the consumer benefits necessary for approval. <em>See In re Merger of Exelon Corp. &amp; Constellation Energy Grp., Inc., </em>103 Md.P.S.C. 22 (2012) (conditioning approval of merger on company\u2019s investment of \u201c$113.5 million, over a three-year period, into a Customer Investment Fund for the purpose of providing energy efficiency and low-income energy assistance to [energy] customers\u201d). The appellees argue that the conditions imposed upon Dominion are \u201cno different\u201d from conditions imposed in other cases, but they identify no case in which the Maryland courts have passed upon the propriety of this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Additionally, both the Commission and Dominion urge this Court not to address the issue of whether the conditions imposed by the order exceeded the Commission\u2019s authority, on the theory that AMP lacks \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the imposition of a \u201ctax\u201d to be paid by Dominion. The Commission denies that AMP has standing in a single sentence of its brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>in which, -without any elaboration, it cites two inapposite cases involving a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the constitutionality of a tax. Dominion advances no argument in support of its assertion that AMP lacks standing to raise this particular challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">These vague and unsupported allusions to doctrines of taxpayer standing are inapt, because AMP has never claimed that its standing in the judicial review action derives from its status as a taxpayer. As AMP correctly asserts, its standing to challenge the overall lawfulness of the order derives from PUA \u00a7 3-202, which authorizes \u201ca party ... that is dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the Commission\u201d to seek judicial review. <em>See Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>361 Md. 196, 206-07, 760 A.2d 1087 (2000) (holding that this requirement of dissatisfaction with an order or decision is met when a party to the proceeding seeks judicial review, proffering reasons for reversal). Without question, AMP was a party to the proceeding and is \u201cdissatisfied by\u201d the Commission\u2019s \u201cfinal decision\u201d to authorize construction of the generating station. To meet the statute\u2019s threshold for challenging the lawfulness of the order, AMP does not need to show that it was also aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s subsidiary decisions to require Dominion to pay sums of money. AMP is a proper party to raise a contention that conditions essential to that ultimate decision were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The decisive issue here is whether the Commission\u2019s decision to condition its approval of the certificate upon payments totaling $48 million to two funds administered by the State amounts to the imposition of a tax. The Court of Appeals has used a variety of general formulations to define a tax under Maryland law:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Th[e] Court long ago defined the statutory term \u201ctaxes\u201d to mean \u201cburdens, charges or impositions, put or set upon persons of property for public uses----\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Greenmount Cemetery, </em>7 Md. 517, 535 (1855). Later th[e] Court defined \u201ctax\u201d as \u201ca charge imposed upon the taxpayer as an act of sovereignty, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>his consent, and for the public use.... \u201d <em>Baltimore v.

State of Maryland, </em>471 F.Supp. 1030, 1036 (D.Md.1979)) (further citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In determining whether a particular governmental charge is a tax, \u201cthe purpose of the enactment governs rather than the legislative label.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Mayor &amp; Aldermen of City of Annapolis, </em>289 Md. 300, 305, 424 A.2d 738 (1981) (citing <em>Maryland Theatrical Corp. v. Brennan, </em>180 Md. 377, 381-82, 24 A.2d 911 (1942)). A variety of charges, although labeled as something other than a tax and directed to specialized funds rather than a general treasury, may be taxes nonetheless. <em>E.g. Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 52-55, 570 A.2d 850 (\u201cdevelopment impact fee\u201d imposed by Montgomery County as condition for approving building permit and deposited in a restricted account for specific road improvements); <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp.

State of Maryland, </em>471 F.Supp. at 1035-36 (\u201cenvironmental surcharge\u201d per kilowatt hour of electric energy to finance ecological, biological, and environmental studies through Environmental Trust Fund).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">It is beyond dispute that contributions to MEAP and SEIF will benefit the public. Both programs operate under statutory mandates to serve defined public purposes. MEAP, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>program established under the purview of the Department of Human Services, makes payments on behalf of low-income households to defray fuel and utility costs. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2007, 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 5-5A-07(b) of the Human Services Article. SEIF, which is administered by the Maryland Energy Administration, expends its funds on a range of programs, including investments in energy efficiency and conservation programs, renewable and clean energy resources, programs to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change, and demand response programs to promote changes in electric usage. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 9-20B-05.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the Commission\u2019s order recognized, Dominion\u2019s contributions to these funds will \u201cbenefit both the environmental and economic interests of the State[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Both the Commission and Dominion attempt to characterize the $48 million in payments as \u201cvoluntary contributions\u201d to those State programs. They emphasize that Dominion, which had originally proposed Conditions J-3 and J-4, accepted the modified conditions even after the Commission more than doubled the contribution amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The appellees\u2019 arguments on this point misconstrue the \u201cinvoluntariness\u201d component of the legal definition of a tax. Although the Court has described taxes as \u201cinvoluntary charges\u201d <em>(Workmen\u2019s Comp. Comm\u2019n v. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp., </em>319 Md. at 6, 570 A.2d 323), the Court has also used that description interchangeably with the phrase \u201clegally required payments to be expended for public purposes[.]\u201d <em>Id.; see also Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 54, 570 A.2d 850 (describing a tax as \u201c \u2018an enforced contribution\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. State of Maryland, </em>471 F.Supp. at 1036). The appellees point to nothing in Maryland case law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>establishes that the legal test for whether a government action constitutes a tax includes an inquiry into a party\u2019s subjective willingness to comply. The exaction here is sufficiently compulsory because the Commission granted permission to construct the power plant upon the requirement that Dominion make the payments. <em>See Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 47, 570 A.2d 850 (county imposed tax when local agency, in accordance with county code, conditioned approval of building permit upon payment of development impact fee). Under the Commission\u2019s order, Dominion has a continuing obligation to pay not because it consented, but because the Commission refused to permit construction unless Dominion complied with the payment conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As AMP concedes, however, not every mandatory payment that results in public revenue is a tax. \u201cHistorically, for some purposes, cases have recognized a distinction between governmental charges that are essentially revenue-raising and those that are primarily part of a regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>289 Md. at 304-05, 424 A.2d 738. The defining characteristic of a tax is not simply that the charge results in government revenue, but that revenue is its primary purpose. <em>See Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 55, 570 A.2d 850 (reasoning that development impact fee was a tax because its \u201cprimary and predominant purpose ... is to raise revenue, regardless of what incidental regulatory effect the imposition of fees may have\u201d); <em>Campbell, </em>289 Md. at 305, 424 A.2d 738 (explaining that determination of whether charge is a tax often depends on whether it \u201cis primarily revenue-raising or primarily for a regulatory purpose\u201d); <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Maryland Soft Drink Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>281 Md. 116, 135, 377 A.2d 486 (1977) (concluding that bills providing for beverage container tax could not be deemed regulatory measures because \u201cthe raising of revenue [wa]s their dominant thrust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">AMP\u2019s argument focuses upon this distinction between revenue measures and regulatory measures. AMP points out that the payment conditions imposed by the Commission are unlike certain regulatory measures that seek to deter or influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>conduct and unlike certain regulatory fees designed to cover expenses of the regulatory process or to provide services to applicants. At the center of AMP\u2019s argument is the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Eastern Diversified Properties, Inc. v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>319 Md. 45, 570 A.2d 850 (1990). AMP writes: \u201cThe Court of Appeals in <em>Eastern Diversified </em>considered an identical situation and held the payment to be an involuntary exaction, and <em>Eastern Diversified </em>is the controlling law in the present case.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWH\">In <em>Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 46, 570 A.2d 850, the Court of Appeals considered whether a \u201cdevelopment impact fee\u201d enacted by the Montgomery County Council was a tax. As a charter county, Montgomery County possessed the general power to regulate businesses so as to promote public welfare, but the County lacked general taxing powers. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 570 A.2d 850. The enactment at issue required applicants for building permits to pay a fee based on a formula that accounted for the type and size of structure. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 570 A.2d 850. The County used the proceeds of the fee to finance highway improvements in designated areas. <em>Id. </em>In an administrative proceeding and in an action for judicial review, Eastern Diversified Properties (\u201cDiversified\u201d) challenged the County\u2019s imposition of the impact fee as a condition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>approval of a building permit for Diversified\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48, 570 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">On appeal, Diversified contended that that the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of the impact fee was to raise revenue and that the County lacked the authority to impose such a tax. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 570 A.2d 850. Diversified argued that there was \u201cno specific correlation\u201d between the property being developed and the highway improvements financed by the fee, and thus \u201cno assurance that the revenue generated by the fee w[ould] actually be used for the construction of highways claimed to be impacted by the development on Diversified\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Diversified emphasized that the County imposed the fee without even \u201cexamining] Diversified\u2019s property and its environs to determine, prior to imposing the impact fee, that road construction would be required to accommodate increased traffic as a result of Diversified\u2019s proposed use of its property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 570 A.2d 850. In response, the County asserted that the impact fee was primarily a regulatory measure because the fee had been designed to reflect \u201c \u2018a proportionate share of the additional traffic placed on the road by such development based on a reasonable and rational formula set forth in the County Code.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 570 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The Court consulted the following criteria to determine whether the impact fee was a tax:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">[W]hether a particular Act is primarily a revenue measure or a regulatory measure is important, because different rules of construction apply. A regulatory measure may produce revenue, but in such a case the amount must be reasonable and have some definite relation to the purpose of the Act. A revenue measure, on the other hand, may also provide for regulation, but if the raising of revenue is the primary purpose, the amount of the tax is not renewable by the courts. There is no set rule by which it can be determined in which category a particular Act primarily belongs. In general, it may be said that when it appears from the Act itself that revenue is its main objective, and the amount of the tax supports that theory, the enactment is a revenue measure. In general, where the fee is imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>for the purpose of regulation, and the statute requires compliance with certain conditions in addition to the payment of the prescribed sum, such sum is a license proper, imposed by virtue of the police power; but where it is exacted solely for revenue purposes and its payment give[s] the right to carry on the business without any further conditions, it is a tax[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 53, 570 A.2d 850 (quoting <em>Brennan, </em>180 Md. at 381-82, 24 A.2d 911) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Applying those principles, the Court determined that \u201cthe primary and predominant purpose of the enactment of the development impact fee [wa]s to raise revenue, regardless of what incidental regulatory effect the imposition of the fees may have on development within the county.\u201d <em>Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 55, 570 A.2d 850. Observing that there were \u201cno further conditions that must be met\u201d to qualify for the permit other than payment of the fee, the Court concluded that the principal purpose of the fee was not to regulate development. <em>Id. </em>The Court reiterated that the amount collected by a revenue measure \u201c \u2018must be reasonable and have some definite relation to the purpose of the Act.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brennan, </em>180 Md. at 381, 24 A.2d 911).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Focusing on this \u201cprimary purpose\u201d inquiry, AMP argues that even if \u201cConditions J-3 and J-4 may incidentally serve a regulatory purpose,\u201d the purpose of the conditions was \u201cto provide revenue to the State[.]\u201d Dominion responds that <em>Eastern Diversified </em>is distinguishable because, \u201c[h]ere, the Commission\u2019s conditions are related to project-specific emissions and potential energy price impacts, with payments targeted to energy-related regulatory programs that would address those emissions and offset any potentially negative effects of energy price increases.\u201d In its brief, the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>sion emphasizes that it developed the modified Conditions J-3 and J-4 only after evaluating the economic and other risks associated with the project itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Ultimately, we are not persuaded by the assertion that the instant case involves an \u201cidentical situation\u201d to the one considered in <em>Eastern Diversified. </em>A few fundamental characteristics of the Commission\u2019s order demonstrate that revenue was only a secondary rather than the primary purpose of the conditions contained in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 55, 570 A.2d 850, the Court inferred that the impact fee primarily served a revenue-generating purpose because a developer did not need to do anything other than pay the prescribed sum to obtain the permit. By contrast, Dominion\u2019s payments did not by any means give it \u201c \u2018the right to carry on the business without any further conditions[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 53, 570 A.2d 850 (quoting <em>Brennan, </em>180 Md. at 381-82, 24 A.2d 911). The Commission\u2019s approval of the construction certificate was contingent upon Dominion\u2019s acceptance of <em>all </em>of the conditions set forth in the appendix, many of which applied throughout the operation of the facility. The 64-page appendix included over 200 separate conditions and requirements regarding other environmental and societal effects. Contrary to AMP\u2019s contentions, Conditions J-3 and J-4 are not simply standalone measures designed to generate revenue at Dominion\u2019s expense. The required payments are part of a unified package of regulatory conditions designed to ensure that, overall, Dominion\u2019s project meets the public convenience and necessity standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The method by which the Commission determined Dominion\u2019s financial contributions indicates that the primary purpose of Conditions J-3 and J-4 was, as stated in the order, to \u201coffset[ ]\u201d identified societal harms from Dominion\u2019s project. The Commission focused on estimates of \u201cthe incremental gas cost to Maryland attributable to Cove Point LNG exports\u201d and the loss of \u201crevenues associated with compliance costs\u201d for purchase of greenhouse-gas allowances. By directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>payments to SEIF, which makes investments designed to offset the effects of carbon emissions, and to MEAP, which makes payments that mitigate the effects of increased energy prices on low-income Maryland residents, the Commission ensured that the payments bore a definite relation to the purposes of PUA \u00a7 7-207. Nothing indicates that the Commission considered the financial needs of government programs that would be funded by the contributions. Instead, the process by which the Commission determined the payment amounts and recipients was limited to fact-finding specific to the generating station, in relation to the standards expressed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">As the Court of Appeals has recognized, \u201c \u2018[t]here is no set rule\u2019 \u201d to determine whether the primary purpose of a measure is to generate revenue. <em>Eastern Diversified, </em>319 Md. at 53, 570 A.2d 850 (quoting <em>Brennan, </em>180 Md. at 381, 24 A.2d 911). <em>Eastern Diversified </em>does not, however, extend to the circumstances of this case, where the agency developed the payment conditions in close connection with an extensive list of other regulatory restrictions in an overall effort to mitigate the identified consequences of the particular project that it was approving. The Commission no doubt anticipated that the financial contributions would enhance government revenue, but the principal purpose of Conditions J-3 and J-4 and the hundreds of other conditions imposed by the order was to calibrate the final outcome to address the considerations of PUA \u00a7 7-207. Thus, even though the payment conditions from the order share some characteristics of a tax, the overall character of the Commission\u2019s action is not indicative of a tax.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As the final issue in this appeal, AMP contends that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by considering the positive recommendation of the Board of County Commissioners of Calvert County.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Before taking final action on an application for a certif\u00edcate of public convenience and necessity, the Commission is required to give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to \u201cthe recommendation of the governing body of each county or municipal corporation in which any portion of the construction of the generating station ... is proposed to be loeated[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 7-207(e)(1). The recommendation of the local governing body is \u201cadvisory only and not controlling.\u201d <em>Howard Cnty. v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>319 Md. 511, 526, 573 A.2d 821 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">At the public hearing on May 1, 2014, a member of the .Board of County Commissioners announced the Board\u2019s \u201cunanimous support ... for th[e] project and for [the] Certif\u00edcate of Public Convenience and Necessity.\u201d The county commissioner stated that the Board had \u201ccarefully considered\u201d the matter and had concluded that the project was in the County\u2019s best interests. The county commissioner anticipated a \u201ctremendous revenue enhancement,\u201d which, he asserted, could be used to fund conservation programs and public education improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">On March 25, 2014, the Board sent the Commission a letter signed by all five county commissioners. The letter stated: \u201cWe understand that Dominion has submitted an application to construct a 130 [megawatt] electric generating station at its existing [LNG] terminal in Calvert County. Should Dominion be given authority to construct the electric station, please know that [the Board of County Commissioners] fully supports their [certificate of public convenience and necessity] application.\u201d The Board expressed confidence that \u201clocal impacts\u201d would be minimal, citing the facility\u2019s safety record and Dominion\u2019s history of working \u201cproactively on preservation and environmental issues[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Before the Commission, AMP argued that the Commission should give either no weight or negative weight to this unanimous support from the local governing body. The Commission rejected that argument, stating: \u201cWe decline to go behind or discount those recommendations as requested by AMP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">AMP now contends that the Commission acted arbitrarily or capriciously by \u201cchoosing to ignore\u201d evidence regarding the Board\u2019s \u201crationale\u201d for its recommendation. AMP quotes selections from the Board\u2019s letter in which the Board expressed support for \u201cLNG exportation\u201d and an \u201cexpansion\u201d of the facility. AMP also relies on public comments from the county commissioner, who emphasized economic benefits of the LNG export facility without specifically mentioning the generating station. According to AMP, the Commission acted capriciously when it \u201crefused to examine\u201d evidence that the Board had based its recommendation on support for the overall liquefaction project rather than the generating station.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">AMP\u2019s argument fails for a number of reasons. First, the statute does not require the Commission to inquire into subjective motives of the local governing body. The Commission must give \u201cdue consideration\u201d both to \u201cthe recommendation of the [local] governing body\u201d (PUA \u00a7 7-207(e)(l)) and to \u201cthe effect of the generating station\u201d on the electric grid, economics, aesthetics, historic sites, aviation, pollution, and waste disposal. PUA \u00a7 7-207(e)(2). The Commission\u2019s inquiry under paragraph (e)(2) focuses on certain societal effects of the station itself, but paragraph (e)(1) includes no limitation for permissible considerations for the local governing body. Under this scheme, the local government officials may be guided by public opinion and other political considerations, which may be outside the confines of environmental and socioeconomic effects attributable to the power plant. The Commission correctly observed that its proper role was to give due consideration to the preferences of the local elected officials without trying to \u201cgo behind\u201d the recommendation to determine whether the Board had sufficiently narrowed its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>AMP\u2019s primary complaint seems to be that the Commission\u2019s consideration of the Board\u2019s recommendation differed from its treatment of other comments and testimony. The Commission discounted many of the public comments opposing the facility, stating: \u201cConsistent with the limited nature of the ... application filed with us, we cannot give weight to arguments that we should reject the entire LNG project, as that issue is not before us.\u201d Similarly, the Commission excluded testimony related to hydraulic fracturing (or \u201cfracking\u201d) on the ground that it was outside the scope of the inquiry concerning the generating station. AMP suggests that the Commission should also have discounted the Board\u2019s recommendation, as the Board\u2019s recommendation was at least partially based on support for the larger LNG project. As we see it, the Commission\u2019s distinction was not arbitrary at all, but firmly grounded in the statute. The recommendation of the local governing body is a separate consideration that the Commission must weigh (PUA \u00a7 7 \u2014 207(e)(1)), in addition to (not as part of) the Commission\u2019s assessments of \u201cthe effect of the generating station[.]\u201d PUA \u00a7 7-207(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In any event, even if the Board was required to limit its rationale to specific effects of the generating station, it was perfectly acceptable for the county commissioners to mention economic benefits of the overall facility. As recounted throughout the Commission\u2019s opinion, the generating station and the larger LNG facility were \u201cintegrally related,\u201d \u201coverlapping,\u201d \u201cintertwined,\u201d \u201cinterdependen[t],\u201d and \u201cfunctional[ly] integrated].\u201d Just as the Commission considered economic data related to the larger facility, it was reasonable for the local governing body to do the same. It would have been unreasonable to expect the non-expert local body to articulate its rationale with greater precision than even the PPRP\u2019s expert economist, who, quite understandably, had difficulty separating the economic effects of the power station from the larger facility that it powered.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Furthermore, even if the Commission was required to scrutinize the rationale for the Board\u2019s recommendation (which it was not), and even if the Board was required to limit its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201crationale\u201d to economic benefits of the generation station (which it was not), AMP\u2019s contention would still fail. What AMP characterizes as \u201crelevant, competent evidence\u201d of the Board\u2019s allegedly improper rationale was by no means conclusive on that point. \u201cThe weight to be accorded the kind of evidence presented ... was for the Commission to determine.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>52 Md.App. at 727, 451 A.2d 945. The Board\u2019s letter clearly expressed unanimous support for construction of the \u201c130 [megawatt] electric generating station,\u201d and recommended that \u201cDominion be given authority to construct the electric station.\u201d The Commission was \u201centitled to believe\u201d <em>(id.) </em>that the Board meant what it said. When the Board went on to voice its support for the related liquefaction facilities, the Commission could reasonably conclude that the Board supported <em>both </em>aspects of Dominion\u2019s project. A statement of support for the liquefaction facilities powered by the generating station is by no means inconsistent with an ultimate positive recommendation for the station itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In sum, the Commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by giving \u201cdue consideration\u201d to the Board\u2019s recommendation in accordance with PUA \u00a7 7-207(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Because AMP has not clearly shown the Commission\u2019s decision to be unconstitutional, unsupported by substantial evidence, outside of the Commission\u2019s authority, or arbitrary or capricious, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court, which affirmed the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Those cases address whether a particular legislative enactment should be regarded as an exercise of the taxing power or the regulatory power. In the instant case, however, the Commission did not \"enact\u201d anything at all. Rather, it ordered payments in a proceeding pursuant to other regulatory powers delegated to it by statute. In another context, federal courts have held that, for purposes of the Tax Injunction Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341), an assessment is less likely to be a tax if it is imposed by an administrative agency rather than imposed directly by a legislature and collected by a general tax assessor (see <em>Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, 22 </em>F.Supp.3d 519, 525 (D.Md.2014)), and that a charge imposed on a single party or narrow class of parties is less likely to be a tax than one imposed on a broad segment of the population. <em>See GenOn Mid-Atlantic, LLC v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>650 F.3d 1021, 1024 (4th Cir.2011). Notwithstanding the uneasy fit between this case and the cases cited by AMP, <em>Eastern Diversified </em>illustrates general principles that are helpful in determining whether the Commission's action can accurately be characterized as taxation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">. After the Court of Appeals invalidated the development fee as an improper exercise of general taxing power, Montgomery County enacted legislation that authorized the imposition of the fee under the County\u2019s power to impose excise taxes.
