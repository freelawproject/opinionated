Appellants, the Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Association, Inc., Montgomery Countryside Alliance, Inc., Christopher and Sandra Sappe, and Gary Noubarian, seek our review of that Board decision, in which it declined to review appellants\u2019 administrative appeal on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Appellants raise two questions for our consideration. We rephrase those questions for clarity and reorder them as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">I. Whether the Board erred where it declined to review the Frederick County Health Department\u2019s determination of \u201cseptic system adequacy\u201d on the grounds it lacked jurisdiction;</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">II. Whether the Board erred where it determined the site plan as amended was not subject to Frederick County\u2019s current site plan review criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We answer these questions in the negative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">This dispute arises out of the ongoing efforts of appellee, the Global Mission Church of Greater Washington (\u201cGMC\u201d), to build a 138,027 square foot place of worship in Frederick County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>These efforts began in 2009 when GMC submitted Site Development Plan SP 92-37 (\u201cSP 92-37\u201d) for consideration by the Frederick County Planning Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d or \u201cPlanning Commission\u201d). SP 92-37 described GMC\u2019s plan to build a large-scale place of worship, which would include the sanctuary itself, dining and kitchen facilities, offices, meeting rooms, and a multi-purpose hall. The plan also included the installation of a septic tank with a total loading capacity of 4,999 gallons per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">GMC held several meetings with both Commission staff and Frederick County staff during the first half of 2009. As the site plan made its way through the review process, two significant issues arose \u2014 the adequacy of the septic system and the need for a secondary emergency access to the property. Despite these two issues, SP 92-37 was brought before the Commission for consideration, and public hearings regarding the site plan were held on July 8 and July 15, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">A Commission staff report recommended the conditional approval of SP 92-37. This approval was drawn from the recommendations of the Engineering, Planning, and Life Safety Sections of the Frederick County Planning Department, as well as the Frederick County Health Department. The Health Department recommended approval of the site plan after a series of negotiations between GMC and the Department regarding proposed water and septic facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The July 15, 2009 hearing turned out to be a watershed moment in the life of SP 92-37. The Commission heard from GMC, county staff, and individual citizens and citizen groups with regard to the site plan. The septic system emerged as a significant concern for the Commission, and it granted a ninety-day continuance in the proceedings in order to give GMC and County staff an opportunity to address the septic system and other issues raised during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">During that ninety-day period, the County sought additional information from GMC regarding the issues raised at the July 15, 2009 hearing, which GMC provided on September 14, 2009. After that, no additional information was requested and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>further meetings were scheduled. Rather, another public hearing was scheduled for October 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">A week before the scheduled hearing, Commission staff released another Staff Report, in which it changed positions and recommended denial of SP 92-37. This new recommendation was based on a review by the Health Department and the Life Safety Section of the new information GMC submitted. The Health Department was concerned that the proposed building capacity would lead to an average septic discharge that would exceed the septic system\u2019s loading capacity. The County Life Safety Section determined the proposed building\u2019s occupant capacity would be four times the number it originally anticipated, and, accordingly, it determined the site plan would need a secondary emergency access road.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">This new recommendation created an additional hurdle for GMC. In an effort to avoid denial of its proposed site plan, GMC sought to hold additional discussions with County staff regarding the revised recommendation. GMC was able to meet only with the Health Department before the hearing, where a Department staff member suggested GMC seek a continuance. Two days before the hearing, on October 12, 2009, GMC requested a continuance, and again, at the October 14 hearing, it reiterated that request before the full Commission. Despite the multiple requests, the Commission denied a continuance and proceeded with the hearing. The Commission heard testimony and received evidence from GMC and the public. Many members of the public objected to the site plan, citing the potential negative impact of the project on the area\u2019s rural and scenic nature, as well as environmental concerns. Notwithstanding GMC\u2019s proffered concessions to address these concerns,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commission denied SP 92-37 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>basis of the revised Staff Report, the lack of adequate septic capacity, and GMC\u2019s failure to provide for a secondary access road.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">GMC sought review of the Commission\u2019s denial from the County Board of Appeals. The Board held a hearing on January 20, 2010, in which it decided to proceed with a <em>de novo </em>review, and heard a significant amount of testimony for and against SP 92-37. The Board issued its decision on March 25, 2010, in which it vacated and remanded the decision of the Commission. The Board explained that the Commission had denied GMC due process because GMC was not afforded a \u201cmeaningful and adequate opportunity\u201d to address the concerns of the Health Department and the County with regard to the septic system and secondary access road, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Of particular significance to the present appeal, the Board\u2019s opinion resolved a jurisdictional issue that arises in this case. The Board explained that the Maryland Department of the Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d), acting via the Health Department, possesses the sole authority to certify or approve proposed septic systems. According to the Frederick County Code, before the Commission can approve a proposed site plan, the Health Department must approve the site plan\u2019s proposed water and sewer facilities. <em>See </em>Frederick County Code of Ordinances (\u201cF.C.C.\u201d) \u00a7 1-19-3.300.4 (2014).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>without MDE\u2019s approval of the proposed septic system, the Board determined the Commission lacked the authority to consider SP 92-37 at that time and should have granted GMC\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Appellees, the Frederick County Board of County Commissioners (the \u201cCounty Commissioners\u201d), were aggrieved by the Board\u2019s March 25, 2010, decision and sought judicial review from the circuit court. The County Commissioners, in their petition, claimed the Board\u2019s decision was erroneous because it considered evidence outside the record, and acted in excess of its powers by remanding the site plan application to the Planning Commission. The circuit court agreed with the Board that GMC was denied due process and the reasonable opportunity to obtain the Health Department\u2019s approval for its septic system, and, accordingly, affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">With this new opportunity in hand, GMC proceeded to revise SP 92-37 to address the concerns raised about the site plan, including those concerns regarding the septic system and the secondary access road. GMC submitted a revised version of SP 92-37 in July 2012,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the site plan once again went before the Planning Commission at a November 14, 2012 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">This hearing was attended by both County staff and the appellants, where appellants registered their opposition to the site plan. County staff recommended approval, however, because it determined the site plan was in compliance with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>applicable county regulations and the Health Department concluded that the septic system was of adequate capacity. Satisfied with the site plan\u2019s progress, the Planning Commission conditionally approved SP 92-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Appellants believed the Commission\u2019s conditional approval was in error and appealed the decision to the Board on December 14, 2012. Appellants contested the Commission\u2019s approval on two grounds: 1) the Health Department underestimated the maximum daily septic discharge; and 2) the Commission failed to consider adequately SP 92-37\u2019s compliance with the criteria of F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.4(A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board held a hearing to consider appellants\u2019 case and denied the appeal on jurisdictional grounds. The Board first explained it lacked the authority to review the Health Department\u2019s determination because, as a State agency, the Department possesses the authority to consider septic system adequacy pursuant to the Environment Article of the Maryland Code. The Board then explained that appellants\u2019 second assignment of error failed as a matter of law because \u00a7 1-19-3.300.4(A) was enacted after SP 92-37 was filed, and could not apply to the site plan. After denying appellants\u2019 requests for reconsideration of its decision in March 2013, the Board adopted its findings in a written decision on April 30, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Appellants petitioned the circuit court on May 30, 2013, for judicial review of the Board\u2019s dismissal of its administrative appeal. The circuit court heard the matter on December 16, 2013, and affirmed the Board\u2019s decision in a written opinion on January 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Appellants timely noted their appeal to this Court on February 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">A. Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Appellants present two sets of grounds for appeal. First, they argue that the Board had the jurisdiction to consider the Health Department\u2019s decision regarding GMC\u2019s proposed septic system because it already did so in the 2010 appeal. Next, appellants argue in effect that, because Lot 4 was added to GMC\u2019s site plan, updating the plan changes the date of filing. F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3 was amended in 2009, and the amending ordinance included a grandfathering clause that made the new version of the statute applicable to all site plans filed after July 24, 2009. Appellants contend that because GMC added Lot 4 to the site plan after July 24, 2009, the filing date of SP 92-37 has changed and the grandfathering clause is inapplicable, making the site plan subject to the current version of \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The Board and Commissioners (the \u201cCounty appellees\u201d) collectively counter and state, first, that appellants\u2019 Lot 4 issue is not preserved for our review. In the event that the issue is preserved, however, the County appellees explain that, despite the revisions to the site plan, review of the plan is according to the version of \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3 in effect at the time of the original submission. Second, they argue the Board cannot review decisions of the Health Department, because it is a State agency acting under the authority of the Environment Article of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">GMC substantially agrees with the County appellees\u2019 contentions regarding Lot 4 and \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3, and regarding the Board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to review the Health Department\u2019s decision on GMC\u2019s proposed septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">This case comes to us on appeal from an order of a circuit court regarding a petition for the judicial review of a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of an administrative agency. Our standard of review for such cases is well-established.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">When we review the decision of an administrative agency or tribunal, \u201cwe [assume] the same posture as the circuit court ... and limit our review to the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Gen. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>402 Md. 236, 244, 935 A.2d 746 (2007) (internal citation omitted). The circuit court\u2019s decision acts as a lens for review of the agency\u2019s decision, or in other words, \u201cwe look not <em>at </em>the circuit court decision but <em>through </em>it.\u201d <em>Emps. Ret. Sys. of Balt. Cnty. v. Brown, </em>186 Md.App. 293, 310, 973 A.2d 879 (2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 560, 979 A.2d 708 (2009) (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">We \u201creview the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency\u201d because it is \u201cprima facie correct\u201d and entitled to a \u201cpresumption of validity.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198 (1993) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The overarching goal of judicial review of agency decisions is to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision was made \u201cin accordance with the law or whether it is arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.\u201d <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 274, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012) (internal citation omitted). With regard to the agency\u2019s factual findings, we do not disturb the agency\u2019s decision if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 569, 709 A.2d 749 (1998) (internal citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). We are not bound, however, to affirm those agency decisions based upon errors of law and may reverse administrative decisions containing such errors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">\n<em>(i) The Board\u2019s Appellate Jurisdiction over Decisions of the Frederick County Health Department</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Appellants essentially seek to have this Court order the Board to review a decision of the Health Department regarding GMC\u2019s proposed septic system because it purportedly did so in 2009. We shall not do so because the Maryland Code, Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d), and the F.C.C. set up a regulatory scheme that places matters related to septic systems within the sole purview of the Health Department \u2014 a State agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The general responsibilities of county health officers are set forth in the Environment Article (\u201cEnvir.\u201d) of the Maryland Code. Among those responsibilities is the inspection of and reporting on \u201csewerage facilities in the county.\u201d Envir. \u00a7 9-102. In Frederick County, those responsibilities extend to the evaluation of proposed water and sewer facilities in site plans. Where a site plan includes service by non-publicly owned community water and sewer utilities, approval of the plan is conditioned on whether \u201cthe facilities [] meet the requirements of and receive approval <em>from the Maryland Department of the Environment/the Frederick County Health Department.\u201d </em>F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.4(0 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">COMAR sets forth the technical requirements for the approval of septic systems by MDE. That Department has promulgated regulations for the approval of septic systems by health officers pursuant to its statutory authority. <em>See </em>CO-MAR 26.04.02 References <em>&amp; </em>Annotations (2014) (citing Envir. \u00a7\u00a7 9-216, 9-217, 9-223, 9-252, 9-319, 9-510, 9-1108, 10-103, 10-301, and 10-304 as the statutory authority for regulation of septic systems). According to these regulations, the Health Department, as the responsible health officer for Frederick County, is tasked with approving septic systems of less than 5,000 gallons. <em>See </em>COMAR 26.04.02.05.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We think this statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>tory and regulatory framework makes clear that the authority to approve septic systems such as the one proposed by GMC is a function of MDE, delegated to appropriate county authorities throughout the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">With regard to zoning decisions, the Frederick County Code delineates the responsibilities of the Commission and the Board. F.C.C. Chapter 1-19, which contains Frederick County\u2019s zoning laws, lists the powers of the Board in F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-2.150(D). Those powers include, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">(1) [The power] [t]o hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter;</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">(2) [The power] [t]o hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the chapter upon which the Board is required to pass under this chapter;</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">(3) [The power] [t]o authorize upon appeal in specific cases a variance from the terms of this chapter, subject to the Board\u2019s administrative procedures[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-2.150(D). These provisions are, in fact, an adaptation of the provisions of \u00a7 4-305 of the Land Use Article (\u201cL.U.\u201d) of the Maryland Code. Section 4-305, which is part of the division of the statute entitled \u201cSingle-Jurisdiction Planning and Zoning,\u201d states that county boards of appeal may:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">(1) <em>hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made </em>by an administrative officer or unit under this division or of <em>any local law adopted under this division;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(2) <em>hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of a local law on which the board is required to pass under the local law; </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">(3) <em>authorize on appeal in specific cases a variance from the terms of a local law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We think the language of the F.C.C. and L.U. \u00a7 4-305 makes clear that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in zoning cases is limited to the review of any decisions made by the Commission under Chapter 1-19. Moreover, as discussed extensively <em>supra, </em>F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.4(0 expressly states that septic system decisions must be made by the State via its agents. (\u201c[T]he facilities shall meet the requirements of and receive approval from the Maryland Department of the Environment/the Frederick County Health Department.\u201d) Reading the statute to include septic system decisions within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction would lead to a result in contravention of the plain language of the statute. The statute\u2019s language clearly excludes approval of septic systems from the authority of the Commission and the Board. Furthermore, L.U. \u00a7 4-305 contemplates the review of decisions made according to <em>local </em>law, whereas septic system decisions are matters of <em>state </em>law and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">We think the F.C.C. makes clear that a person aggrieved by the decision of the Frederick County Health Department must follow the appropriate State-wide statutory and regulatory procedures for review of those decisions. The decision of the local health officer on a septic system is not a matter of county authority, but State-delegated authority. Similarly, decisions of the Commission and the Board are matters of county authority, as stated in both the F.C.C. and the Maryland Code. We hold that the Board did not err where it found it lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to review the Frederick County Health Department\u2019s decision on GMC\u2019s septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Appellants\u2019 additional contention that because the Board considered the substantive determination of the Health De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>partment in the 2010 appeal, it must do so again in the present appeal is unpersuasive because of its inaccuracy. The Board explicitly stated in its March 2010 decision that GMC</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">may have to appeal the decision of the Health Department pursuant to the applicable regulations set forth in [CO-MAR]. Neither the Planning Commission <em>nor the Board of Appeals is the appropriate body to hear an appeal of the decision of the Health Department to deny an applicant\u2019s septic system plan or the manner in which the Health Department made its decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">(Emphasis added). The Board did not decide anything substantive with regard to the proposed septic system and made absolutely clear it lacked jurisdiction. We hold, in light of the discussion <em>supra, </em>the Board did not violate appellants\u2019 due process rights because it has consistently declined to exercise jurisdiction over matters within the purview of the Frederick County Health Department, a State agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>(ii) SP 97-32\u2019s Compliance with F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We disagree with appellants\u2019 second assignment of error that the Board committed an error of law where it approved SP 97-32. According to appellants, SP 97-32 as submitted does not meet the requirements for the site plans in F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3 because it did not include Lot 4, where the proposed access road would be built.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Appellants effectively argue that the addition of Lot 4 to the site plan is not an amendment of the plan, but, rather, a new site plan application subject to the post-July 24, 2009, requirements of \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3. This would require the Commission and the Board to treat each amendment to a site plan as a brand new plan \u2014 a result we think unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">A close examination of the Frederick County Code provisions on the review of site plans, F.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-19-3.300 to 1-19-3.300.4, reveals that the statute possesses no language requiring the Commission to treat amended site plans as new site plans. First of all, this would create an unnecessary backlog of zoning applications, particularly where the amendments are minor. The statute already contemplates the necessity of amendments where the submitted information is somehow deficient. <em>See </em>F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3(G)(3) (\u201cThe submitted information, <em>if found deficient or in error, may be required to be resubmitted </em>over the certification of an engineer, architect, landscape architect, land surveyor or other certified professional.\u201d (emphasis added)). It bears noting that there is nothing following this language in \u00a7 1.19-3.300.3 that indicates that an applicant must start the approval process from scratch where information is resubmitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Moreover, we defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of its statute. The Board is the administrative body authorized to hear appeals on matters related to the application of the Zoning chapter of the County Code. <em>See </em>F.C.C. \u00a7 1-19-2.150. Given this subject matter expertise, we defer to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Zoning chapter. <em>See Marriott Emps. Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997); <em>Haigley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>128 Md.App. 194, 216, 736 A.2d 1185 (1999) (\u201cTo be sure, the consistent construction by an agency responsible for administering a statute is entitled to considerable weight. That deference is premised on the notion that <em>the agency has particular expertise in the area governed by the statute.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (internal citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The Board, in arguing for the date of filing to remain fixed with the date the original site plan was filed, examines and interprets Frederick County Ordinance No. 09-22-526 (\u201cF.C.O. 09-22-526\u201d). That ordinance amended the Zoning chapter of the County Code, specifically \u00a7 1-19-3.300.4 \u2014 the main provision at issue here. Of critical importance to this dispute is the grandfathering clause in F.C.O. 09-22-526: \u201c[T]his Ordinance shall take effect on and apply to site plan applications filed <em>after July 2b, 2009.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The Board\u2019s interpretation of this clause considers the filing date to be the date the <em>original </em>site plan application was filed, and not when an amendment is filed. The Board explains that if it were to interpret the clause otherwise, the Board would be reading verbiage into the plain language of F.C.O. 09-22-526 that is non-existent. <em>Cf Marriott Emps. Fed. Credit Union, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d 455 (explaining that courts will not insert terms to make a statute express an intent not reflected in statute\u2019s original form). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">A site plan filed pursuant to the Zoning chapter of the County Code retains the date of its original filing. We are in accord with the Board\u2019s reading of its statute and defer to its interpretation, especially in light of the plain language of F.C.O. 09-22-526. We think that, if a new filing date controlled for each amendment of a site plan, a certain amount of administrative discord would be introduced into the zoning process. \u2022 The Board, tasked with maintaining its administrative efficiency, is in the best position to determine how the grandfathering clause will apply to extant site plan applications. <em>See, e.g., Cowles v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>123 Md.App. 426, 437, 718 A.2d 678 (1998) (citing administrative efficiency as a persuasive factor in accepting interpretation of statute by Board of Appeals for Montgomery County in a zoning matter). Having a new filing date apply each time an amended site plan is filed would be grossly inefficient. The Commission would need to constantly update records to reflect new filing dates. Moreover, those site plans filed before July 24, 2009, would have to comply with the new version of \u00a7 1-19-3.300.3. This would unnecessarily extend the approval process for existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>site plans because the review process would begin anew for these plans. This would create a wholly unnecessary backlog. Avoiding unnecessary delays and administrative inefficiency commands a common sense reading of the statute. The plain language of F.C.O. 09-22-256 and the Board\u2019s interpretation of that ordinance are persuasive that the original filing date of a site plan should control with regard to the application of the grandfathering clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">In light of these considerations, we determine the Board committed no error in considering SP 97-32 \u2014 which includes Lot 4 after amendment of that plan \u2014 under the pre-July 27, 2009 requirements. The Board was not required to consider the site plan under the new requirements, and did not err where it found appellants had no grounds for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The Board\u2019s declination of appellants\u2019 administrative appeal was not erroneous. The Board\u2019s jurisdiction to consider the decision of the Health Department with regard to GMC\u2019s proposed septic system was necessarily limited by statute, and the grandfathering clause in F.C.O. 09-22-256 does not contemplate a new filing date for each site plan application. We hold the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss appellants\u2019 appeal was not arbitrary and capricious and that the decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.

The appellees collectively argue that appellants' arguments regarding Lot 4 are not preserved for our review. Our review is limited to the record made before the administrative agency and we cannot pass upon issues presented to us for the first time on appeal. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001); <em>Halici v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>180 Md.App. 238, 248, 949 A.2d 85 (2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 Md. 113, 956 A.2d 202 (2008). On pages 47-48 of the transcript of the Board's proceedings on February 28, 2013, appellants' counsel clearly raises the Lot 4 issue and the applicability of the revised ordinance to SP 92-37. Although the argument was, perhaps, not as detailed before the Board as it is before this Court, we think the issue was brought to the Board\u2019s attention sufficiently before it rendered the decision before us. Accordingly, we determine appellants have preserved this question for this Court's review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
