Law (\u201cCL\u201d) \u00a7 8-303(b). The circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>court, however, refused to enter such a declaratory judgment. Subsequently, the appellant filed this timely <em>pro se </em>appeal. He presents five questions for our review, which we have reduced to two and rephrased:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">1. Did the circuit court err where it dismissed the appellant\u2019s Complaint for Declaratory Relief without making a written declaration of the parties\u2019 rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">2. Did the circuit court commit an abuse of discretion where it denied the appellant\u2019s motions for recusal and pre-service discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">For the following reasons, we answer the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative. Therefore, we shall vacate the judgment below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">On September 13, 2014, the appellant wrote the Honorable John W. Debelius III requesting that he \u201cissue a warrant for the arrest of [President] Barack Hussein Obama\u201d for violating CL \u00a7 8-303.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, on September 22, 2014, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>appellant also wrote the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County requesting permission to appear in person before the Grand Jury to present evidence of President Obama\u2019s aforementioned alleged violations of Maryland criminal law. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney responded to the appellant by letter dated September 25, 2014. He indicated that \u201c[t]he Grand Jury for Montgomery County, Maryland has considered your request that an investigation be opened into whether documents relating to President Obama\u2019s eligibility for office are fraudulent ... [and] declines to investigate this matter.\u201d The letter was co-signed by the foreman of the Grand Jury; however, the foreman\u2019s signature was illegible.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On October 6, 2014, the appellant filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against John Doe, foreman of the Montgomery County Grand Jury. Also on October 6, 2014, the appellant filed a motion to conduct pre-service discovery and a motion to expedite the hearing. Both of these motions were denied by Judge Debelius on October 20, 2014. Therefore, on November 6, 2014, the appellant filed \u201cVerified Emergency Motions to (I) Disqualify the Honorable John W. Debelius III, and (II) Reconsider Orders Denying Motions to Conduct PreService Discovery and to Expedite.\u201d The appellant based his motion to disqualify Judge Debelius on the fact that he had previously sent him a letter requesting a warrant for President Obama\u2019s arrest, thus making him a witness to the action. Judge Debelius, by Order dated November 6, 2014, denied both the motion to disqualify and the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On December 2, 2014, the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County filed a Motion to Intervene and a Motion to Dismiss. On December 19, 2014, Judge Debelius granted the Motion to Intervene, ordering that the State\u2019s Attorney be added as a defendant. A hearing on the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was held before the Honorable Michael D. Mason on January 22, 2014. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Mason orally granted the Motion to Dismiss subject to the appellant filing an amended complaint. Judge Mason followed up his oral ruling with a written Order of Dismissal dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>February 3, 2015. Before that, on January 27, 2015, the appellant filed an Amended Complaint along with a Motion to Alter or Amend the January 22, 2014, Order of Dismissal. Judge Mason denied the Motion to Alter or Amend on May 11, 2015. Four days later, the appellant timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">I. Dismissal of Complaint for Declaratory Relief</p>\n<p id=\"AEv\">A. The Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The parties agree that in granting the Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Relief, the circuit court failed to discharge its duty to make a written declaration of the appellant\u2019s rights. Therefore, the parties concur that at the very least a procedural remand for re-entry of judgment is appropriate. Their agreement, however, ends here.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">According to the appellant, the circuit court erred in the first place where it granted the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. The appellant advances this argument on a variety of grounds. First, the appellant asserts that under Maryland law, the granting of a motion to dismiss is \u201crarely appropriate in a declaratory judgment action,\u201d <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 465, 494 A.2d 934 (1985), and thus was inappropriate here. Second, the appellant contends that the circuit court should have addressed the fundamental question raised in his Complaint for Declaratory Relief, which was whether the preconditions established by the Court of Appeals in <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 40 A.2d 319 (1944), \u201cimproperly impaired [his] Common Law right to directly and in person petition the Grand Jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. Third, the appellant argues the circuit court erred by dismissing the Complaint without addressing issues raised therein that were left unresolved by <em>Brack. </em>These include whether, after he has \u201cexhausted] his remedy before the magistrate and state\u2019s attorney,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 97, 40 A.2d 319, he has the right to present to the foreman <em>in person </em>his request to appear before the Grand Jury, and whether the foreman would thereafter be required to present his request to the body over which he presides. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Finally, the appellant assigns error to the fact that \u201cthe circuit court failed to declare whether [his] right to access the Grand Jury has been interfered with by prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15 (emphasis omitted), namely, by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s alleged declaration to the foreman that he is a \u201cbirther lunatic.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The State\u2019s Attorney, on the other hand, argues that the circuit court did not err beyond its failure to make a written declaration of the appellant\u2019s rights. Accordingly, the State\u2019s Attorney asserts the circuit court did not err insofar as it granted the Motion to Dismiss. The State\u2019s Attorney, pointing to the holding in <em>Brack, </em>contends that private citizens only have the right to <em>ask </em>the foreman for permission to appear before the Grand Jury, not the right to present their requests to the foreman <em>in person. </em>However, the State\u2019s Attorney argues that in this case the appellant did not even trigger his right to ask the foreman for permission to appear because he did not \u201cexhaust his remedy before the magistrate and state\u2019s attorney.\u201d <em>Brack, </em>184 Md. at 97, 40 A.2d 319. The State\u2019s Attorney asserts that while the appellant apparently read \u201cmagistrate\u201d in <em>Brack </em>to mean the circuit court, \u201cthe Court\u2019s reference to \u2018magistrate\u2019 in 1944 is equivalent to \u2018District Court Commissioner\u2019 in 2015.\u201d Appellee State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Br. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In response to the appellant\u2019s contention regarding prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s statement to the foreman that he is a \u201cbirther lunatic,\u201d the State\u2019s Attorney argues that \u201c[u]nder Maryland law, ... there is no prohibition against prosecutors communicating to a grand jury their opinions about allegations before the jury, including the credibility of those who make the allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"A--\">We have recently explained that we</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">conduct[ ] a <em>de novo </em>review of the circuit court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss, <em>see Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 142, 46 A.3d 443 (2012), applying the same standard as the circuit court and determining whether that decision was legally correct. <em>See Reichs Ford Rd. Joint Venture v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Md. 500, 509, 880 A.2d 307 (2005) (citing <em>Adamson v. Corr. Med. Servs., </em>359 Md. 238, 246, 753 A.2d 501 (2000)). \u201cThe appellate court accords no special deference to the circuit court\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>437 Md. at 95, 85 A.3d 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Margolis v. Sandy Spring Bank, </em>221 Md.App. 703, 713-14, 110 A.3d 784 (2015). Thus, because we apply the same standard as the circuit court, we are required to</p>\n<p id=\"A_7\">assume[ ] the truth of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and of any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom. <em>See, e.g., Patton v. Wells Fargo Fin. Md., Inc., </em>437 Md. 83, 95, 85 A.3d 167 (2014) (citing <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 708, 697 A.2d 1371 (1997)). A court, however, need not accept the truth of pure legal conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Shepter v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>334 Md. 82, 103, 637 A.2d 1223 (1994); <em>John B. Parsons Home, LLC v. John B. Parsons Found., </em>217 Md.App. 39, 69, 90 A.3d 534 (2014) (quoting <em>Shenker v. Laureate Educ., Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 335, 983 A.2d 408 (2009)) (\u201c \u2018[m]ere conclusory charges that are not factual allegations need not be considered\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, \u201c[a]ny ambiguity or uncertainty in the allegations bearing on whether the complaint states a cause of action must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>construed against the pleader.\u201d <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 335, 983 A.2d 408; <em>John B. Parsons, </em>217 Md.App. at 69, 90 A.3d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">A court should dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only if the alleged facts and reasonable inferences would fail to afford relief to the plaintiff. <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 709, 697 A.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\"><em>Margolis, </em>221 Md.App. at 713, 110 A.3d 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The seminal case on the issue of what rights a private citizen has when he or she desires to present evidence of criminal violations to the Grand Jury is <em>Brack, supra. </em>The Court of Appeals summarized its holding in that case as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">It is the opinion of this Court that every citizen has a right to offer to present to the grand jury violations of the criminal law. This does not mean that an individual member of that body may be approached. The citizen should exhaust his remedy before the magistrate and state\u2019s attorney as was done in the instant case, and if relief can not [sic] be had there, he then has the right to ask the grand jury for permission to appear before that body.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 40 A.2d 319. The State\u2019s Attorney argues that this holding stands not for the notion that a private citizen has the right to present <em>in person </em>before the foreman, but rather for the idea that he or she has the right to <em>ask </em>the foreman for the permission to appear before the Grand Jury. We agree and shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Brack, </em>as we see it, is straightforward. Its core is that \u201cevery citizen has a right to offer to present to the grand jury violations of the criminal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Conveniently, the Court of Appeals left no room for ambiguity regarding what this right entails. For example, the Court clearly stated that the existence of the right \u201cdoes not mean that an individual member of [the Grand Jury] may be approached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(underline added). In addition, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>described how a citizen is to go about exercising his right to offer to present evidence to the Grand Jury as follows: \u201cThe citizen should exhaust his remedy before the magistrate and state\u2019s attorney[,] ... and if relief can not [sic] be had there, he then has the right to ask the grand jury for permission to appear before that body.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the appellant first wrote Judge Debel\u00e1is to request the issuance of an arrest warrant for President Obama. He then wrote the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney to request permission to appear before the Grand Jury to present evidence of President Obama\u2019s alleged violations of Maryland criminal law. His latter request was responded to on February 5, 2015, in the form of a letter signed by the foreperson of the Grand Jury. That letter contained the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">On January 29, 2015, the Grand Jury for Montgomery County, Maryland received a sealed packet from you asking that in [sic] investigation be opened into whether documents relating to President Obama\u2019s eligibility for office are fraudulent. The Grand Jury declined to investigate this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"A8a\">Therefore, we agree with the State\u2019s Attorney that \u201c[the appellant] has exercised his right to ask the ... foreperson for permission to present his allegations to the grand jury.\u201d Appellee State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Br. at 4. We also agree with the State\u2019s Attorney that the appellant does not have the right to appear <em>in person </em>before the foreman. <em>See Brack, </em>184 Md. at 97, 40 A.2d 319 (\u201cIt is the opinion of this Court that every citizen has the right to offer to present to the grand jury violations of the criminal law. This does not mean that an individual member of that body may be approached.\u201d (underline added)). Here, unlike <em>Brack,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney delivered the appellant\u2019s request to the foreman. Therefore, the appellant\u2019s rights with respect to the Grand Jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>have not been violated, and thus the circuit court did not err in granting the Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">However, we agree with both parties that the circuit court erred in- dismissing the Complaint for Declaratory Relief without making a formal declaration of the appellant\u2019s rights. The Court of Appeals held in <em>Harford Mut Ins. Co. v. Woodfin Equities Corp., </em>344 Md. 399, 687 A.2d 652 (1997), that</p>\n<p id=\"AhI\">[t]he fact that the side which requested the declaratory judgment did not prevail in the circuit court does not render a written declaration of the parties\u2019 rights unnecessary. As this Court stated many years ago, \u201cwhether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u201d <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959). <em>See also, e.g., Christ v. Department, supra, </em>335 Md. [427] at 435-436, 644 A.2d [34] at 38 [ (1994) ] (\u201c[t]he court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs position on the merits furnishes no ground for\u201d failure to file a declaratory judgment); <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 467, 494 A.2d 934, 937 (1985) (\u201cthe trial judge should have declared the rights of the parties even if such declaration might be contrary to the desires of the plaintiff\u2019); <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 461 n. 3, 445 A.2d 343, 347 n. 3 (1982) (\u201cwhere a plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment ..., and the court\u2019s conclusion ... is exactly opposite from the plaintiffs contention, nevertheless the court must, under the plaintiffs prayer for relief, issue a declaratory judgment\u201d); <em>Shapiro v. County Comm., </em>219 Md. 298, 302-303, 149 A.2d 396, 399 (1959) (\u201ceven though the plaintiff may be on the losing side of the dispute, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>states the existence of a controversy which should be settled, he states a cause of suit for a declaratory decree\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AqQG\"><em>Harford, Mut. Ins. Co., </em>344 Md. at 414-15, 687 A.2d 652. Therefore, we hereby remand this case to the circuit court for re-entry of judgment. The re-entered judgment shall contain a written declaration of the appellant\u2019s rights with respect to the Grand Jury. This declaration shall be consistent with this opinion and the holding of <em>Brack, </em>and acknowledge specifically that a District Court Commissioner is today\u2019s equivalent of a \u201cmagistrate\u201d for purposes of the exhaustion requirement we have been addressing in this section. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>305 Md. 489, 501-02, 505 A.2d 511 (1986) (\u201c[T]he legislature has bestowed upon commissioners of the District Court of Maryland the authority \u2018in general, [to] perform all the functions of committing magistrates as exercised by the justices of the peace prior to July 5, 1971.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Md.Code \u00a7 2-607(c)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article)).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">II. Denial of Motions for Recusal and Pre-Service Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">A. Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The appellant argues that Judge Debelius abused his discretion in denying the motions for recusal and pre-service discovery. The appellant asserts that Judge Debelius was required to disqualify himself pursuant to Rule 2.11(a)(1) of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct (\u201cCJC\u201d), which states that \u201c[a] judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including ... circumstances ... [wherein t]he judge has ... personal knowledge of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding.\u201d According to the appellant, Judge Debelius had impermissible knowledge of the case as a result of being \u201ccontacted by [the appellant] prior to filing suit as required by <em>Brack ... </em>as a condition precedent to Sibley contacting the Foreman of the Grand Jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5 (underline omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In addition, the appellant contends the denial of pre-trial discovery was an abuse of discretion because \u201cif Sibley could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>not identify the John Doe Defendant, that person could not be served and the instant matter would ultimately be dismissed for lack of prosecution.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The State\u2019s Attorney, on the other hand, argues Judge Debelius exercised his discretion properly in denying both of the motions presently at issue. In large part, we shall adopt the various arguments advanced by the State\u2019s Attorney in our analysis below.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We apply the abuse of discretion standard of review to both a trial judge\u2019s decision whether or not to recuse himself and the denial of discovery. <em>See Cicoria v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 403, 426-27, 598 A.2d 771, <em>aff'd, </em>332 Md. 21, 629 A.2d 742 (1993) (citing <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 74, 581 A.2d 1 (1990)) (recusal reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>See also Bacon v. Arey, </em>203 Md.App. 606, 671, 40 A.3d 435 (2012) (\u201cWe review the denial of discovery under the abuse of discretion standard[.]\u201d (quoting <em>Beyond Sys., Inc. v. Realtime Gaming Holding Co., LLC, </em>388 Md. 1, 28, 878 A.2d 567 (2005))). As we have indicated time and time again,</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">[a]n abuse of discretion occurs \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court[ ] ... or when the court acts without reference to any guiding principles, and the ruling under consideration is clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court [ ] ... or when the ruling is violative of fact and logic.\u201d <em>Bacon, </em>203 Md.App. at 667, 40 A.3d 435 (quoting <em>Beyond Systems, Inc., </em>388 Md. at 28, 878 A.2d 567).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Neither the denial of the motion for recusal nor the denial of the motion for pre-service discovery constituted an abuse of discretion by the circuit court. We agree with the State\u2019s Attorney that \u201cnot only was there never a \u2018dispute\u2019 as to whether [the appellant] had contacted Judge Debelius, but \u2018personal\u2019 in the [CJC Rule 2.11(a)(1) ] context only means knowledge from an \u2018extrajudicial source,\u2019 not knowledge \u2018ac- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>\u2022 quired in a judicial setting.\u2019 \u201d Appellee State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Br. at 9 (quoting <em>Scott v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 130, 152, 926 A.2d 792 (2007)). \u201cOnly bias, prejudice, or knowledge derived from an extrajudicial source is \u2018personal\u2019 [for purposes of recusal].\u201d <em>Scott, </em>175 Md.App. at 152, 926 A.2d 792. Therefore, because Judge Debelius acquired the knowledge at issue in a judicial setting, we hold that \u201ca reasonable member of the public knowing all the circumstances would [not] be led to the conclusion that [his] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 253, 533 A.2d 916 (1987). Accordingly, he did not abuse his discretion where he denied the appellant\u2019s request for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We also agree with the State\u2019s Attorney regarding the issue of whether Judge Debelius abused his discretion in denying pre-service discovery. In the appellant\u2019s motion for pre-service discovery, he requested to that he be allowed to \u201c[direct] interrogatories ... to ... [the] Assistant State\u2019s Attorney [to whom he had written] ... to establish the identity of John Doe, Foreman, Montgomery County Grand Jury.\u201d However, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney was never a party to the instant action, and Md. Rule 2-421 only permits interrogatories against parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he circuit court \u2018has the inherent power to control and supervise discovery as it sees fit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bacon, </em>203 Md.App. at 673, 40 A.3d 435 (quoting <em>Gallagher Evelius &amp; Jones, LLP v.
