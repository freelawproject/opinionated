That fight concluded when Nottingham \u201csucker punched\u201d Post, causing Post to fall and suffer fatal head injuries. An indictment was returned in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, charging Nottingham with assault in the second degree and involuntary manslaughter for his role in Post\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">A jury trial ensued, in August 2013, but ended in a mistrial. Trial was re-scheduled for December of that year. Shortly before the scheduled retrial, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the original indictment and thereafter obtained a new indictment, charging Nottingham with involuntary manslaughter, assault in the second degree, reckless endangerment, intoxication, and affray. Following a second jury trial, Nottingham was convicted of all charges except intoxication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The circuit court imposed a sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter and concurrent five-year sentences for each of the other convictions. Nottingham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>thereafter noted this appeal, raising the following questions, which we have re-cast:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in instructing the jury on the crime of affray; and</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">II. Whether Nottingham\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated, where the State delayed his retrial by postponing his case and opportunistically re-charging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We hold that the circuit court erred in omitting an element of the crime of affray from its jury instruction and that the error, under the circumstances of this case, was not harmless, as to the affray charge. Because, however, that error had no effect on the verdicts for second-degree assault and reckless endangerment, either of which was a valid predicate offense underlying the manslaughter conviction, we affirm the remaining convictions. We further hold that Nottingham\u2019s right to a speedy trial was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Accordingly, we shall vacate his conviction for affray, affirm all other judgments of conviction, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Most of the facts in this case are not in dispute, as there were surveillance cameras in and outside of the bar where the crimes occurred, and film footage obtained from those cameras was admitted into evidence at Nottingham\u2019s trial. Where there may be any differing inferences to be drawn from those facts, we present them in a light most favorable to the State. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">During the evening of January 25, 2013, Nottingham, Post, and a third friend, Robert Jackson, were drinking together in the Harbor Inn, a bar in Ocean City. Shortly before closing time, in the early morning of January 26, what had been, in the words of the bartender, Herbert \u201cBuddy\u201d Groff, \u201ckidding around and playing\u201d turned into a fight when Post and Jackson took Nottingham\u2019s cell phone and hid it from him. According to one witness, William Wilkens, Nottingham then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>began to look \u201call over\u201d for his phone, \u201cthrowing bar stools\u201d and hurling obscenities. He eventually discovered that Post had the phone and demanded to know why Post had not so informed him. Then, in Wilkens\u2019s words, \u201cstupidity ensue[d].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Nottingham \u201cpushed\u201d or \u201cbumped\u201d Post in the chest. Post, in turn, \u201cgot aggravated\u201d and pushed Nottingham back. Nottingham also punched Post several times, including at least once in the face, and also pushed Wilkens in the \u201c[c]hest or throat\u201d area. Groff then intervened, telling Nottingham to \u201cjust stop it.\u201d As it was approximately 1:40 a.m. (twenty minutes before closing), Groff, after separating the men, asked \u201cMike Post to go out the front door,\u201d asked \u201cRobert Jackson to go out the back door,\u201d and allowed Nottingham to remain, \u201cbecause he had the tab\u201d for all three men that evening. As Post left, he, in the words of Wilkens, \u201cflipp[ed] off\u2019 Nottingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Nottingham \u201cpaid his tab\u201d and remained in the bar for a few minutes, when he approached the front of the bar, near the front door. Groff moved to block Nottingham from leaving, standing between him and the bar and suggesting that Nottingham leave through the back door instead. Nottingham told Groff that he \u201cjust want[ed] to go home,\u201d and Groff, seeing no one outside, relented and allowed Nottingham to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Unbeknownst to Groff, Post was still outside. Upon seeing Post, Nottingham punched him once in the face, knocking him to the ground and causing him to land on his head. According to the pathologist from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Post, the cause of death was the head injury he sustained from that fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Shortly afterward, Nottingham went back inside the bar and told the people inside that Post had \u201cslipped\u201d and fallen. Nottingham, Jackson, and Wilkens went outside and tried unsuccessfully to revive Post. Groff called an ambulance, but Post was pronounced dead at 2:20 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">After the first jury trial resulted in a mistrial, a new trial was scheduled for October 10, 2013, but the State moved for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>continuance, a request which was granted over defense objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A new trial date of December 10, 2013, was set. Shortly before that date, the State entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the original indictment and thereafter, on December 17, 2013, obtained a new indictment, charging Nottingham with involuntary manslaughter, assault in the second degree, reckless endangerment, intoxication, and affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Nottingham moved to dismiss, on the ground that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. After a hearing, on February 14, 2014, the circuit court denied that motion. The case was ultimately retried, before a jury, on June 16, 2014, and Nottingham was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, assault in the second degree, reckless endangerment, and affray.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Additional facts will be noted as pertinent to discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">I. The affray instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The court instructed the jury on the offense of affray as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The Defendant remains charged with the crime of affray. In order to convict the Defendant of affray, the State must prove that the Defendant willfully engaged in a fight with [the victim] in a public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Nottingham contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the jury instruction given for affray. He raises two distinct claims of instructional error: first, that there was insufficient evidence of either mutual combat or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>terror to the public and that, therefore, the instruction given was not generated by the evidence; and second, that the circuit court, in adopting the State\u2019s proposed affray jury instruction, omitted an element of the crime of affray from the instruction \u2014 namely, that to convict a defendant of an affray, the State must prove that the fighting was \u201cto the terror of the people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We begin with the question whether the instruction given was a correct statement of the law and conclude that it was not. We next consider and reject Nottingham\u2019s claim that no affray instruction was appropriate in light of the evidence (or lack thereof). Finally, we address the effect of the instructional error on the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">A. Affray</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Affray is \u201cthe fighting together of two or more persons, either by mutual consent or otherwise, in some public place, to the terror of the people.\u201d <em>Dashiell v. State, </em>214 Md.App. 684, 689, 78 A.3d 916 (2013) (citation and quotation omitted). Although affray shares common elements with common law assault and battery, it is, unlike assault and battery, not a crime against the person; rather, affray is \u201ca crime against the public and its aim is to protect the peace.\u201d <em>Hickman v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 238, 252, 996 A.2d 974 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\"><em>Hickman </em>involved facts not dissimilar to those before us in this appeal, i.e., a barroom fight escalating into the death of one of the participants. Writing for the Court, Judge Arrie Davis, observed that the case was \u201cone of first impression, namely, whether the common law crime of an affray exists in Maryland[.]\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>193 Md.App. at 247, 996 A.2d 974. Discussing the crimes of assault and battery, vis a vis, the then-recent legislative re-codification of those common law offenses into statutory offenses, the Court held that affray remains as a viable, chargeable common law offense in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In so holding, the Court pointed out that \u201c[u]nlike other states, which have codified the common law offense of affray, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Maryland has not and, therefore, if the offense exists, it is clearly only as a matter of common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 996 A.2d 974. The Court further observed that \u201cMaryland case law does demonstrate that common law affray has, historically, been a chargeable common law offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 996 A.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"> Because the offense remains viable in Maryland, the \u201cpublic place\u201d and \u201cterror to the people\u201d elements remain likewise viable. \u201cThe \u2018public place\u2019 and \u2018terror to the people\u2019 elements of affray are closely related,\u201d and \u201cevidence that a fight occurred in a \u2018public place\u2019 may be sufficient to establish, ipso facto, that the fight resulted in \u2018terror to the people.\u2019\u201d <em>Dashiell, </em>214 Md.App. at 690, 78 A.3d 916. To prove the \u201cterror to the people\u201d element, the State \u201cneed only show that the acts and surrounding circumstances were \u2018likely to strike terror in anyone,\u2019\u201d not that they \u201cactually\u201d have \u201cin any specific individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 78 A.3d 916 (quoting <em>Schlamp v. State, </em>390 Md. 724, 737, 891 A.2d 327 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In <em>Dashiell, </em>we sought to clarify the relationship between the \u201cpublic place\u201d and \u201cterror to the people\u201d elements of affray, relying on Lewis Hochheimer\u2019s treatise, in which he stated that, as to affray, \u201c[tjerror need not actually exist among the people\u201d; rather, \u201c[i]n a legal sense, fighting in public is to the terror of the people.\u201d <em>Dashiell, </em>214 Md.App. at 691, 78 A.3d 916 (quoting Lewis Hochheimer, <em>The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure, </em>ch. 36, \u00a7 243, at 281 (2d ed. 1904)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It appears that this comment was interpreted by the State, in requesting the instruction, and by the trial court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>giving the instruction, so as to obviate altogether the \u201cterror to the people\u201d element of affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Nonetheless, \u201cpublic place\u201d and \u201cterror to the people\u201d are distinct elements of the crime of affray, both of which, like any element of a charged offense, must be proven by the State, beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, the early common law commentators appear to have been in substantial agreement that affray consists not only of fighting in a public place, but that such fighting must be \u201cto the terror of his majesty\u2019s subjects.\u201d 4 Sir William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>144 (New ed. 1825); <em>accord </em>3 Joseph Chitty, <em>A practical treatise on the criminal law: comprising the practice, pleadings, and evidence, which occur in the course of criminal prosecutions </em>821 n.(x) (3d Am. ed. 1836) (\u201cAn affray is a public offence to the terror of the king\u2019s subjects---Every assault does not include an affray, as where the assault does not terrify the people in general, it being committed in private[.]\u201d); 1 William Hawkins, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>487 (8th ed. 1824) (\u201cIt is said, that the word \u2018affray\u2019 is derived from the French word <em>effraier, </em>to terrify, and that, in a legal sense, it is taken for a public offence to the terror of the people.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Subsequent cases establish that, to prove an affray, the State must, at minimum, show that the fighting and surrounding circumstances were likely to result in terror to the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two decisions are instructive in that regard: <em>State v. Heflin, </em>27 Tenn. 84 (1845), and <em>Carwile v. State, </em>35 Ala. 392 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In <em>Heflin, </em>the Supreme Court of Tennessee addressed the sufficiency of an indictment charging an affray, which failed to expressly allege that the fight occurred in a public place. The indictment in that case stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Bartlett Travis and William Heflin, late of the county of Montgomery, laborers, on the twenty-second day of February, one thousand eight hundred and forty-six, with force and arms, in the county aforesaid, an affray did make by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>then and there fighting together in the town of Clarksville, greatly to the terror of the good people[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In holding that the indictment was insufficient, the Court observed</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">that there may be an assault which will not amount to an affray, as where it happens in a private place out of the hearing or seeing of any except the parties concerned, in which case it cannot be to the terror of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 85-86 (quoting 1 Hawkins, <em>supra, </em>at 487). Not only did the Tennessee Supreme Court hold that to \u201cconstitute an affray, a necessary and indispensable ingredient is that the fighting must be in some public place,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 85, it further held that the omission of the \u201cpublic place\u201d element necessarily meant that the indictment did not sufficiently allege that the fighting \u201cbe to the terror of the people,\u201d despite the fact that the indictment itself contained similar \u201cterror\u201d language. We conclude that, considering <em>Heflin, </em>an indictment charging affray must expressly state both that the fighting occurred in a public place and that it tended to cause terror to the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">In <em>Carwile v. State, supra, </em>35 Ala. 392, the Supreme Court of Alabama addressed whether \u201ca place within an enclosed lot, ninety feet from a street\u201d in a town, and \u201cwhich could be seen from the street, is a public place, according to the import of the phrase in the common-law definition of an affray.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393. In concluding that it was, the Court noted that the \u201cdistinguishing characteristic of an affray is the terror to the people actually resulting, or presumed to result, from the fighting in a public place,\u201d and that, under the circumstances before it, \u201c[tjerror to the people\u201d could be \u201cpresumed from the fighting in a public place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. Although <em>Carwile </em>held that terror could be presumed from the fact that fighting occurred in a public place, it did not countenance omission of the \u201cterror to the people\u201d element from a jury instruction, nor is it plausible that it could have, given its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>characterization of that element as the \u201cdistinguishing characteristic of an affray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">As we made clear in <em>Hickman,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">An affray is an aggravated disturbance of the public peace and is an offence exclusively against the public. An affray is, therefore, characterized as a public disturbance, a crime against the public and its aim is to protect the peace.... As stated by the renowned authority on the English common law, Sir Matthew Hale, \u201cAn assault is but a wrong to the party, but an affray is a wrong to the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">193 Md.App. at 252-53, 996 A.2d 974 (internal citations, quotations, and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">In the instant case, the trial court omitted any mention of the \u201cterror to the people\u201d element from its instruction to the jury as to the crime of affray. In so doing, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">B. The instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The State submitted a requested instruction to the trial court, based, the prosecutor asserted, on the language of <em>Dashiell. </em>The court ultimately instructed the jury, based on the State\u2019s request, that</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">[t]he Defendant remains charged with the crime of affray. In order to convict the Defendant of affray, the State must prove that the Defendant willfully engaged in a fight with [the victim] in a public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">Defense counsel objected, not to the particular language of the instruction, but to the giving of the affray instruction at all, arguing that the evidence did not support the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">In the discussion of the State\u2019s proposed instruction, the following, turning on the import of <em>Dashiell, </em>was said:</p>\n<p id=\"AsR\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Dashiell[ ] deals squarely with the issue. The issue before the Court was whether or not the State needed to prove that it was to the terror of the public, which is what common law \u2014 the language of common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The Court, in Dashiell, stated that it need not be to the terror of the public, that ipso facto, if it happens in a public place, a fight is terror to the public. That is the square holding of Dashiell.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">THE COURT: Wait a minute now. But it says in a public place to the terror of the'people.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: That is the common law language, but Dashiell deal[t] with that issue. Because the issue before the Court in Dashiell was whether or not the State needed to prove that there were people in terror, because they had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The Court of Special Appeals said that they need not show that there was any terror to the public, that ipso facto, if there is a fight in a public space, it is considered terror to the public, it need not be part of the elements the state need prove. And that is the square holding of Dashiell.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a question, what is meant by, to the terror of the people? I think what [Defense Counsel] is saying, that phrase to the terror of the people means there must be a public disturbance that must affect the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">But I understand reading the case, it was an or conjunction, either in a public place or to the terror of the people. It means, if you\u2019ve got one or the other of them, you\u2019ve got the instruction, so I read the case. So, I will accept your instruction on affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">As we have concluded, the instruction, by omitting the \u201cto the terror of the people\u201d element, was erroneous. The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Dashiell </em>in its urging of the instruction given was misplaced. Dashiell was charged, not with affray, but with involuntary manslaughter. Our discussion concluded that Dashiell was entitled to an instruction that self-defense was a defense to affray, to the extent that affray was an underlying element of the involuntary manslaughter charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Thus, we reaffirm that affray is a viable common law offense in Maryland and that, when charged, and if the evidence justifies, a defendant is entitled to an instruction that contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>both inherent elements of the crime \u2014 \u201cin a public place\u201d and \u201cto the terror of the people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">C. Sufficiency of the evidence as to affray</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We next address Nottingham\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence of either mutual combat or terror to the people and that, consequently, no affray instruction was appropriate in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Claims of instructional error are governed by Maryland Rule 4-325, which provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">(c) How Given. The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">(e) Objection. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Rule 4-S25(c) requires that a trial court give a requested jury instruction \u201cwhere \u2018(1) the instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.\u2019\u201d <em>Cost v. State, </em>417 Md. 360, 368-69, 10 A.3d 184 (2010) (quoting <em>Dickey v. State, </em>404 Md. 187, 197-98, 946 A.2d 444 (2008)). Only the second condition, whether the instruction was \u201capplicable to the facts of the case,\u201d is at issue here. But before we can address Nottingham\u2019s claim, we must first determine, as the State suggests, which parts of that claim are preserved and which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Nottingham made a timely objection to the circuit court\u2019s affray jury instruction. He contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that, although it was clear that he had assaulted the victim in a public place, there was \u201cabsolutely no public surrounding it, no evidence of any individuals around.\u201d In response to the State\u2019s incorrect assertion that, under <em>Dashiell, </em>it was unnecessary to prove terror to the public, Nottingham countered that, in <em>Dashiell, </em>unlike in the present case, \u201cthere were other people present.\u201d Then, following the trial court\u2019s instruction, Nottingham repeated his objection, agreeing with the court\u2019s characterization of that objection \u2014 that \u201cit has to be a public disorder or some[ ] ... other person put in fear[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>At no time did Nottingham object to the challenged jury instruction on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of mutual combat. That issue is therefore not preserved. Md. Rule 4-325(e). As to that issue, reversal would be appropriate only if the alleged error were \u201cplain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the evidence that Nottingham assaulted Post at least three times; that Post \u201cpushed\u201d Nottingham at least once during the fight; and that, upon being ejected from the tavern, Post \u201cflipped ... off\u2019 Nottingham as he was leaving, it is clear that there was no plain error (or indeed, any error at all) as to whether there was sufficient evidence of mutual fighting to warrant an affray jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">On the other hand, Nottingham\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence of terror to the public to warrant an affray jury instruction is preserved. That claim, however, is without merit. Given the evidence that, inside the bar and in the presence of the bartender and other patrons, Nottingham threw several bar stools and punched Post at least once, and that there was mutual pushing and shoving, it is clear that there was sufficient evidence \u201cthat the acts and surrounding circumstances were likely to strike terror in anyone\u201d observing the fight. <em>Dashiell, supra, </em>214 Md.App. at 691, 78 A.3d 916 (citation and quotation omitted). We therefore conclude that an affray jury instruction was generated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">D. The effect of the instructional error on the verdicts</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Having concluded that the circuit court erred in omitting, in its jury instruction, any mention whatsoever of the \u201cterror to the people\u201d element of the crime of affray, but that it was appropriate to instruct the jury as to affray, under the evidence presented in this case, we turn next to consider the effect of the error on the verdicts. The leading case addressing the applicability of harmless error analysis to such an instructional error is <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8-15, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), which held that the omission of an element of an offense from a jury instruction is amenable to Chapman harmless error analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>In applying harmless error analysis in <em>Neder, </em>the Supreme Court framed the question before it as \u201cwhether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827. If, in answering that question, \u201ca reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error, the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 119 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The State was required to show that Nottingham engaged in affray, that is, \u201cthe fighting together of two or more persons, either by mutual consent or otherwise, in some public place, to the terror of the people.\u201d <em>Dashiell, supra, </em>214 Md.App. at 689, 78 A.3d 916 (citation and quotation omitted). The element omitted from the instruction, that the fighting was \u201cto the terror of the people,\u201d was contested below. Moreover, the part of the fighting when the fatal blow was struck occurred outside, in the winter, at an early morning hour.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we do not hesitate to say that, given that a portion of the fighting occurred inside the tavern, in the presence of others, there was sufficient evidence to establish \u201cthat the acts and surrounding circumstances were likely to strike terror in anyone,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 691, 78 A.3d 916, we cannot say that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>evidence was \u201coverwhelming,\u201d <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 17, 119 S.Ct. 1827, or that no rational jury could have concluded otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827. We therefore conclude that the error was not harmless, and we vacate Nottingham\u2019s conviction for affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\u201cUnder the law of this State, where there is a conviction for only one offense and an erroneous instruction on that offense, the judgment is ordinarily vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 290, 604 A.2d 489 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cHowever, where there are multiple offenses involved, as is the case here, the remedy for an error in the instructions on one of the offenses depends upon the degree to which the erroneous instruction taints each individual conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 604 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">As \u201cterror to the people\u201d is not an element of either assault in the second degree or reckless endangerment, it is clear that the erroneous affray instruction \u201cdespoiled only\u201d the affray verdict, leaving the other two verdicts \u201cchaste and pure,\u201d and \u201cthere is no good cause to wash out the judgment entered on\u201d the convictions for assault in the second degree and reckless endangerment. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, as the jury was properly instructed that it could convict Nottingham of involuntary manslaughter if it found him guilty of any of three predicate offenses \u2014 affray, assault in the second degree, or reckless endangerment \u2014 and it is clear from the verdicts that the jury found him guilty of both assault in the second degree and reckless endangerment, we hold that the conviction for involuntary manslaughter also is untainted by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">II. Speedy trial</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Nottingham contends that, in \u201copportunistically\u201d postponing his case by entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the original indictment and thereafter obtaining a new indictment, the State caused his right to a speedy trial to be violated and that, therefore, the charges against him should have been dismissed. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The right to a speedy trial is guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>State v. Kanneh, </em>403 Md. 678, 687, 944 A.2d 516 (2008). In addressing a claimed violation of that right, we apply the four-factor balancing test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), \u201cin which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\u201d <em>Kanneh, </em>403 Md. at 687-88, 944 A.2d 516 (quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182); <em>Glover v. State, </em>368 Md. 211, 221, 792 A.2d 1160 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Those factors are: (1) the \u201c[l]ength of delay\u201d; (2) the \u201creason for the delay\u201d; (3) the \u201cdefendant\u2019s assertion of\u2019 his speedy trial right; and (4) \u201cprejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182. None of these factors is, in itself, either necessary or sufficient to find a violation of the speedy trial right; instead, \u201cthey are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533, 92 S.Ct. 2182. But, before we apply the four-factor test, we must first determine whether the delay was of sufficient length to be deemed \u201cpresumptively prejudicial,\u201d because, unless \u201cthere is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In determining whether there was a sufficient delay to trigger a constitutional speedy trial analysis, we must first ascertain the parameters of the time in question \u2014 the starting point and ending point. Ordinarily, in a case in which there was a retrial following the declaration of a mistrial, the starting point for computing the length of delay begins at the time when the mistrial was declared, and the. relevant time period runs until the commencement of the retrial. <em>Icgoren v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 407, 420, 653 A.2d 972 (1995). That determination is changed, however, by the fact that, three days before the scheduled retrial, the State entered a <em>nolle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>prosequi </em>to the original charging document and, one week later, filed a new indictment. The Maryland rule in such case is that, so long as the State acted in good faith, the <em>nolle prosequi </em>terminates the original prosecution, and the speedy trial clock starts anew from the date of the filing of the new charging document. <em>See State v. Henson, </em>335 Md. 326, 336-38, 643 A.2d 432 (1994); <em>accord Clark v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 381, 393-94, 629 A.2d 1322 (1993) (\u201cIf the prior termination of charges is done in good faith, we start the speedy trial clock at the second indictment.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The State presented this very argument<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at the February 14, 2014 motions hearing, citing <em>Clark </em>and <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in support, specifically pointing out that prosecutorial good faith \u201ccan include changes to a charging document.\u201d At the conclusion of argument, the circuit court denied Nottingham\u2019s motion to dismiss without articulating specific grounds, stating merely, \u201cI find there\u2019s no violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Although the motions court did not articulate the basis of its ruling, it appears that it adopted the State\u2019s argument, as it did not engage in the <em>Barker </em>four-factor balancing test. In this respect, the instant case is distinguishable from <em>Henson, </em>where the trial court likewise did not engage in the balancing test, <em>Henson, </em>335 Md. at 332, 643 A.2d 432, but where, because the \u201cState\u2019s good faith in dismissing the charges ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>was neither presented to, nor decided by, the motions court,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 389, 643 A.2d 432, it was necessary to remand so that the circuit court could make findings as to whether the State had acted in good faith and whether Henson\u2019s speedy trial right had been violated, once the relevant time period had been determined. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 643 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Here, in contrast, given that the State\u2019s argument focused almost exclusively on good faith, and given the presumption that, \u201cabsent a misstatement of law or conduct inconsistent with the law, a trial judge is presumed to know the law and apply it properly,\u201d we conclude that the motions court found, as a fact, that the State acted in good faith in entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the original indictment and, one week later, returning a new indictment. <em>Medley v. State, </em>386 Md. 3, 7, 870 A.2d 1218 (2005) (brackets omitted) (citation and quotation omitted); <em>see also Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 489-90, 837 A.2d 248 (2003) (observing that, where motions court merely announces its ruling, \u201cwithout announcing any findings of fact,\u201d appellate court \u201cwill resolve ambiguities and draw inferences in favor of the prevailing party and against the losing party\u201d). Because, given that implicit finding, the speedy trial clock began on December 17, 2013, the date when the new indictment was filed, the motions court was obviously correct in denying, on February 14, 2014, Nottingham\u2019s motion for speedy trial, as it is clear that a two-month delay falls well short of triggering the <em>Barker </em>analysis. <em>See, e.g., Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 652 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (observing that, generally, a delay triggers a speedy trial analysis \u201cat least as it approaches one year\u201d); <em>Divver v. State, </em>356 Md. 379, 389-90, 739 A.2d 71 (1999) (observing that delay as brief as eight months could trigger constitutional speedy trial analysis); <em>State v. Ruben, </em>127 Md. App. 430, 440, 732 A.2d 1004 (1999) (observing that \u201cdelay of nearly 11 months from arrest to trial was of constitutional dimension, albeit barely so\u201d); <em>Icgoren, supra, </em>103 Md.App. at 423, 653 A.2d 972 (delay of eleven months and thirteen days \u201cbarely\u201d of constitutional dimension); <em>Howard v. State, </em>66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>McLApp. 273, 291, 503 A.2d 739 (1986) (delay of eight months and 26 days of constitutional dimension).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY REVERSED AS TO AFFRAY CHARGE; ALL OTHER JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION AFFIRMED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS ASSESSED ONE HALF TO WORCESTER COUNTY AND ONE HALF TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-12\">. Different judges presided at the first trial, including the speedy trial motions hearing, and the second trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\">. The request for continuance was made by the State based on \"trial conflicts.\u201d At the motions hearing, the motions court observed that Nottingham\u2019s assertions of prejudice as a result of the delay were \"speculative\u201d and, at least implicitly, determined good cause and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\">. The circuit court granted a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the intoxication count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">. Hochheimer, in turn, cited <em>State v. Sumner, </em>36 S.C.L. (5 Strob.) 53 (S.C.Ct.App.1850), in support. In that case, the court addressed, among other things, whether the State was required to prove \"that the people were terrified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. <em>Sumner </em>held that \"[t]he existence of terror among the people, as a matter of fact, does not require proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further explained that, although affray \"must be charged to have been in a public place,\u201d if \"proved accordingly, ... it is presumed\u201d that \u201cthe inference of law will be strong enough to import whatever of terror may be a necessary ingredient.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b628-11\">. To the extent that <em>State v. Sumner, supra, </em>36 S.C.L. (5 Strob.) 53, holds otherwise, we decline to follow it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\">. The State misconstrues Nottingham's appellate claim as, in part, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In fact, Nottingham does not directly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence; indeed, his brief does not even mention Maryland Rule 4-324, the rule which governs motions for judgment of acquittal, the vehicle for raising such a challenge. Only because a challenge to a jury instruction on the ground that it was not generated by the evidence inevitably injects the question of evidentiary sufficiency into the case is the latter question before us. <em>See Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 292, 721 A.2d 699 (1998) (observing that, in considering whether a requested jury instruction was generated by the evidence, a reviewing court must determine whether the proponent of the instruction \"produced that minimum threshold of evidence necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that would allow a jury to rationally conclude that the evidence supports the application of the legal theory desired\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Given that the remedy for an instructional error is typically reversal and the opportunity for a new trial, <em>see, e.g., State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 290-91, 604 A.2d 489 (1992), whereas the remedy for evidentiary insufficiency is outright acquittal, <em>see, e.g., Evans v. Michigan, </em>568 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 1069, 1073, 185 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013), we would face a dilemma if Nottingham\u2019s instructional claim had merit, because the possibility would arise of reversing a conviction and ordering a retrial, despite having found that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a State-requested jury instruction and, therefore, surely insufficient to sustain the conviction. Because, as we explain, the affray instruction was generated by the evidence, we need not confront that dilemma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">. In federal criminal trials, there are two standards of harmless error, depending upon whether the error at issue is \"constitutional.\u201d Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>of non-constitutional error in federal criminal cases are governed by the standard articulated in <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), under which an error requires reversal only if it \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the juiy\u2019s verdict.\u201d Claims of constitutional error in federal criminal trials, in contrast, are governed by the more stringent standard articulated in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), under which an error requires reversal unless a reviewing court is \"able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The latter standard applies to all errors, whether or not of constitutional dimension, in Maryland criminal trials. <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>State, </em>276 Md. 638, 657-59, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Thus, <em>Neder </em>applied the <em>Dorsey </em>harmless error standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. Indeed, it was fortuitous that the act was captured on a surveillance video camera, as there were no other witnesses at the time the fatal blow was struck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">. Inexplicably, the State does not raise this contention in its brief. We may, however, affirm a judgment on any ground apparent from the record, especially given that this issue was raised in and, as we explain, decided by the court below. <em>See, e.g., State v. Phillips, </em>210 Md.App. 239, 270, 63 A.3d 51 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">. <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 7, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982), held that \"the Speedy Trial Clause has no application after the Government, acting in good faith, formally drops charges.\u201d That decision did not directly address whether the time from a defendant's initial arrest until the dismissal of charges should be counted in a speedy trial claim raised after a new indictment is issued. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>335 Md. 326, 338, 643 A.2d 432 (1994), the Court of Appeals interpreted <em>MacDonald </em>to hold that \"the period preceding the earlier dismissal is not counted in the speedy trial analysis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. Although it obviously could not have been error for the circuit court to have begun trial, on June 16, 2014, that is, six months after the new indictment was filed, given that Nottingham did not renew his speedy trial motion at that time, we further note that the Court of Appeals observed, in <em>State v. Gee, </em>298 Md. 565, 578, 471 A.2d 712 (1984), that it was \"not aware of an opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States or of the appellate courts of this State which holds that a delay of six months is of constitutional dimension.\u201d Indeed, it could even be argued that Nottingham affirmatively waived his speedy trial claim when, at the beginning of the retrial, the court asked: \"And to the extent any procedural things didn\u2019t go right in order, do you waive that?\u201d To which defense counsel replied, \"We do, Your Honor.\u201d As the State does not contend that Nottingham thereby waived his speedy trial claim, we shall not rely upon this ground in affirming the circuit court's denial of it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
