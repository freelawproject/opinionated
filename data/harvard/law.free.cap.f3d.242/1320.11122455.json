The bankruptcy court allowed Washington to avoid her attorney\u2019s lien on Washington\u2019s homestead property pursuant to \u00a7 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>the district court held that the hen was not a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d avoidable under \u00a7 522(f)(1). 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1). After review, we affirm the decision of the district court in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">On December 9, 1993, Washington entered into a retainer agreement with attorney Martha Irene Weed to secure her services in seeking a divorce. Paragraph 8 of the agreement provided that the attorney would have a lien on all of Washington\u2019s property, regardless of homestead, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">The undersigned attorney shall have a hen on all of the Ghent\u2019s documents, property (both real and personal, regardless of homestead), or money in his or her possession or another\u2019s for his/ her benefit for the payment of ah sums due under this agreement, and upon property or funds received by chent by settlement, judgment, or otherwise, or which was an issue in litigation between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">The assets awarded to Washington in the divorce proceeding included the marital home \u2014 homestead property under Florida law. On April 25, 1995, the state divorce court granted Weed\u2019s motion for a \u201ccharging hen\u201d against any and all assets awarded to Washington in the divorce, including her home, pursuant to the retainer agreement between Washington and Weed. In so doing, the state divorce court found that Washington had received proper notice and that Washington was indebted to the offices of Martha Irene Weed in the amount of $5,296.96 for professional legal services in that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">On August 28, 1995, Washington filed a Chapter 7 petition under the Bankruptcy Code. In the bankruptcy proceedings, Washington filed several motions to avoid Weed\u2019s hen against her homestead property. The bankruptcy court denied these motions on procedural grounds. Thereafter, Washington filed a second amended verified motion to avoid Weed\u2019s hen pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1) because it impaired her homestead exemption. After a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered a summary order holding that Weed\u2019s hen on Washington\u2019s homestead property was a \u201cjudicial hen\u201d which would be avoided pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">Weed appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to the district court, which reversed. Although Washington raised numerous issues in the district court, the district court focused exclusively on whether an attorney\u2019s \u201ccharging hen,\u201d as defined by Florida state law, is a \u201cjudicial hen\u201d that can be avoided pursuant to \u00a7 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Assuming that Weed\u2019s hen on Washington\u2019s property was a valid attorney\u2019s charging hen under Florida law and finding that such charging hens are not \u201cjudicial hens\u201d that may be avoided under \u00a7 522(f)(1), the district court held that Weed\u2019s hen on Washington\u2019s homestead property was not avoidable under \u00a7 522(f)(1). Washington appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-13\">\n<em>A. Attorney\u2019s Charging Liens Under Florida Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-14\">While federal law controls the bankruptcy issues in this case, state law governs the determination of whether a lien has been created in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding. <em>Grant v. Kaufman, P.A. (In re Hagen), </em>922 F.2d 742, 744 n. 2 (11th Cir.1991)(\u201cIt is agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>state law applies in determining the creation of a lien and the consequences and rights attributable to the lien, other than the bankruptcy statutory issues.\u201d)(citing <em>Matter of Fitterer Eng\u2019g Assoc., Inc., </em>27 B.R. 878, 880 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Under Florida law, the equitable right of attorneys to have costs and fees owed for legal services secured by the judgment or recovery in a lawsuit has been recognized for over a century. <em>Sinclair, Louis, Siegel, Heath, Nussbaum &amp; Zavertnik, P.A. v. Baucom, </em>428 So.2d 1383, 1384 (Fla.1983). The equitable mechanism recognized by Florida law for securing this right is an attorney\u2019s charging lien. <em>Id. </em>In order for an attorney\u2019s charging lien to be imposed, Florida law requires: (1) a contract between the attorney and client; (2) an express or implied understanding that payment is either contingent upon recovery or will be paid from the recovery; (3) an attempt by the client to avoid paying or a dispute as to the amount of the fee; and (4) a timely notice of a request for a lien. <em>Id. </em>at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">There are no requirements under Florida law for perfecting a charging lien beyond timely notice. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Sinclair, </em>the Florida Supreme Court found that the filing of a motion to enforce such a lien provides the notice necessary to perfect it. <em>Id. </em>Although an attorney\u2019s charging hen attaches to a judgment for the client, this equitable hen relates back to the commencement of the services rendered by the attorney on behalf of the client and takes effect from that time. <em>Miles v. Katz, </em>405 So.2d 750, 752 (Fla. 4th DCA 1981). An attorney\u2019s charging lien has priority over any judgment hen obtained after commencement of an attorney\u2019s services. <em>Id. </em>In effect, the interest created by a valid attorney\u2019s charging hen arises by operation of law when all of the requirements of such a lien are satisfied and is effective from the commencement of the attorney\u2019s services in advance of any judicial action recognizing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">\n<em>B. Judicial Liens Under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">Section 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor may avoid a \u201cjudicial hen\u201d on property to the extent it impairs certain exemptions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-10\">Notwithstanding any waiver of exemptions but subject to paragraph (3), the debtor may avoid the fixing of a hen on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such hen impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section if such lien is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-11\">(A) a judicial hen ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1). Section 101(36) of the Bankruptcy Code defines a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d as a \u201chen obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process or proceeding.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(36). Courts have described a judicial lien as \u201can interest which encumbers a specific piece of property granted to a judgment creditor who was previously free to attach any property of the debtor\u2019s to satisfy his interest but who <em>did not have an interest in a specific piece of property before occurrence of some judicial action.\u201d In re Fischer, </em>129 B.R. 285, 286 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.l991)(quoting <em>In re Boyd, </em>31 B.R. 591, 594 (D.Minn.1983)(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">Bankruptcy courts have found that hens that arise by operation of law without judicial action are not \u201cjudicial hens\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 522(f)(1) because they are not obtained through the judicial process. <em>See In re Fischer, </em>129 B.R. at 286 (holding that an equitable hen on a home arising in the context of a divorce proceeding was not a judicial hen that could be avoided under \u00a7 522(f)(1) as an impairment on a homestead exemption); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number><em>In re Davis, </em>96 B.R. 1021, 1022 (Bankr. M.D.Fla.1989) (holding that a final judgment merely recognized a preexisting equitable vendor\u2019s lien that arose by operation of law and that judgment did not make the lien a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d obtained through the judicial process that could be avoided under \u00a7 522(f)(1)); <em>In re Sacco, </em>99 B.R. 647, 651-52 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1989) (finding that an attorney\u2019s charging lien is not a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d under \u00a7 522(f)(1) because such a lien arises by operation of law and requires no affirmative judicial action); <em>see also In re O\u2019Connell, </em>167 B.R. 928, 931 (Bankr.D.Mont.1994) (finding that attorney\u2019s charging lien that arose by statute and related back to commencement of services is not a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d that may be avoided under \u00a7 522(f)(1)). Although such liens may be recognized ultimately by a judgment or other process, liens that arise by operation of law need no judicial action to establish a creditor\u2019s interest. <em>Davis, </em>96 B.R. at 1023 (explaining that because a creditor\u2019s interest in property predates judicial proceedings decreeing the existence of such a lien, such liens are not judicial liens avoidable under \u00a7 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code). Therefore, such liens generally may not be avoided as judicial liens pursuant to \u00a7 522(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">\n<em>C. Washington\u2019s Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">We now apply these legal principles to Washington\u2019s claims on appeal. Specifically, in the district court and on appeal, Washington made several arguments that Weed\u2019s lien against her homestead property was not a valid attorney\u2019s charging lien under Florida law and was created solely by the judgment of the state divorce court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">First, Washington argued that there was no valid charging lien created by the retainer agreement with her lawyer prior to the entry of the divorce court\u2019s order because: (1) she alone could not give a lien on the homestead property prior to her divorce because both she and her husband owned the property as tenants by the en-tireties at that time; (2) the retainer agreement between Washington and her lawyer failed to satisfy the requirements for a valid charging lien under Florida law because the hen provision did not require fees to be paid from the proceeds of the action alone; and (3) there was an insufficient showing that the attorney\u2019s services had created the homestead asset or that ownership of the homestead property was even contested in the divorce. Because her retainer agreement failed to satisfy the requirements for a charging lien under Florida law, Washington argued that no valid lien was created prior to the judgment of the state divorce court, thus making the lien a judicial lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Second, Washington argued that, even if the lien were otherwise a valid charging lien prior to the state court order, it was not enforceable as to her homestead property before the entry of the order because Florida law requires judicial action to create an interest in real property. Thus, Weed argued that the hen, as to her home only, was avoidable as a judicial lien under \u00a7 522(f)(1) because it was nonexistent pri- or to the judgment of the state divorce court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">In reversing the order of the bankruptcy court, the district court did not address any of these issues concerning the validity and enforceability of Weed\u2019s lien. Instead, assuming that Weed\u2019s lien against Washington\u2019s homestead property was a valid attorney\u2019s charging lien under Florida law, the district court held that an attorney\u2019s charging lien under Florida law does not constitute a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code because it arises in advance of judicial proceedings and relates back to the date that legal services commenced. <em>Weed v. Washington (In re Washington), </em>238 B.R. 852, 856 (M.D.Fla.l999)(\u201c[T]his Court holds that the attorney\u2019s charging lien in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>case is not a \u2018judicial lien\u2019, and is thus not avoidable under section 522(f)(1).\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree that a <em>valid </em>attorney\u2019s charging lien under Florida law arises by operation of law in advance of judicial proceedings and thus is not \u201cobtained by judgment\u201d as required for a judicial lien pursuant to \u00a7 101(36) of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(36). Similarly, because an attorney\u2019s charging lien under Florida law vests an effective interest in a creditor before the occurrence of some judicial action, such a hen does not conform to the statutory definition of judicial hens. <em>See In re Fischer, </em>129 B.R. at 286. Thus, we affirm the decision of the district court to the extent that it so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">This legal principle alone does not fully answer all of the questions raised in the district court, however. Only if Weed\u2019s hen was a valid charging lien under Florida law was the district court correct in reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that the hen could be avoided as a judicial lien. The district court did not address Washington\u2019s arguments that the lien failed to meet the requirements of a valid attorney\u2019s charging hen and that charging hens are insufficient to create an interest in real property under Florida law in any event. Even assuming that all of the prerequisites of a valid charging hen under Florida law had been satisfied by the retainer agreement between Washington and Weed, questions of Florida law remain regarding the enforceability of such a lien as against homestead property in advance of judicial action, either as a matter of public policy or real property law. <em>See e.g., Bakst, Cloyd &amp; Bakst, P.A. v. Cole, 750 </em>So.2d 676, 676-77 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999)(holding that a former wife\u2019s homestead property was not subject to her attorney\u2019s otherwise valid charging hen in light of public policy considerations generally prohibiting waiver of homestead protections in case where retainer agreement made no express mention of homestead property). The district court also did not address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the conclusion of the district court that a valid attorney\u2019s charging lien under Florida law is not a \u201cjudicial lien\u201d that may be avoided pursuant to \u00a7 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Nonetheless, we vacate the district court\u2019s order, dated September 16, 1999, which reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, dated July 29, 1998, and remand to the district court to address, in the first instance, the issues of state law raised by Washington.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>determinations of law, whether made by the bankruptcy court or by the district court. <em>Williams v. EMC Mortgage Corp. (In re Williams), </em>216 F.3d 1295, 1296 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">. Relying on the Supreme Court decision in <em>Farrey v. Sanderfoot, </em>500 U.S. 291, 111 S.Ct. 1825, 114 L.Ed.2d 337 (1991), the district court noted in a footnote that Weed\u2019s lien could not be avoided under \u00a7 522(f)(1) for the additional reason that the lien \"fixed\u201d to the homestead property before Washington received a fee simple interest in it \u2014 at a time when it was owned as a tenancy by the entire-ties. Because the Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 522(f)(1) does not allow for the avoidance of liens that fixed to property in advance of a debtor\u2019s ownership, the district court noted that the lien was unavoidable for this additional reason. This reasoning also assumes that Weed\u2019s lien on Washington\u2019s homestead property was a valid charging lien that properly vested in advance of the order of the Florida divorce court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">. We note that Appellant filed the same brief in this Court that she filed in the district court in support of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order allowing her to avoid the lien. Further, Ap-pellee has filed no brief in this Court at all. The inadequacy of the briefing to assist the Court in resolving the state law issues presented by this appeal further warrants our remand to the district court where the issues can be more fully addressed. Furthermore, our recognition of the state law issues remaining to be decided shall not be construed as expressing any opinion with respect to the merits of such issues under Florida law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
