At the time of testator\u2019s death, a portion of the estate consisted of certain shares of the stock of a railroad corporation, whose entire capital was divided into 14,000 shares, of which only 13,052 had ever been issued, the balance, 948 shares, remaining in the treasury. Thereafter, pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors, whereby it was determined to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the unissued shares ratably among the existing stockholders, the executors received, as their quota, 22 shares, which they sold, realizing by the transaction the net amount of $1,741.25.

At a meeting of the directors of the company after the death of the testator, held September 17th, 1884, it was resolved to issue said 948 shares as follows: to the stockholders of the company as they that day appeared of record on the books of the company, at the rate of seven and one quarter shares for each 100 shares of stock then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>owned and held by each stockholder, and in like proportion for any larger or smaller amounts of stock so owned or held. In addition, it was also resolved, that, for the purpose of equalizing fractional parts of shares between stockholders, the stock should be rated at $1.50 (it was then in the market at $1.60), and payments should be received from any stockholder whose fraction of a share should amount to a moiety thereof, in the like manner and at the same rate. On October 1st, 1884, the executors received from the Atlantic Avenue Railroad company 22 shares of the capital stock of said company, paying therefor $18.75 for equalization; and on November 22d, 1884, they sold the same at $80 per share, amounting to $1,760. After deducting the sum of $18.75 paid by them for equalization of shares, they now ask to whom they shall credit the balance of said sale of $1,741.25,\u2014whether the same should be paid to the executors and trustees to be held by them as capital, or be paid by them to the life tenants as income. In reference to the question whether an extra stock dividend shall be deemed capital or income, the English and American decisions are very conflicting, and the question has not been definitely settled by the Court of Appeals of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It is time, that the cases of Clarkson v. Clarkson (18 <em>Barb., </em>646), and Riggs v. Cragg (26 <em>Hun, </em>89), hold that the same is income. But in Brander v. Brander (4 <em>Ves., </em>100); Barton\u2019s Trust (L. <em>R., </em>5 <em>Eq. Cas., </em>238); Minot v. Paine (99 <em>Mass., </em>101); Doland v. Williams (101 <em>id., </em>571); Atkins v. Albree (12 Allen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>359); and Moss\u2019s Appeal (83 <em>Penn., </em>264), it was held to be capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The Court of Appeals of this State, in the case of Riggs v. Cragg (89 <em>N. Y., </em>487), Chief Justice Andrews writing the opinion of the court, in referring to the question of capital and income of stock dividends, say that <em>\u201c </em>the question has not been settled by the court of last resort, but it will be the duty of this court when occasion arises, to settle the question upon principle, and establish a practical rule for the guidance of trustees and others, which shall be just and equitable as between the beneficiaries of the two estates.\u201d I think, however, that the case at bar is distinguishable from the cases of Clarkson v. Clarkson and Riggs v. Cragg <em>(supra), </em>inasmuch as the extra dividend in stock was a part of the original capital of the company, which had not been issued, but was held in the treasury, to be issued or sold by the company at such times as it might deem proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">When this extra dividend was declared and issued, it was simply distributing among the stockholders what then belonged to them, for the company received no additional property or equivalent in any way for the stock so issued. It was only giving to them the balance of the unissued stock, which was held in the treasury. To regard this extra dividend of stock as income, would be unjust to the remaindermen, as it would reduce the value of the original issue of the stock to the extent of the extra stock dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">I, therefore, think that the extra dividend in this case must be deemed an augmentation of the capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>As to the second objection, I think that the trustees should be permitted to hold the investments now in their hands, for the reason that they were investments made by the testator in his lifetime, which by his will he authorized his trustees to hold for the purposes of the trust therein created.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">A decree may be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
