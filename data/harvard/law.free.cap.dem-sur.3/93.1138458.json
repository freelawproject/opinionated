The three instruments of 1880 were severally entrusted by her to three different persons, one of whom was an attorney, P. Shortly before her death, she insisted on sending for the three last mentioned papers, declaring her intention to revoke them. Accordingly, P. attended upon decedent, and wrote at the end of one, and upon the back of another of these papers, a formal revocation, each of which was read to the testatrix, who declared that it was \u201c all right,\u201d and subscribed it in the presence of P. and another witness, who thereafter subscribed their names to an attestation clause in the usual form. The third paper, which was in P.\u2019s possession, he omitted to cancel.

Biggs, her son by a former marriage, who, during the progress of the cause, produced in court an instrument dated December 2d, 1880, making, a different disposition of the property, with a petition praying for the probate thereof as decedent\u2019s will. Thereupon the first proponent filed objections, averring, among other things, that said last mentioned will had been revoked on April 3d, <em>1885; </em>and the two proceedings were consolidated and heard as one matter. It appeared that de.cedent' died April 14th, 1885, leaving the first mentioned paper, executed in due form, and also another paper, dated December 2d, 1880, executed in triplicate, each purporting to be her last will. The three triplicate originals were severally entrusted by decedent to three different persons, one of whom was an attorney, Oliver N. Payne. None of them contained or exhibited any recital or minute showing them to be intended as such triplicates, this fact appearing solely from the identity of their form and execution. The instrument of 1880 contained a clause expressly \u201crevoking all other or former wills by\u201d decedent \u201c made.\u201d Each of the triplicates was written upon both sides of several pages of legal cap paper. On the back of one of the set appeared the following:'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">\u201cIn the name of God, Amen, I, Charlotte Angus, wife of John Angus, of the city of Brooklyn, county of Kings, and State of New York, of the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>seventy-three years, weak of body but of sound disposing mind and memory, do hereby revoke and annul, and declare of none effect, my foregoing last will and testament, bearing date December 2d, 1880.

Biggs, by a prior husband; having executed a will dated June 19th, 1875, by which she devised all her estate absolutely to her husband, John Angus, which he propounded for probate, and which was contested by the son of the testatrix, upon the ground that she had executed a subsequent will dated November 2d, 1880, contain-; ing a revocation clause revoking all former wills made by her; and he asks that the will of 1880 be admitted to probate as the last will and testament of Charlotte Angus, deceased. It is unnecessary to discuss the question of the validity of the will of 1875, as it is disposed of by the will of 1880, which contained a provision expressly revoking all former wills made by the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The will of 1880 was executed in triplicate ;\u2022 and on the 3rd day of April, 1885, testatrix executed a revocation of said.will, written on the last page of two of the triplicate set thereof. The only questions to be disposed of are\u2014whether said revocation was executed in conformity to the statutory requirements for the execution of a will; whether the testatrix at that time possessed testamentary capacity; and whether she executed it free from undue influence. It appears from the testimony that testatrix, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>presence and hearing of the witness, Mary E. Thurber, told her husband, John Angus, to go to lawyer Payne\u2019s after a paper of hers, and also to Mr. Stanley\u2019s, as she had made a will and had done something and gave away something that did not belong to her, and she wanted to have it changed. \u201c She could not die with it on her mind.\u201d Her husband told her: \u201cno, if that suited her the way things were,, let it be so.\u201d She said: \u201c no, I can\u2019t die and let this be so.\u201d He refused twice to go, and then insisted on her writing an order to Mr Payne, which she did, first directing witness, Mary E. Thurber, to get her glasses, designating where they could be found. A few hours afterwards, Mr. Payne came to the house and drew the revocation of the will of 1880, writing it in duplicate, one on the last page of two of the triplicate set of the will of 1880, but neglecting to write it on the third of the set, which he had in dispossession.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">It further appears that, in the presence of witness, Mary E. Thurber, Mr. Payne read the revocation so written to the testatrix, and she declared that \u201cit was all right \u201d and signed it, and then at her request, the' witnesses, Mary E. Thurber and Oliver N. Payne signed the attestation clause. The testimony, also, shows that testatrix executed it without being unduly influenced by her husband, and that she was of sound mind and memory at the time of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Upon a careful review of all the testimony, I am of the \"opinion that the revocation was executed in conformity to the statutory requirements; that testatrix at the time of its execution possessed testamentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>capacity; that she was not unduly influenced to execute the same, and that the said will of date April 3rd, 1880, was legally revoked thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Therefore, I am of the opinion that the testatrix, Charlotte Angus, died intestate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
