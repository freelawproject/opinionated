Section 2481, subd. 6 authorizes the Surrogate, in a proper case, to vacate a decree of his court, and provides that the powers thus granted \u201cmust be exercised ..... in the same manner as a court of record and of general jurisdiction exercises the same powers.\u201d That manner is indicated by the practice which, in such courts, is customarily sanctioned in proceedings to set aside or open a judgment. Such proceedings may be begun by a notice of motion, or by an order to show cause.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
