It must, therefore, be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the destruction of that one of the two papers which was within her reach was intended to nullify the other. A decree denying probate may, therefore, be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Before I can pass upon claims for costs and allowances, affidavits, showing what time has been devoted to the controversy, must he submitted to the clerk.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
