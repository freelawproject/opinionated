Thereafter the administrator died, before the undetermined issues had been passed upon, and before any decree of settlement had been entered : whereupon contestants sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to revive the special proceeding against the administratrix of his estate.\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b261-4\"><em>Held, </em>that the same had abated by the administrator\u2019s death ; that no decree could ever be entered therein ; and that the application for revival must be denied.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">Application by Ella S.

Stevenson, now deceased, was, in his lifetime, administrator of this estate. An accounting proceeding, instituted by him. as such administrator, was pending in this court at the time of his death. In December, 1888, the Surrogate, by a written memorandum for counsel, announced the conclusion he had reached in regard to certain exceptions that had been taken to the report of. a referee, to whom the account and the objections thereto had been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">As to one of the matters in controversy, leave was given the accounting party to offer additional evidence. Such evidence was afterward, and in Mr. Stevenson\u2019s lifetime, introduced; but the issue upon which it bears has not been passed upon by the Surrogate, and no decree has been entered, settling, in whole or in part, the administrator\u2019s account. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>petitioners, who are children of the decedent Smith, now pray that the accounting proceeding be revived and continued against the widow of Mr. Stevenson, who has lately been appointed his administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">It is admitted that, prior to the recent amendment of \u00a7 2606 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see L. 1884, ch. 399), the Surrogate had no jurisdiction to cite A., as executor or administrator of B., to account for B.\u2019s dealings, as executor or administrator of C-, with C.\u2019s estate; except for such assets of C. as had come into A.\u2019s possession (Dakin v. Demming, 6 Paige, 95; Montross v. Wheeler, 4 <em>Lans., </em>99 ; Farnsworth v. Oliphant, 19 <em>Barb., </em>30; Le Count v. Le Count, 1 <em>Dem., </em>29 ; Bunnell v. Ranney, 2 <em>id., </em>327).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">But by \u00a7 2606, as it now reads, the Surrogate can require an accounting from a representative of a deceased executor or administrator, just as he might require it from the deceased executor or administrator himself, after the revocation of his letters. There is no doubt, therefore, that, in a new proceeding, this administratrix can be directed to render a full account of her husband\u2019s management of decedent\u2019s estate. I am convinced, however, that the proceeding, which has abated by Mr. Stevenson\u2019s death, cannot be revived.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In Leavy v. Gardner the Special Term of the Court of Common Pleas permitted an action to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien to be continued, after the death of the defendant, against the defendant\u2019s executor. Its action was reversed at General Term, and the reversal affirmed by the Court of Appeals (63 <em>N. Y., </em>624), upon the ground that the proceeding thus allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>be continued was not an <em>action, </em>within the meaning of the Code, but was a <em>special </em>proceeding-, to which the Code provisions, respecting the revival of actions, had no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">I am unable to find any reason for upholding, in the case at bar, the contention of this petitioner\u2019s counsel, that might not, in the case of Leavy v. Gardner, have been urged with equal or greater pertinency in behalf of the plaintiff Leavy. Section 755, which provides that actions shall not abate if the cause of action survives, does not apply to Surrogates\u2019 courts, but | 765 is expressly made applicable thereto by subdivision 6 of \u00a7 3347. This section 765 forms part of title 4 of chapter 8 (the title that treats of \u201c Proceedings upon the death of a party\u201d), and declares that nothing in the title contained shall authorize the entry of a judgment against a party who dies before a verdict, report or decision is actually rendered against him, but that, in such case, the verdict, report or decision is absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">No \u201c decision,\u201d within the meaning of that word in the section just quoted, has been rendered, as to any of the matters at issue in the accounting proceeding (Adams v. Nellis, 59 <em>How. Pr., </em>385; Weyman v. Bank, <em>id., </em>331); therefore no decree can ever be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
