That article directs that, upon the death of the testator\u2019s sister Judith, his estate shall be divided into fourteen parts, and distributed according to a scheme in such article specified. The paragraph that has given rise to the present contention is as follows : <em>\u201c </em>One other fourteenth part of my said estate is hereby given to and shall be vested in the children of my deceased niece, Hannah Talmage, in equal shares. And in case either of the children of said Hannah Talmage shall die before my said sister Judith, leaving lawful issue surviving, such issue shall take the share which would have been taken by such deceased child of Hannah Talmage if living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">It appears that Hannah Talmage left her surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>eight children. One of them, a daughter, died before the making of this will, leaving one child, an infant, who is now living. Is this infant entitled to the share in the estate that his mother would take were she still alive?</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">It is obvious that a testator, in selecting a class of persons\u2014for example, the children of A.\u2014as objects of his bounty, and providing for the issue of A.\u2019s children deceased, may or may not wish to include the issue of such children of A. as have died before the date of the will. In directing that issue shall stand in place of their deceased parents, and take the share which their parents would have taken, if living, he may intend to limit this secondary gift, if I may so term it, to the issue of such <em>\u201c </em>parents \u201d only as shall die after the execution of his will and before his own death, or before some other indicated period of distribution; or he may wish, on the other hand, to include .among his beneficiaries the issue of \u201c parents\u201d who are already dead. Which of the two is meant is sometimes plainly indicated by the testator himself. It is very far, however, from being plainly indicated in the case at bar. It has accordingly been necessary to make exhaustive examination of adjudged cases, in which language similar to that which has occasioned the present controversy has been judicially interpreted. The result of that examination will presently appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">It is insisted, on behalf of the seven children of Hannah Talmage who were living at the date of testator\u2019s will, and all of whom are still alive, that the words\u2014\u201c in case <em>either </em>(that is <em>any) </em>of the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>shall die \u201d\u2014refer to the contingency of the death of such children as were alive at the date of the will, and of such children only, and that those words have, therefore, no application whatever to any child or children then dead. If the testator\u2019s language must \u00bb he rigidly interpreted according to its grammatical construction, this proposition is obviously correct. \u201cShall die\u201d literally imports death in the future, and it was not possible, in December, 1883, that the mother of this infant should thereafter die, seeing that she was already dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">But in the construction of testamentary papers, it has often been the case that language, which by strict grammatical tests has referred to the happening of events in the future, has been held to include past events of a similar character. Thus, in Doe d. James v. Hallett (1 <em>Maule &amp; Sel., </em>124), a son of J. S., bom before the date of a testator\u2019s will, was held entitled to take an estate that such testator had devised to the sons of J. S., \u201c to be begotten.\u201d The same doctrine is declared in Hewet v. Ireland (1 <em>P. Wms., </em>426). So in Wilkinson v. Adam (1 <em>Ves. &amp; Bea., </em>422) a devise \u201c to the children I may have by A., and living at my decease,\u201d was held to include the devisor\u2019s children by A., who were in existence at the date of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In other reported cases, even more closely analogous to the case at bar than those above cited, the words \u201cshall die,\u201d and kindred expressions occurring in testamentary papera, have been held to have the force of the words \u201cshall be dead\u201d or \u201cshall have died \u201d\u2014the idea of futurity suggested by the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u201c shall\u201d being thus specially associated,' not with the period of death but with the period of distribution, and with the fact of death <em>in the past, </em>as at that period <em>in the future </em>affecting the respective rights of persons interested as beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Among the adjudged cases wherein this liberal, construction has been sanctioned, are : [a] Sheppard\u2019s Trust (1 <em>K. &amp; J., </em>269); [b] Chapman\u2019s Will (32 <em>Beav., </em>382); [c] Parsons v. Gulliford (10 <em>Jur., N. S., </em>231); [d] Loring v. Thomas (1 <em>Dr. &amp; Sm., </em>497); [e] Hannam v. Sims (2 <em>De G. &amp; J., </em>151); [f] Harris v. Harris <em>(L. R., </em>11 <em>Ch. Div., </em>663); [g] Jarvis v. Pond (9 <em>Sim., </em>549); <em>[h] </em>Adams v. Adams <em>(L. R., </em>14 <em>Eq., </em>246). The expressions construed im the foregoing decisions were respectively as follows, viz.: <em>a- </em>\u201c Shall depart this life; \u201d <em>b, c </em>and <em>d- </em>\u201c Shall die in my lifetime; \u201d <em>e- </em>\u201c Shall happen to die; \u201d /- \u201c Shall die;\u201d <em>g- </em>\u201cIn case of the decease . of,\u201d etc., etc.; <em>h- </em>\u201cShould any die.\u201d I am clear, therefore, that the infant claimant in the case at bar is not to be excluded from sharing in the benefits of the legacy here in question, merely because, in choosing his words for bequeathing it, the' testator has said \u201cshall die,\u201d instead of \u201c shall be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Even in Christopherson v. Naylor <em>(infra) </em>which, as will presently appear, is the leading case in support of the position that the issue of that child of Hannah Talmage who died before the date. of this will can take nothing:under it, the court said: \u201cThe question in this case does not depend upon the, words <em>\u2018 </em>shall happen to die in my lifetime.\u2019 Though according to strict construction those words import futurity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>they might have been understood as speaking of the event at whatever time it happened.\u201d I shall, accordingly,' treat the provision that is here to be construed, as if it were thus expressed: <em>\u201c </em>The issue of such children of said Hannah Talmage [(as shall have died before) \u201d or \u201c (as shall be dead at the death of) my said sister Judith] shall take,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">It is next claimed, in behalf of the surviving children of Hannah Talmage, that the bequest in dispute, even as its terms are above paraphrased, is primarily given to a class in which no other persons than themselves are included, and that the infant who claims the share of his deceased mother can take nothing under what they term the substitutionary clause, because, at the time the original class was created, his mother was not a member of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The counsel who makes this contention greatly relies upon the decision of Sir William Grant, in Christopherson v. Naylor (1 <em>Mer., </em>320). By the will there under review, a testator made a bequest \u201c to each and every the child and children of my brother and sisters which shall be living at the time of my <em>decease; </em>but if any child or children of my said brother and sisters shall happen to die in my lifetime and leave any issue ..... living at his decease ..... then and in such case the legacies hereby intended for such child or children so dying..... are given and bequeathed to his, her or their issue, such issue taking only the legacies which his, her or their parent or parents would have been entitled to, if living.\u201d It was held that, under the provision above quoted, the nephews and nieces of the testator were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>primary legatees; that to the issue of nephews or nieces nothing whatever. was given, except by way of substitution; that no person, therefore, could be treated as a substituted legatee, unless\u2019 there was some original legatee in whose place he was entitled to stand; and that, as none of the testator\u2019s nephews and nieces could have taken under the will except, those who were living at its date, the issue of those who were already dead could not take by substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The theory of interpretation which is invoked in the case at bar, in behalf of Hannah Talmage\u2019s grandchild, is very fully and emphatically enunciated by Vice Chancellor Kindersley, in Loring v. Thomas (1 <em>Dr. &amp; Sm., </em>497).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The special guardian insists that the testator has not made an original bequest to Hannah Talmage\u2019s children as a class, and then supplemented it by a substitutional bequest to the issue of members of that class who should thereafter die, but that he has extended the primary benefits of his bequest to a more comprehensive class, which consists of such children of Hannah ' Talmage as shall be living at Judith\u2019s death, together with the issue of such others of her children as at any time theretofore shall have died leaving issue surviving, such issue to take a parent\u2019s share, etc. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">While the question here presented has been frequently discussed in the judicial tribunals of England, almost from the beginning of the century, it seems to have been submitted in but a single instance for the determination of a New York court. A testator, whose will was construed in Lawrence v. Hebbard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(1 <em>Bradf., </em>252), had disposed of the residue of his estate in these words: \u201c The remainder of my property is to be equally divided among my eleven children, and in case of the death of any of my children, their portion shall be divided among their children if they have any.\u201d A daughter of the testator had died before the execution of the will, leaving a son her surviving. Surrogate Bradford held that such son was entitled to the share that his mother would have received, had she lived to claim it. The decision, however, was in part founded upon the fact that, at the date of the testator\u2019s will, there were but ten of his children living, and that his direction that the residue should be divided into eleven parts was, therefore, a plain intimation of his purpose to extend the benefits of the disputed bequest to the issue of the deceased daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Long v. Labor (8 <em>Penn. St., </em>229), May\u2019s Appeal (41 Penn. <em>St., </em>512), and Wheeler v. Allen (53 <em>Me., </em>232), are the only other American decisions that have fallen under my observation. They favor the broad rather than the narrow construction of such words as are here submitted for interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The English reports abound in cases very similar to the one at bar, many of them, indeed, almost identical with it. Some of those decisions strongly support, while others no less strongly discountenance, such a claim as is here urged by the special guardian. Very many of them turn upon the question Avhether the disputed gift is strictly substitutional in its character, or is, on the other hand, an original substantive gift to issue. The principle of the distinction is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>plain one, but its application has given rise to all sorts of subtleties and refinements of construction, and to decisions that are utterly irreconcilable. To review those decisions would be a profitless task. They are grouped below in the order of their dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The exclusion of the infant from the benefits of Mr. Aymar\u2019s will seems to be demanded by [1816] Christopherson v. Naylor (1 <em>Meriv., </em>320); [1827] Butter v. Ommany (4 <em>Russ., </em>70); [1833] Waugh v. Waugh (2 <em>Myl. &amp; K., </em>41); [1838] Peel v. Catlow (9 <em>Sim., </em>372); [1843] Gray v. Garman (2 <em>Hare, </em>268); [1852] Coulthurst v. Carter (15 <em>Beav., </em>421); [1853] Congreve v. Palmer (16 <em>Beav., </em>435); [1854] Thompson\u2019s Trust (5 <em>De G., M. &amp; G., </em>280); [1859] Stewart v. Jones (3 <em>De G. &amp; J., </em>532); [1859] Smith v. Pepper (27 <em>Beav., </em>86); [1869] Hotchkiss\u2019 Trust (L. <em>R., </em>8 <em>Eq., </em>643); [1871] Atkinson v. Atkinson (6 <em>Ir. Rep., Eq., </em>184); [1873] Hunter v. Cheshire (L. <em>R., </em>8 <em>Ch. App. Cas., </em>751); [1876] West v. Orr (L. <em>R., </em>8 <em>Ch. Div., </em>60); [1883] Widgen v. Mello (L. <em>R., </em>23 <em>Ch. D., </em>737).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On the other hand, the infant\u2019s claim as a beneficiary has the apparent sanction of [1835] Tytherleigh v. Harbin (6 <em>Sim,., </em>329); [1837] Giles v. Giles (8 <em>id., </em>360); [1837] Rust v. Baker <em>(id., </em>443); [1839] Bebb v. Beckwith (2 <em>Beav., </em>308); [1839] Jarvis v. Pond (9 <em>Sim., </em>549); [1844] Gaskell v. Holmes (3 <em>Hare, </em>438); [1856] Etches v. Etches (3 <em>Dr., </em>441); [1858] Hannam v. Sims (2 <em>De G. &amp; J., </em>151); [1858] Faulding\u2019s trust (26 <em>Beav., </em>263); [1861] Loring v. Thomas (1 <em>Dr. &amp; Sm., </em>497); [1863] Chapman\u2019s will (32 <em>Beav.,.</em>382); [1863] Jordan\u2019s Trust, (2 <em>New., </em>57); [1864] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Parsons v. Gulliford (10 <em>Jur., N. S., </em>231); [1866] Attwood v. Alford <em>(L. R., </em>2 <em>Eq., </em>479); [1868] Gowling v. Thompson (19 <em>Law T. Rep., N. S., </em>242); [1869] Philp\u2019s will <em>(L. R., </em>7 <em>Eq., </em>151); [1869] Potter\u2019s trust <em>(L. R., </em>8 <em>Eq., </em>52; [1870] Barnaby v. Tassell <em>(L.

C., found himself to be in, when he pronounced his opinion in Barnaby v. Tassell <em>(supra). </em>He sustained the claim of the issue of a predeceased child, but declared that he did so \u201c with the greatest hesitation and the least possible confidence in the soundness of the result.\u201d I shall follow his example. Decreed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
