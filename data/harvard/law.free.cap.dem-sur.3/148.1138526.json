Pro., \u00a7 2717, to compel payment of an alleged claim against a decedent\u2019s estate, an objection, properly interposed, whereby it is insisted that the demand is excessive in amount, necessitates a dismissal of the petition,\u2014the issue so raised being one which the Surrogate\u2019s court has no authority to determine.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-8\">Petition by Joseph Koch to compel Henry Alker and another, administrators of decedent\u2019s estate, to pay his claim.

If this objection shall be presented in the form of a verified answer, the claim must necessarily be treated as a disputed-one, and, as such, one which the Surrogate has no authority to determine. The respondent will be afforded an opportunity to interpose such a verified answer, embodying his objection to the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>In default of such answer, an order must be entered directing payment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
