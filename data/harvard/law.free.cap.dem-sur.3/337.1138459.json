S. (3 <em>Banks, 7th ed., </em>2301) provide that a legacy to a minor, in case it is of the value of fifty dollars or more, must be paid to the general guardian of such minor, upon the giving of security, to be approved by the Surrogate; and that, \u201cif there be no such guardian, or the Surrogate do not direct such payment,\u201d the legacy shall be invested, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the direction of the Surrogate, in permanent securities, in the name and for the benefit of such minor, which securities shall be kept in the Surrogate\u2019s custody. It was held, in McLoskey v. Reid (3 <em>Bradf., </em>329), that, in case the general guardian of an infant legatee should fail to give the bond required to be given upon the receipt of the ward\u2019s legacy, the Surrogate should proceed as if the ward were without a guardian, and should direct the fund to be paid into court and invested for the minor\u2019s benefit. In the case at bar, it appears that the executors of this testatrix have failed to comply with the provisions of the decree of April 8th, 1884, directing them to pay to Laura Th\u00e9beaud, as general guardian of the infants Isabella, Josephine, Panline, Jules and Marie Th\u00e9beaud, certain legacies bequeathed to them respectively by this testatrix, and that the reason for such failure is the fact that the general guardian has neglected to give the required security. The executors now ask that an order be entered, directing them to deposit the legacies in question in the Surrogate\u2019s court. This application is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Second.\u2014The executors also ask that such order may provide for the delivery, into the Surrogate\u2019s custody, of a certificate of deposit of certain watches, jewelry, etc., which certificate is now in their hands. By the will of the testatrix, these articles were bequeathed as a specific legacy to certain designated persons, among whom are some of the minors above named. The embarrassment under which the executors labor, in respect to this property, is one from which they cannot obtain relief by surrendering it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>into the charge of the Surrogate. The statute does not contemplate that that officer shall take such charge of any other bequests than bequests to an infant legatee, and even as regards those, he is called upon to take that responsibility, only when the thing bequeathed is capable' of investment for the infant\u2019s benefit. As regards, therefore, the watches, jewelry, etc., which are the subject of the specific legacy, the executors\u2019 petition must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">I also deny the counter application of the administrator of the estate of Laura M. Toler, deceased. He must seek relief in another tribunal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
