For the amount thus paid, the executors, in the settlement of their accounts, now seek to be credited. These accounts, together with the objection thereto, have been submitted to a referee, who, by his report now before me, finds that the interest which, after the testator\u2019s death, accrued upon the mortgage, has been improper!}*- charged to the <em>corpus </em>of the personal estate. This conclusion, unless it is justified by some statutory provision, or by some direction of decedent\u2019s will, is clearly erroneous; for, if both the statutes and the will are silent on the subject, the mortgages in question, together with the interest thereon, must he held, in accordance with the doctrine of the common law, as chargeable, like other debts, to the personal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In \u00a7 4, tit. 5, ch. 1, part 2 of the Revised Statutes (3 Banks, <em>7th </em>ed., 2205), appears the provision following : <em>\u201c </em>Wherever any real estate, subject to a mortgage executed by anjr ancestor or testator, shall descend to an heir, or pass to a devisee, such heir or devisee shall satisfy and discharge such mortgage out of his own property, without resorting to the executor or administrator of his ancestor, <em>unless there he an express direction in the will of such testator that such mortgage he otherwise paid.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Now, the testator, in the case at bar, seems to me to have given such express direction, and thus to have relieved the realty covered by the mortgages from the operation of the statute. He gives his real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>estate, and his residuary personal estate, to his executors, in trust, <em>\u201c </em>to pay over the entire net annual rents of said real estate, after payment of all <em>taxes, assessments, insurance and repairs, </em>of and upon said, real estate, and .the interest, income and profits and dividends of said personal estate,\u201d to his wife, in quarterly payments, for the support and maintenance of the family, and the care and education of her children, until the survivor of his two youngest children shall attain his majority; when the entire residuary estate, real and personal, is directed to be distributed in equal parts to his wife and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The specification of the burdens to .which the rents of the real estate are subjected does not include either the discharge of mortgages or that of interest on mortgages. It does not, therefore, in the least abate, but rather augments, the force of the fifth article, as an express direction, by the testator, that the mortgages, principal and interest, be satisfied out of the personalty. This interpretation, too, better than any other, seems to me to accord with the fact that the income, which is sought to be charged with the burden of interest, was given by the testator to his widow, for the maintenance of his family, and the care and education of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The referee\u2019s report is sustained, with modifications above noted, and a decree may be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
