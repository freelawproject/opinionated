It appears, from the papers submitted, that the only service of citation which has been made upon the next of kin of the deceased, is one of thirteen days\u2019 notice by mail, upon the next of kin residing in the city of Philadelphia. That, in my opinion, is not sufficient. The only way in which the court can acquire jurisdiction of non-residents is by the service of citation as pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>scribed by \u00a7 2524 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or by voluntary appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">But in this case I think that such application cannot be sustained, as there is no proceeding nor application pending for letters of administration in chief. Subdivision 1 of \u00a7 2668 of the Code provides that, where delay necessarily occurs in the granting of letters testamentary or letters of administration, in consequence of a contest arising upon an application therefor, or for probate of a will, or in consequence of the absence from the State of an executor named in the will, or for any other cause, temporary letters of administration may issue. This section assumes that an application is pending for letters of administration in chief, before temporary letters will be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Temporary letters may be granted where a delay necessarily occurs in the granting of letters in chief, in consequence of a contest arising upon the application for them. There being no application for letters in chief pending, no delay can occur in the granting of them. Therefore, the application for temporary letters must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
