Shepley contends that his probation automatically terminated, pursuant to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before the State filed its motion for probation revocation. We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">I. CASE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">[\u00b6 2] On February 13, 2001, Shepley, upon his plea, was convicted of one count of terrorizing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> two counts of assault,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of violating conditions of release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The crimes all occurred during 2000. The court sentenced Shepley to the county jail for a term of nine months, with all but fifteen days suspended. Shepley was also placed on probation for a term of two years, with special conditions that Shepley complete a batterers\u2019 intervention program, refrain from criminal conduct, refrain from the use of drugs or alcohol, and pay a monthly supervision fee to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">[\u00b6 3] On February 19, 2002, Shepley completed his batterers\u2019 intervention program. He did not file a motion with the court to terminate his probation. On April 27, 2002, Shepley was arrested and charged with criminal mischief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two days later, Shepley\u2019s probation officer filed a motion to revoke Shepley\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-19\">[\u00b6 4] Prosecution of the probation violation depends upon the interpretation of 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999) and the 2001 amendment to that section. In 1999, the Legislature added section 1202(1-B) to the probation statute. P.L. 1999, ch. 492, \u00a7 1. Section 1202(1-B) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-20\">Notwithstanding subsection 1, the period of probation for a person convicted of a Class D or Class E crime involving domestic violence must be 2 years, except that the term of probation must be terminated at the time the probationer completes a certified batterers\u2019 intervention program as defined in Title 19-A, Section 4014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-21\">17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999). The Legislature amended this statute in 2001, by P.L.2001, ch. 386, \u00a7 3, to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-22\">Notwithstanding subsection 1, the period of probation for a person convicted of a Class D or Class E crime involving domestic violence must be 2 years, except that the term of probation must be terminated at the time the probationer completes a certified batterers\u2019 intervention program as defined in Title 19-A, Section 4014, <em>unless there is another condition of probation that has yet to be met.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-23\">17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-24\">[\u00b6 5] After a preliminary hearing on the probation revocation motion, the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>Court <em>{Mead, J.) </em>specifically found that Shepley had successfully completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program on February 19, 2002. However, the court held that Shepley\u2019s probation did not terminate at that time because 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B), as clarified by the 2001 amendment to the statute, prevented Shepley\u2019s probation from terminating until Shepley met all of the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">[\u00b6 6] The court held that the 2001 amendment to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) applied to Shepley because it clarified the original legislative intent behind 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999) and, therefore, it was not a retroactive application of a new law. The court held that Shepley\u2019s probation did not terminate when he completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program because Shepley had yet to satisfy the probation condition that he pay a monthly supervision fee to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">[\u00b6 7] At a subsequent hearing, the parties stipulated that Shepley violated the conditions of his probation based on the court\u2019s ruling that Shepley\u2019s probation did not terminate before the April 27, 2002, violation. The court entered an order that partially revoked Shepley\u2019s probation, amended the conditions of Shepley\u2019s probation to require that Shepley complete an anger management program, and stayed Shepley\u2019s sentence pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">[\u00b6 8] This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">A. Retroactive Application of the 2001 Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-13\">[\u00b6 9] \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a matter of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Hailu v. Simonds, </em>2001 ME 155, \u00b6 8, 784 A.2d 1, 3; <em>accord State v. Nastvogel, </em>2002 ME 97, \u00b6 6, 798 A.2d 1114, 1117. As a preliminary matter, we must decide whether the 1999 or the 2001 version of 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) applies to Shepley\u2019s probation. Absent clear and unequivocal language to the contrary, a statutory amendment does not affect any penalties that were incurred before the amendment took effect, nor does it apply to crimes committed prior to the time the amendment was enacted. 1 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 302 (1989);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Riley v. Bath Iron Works Corp., </em>639 A.2d 626, 628 (Me.1994).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>[\u00b6 10] The 1999 version of section 1202(1-B) governs the termination of Shepley\u2019s probation because that version of the statute was in effect in 2000 when Shepley committed his crimes. <em>State v. Hardy, </em>489 A.2d 508, 512 (Me.1986) (\u201cPunishment is incurred at the time of the wrongful act, as opposed to when ultimate liability for the act is imposed. Thus, the wrongdoer must be punished pursuant to the law in effect at the time of the offense.\u201d). To apply the 2001 amendment to Shepley would violate the United States Constitution, article I, section 10, and the Maine Constitution, article I, section 11, as an ex post facto application of a criminal law. <em>See State v. Haskell, </em>2001 ME 154, \u00b6 6, 784 A.2d 4, 8 (\u201cA criminal statute will violate these constitutional prohibitions of ex post facto legislation if ... [it] makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">B. Time of Termination of Probation</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">[\u00b6 11] Pursuant to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999), the court must place a person convicted of a Class D or Class E crime involving domestic violence on probation for two years. Section 1202(1-B) then qualified the mandatory two-year probation period, stating that it \u201cmust be terminated\u201d upon the probationer\u2019s completion of a batterers\u2019 intervention program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">[\u00b6 12] In interpreting a statute, \u201c[w]e look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language as a means of effecting the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Pennings v. Pennings, </em>2002 ME 3, \u00b6 13, 786 A.2d 622, 627 (quoting <em>Coker v. City of Lewiston, </em>1998 ME 93, \u00b6 7, 710 A.2d 909, 910; <em>accord Gallant v. Bartash, </em>2002 ME 4, \u00b6 3, 786 A.2d 628, 629. \u201cUnless the statute itself discloses a contrary intent, words in a statute must be given their plain, common, and ordinary meaning, such as [people] of common intelligence would usually ascribe to them.\u201d <em>State v. Vainio, </em>466 A.2d 471, 474 (Me.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">[\u00b6 13] The common and ordinary meaning of the \u201cmust be terminated\u201d language in section 1202(1-B) indicates that the Legislature intended some affirmative act to terminate the probation, rather than for the probation to automatically terminate when the probationer completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program. Because some objective determination must be made about whether a probationer has satisfactorily completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program, court action is a prerequisite to termination of probation short of the statutory two-year term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-10\">[\u00b6 14] The central question presented in this case, therefore, is whether the court\u2019s finding that Shepley had satisfactorily completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program, made after the State charged him with criminal mischief, is an act sufficient to terminate the probation retroactively to the date he completed the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-11\">[\u00b6 15] Criminal statutes are generally construed strictly and any ambiguities are generally resolved in favor of the defendant. <em>See Nastvogel, </em>2002 ME 97, \u00b6 6, 798 A2d at 1117. However, \u201cthe rule of strict construction of a penal law is subordinate to this other rale, that the judicial interpretation must be reasonable and sensible, with a view to effectuating the legislative design, and the true intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>State v. Millett, </em>392 A.2d 521, 525 (Me.1978). Courts, therefore, must not construe a statute\u2019s plain language in a manner that creates an absurd, illogical, or inconsistent result. <em>Nastvogel, </em>2002 ME 97, \u00b6 6, 798 A.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-12\">[\u00b6 16] Construing section 1202(1-B) in the most reasonable and sensible manner, the termination of Shepley\u2019s probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>was effective the date the trial court entered its judicial finding. First, when drafting section 1202(1-B), the Legislature could have stated, but did not, that the termination of probation \u201crelates back\u201d from the court\u2019s finding to the date the probationer completed the program. Second, proponents of 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999) recognized that instances of domestic violence are widespread in Maine. See 1 Legis. Rec. 885 (1st Reg.Sess.1998-1999) (statement of Rep. Povich). The Legislature, therefore, sought to make the probationary period more demanding for persons convicted of domestic violence when it enacted section 1202(1-B). <em>See </em>P.L.1999, ch. 492, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAn Act to Increase the Length of Probation for a Person Convicted of Domestic Violence.\u201d). Finally, interpreting the provision at issue to require the court to \u201crelate back\u201d the termination of Shepley\u2019s probation to the date he completed the program is illogical because it will result in absolute uncertainty as to the probationary status and obligations of probationers who claim to have completed a certified batterers\u2019 intervention program but for whom there has been no formal termination of probation. <em>See State v. Heald, </em>382 A.2d 290, 294 (Me.1978) (\u201c[I]n the interpretation of penal statutes ... the legislative language will be construed to have such meaning as shall appear most reasonable and best suited to accomplish the objects of the legislation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">[\u00b6 17] Shepley\u2019s probation was in effect when the law enforcement authorities arrested him and when the State charged him with criminal mischief. He had not moved to terminate his probation, and the court had not found that he completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program. As a consequence, Shepley violated a condition of his probation, and, thus, the court properly revoked his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">The entry is:</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">.

In <em>Riley v.

Since adoption of the Criminal Code, courts have been authorized to terminate probation at any time earlier than the specified probation period upon a showing of good conduct, including satisfactory completion of a condition or conditions of probation. This early termination of probation can be initiated by a probationer, by a probation officer, or even by the court on its own motion. Thus, 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(3) (Supp.2002) essentially unchanged since adoption of the Criminal Code, and in its present form since 1991,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1184-10\">On application of the probation officer, or of the person on probation, or on its own motion, the court may terminate a period of probation and discharge the convicted person at any time earlier than that provided in the sentence made pursuant to subsection 1, if warranted by the conduct of such person. A termination and discharge may not be ordered upon the motion of the person on probation unless notice of the motion is given to the probation officer by the person on probation. Such termination and discharge shall serve to relieve the person on probation of any obligations imposed by the sentence of probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">[\u00b6 19] The Court\u2019s opinion suggests that when the Legislature enacted section 1202(1-B) in 1999, and included the specification that the two-year probation \u201cmust be terminated at the time the probationer completes a certified batterers\u2019 intervention program,\u201d the Legislature really meant nothing more than that once the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>intervention program was completed, probation might be terminated early upon a motion being filed as authorized by section 1202(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">[\u00b6 20] The Court\u2019s interpretation renders the \u201cmust be terminated at the time\u201d language crafted by the Legislature a nullity. It also suggests that subsequent amendments to section 1202(1-B) were unnecessary and superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">[\u00b6 21] In construing a statute, we have said that \u201c[n]othing in a statute may be treated as surplusage if a reasonable construction supplying meaning and force is otherwise possible.\u201d <em>Watts v. Watts, </em>2003 ME 36, \u00b6 8, 818 A.2d 1031, 1033 (quoting <em>Struck v. Hackett, </em>668 A.2d 411, 417 (Me. 1995)); <em>see also Stromberg-Carlson Corp. v. State Tax Assessor, </em>2001 ME 11, \u00b6 9, 765 A.2d 566, 569 (\u201cWords must be given meaning and not treated as meaningless and superfluous.\u201d). Our caution against treating statutory language as superfluous is particularly important in this criminal case where \u2014 as the Court recognizes \u2014 the statute must be strictly construed and ambiguities resolved in favor of the defendant. Examining legislative intent from the common and ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cat the time that the probationer completes a certified batterers\u2019 intervention program,\u201d a reasonable construction suggests that once the court determines that the probationer has satisfactorily completed the batterers\u2019 intervention program, the court must order that the termination is effective, retroactive to the date \u2014 \u201cat the time that\u201d \u2014 the program was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">[\u00b6 22] The Superior Court found, and the State does not dispute, that Shepley satisfactorily completed his batterers\u2019 intervention program on February 19, 2002. On this basis, pursuant to 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1202(1-B) (Supp.1999), the court was required to terminate Shepley\u2019s probation effective February 19, 2002. Because Shepley was not on probation when he was charged with criminal mischief on April 27, 2002, or when the State filed its motion for probation revocation two days later, the Superior Court erred in revoking Shep-ley\u2019s probation. Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1184-12\">. P.L.1991, ch. 258, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
