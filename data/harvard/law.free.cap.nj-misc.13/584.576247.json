Pari-mutuel is sometimes spelled thus, as a hyphenated word, and sometimes appears as two words and with variant spelling. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary briefly defines pari mutuel or paris mutueis as \u201ca form of betting on horses in which those who bet on the winning horse share the total stakes, less a small per cent, to the management.\u201d See, also, title \u201cParis mutueis or Paris mutuals,\u201d <em>27 C. J. </em>976, and title \u201cFrench Pool,\u201d <em>27 C. J. </em>987. The system was long ago classified, and condemned, as a lottery by the courts of this state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lovell, </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>458. It is immaterial that in the case before us the racing and attendant betting concerned dogs rather than horses. Chapters 56 <em>(N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1934, \u00a7 *136-4600 (95, 96) and 179 <em>(N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1934, \u00a7 <em>7-212 </em>to 217) of the laws of 1934, under the provisions of wdiich the lease was made, have been declared unconstitutional by the Court of Errors and Appeals; as has, also, chapter 391 of the laws of 1933. <em>N. J. Stat. Annual </em>1934, \u00a7 85-8. <em>Hyman </em>v. <em>Long Branch Kennel Club, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>123; 179 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>105. The object of the lease agreement was palpably unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Prosecutrix is a citizen and taxpayer of the city of Atlantic City. There wras no proof introduced against the <em>status </em>of the prosecutrix; and after the allowance of a writ of <em>certiorari </em>the status will be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>81 <em>N. J. L. </em>643; 80 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>498.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The argument upon which respondents rest their second point, and their remaining points as well, has been adversely determined by this court in <em>Gimbel </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>114 <em>N. J. L. </em>574; 178 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>62.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The motion to vacate the <em>allocatur </em>heard as a part of the argument is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The proceedings brought up for review are set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
