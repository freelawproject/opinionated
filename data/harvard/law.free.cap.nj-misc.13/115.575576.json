Berry.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-6\">For the defendant-appellant, <em>Ira F. Smith.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b128-7\">Brogan, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AZq\">The appeal is from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Ocean county entered in favor of the plaintiff. Seven grounds of appeal are urged for a reversal. Six are valueless.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The grounds (a) that the verdict was contrary to the weight of evidence; (b) that it was a compromise verdict; (c) that it was not predicated upon the evidence; (d) that the verdict was contrary to law, are ineffectual since they do not challenge judicial error. <em>Booth </em>v. Keegan, 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>538; 159 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>402. These questions should have been raised on rule to show cause. An appendix to the appellee\u2019s brief would indicate that they were so raised and determined adversely to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The next ground challenges the admission of evidence. This, too1, is ineffectual because it does not point out the questions and answers, the admission of which is challenged as error. <em>Booth </em>v. Keegan, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The ground \u00edot reversal, asserting that there should have been a nonsuit, is abandoned. The sixth ground, however, is formally correct, to the effect that a verdict should have been directed for the defendant, but it has no merit whatever. Furthermore it was raised on rule to show cause and is, therefore, not available as a ground of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
