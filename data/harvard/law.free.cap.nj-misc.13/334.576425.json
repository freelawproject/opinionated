The Hudson county board of taxation affirmed the assessment. The appeal covered also the assessment upon the lands and personal property. At the hearing before the state board, the appellant withdrew its objections to the latter assessments. The state board reduced the assessment upon the improvements from $169,000 to $150,000. The municipality thereupon sued out this certiorari, and now alleges that there was no legal evidence upon which the reduction could be predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">We find this claim to be devoid of merit. The prosecutor\u2019s witness, Yinik, appraised the improvements, as of October 1st, 1932, the taxing date, at $185,358. This represented what the witness conceived to be the reproduction cost, $218,067, less depreciation of fifteen per cent. The landowner\u2019s expert witness placed the reproduction cost at $156,493, and depreciation at twenty per cent. Therefore, the net value was, in his opinion, $126,155. It is true that this witness did not consider, in the making of his appraisement, certain items of construction, <em>i. e., </em>plumbing and heating, stoker and blower, sprinkling system, electric wiring, and a baking oven and furnace. But, considering these items, we are of opinion that the state board was entirely justified in reducing the assessment to' the sum mentioned. The president of the board viewed the property; and the board was unanimous in its conclusion. The board was privileged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>use its own knowledge and judgment in the appraisement of this property for tax purposes. <em>City of Bayonne </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and Assessments, </em>11 <em>N.

The evidence, in our opinion, fairly supports the challenged judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
