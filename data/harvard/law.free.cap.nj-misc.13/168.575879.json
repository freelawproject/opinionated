H. Thayer-Martin, state tax commissioner of the State of New Jersey, in the matter of the estate of John T. Dorranee, deceased, as made on October 10th, 1932, and amounting to $12,247,333.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">We have carefully studied and considered the voluminous records, proofs and briefs herein submitted. The opinions of Buchanan, Vice-Ordinary, in this matter when it came up before him for determination are reported in 115 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>268; 170 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>601, and 116 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>204; 172 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>503.
