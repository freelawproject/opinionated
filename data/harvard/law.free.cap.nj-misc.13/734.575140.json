It was, therefore, the duty of the board to affirm his action. A scientific basis for appraising a utility\u2019s property within the several taxing districts was proved and followed by the tax commissioner. The result was uniform. Such method conforms to the law, while the acceptance of the views of one hundred and sixty-three different assessors could lead to no useful result.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">The judgment under review, therefore, is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
