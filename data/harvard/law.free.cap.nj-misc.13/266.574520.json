Our books are replete with cases holding that such a specification is inadequate to bring before this court any ruling in the trial court, the latest, <em>Greenblatt Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Jacobs, 12 N. J. Mis. R. </em>176, citing <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>109 N. <em>J. L. </em>449.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The appeal having been perfected but not adequately presented on the pleadings, j the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
