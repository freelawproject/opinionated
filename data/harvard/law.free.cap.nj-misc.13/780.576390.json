The town was incorporated under the Town act of 1895, a general act entitled: \"An act providing for the formation, establishment and government of towns.\u201d <em>Pamph. </em>L., <em>p. </em>218; 4 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>5518, \u00a7\u00a7 317 <em>et seq. </em>By supplement <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1905, <em>p. </em>310; 4 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>5520, \u00a7 326), the councilman-at-large was to be designated mayor. In 1907 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>121; 4 <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>5426, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 37), a statute was enacted entitled \"An act to provide for the election in incorporated towns of this state of a councilman-at-large, to be called mayor, and to regulate his duties and terms of office.\u201d Under this act the mayor was given a two years\u2019 term. By supplement of 1932, page 27 <em>(N. J. Stat. Annual. </em>1932, \u00a7 215-37a), the mayor was given veto powers. The act of 1907, was held a general act affecting each of the incorporated towns in the state. <em>Herrmann </em>v. Guttenberg, 87 <em>N. J. L. </em>261; 93 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>889. See, also, <em>Boonton </em>v. Logan, 86 <em>N. J. L. </em>486; 92 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>97.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">There is nothing of a restrictive nature in the 1932 supplement which could limit its scope. <em>Winne </em>v. Cassale, 99 <em>N. J. L. </em>345; 123 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>533; 100 <em>N. J. L. </em>291; 126 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>324. It is a general act, if there ever was one, and the legislative purpose seems clear to vest in all town mayors the veto power.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>West </em>Hoboken, 90 <em>N. J. L. </em>1; 100 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>223, it was held that the powers granted under the Town act could be enlarged by legislation entitled \u201cAn act to authorize any incorporated town,\u201d &amp;e. By the same token it would seem that the powers of the mayor of an incorporated town could be enlarged by similar entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We can see no objection that the mayor has both a vote and a veto. He can perform different services, and after all the only limits upon the legislative power to control the affairs of a municipality are to be found in the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The writ will be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
