Prosecutor has a boatyard between state highway hTo. 4 and Toms River. The land lies to the south of Jake\u2019s Branch. There are gasoline stations all along the highway and a large one to the north of Jake\u2019s Branch in an almost identical location between the river and the highway. Prosecutor\u2019s property is admirably suited for the servicing of both boats and automobiles. Restricting the use of prosecutor\u2019s property to the business of a boatyard, and allied purposes, is without legal basis. Obviously, the restriction was arbitrary and baseless. There are no residences in the vicinity and the ordinance complained of, in substance, says to an owner of land on one side of Jake\u2019s Branch, \u201cyou may not service automobileswhile to the owner of land precisely situate on the other side of the branch, \u201cyou may make full use of your property to your advantage.\u201d Such action is not lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
