The car that did the damage was owned by defendant\u2019s brother, one Klein, and defendant had the privilege of using it. The only errors alleged are refusal to nonsuit and refusal to direct a verdict for defendant. The question is whether there was legal evidence for the jury that at the time of the accident the car was being operated by defendant\u2019s servant on defendant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Defendant, as has been said, had the privilege of using the ear, which was kept at the garage operated by one Isidore Katerwitz. The defendant did not drive the car, and when she used it, she employed Katerwitz to do the driving. On the occasion now under examination she desired to go and see her mother, and called up the garage. The telephone was answered by an employe of Katerwitz named Clarkson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Defendant asked for \u201cIzzy\u201d meaning Katerwitz and Clarkson said he had gone to supper. Defendant said, \u201cI want him to take me some place,\u201d and hung up. Clarkson testified that he said he would take her, but that \u201cshe evidently had hung up\u201d and \u201cdid not say anything.\u201d Defendant also testified that she hung up, on saying that she \u201cwanted him to take her some place.\u201d Plaintiff undertook to impeach Clark-son\u2019s testimony by proof of an inconsistent statement in another action, but of course such statement could not be used as evidence on the main issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">However, Clarkson undertook to drive the car to defendant\u2019s house, which was some blocks, away, to the southwest of the garage. His shortest route was south along Quitman street, then west five blocks on a convenient intervening cross street, then south on Stratford Place to defendant\u2019s home. But he needed some cigarettes, and to get them at a store on West Kinney street, started north, instead of south, on Quitman street, and the accident occurred at the very first corner, while he was northbound.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Without taking time to discuss the border line cases on deviation in detail, we are of opinion that assuming the defendant heard and assented to Clarkson\u2019s offer to bring the car, he was not operating it for her at the time of the accident. Hot only had he ignored the natural route, but was actually going away from defendant\u2019s house at the time. In <em>Shefts </em>v. Free, 105 <em>N. J. L. </em>577; 146 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>185, the normal journey had ended. Here, we consider it had not begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">But if we err in this regard, there was still no case for the jury, as the evidence altogether failed to show that defendant was in any way apprised that Clarkson was coming, let alone that she asked him to do so or even assented to his doing so. Quite conceivably she might have answered, if she had heard what he said over the telephone, that she did not know Clark-son and wanted \u201cIzzy\u201d or no one. The testimony failed to indicate Clarkson as anything more than a mere volunteer. There was consequently no case for the jury, and the refusal to control them was error, for which the judgment must be reversed to the end that a <em>venire de novo </em>issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
