Sanchez contends that the BIA erred when it found him removable based on his Texas conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle (UUMV). Sanchez contends that his UUMV offense was not an aggravated felony because it does not constitute a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). He also asserts that the BIA erred when it denied his request for a waiver of removal under former \u00a7 212(c) of Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-22\">As a threshold matter, we have jurisdiction to review Sanchez\u2019s constitutional claims and questions of law pursuant to the REAL ID Act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 518 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 40, 166 L.Ed.2d 18 (2006). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 </em>F.3d 194, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>197 (5th Cir.1996). Although questions of law are reviewed de novo, courts should defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretations of statutes and regulations that the BIA administers. Fon<em>seca-Leite v. INS, </em>961 F.2d 60, 62 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Sanchez\u2019s argument that Texas\u2019s UUMV offense does not constitute a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Galvan-Rodriguez, </em>169 F.3d 217, 219 (5th Cir.1999). <em>See also In re Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 767-70, 2005 WL 1352038 (BIA 2005) (Texas UUMV conviction was a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b) and therefore an aggravated felony). Our decision in <em>United States v. Charles, </em>301 F.3d 309, 314 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc), expressly limited <em>Galvan-Rodriguez\u2019s </em>holding to its property aspects and to \u00a7 16(b) cases; thus <em>Galvan-Rodriguez </em>remains applicable to Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We also reject Sanchez\u2019s argument that he is entitled to seek discretionary relief pursuant to former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA. Deportable aliens are eligible for relief under \u00a7 212(c) only if their offenses have a statutory counterpart in \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 771-73. Sanchez was ordered removed as an aggravated felon who had committed a crime of violence. There is no comparable crime-of-violence ground of excludability. <em>Id. </em>Sanchez is therefore ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Sanchez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-16\"> REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.
