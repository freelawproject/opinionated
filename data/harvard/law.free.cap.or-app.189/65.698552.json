The proposed sexual partners were three minor girls, all under the age of 14. Two of the three girls, \u201cHolly\u201d and \u201cChristine,\u201d were the fictional daughters of undercover agent Adrienne Sparrow, with whom defendants met on several occasions to discuss the possibility of sexual relationships between their children. The only \u201creal\u201d girl was defendants\u2019 12-year-old neighbor, who was a friend of B. Defendants were convicted and now appeal, raising various assignments of error. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The relevant charged offenses are inchoate crimes relating to sexual abuse in the first degree. ORS 163.427.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Five counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree were alleged only against defendant Jonathan Aragorn. The allegations in each count were the same except for the names and ages of the children. As exemplary, one of those counts alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cThe said defendant, Jonathan Aragorn, on or between January 1, 1998 and February 11, 1999, in the County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly attempt to subject [B], a person under the age of fourteen years, to sexual contact by attempting to aid and abet [B] in touching a sexual or intimate part of a child known to the defendant as HOLLY, a child purported to be 11 years of age, contrary to the Statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Four counts of solicitation to commit sexual abuse in the first degree were alleged against both defendants. Again, the allegations in each count were the same, except for the names and ages of the individual children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">\u201cThe said defendants, on or between January 1, 1998 and February 11, 1999, in the County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, did unlawfully solicit Special Agent Adrienne Sparrow, a person known to defendants as Adrian Lynch, to engage in specific conduct, to-wit: to aid and abet [B], a person under the age of 14 years, in engaging in sexual contact by having [B] touch a sexual or intimate part of a child known to defendants as Holly, a child purported to be 11 years of age, which conduct constituted the crime of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree, punishable as a felony, with the intent of causing the said Special Agent Adrienne Sparrow, a person known to defendants as Adrian Lynch, to engage in said conduct by providing the said child known to the defendants as Holly for the purpose of sexual contact, contrary to the Statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Finally, five counts in each indictment alleged that defendants had committed conspiracy to commit sexual abuse in the first degree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cThe said defendants, on or between January 1, 1998 and February 11, 1999, in the County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, did unlawfully, with the intent that conduct constituting the crime of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree punishable as a felony be performed, agree with each other to cause the performance of the following conduct, to-wit: to unlawfully and knowingly cause [B], a person under the age of 14 years, to engage in sexual contact by having [B] touch a sexual or intimate part of a child known to the defendants as HOLLY, a child purported to be 11 years of age, contrary to the Statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Defendants demurred to the indictments, arguing, in part, that, under ORS 163.345,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sexual contact between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>children within three years of age of each other is not a crime. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 demurrers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">\u201cI\u2019m satisfied after reading the case law that <em>State </em>[v.] <em>Harvey[, </em>303 Or 351, 736 P2d 191 (1987),] is, in fact, controlling, and although at least on the Sexual Abuse in the First Degree counts, that [one or another of the children] might have a defense based upon the age, that that defense is not available to the parents. And that a crime has, in fact, been stated in the Indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">At the close of the state\u2019s case in chief, defendants moved for judgments of acquittal, again in part on the ground that ORS 163.345 provided a defense to the charges; as relevant here, the trial court denied those motions as well. At the close of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury as to each attempt count using wording parallel to that used in the indictment; for example, as to one of the attempt counts, the court instructed the jury that \u201cthe State must prove * * * that Jonathan Aragorn knowingly attempted to subject [B] to sexual contact by * * * attempting to aid and abet [B] in touching a sexual or intimate part of a child known to the defendant as Holly.\u201d As exemplary of the solicitation counts, the trial court instructed the jury that it must find that defendants solicited Sparrow to commit the crime of sexual abuse in the first degree and that the material elements of the latter crime were \u201c[t]o knowingly aid and abet [B], a person less than 14 years of age, in engaging in sexual contact by providing a child known to [defendants] as Holly for the purpose of sexual contact with [B].\u201d The trial court also separately instructed the jury on the meaning of aiding and abetting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u201cA person attempts to aid and abet another person in the commission of a crime if the person with the intent to promote or make easier the commission of the crime attempts to encourage, procure, advise or assist by act or advice the planning or commission of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The trial court declined to give defendants\u2019 requested jury instruction on the age defense provided in ORS 163.345. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>noted, defendants were convicted on all of the described counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">In their first, second, and third assignments of error on appeal, defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their demurrers to the indictments, in denying their motions for judgments of acquittal, and in failing to give their requested jury instruction. Each of those assignments is based on ORS 163.345, which provides, as noted, that, in any prosecution under ORS 163.427 or other enumerated sexual offense, \u201cit is a defense that the actor was less than three years older than the victim at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d Defendants contend that they were charged and tried on an accomplice theory of liability in which it was alleged that they attempted to, or solicited Sparrow to, aid and abet the boys in sexually abusing the girls, that the defense was available to the boys, that it therefore was available to them, and that, accordingly, as a matter of law, the trial court erred in the described respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The state responds that the defense provided in ORS 163.345 is not available to defendants because they were not tried on an accomplice theory. According to the state, defendants were tried as the principal actors of the specified inchoate crimes committed against the children, including the boys, the latter of whom were the victims of the crimes. The state contends that, to the extent that the indictment alleged that defendants aided and abetted the boys, that allegation merely described the means by which they committed their crimes and, as a legal matter, constituted mere surplus-age as to the elements of the crimes actually charged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the latter regard, the state argues that, because the availability of the defense provided in ORS 163.345 is a question of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>and therefore did not affect defendants\u2019 presentation of evidence, and because, in any event, the state\u2019s case focused in part on defendants as principals, defendants were not prejudiced by the inclusion of the <em>\u201caid and </em>abet\u201d language. Finally, relying on principles of statutory construction and on <em>Harvey, </em>the state argues that, even assuming that defendants were charged and tried on an aiding and abetting theory, the defense provided in ORS 163.345 is not available to adult defendants, even those who are criminally liable for the criminal acts of others to whom the defense is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Defendants reply that the aid and abet language in the indictments was not surplusage and that, even if the age defense was not available to them as a matter of law, the inclusion of that language deprived them of their right to adequate notice of the charges against them and other protections implicated in the proper pleading of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendants\u2019 demurrers to the indictments for errors of law. <em>State v. Huckins, </em>176 Or App 276, 281, 31 P3d 485 (2001). In determining whether the trial court erred in denying defendants\u2019 motions for judgments of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether, in light of defendants\u2019 asserted defense, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. King, </em>307 Or 332, 339, 768 P2d 391 (1989); <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>186 Or App 729, 731, 64 P3d 1215 (2003); <em>see also State v. Herrera, </em>286 Or 349, 360, 594 P2d 823 (1979) (applying standard in context of submission of defense to jury in criminal case). We review the trial court\u2019s refusal to give defendants\u2019 requested jury instruction for errors of law. <em>State v. Moore, </em>324 Or 396, 428-29, 927 P2d 1073 (1996).5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>As an initial matter, we decline to address the state\u2019s contention that the aiding and abetting allegations included in the attempt and solicitation counts of the indictments were surplusage. In the abstract, those counts arguably stated crimes even without the aiding and abetting allegations. <em>Cf. State v. Coven, </em>115 Or App 538, 541, 839 P2d 261 (1992) (Warren, P. J., specially concurring) (in determining whether an allegation in an indictment is surplusage, \u201c \u2018[a]ll unnecessary words may * * * be rejected as surplusage if the indictment would be good were they omitted\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Frisbie v. State, </em>1 Or 248,249 (1859)). *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the record in this case demonstrates that the aiding and abetting allegations constituted integral components of the state\u2019s pleading and proof as to those charges. Notably, the trial court gave a jury instruction on aiding and abetting, and the state did not object to that instruction. We decline at this late stage to regard the state\u2019s case as embodying a different theory of the crimes. It follows that we also need not consider whether defendants were prejudiced in that manner by the inclusion in the indictments of the purported \u201csurplusage.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>We turn to the issue as framed by defendants on appeal: whether the trial court erred as to the applicability to them of the age defense in ORS 163.345. We begin our analysis by considering the text of the statute. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The availability of the defense provided by ORS 163.345 depends on the age of the \u201cactor\u201d at the time of the alleged offense. The term \u201cactor\u201d has no statutory definition. As pertinent here, the commonly understood meaning of the term is \u201cwrongdoer.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>22 (unabridged ed 1993). This court previously has noted, without further analysis, that the defense provided by ORS 163.345 is available to the \u201coffender\u201d or the \u201cdefendant,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the person charged, who satisfies the age difference. <em>See, e.g., State v. Thorp, </em>166 Or App 564, 575, 2 P3d 903 (2000), <em>rev dismissed, </em>332 Or 559 (2001) (ORS 163.345 was enacted to provide a defense for \u201coffenders\u201d less than three years older than the victim); <em>State v. Jalo, </em>72 Or App 479, 482 n 1, 696 P2d 14, <em>rev den, </em>299 Or 443 (1985) (ORS 163.345 provides a defense that \u201cthe defendant\u201d was less than three years older than the victim at the time of the alleged offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Other provisions of the criminal code use the term \u201cactor\u201d to similar effect. ORS 161.460(1) provides a defense of renunciation to the crime of conspiracy when the \u201cactor, after conspiring to commit a crime, thwarted commission of the crime which was the object of the conspiracy, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of the criminal purpose of the actor.\u201d In the attempt context, ORS 161.425 provides that \u201cit is no defense that it was impossible to commit the crime which was the object of the attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>where the conduct engaged in by the actor would be a crime if the circumstances were as the actor believed them to be.\u201d In both of those contexts, the actor is the person whose conduct constitutes commission of the inchoate crime and who therefore is the person liable to be charged with the offense. That is consistent with our understanding of the term \u201cactor\u201d as used in ORS 163.345.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Defendants nevertheless correctly observe that it is possible for a person to be prosecuted for the conduct of another. ORS 161.155 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201cA person is criminally liable for <em>the conduct of another person constituting a crime </em>if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201c(1) The person is made criminally liable by the statute defining the crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201c(2) With the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\u201c(a) Solicits or commands such other person to commit the crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\u201c(b) Aids or abets or agrees or attempts to aid or abet such other person in planning or committing the crime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">\u201c(c) Having a legal duty to prevent the commission of the crime, fails to make an effort the person is legally required to make.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">(Emphasis added.) Under ORS 161.155(2)(b), a person who aids or abets or attempts to aid or abet another person in the commission of a crime with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime is criminally liable for the conduct of the other person. In such a case, the person charged might be different from the person who carries out the criminal conduct. That circumstance raises the question whether a person who is charged as an accomplice to the commission of a crime is entitled to rely on a defense to criminal liability that is available to the person who committed the conduct constituting the crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The Supreme Court addressed that question in <em>Harvey. </em>In that case, the defendant was charged with first-degree rape on an accomplice theory under ORS 161.155 for having solicited his 14-year-old son to have sexual intercourse with his 11-year-old stepdaughter. ORS 161.155(2)(a). The defendant argued that he could not be found guilty as an accomplice to rape because, under the then-extant provisions for remand of juveniles to adult court for criminal prosecution, his son, the person who performed the underlying sexual act, could not be prosecuted for or found guilty of rape. <em>Harvey, </em>303 Or at 354. The court rejected that argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cIt is no defense for the adult defendant that his juvenile son could not be criminally tried for first degree rape although an adult could be. <em>See </em>{former] ORS 419.533 [(restricting remand from juvenile court to adult court to persons aged 15 or older)]. Similarly, if the actor\u2019s conduct otherwise qualifies as a crime, the fact that he has a personal defense of acting under duress by another person hardly can be a defense to that other person\u2019s responsibility under ORS 161.155 for commanding and compelling commission of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The court referred to the 14-year-old son as the \u201cactor.\u201d In defendants\u2019 view, that reference is consistent with their position that, in this case, the children were the actors and that the conduct of the children should be the focus of the inquiry as to the availability of the defense under ORS 163.345.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">That is not our understanding of <em>Harvey. </em>To the contrary, we understand it to say that the availability of a personal defense to one person who has engaged in criminal conduct does not itself insulate from criminal liability other persons to whom the defense, by its operative terms, does not apply. Thus, in <em>Harvey, </em>the fact that the defendant\u2019s son may have acted under duress was of no assistance to the defendant, not because the defendant applied the duress but for the more fundamental reason that the defendant himself did not act under duress. Moreover, we understand the principle recognized in <em>Harvey </em>to apply, not only in the context of accomplice liability, but also in the context of liability for inchoate crimes such as attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy. That is because liability for any type of crime attaches upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the commission of criminal conduct and, in the case of inchoate crimes, the inchoate conduct is itself made criminal by the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Thus, even assuming that some persons are, in effect, primary actors in the commission of an offense and others are criminally liable only as accomplices or by reason of conduct constituting an inchoate crime, each is entitled to assert only the defenses to liability that attach to that person\u2019s own circumstances or relation to the crime. In short, <em>Harvey </em>does not support defendants\u2019 position that ORS 163.345 is available to persons in their position\u2014whether charged as accomplices or with inchoate crimes\u2014solely by reason of the fact that a different person contemplated as having committed the underlying conduct would be entitled to assert that defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Applying the described understanding of ORS 163.345 here, we conclude that the defense provided in that statute was not available to defendants. It necessarily follows that the trial court did not err in denying defendants\u2019 demurrer, in denying their motions for judgment of acquittal, or in refusing to give their requested jury instruction based on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Defendants assert several other assignments of error pertaining to their criminal convictions that we reject without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> Throughout this opinion, when we refer to Jonathan and Sarah Aragorn together, we refer to them as \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> Defendants\u2019 criminal cases were consolidated for purposes of both trial and appeal with the juvenile proceeding establishing dependencyjurisdiction over B, C, and their oldest child, A.

Rather, the underlying conduct at issue consists of defendants\u2019 various efforts to subject their own young children to sexual contact. Thus understood, defendants\u2019 characterization of their children as the \u2018principals\u2019 and of themselves as mere \u2018aiders and abettors\u2019 miscasts the issue. <em>Defendants are the principal actors in the charged crimes.

Under the \u2018any evidence\u2019 standard, a court should not attempt to weigh conflicting evidence; rather, it may decline to give a requested jury instruction only if the record contains no evidence on an essential element of the defense. <em>State v.

Similarly, as to the solicitation counts, omission of the aid and abet language\u2014albeit with the retention and repositioning of the allegation that B is under 14 years of age\u2014would leave, as pertinent here, an allegation that defendants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cdid unlawfully solicit [Sparrow], a person known to defendants as Adrian Lynch, to engage in specific conduct, to-wit: by having [B], a person under 14 years of age, touch a sexual or intimate part of a child known to defendants as Holly, a child purported to be 11 years of age, which conduct constituted the crime of Sexual Abuse in the First Degree, by providing the said child known to the defendants as Holly for the purpose of sexual contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">That allegation adequately states the crime of solicitation of sexual abuse in the first degree, again identifying B as the victim. Thus, the indictments arguably can be viewed as stating either (1) the crimes of (a) aiding and abetting the boys in attempting to sexually abuse Holly and (b) soliciting Sparrow to aid and abet the boys in doing so; or (2) the crimes of (a) attempting to sexually abuse the boys and (b) soliciting Sparrow to sexually abuse the boys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\"> Defendants do not assert that the indictments failed to state crimes because they did not allege attempted or solicited physical contact between themselves and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the boys. Under ORS 163.427, the sexual contact need not be between the person charged and the victim. The statute requires only that the defendant \u201csubject\u201d another to sexual contact. Thus, the offense of sexual abuse in the first degree encompasses causing the victim to have sexual contact with a third person. <em>See </em>Criminal Law Revision Commission, Proposed Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft and Report (July 1970), Commentary to \u00a7\u00a7 115,116, pp 122-24 (\u201cThe contact need only be with either the victim or the actor but it need not be between them. Subjecting another to sexual contact with an animal or another person is also covered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Defendants also do not argue that the indictments were deficient because, as a matter of law, they could not aid and abet the victims\u2014the boys\u2014in committing crimes against themselves. <em>See </em>ORS 161.155 (setting out circumstances in which a person is criminally liable for the conduct of another person \u201cconstituting a crime\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\"> Again, defendants have not challenged the apparent premise of the attempt and solicitation charges that a defendant may aid and abet a victim in the commission of a crime against the victim, and we express no opinion on that matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\"> The <em>Harvey </em>court did not discuss ORS 163.345. In light of the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, however, it seems unlikely that, had the court noted the use of the term \u201cactor\u201d in ORS 163.345, it would have used that same term in the quoted portion of its analysis to refer to the person performing the underlying act. For that reason as well, we view <em>Harvey </em>as being of no assistance to defendants in their quest to attach anything other than its usual meaning to the term \u201cactor\u201d as used in ORS 163.345.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
