BURLEIGH, APPELLANT, v. PAUL J. SARTAIN AND JOHN V.

Burleigh, Plaintiff, vs. Paul J. Sartain and John V. Rice, Jr., Defendants,5 and the deposition commences with the averment, \u2018I am the plaintiff in the above stated cause,5 and since the motion to quash was made upon the ground that the affidavit \u2018is defective and insufficient because the said affidavit is entitled in a cause that was not pending at the time and for the reason that perjury cannot be assigned thereon,5 it seems quite evident under the authorities that the writ must be quashed in view of the long line of cases so holding. <em>Polter </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(decided by a Circuit Court judge in 1907), was reported in 30 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>206. There it was definitely held that an affidavit for bail was insufficient if entitled in the cause, the theory being that no cause is pending when the affidavit is made, and for that reason perjury cannot be assigned thereon. That case has been several times referred to in the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Errors and Appeals <em>(Kein </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1918), 92 <em>N. J. L. </em>406), and has never been overruled. In the recent case in the Supreme Court of <em>Vitalano </em>v. <em>Roffo </em>(1925), 3 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1130; 130 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>815, Potter <em>v. </em>Cook was approved and followed. In <em>Stuerwald </em>v. <em>Furman </em>(1926), 4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>470; 133 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>187, it was definitely followed likewise. In <em>Van De Velde </em>v. <em>Colle </em>(1930), 8 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>782; 152 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>645, it was recognized that the entitling of the affidavit in a cause, where no such cause was pending, was fatal to its validity. In <em>Rauschbach </em>v. <em>Duval </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Food Products Co. </em>(.1933), 11 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>900; 168 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>591, the same rule was recognized and applied, and therein it was pointed out that \u2018there can he no distinction in this regard between an affidavit made for the purpose of obtaining an order for bail and an affidavit made for the purpose of obtaining an order for attachment, because the Attachment act specifically requires the same kind of an affidavit. The whole action is founded on it in either ease.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-4\">\u201cIt is suggested that the title may be regarded as surplusage. But that in cases like the present, the courts have declined to do for manifest reasons. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Cook, supra; Vitalano </em>v. <em>Rufo, supra; Rauschbach </em>v. <em>Duval Food Products Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">\u201cIt is further suggested that I \u2018amend or expunge\u2019 the objectionable matter and then give effect to what remains, but it is clear that I have no power so to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b195-6\">\u201cCounsel may present a rule quashing the attachments.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-7\">For the appellant, <em>Hervey S. Moore </em>and <em>John A. Hartpence.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-8\">For the respondents, <em>I. Herbert Levy.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b195-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The action of the lower court is reviewable on appeal. <em>Hanford </em>v. <em>Duchaslel, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>205; <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>88 <em>Id. </em>361; <em>Jaudel </em>v. <em>Schoelzke, </em>95 <em>Id. </em>171.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">The rule under review will be affirmed, for the reasons stated in the memorandum of Mr. Justice Trenehard, <em>supra. </em>The case of Potter <em>v. </em>Cook, cited by him, not being officially reported, it is proper to repeat the citations made in that case, of the New York decisions in <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>12 <em>Johns. </em>460; <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Cande, 2 Cow. </em>509, and <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Selye, </em>3 <em>Den. </em>54. The opinion in <em>Kulich </em>v. <em>Kertacy, </em>12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>743; 174 <em>All. Rep. </em>503, relied on by appellant, fully recognizes the rule in Potter <em>v. </em>Cook and that line of cases as applicable to an affidavit for bail or for attachment and is careful to distinguish between the affidavit, on which an order is founded, and the order itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">The rule under review is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Chief Justice, Parker, Lloyd, Case, Bodine, Donges, Heher, Perskie, Yan Buskirk, Kays, Hetfield, Dear, JJ. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
