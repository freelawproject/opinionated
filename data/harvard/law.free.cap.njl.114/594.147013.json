L. </em>1931, <em>p. </em>905. The Bergen county board of taxation denied the claim for exemption, and sustained the assessment, for the purpose of taxation, made by the taxing district of the city of Englewood. The state board of tax appeals affirmed the judgment. The claimant thereupon sued out this <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The insistence of prosecutor is that the corporation is not conducted for profit; that the property included in the tax ratables is devoted exclusively to educational purposes, and that \u201cit is an eleemosynary institution, pure and simple.\u201d But, without disputing these premises in their entirety, we cannot give assent to the view that the property in question is, in whole or in part, the subject of exemption from taxation within the intendment of the statute invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The test is whether the purposes and objects of the school claiming the exemption are \u201cfundamentally charitable or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>philanthropic.\u201d <em>Carteret Academy </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and </em>Assessments, 102 <em>N. J. L. </em>525; <em>affirmed, </em>104 <em>Id. </em>165. The claim for exemption here does not meet this standard or test of validity. In respect of this fundamental requirement, there is no substantial difference in point of fact between that case and this. The claimant here derives its corporate vitality from the statute providing for the incorporation of associations not for pecuniary profit. It was incorporated on June 24th, 1925. The design of its founders was to convey to the corporate body an existing privately-owned institution \u2014a very profitable enterprise \u2014 maintained in the city of Englewood for the preparatory and general education of girls, under the name and style of \u201cThe Dwight Scho'ol for Girls.\u201d The founders of the school were Miss Euphemia S. Creighton and Miss Ellen W. Parrar, who, shortly after the corporation came into being, conveyed to it title, in fee-simple absolute, to the lands devoted to school purposes, and with Miss Prances Leggett, who had acquired Miss Parrar\u2019s interest in the school, transferred to the corporation the title to the furniture, equipment and personal property contained therein. The declared design of the grantors was to secure a continuance of the school \u201calong and according to the ideals\u201d established by the grantors; and to effectuate that purpose it was \u201cdeemed advisable that a corporation without capital stock and without hope of pecuniary profit should be organized with a substantial board of trustees whose interest in Englewood and in the maintenance of a <em>desirable private school for girls </em>would assure the continuation of the enterprise.\u201d The institution has since been conducted as a comparatively exclusive private school for girls. The annual tuition fee ranges between $200 and $500; the maximum annual rate for boarding pupils is $1,500. On the date of the assessment at issue, the enrollment was two hundred and thirty pupils. The teaching staff consisted of thirty-two \u2014 an average of one teacher for seven students. There were twelve additional emplojres. At the time in question less than half of the pupils were residents of the city of Englewood; many of the remainder were not residents of this state. There was a considerable annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>outlay of money devoted to advertising the advantages of the school, in order to attract pupils from distant parts. The corporation pays annuities of $800 each to' two former teachers who render no service in return. This obligation is imperative; the conveyance of the property was conditioned upon its performance. The salaries paid to the teaching staff compare favorably with the salaries paid in schools conducted for profit. Two of the trustees are teachers, and receive salaries as such; in addition, one is furnished board and lodging at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The annual income has been in excess of operating expenses; but, it is insisted, that the surplus is more apparent than real, in that \u201cdepreciation on buildings and the amount necessary to annually amortize one of the mortgages,\u201d are properly included in the operating expenses. And it is said that \u201cboarding pupils are taken and sought in order to make it possible to educate the children of Englewood and vicinity for a smaller tuition fee than would otherwise be possible.\u201d We are not persuaded of the validity of this claim. Considering the annual mortgage amortization payment of $4,500 as an operating expense, the school still yields a substantial surplus income. Eor the five-year period ending September 30th, 1932, the excess of income over expenses (including in the latter ordinary expenses, taxes, maintenance and repairs in the sum of $53,483.76, the mortgage amortization payments, and annuities) was $100,905.44. The excess income for the year ending September 30th, 1932, after the making of like deductions, was $13,930.64; in no year during that period did the expenses equal the income. The surplus account increased from $109,572 in 1928, to $200,569 on September 30th, 1932. Prosecutor maintains that the surplus is requisite \u201cto provide necessary depreciation reserves,\u201d and that \u201cno more is charged [for tuition] than is necessary to pay the operating expenses, depreciation and amortization charges.\u201d This is not the fact. Concededly, the school was a very profitable institution for many years before its transfer to the corporation; and, although its income has not been materially lessened since, the tuition fees have not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>reduced. And it is also worthy of note that to the school\u2019s board of trustees is committed the exclusive authority to prescribe educational standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">As to the ultimate disposition of the property, if the school should be discontinued, there is nothing to control the trustees except the expression of Miss Creighton\u2019s wish, in form an explanatory statement on the minutes, that should the trustees \u201cfind it desirable to dispose of the present property and buildings, it is my desire that the proceeds derived from such sale shall be applied, in the first instance, to procuring other property in the city of Englewo'od, or vicinity, and erecting thereon suitable building or buildings for the continuation of the school;\u201d and that if, on the other hand, the trustees should deem it advisable to discontinue the school, \u201cI then wish to see all moneys, which may be derived from the sale of the properties, turned over to Yassar College, either as a part of the endowment fund of that institution, or as a separate fund, the income from which shall be used to' provide scholarships at Yassar for girls from Englewood and its vicinity who may need financial assistance in securing their education, and who shall be selected and appointed in such manner as the trustees of this corporation may stipulate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Thus it is evident that, basically and fundamentally, the school does not partake of the characteristics of a \u201cnonprofit\u201d enterprise within the design of the statute. The statutory concept of the institution entitled to an exemption is one devoted to charitable, benevolent or religious purposes. The provisos of the exemption statute express this legislative purpose in unmistakable terms. They limit its operation to institutions \u201cnot conducted for profit, except that the exemption of the buildings and lands used for charitable, benevolent or religious purposes shall extend to cases where the charitable, benevolent or religious work therein carried on is supported partly by fees and charges received from or on behalf of beneficiaries using or occupying the said building; <em>provided, </em>the building is wholly controlled by and the entire income therefrom is used for said charitable, benevolent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>religious purposes.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1931, <em>p. </em>904. The claimant here does not meet this standard. There is an absence of what Mr. Justice Minturn, in <em>Carteret Academy </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and Assessments, supra, </em>termed the statutory essentials constituting the basis for a valid exemption, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cthe absence of profit in those interested, and the existence of a status of self-abnegation and sacrifice upon the part of all concerned in the interest of the local public good, very much as was found in <em>Institute of Holy Angels </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>79 <em>N. J. L. </em>34.\u201d See, also, <em>Princeton Country Day School </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, </em>113 <em>Id. </em>515.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Here the claimant operates what is essentially an exclusive boarding school. It is not local in character. It is held out as offering superior educational facilities and standards, and social advantages not obtainable in the common schools. Its instructors are compensated accordingly \u2014 on a basis fairly comparable with schools offering like advantages and conducted for profit. Its tuition fees are fixed accordingly. It is urged that the granting of the exemption will reduce the <em>per capita </em>cost; but it is not suggested that this will alter the fundamental character of the institution, and it is clear that such, in fact, is not the objective. There is not, therefore, in this situation, the <em>quid pro quo </em>for the exemption, in the form of a \u201cpublic work essentially of service to the state, without hope or expectation of remuneration for the service thus performed.\u201d <em>Carteret Academy </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and Assessments, supra. </em>The benefit to the community, viewed from the standpoint of the rendition of service that would otherwise be a governmental function and obligation, is merely a trivial incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">It is urged by prosecutor that \u201cthe presence of a desirable private school for girls\u201d is \u201can important factor in making Englewood popular as a residential suburb,\u201d and therefore tends to appreciate realty values; but this is obviously not a ground for exemption. It is not, in any sense of the term, the <em>quid pro quo </em>contemplated by the statute. All such exemption statutes are strictly construed; the burden is upon the claimant to establish the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In the <em>Carteret Academy Case, supra, </em>it appeared that the school was conducted at an annual loss, which was met, in part, by voluntary contributions from friends and patrons; it was also the beneficiary of an endowment fund, and the charter, as amended, declared that the corporate object was fundamentally philanthropic, charitable and educational, and the excess of income over disbursements \u201cshould be used to reduce the cost of tuition, to provide free scholarships, or for other educational, philanthropic and charitable purposes.\u201d ' It imposed upon the corporate trustees an obligation not unlike that undertaken by the trustees in the instant case for the disposition of the corporate property in the event that the school should be discontinued. This court observed: \u201cWhen an institution functions as a business concern, with the economic factor of profit, instead of the legislative conception of philanthropy as the basis for its existence, it <em>ipso facto </em>eliminates itself from the legislative purview of exemption.\u201d See, also, <em>Stevens Institute </em>v. <em>Bowes, </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>205; <em>Montclair </em>v. <em>State Board, </em>86 <em>Id. </em>497; <em>Carteret Academy </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>98 <em>Id. </em>868; <em>Princeton Country Day School </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Appeals, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Equality is the basic principle of taxation. Exemption therefrom, can be justly sustained only upon the principle that the \u201cconcession is due as <em>quid pro quo </em>for the performance of a service essentially public, and which the state thereby is relieved <em>pro tanto </em>from the necessity of performing, such as works of charity and education, freely and charitably bestowed, as evidenced by the legislation under consideration. Without that concurring prerequisite, an exemption becomes essentially a gift of public funds at the expense of the taxpayer, and indefensible both under our public policy of equal taxation and our constitutional safeguard against illegal taxation.\u201d <em>Carteret Academy </em>v. <em>State Board of Taxes and Assessments, supra. </em>The exemption, to be valid, must of necessity clearly serve a public purpose contemplated by the statute. It results that the challenged judgment is free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
