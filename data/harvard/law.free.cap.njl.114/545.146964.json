Execution issued on the judgment and was levied on a bank balance standing to the credit of the estate, as a \u201cright and credit\u201d of said estate. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1915, <em>p. </em>182, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. Under section 9 of the same act, the court made an order that the bank show cause why the balance should not be applied to satisfaction of the execution. The administrators resisted the application, and the court made an order discharging the rule to show cause, and quashing the execution. The appeal is from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">We find it unnecessary to go into the merits, as the rule is settled that a review of these proceedings in aid of execution must be by <em>certiorari. Gordon </em>v. <em>Pannaci, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>392. The case of <em>Eames </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>490, cited for appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>lant, is not applicable, for the reason that the review in that case was in the Court of Errors and Appeals, which does not review by <em>certiorari. </em>In the present case the Supreme Court is asked to review a proceeding not according to the course of the common law, and in an inferior tribunal. Such review on well settled principles is by <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The appeal will be dismissed, with costs, but without prejudice to an application for <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
