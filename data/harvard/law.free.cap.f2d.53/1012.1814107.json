The bill of complaint alleges that federal narcotic agents unlawfully and without search warrant caused appellant\u2019s hotel room to be broken into, and a package there found, charged to contain narcotics, to be taken therefrom; that he was taken before the United States commissioner on the charge of violating the Harrison Narcotic Act (26 USCA \u00a7 211 and \u00a7 691 et seq.), and upon hearing was held to the grand jury. The relief asked is that appellees \u2014 the District Attorney and the narcotic agents \u2014 be restrained from presenting to the grand jury any evidence gained through the entrance of appellant\u2019s room and the seizure of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The bill attaches, and makes a part of it, a transcript of evidence \u2014 that of one of the narcotic agents \u00e1nd of a policeman \u2014 given at the hearing. From this it appears that the narcotic agents had learned from their superior officer at Chicago that a package of narcotics would be <em>sent by </em>express <em>to </em>Superior, Wis., addressed to Henry C. Whalen, Saratoga Hotel, and that they were instructed to go there to keep a lookout for the paekage; that, after watching at the express office for two days, a package so addressed arrived, which the express agent opened in their presence, and which <em>was </em>found to contain twenty-live 1-ounce cans of morphine and six pounds of smoking or gum opium, all unstamped; that the narcotic agents communicated with the police department at Superior, and it was arranged that the express agent would bring the package <em>to </em>the hotel (where appellant was registered under the name of Henry C. Whalen), and that two policemen would be present to arrest appellant upon delivery of the package to him; that the express agent brought the paekage to the hotel, tho clerk notified appellant, who asked that it be brought to his room, and <em>the express agent took it to the </em>door, which was opened from within, entered, and gave the package to appellant, who signed for it and put it on *. table; that the policemen, to whom the fncts had been communicated, walked through the open door into the room and placed appellant under arrest, and then took possession of the paekage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\"> These facts appearing from the bill (and nothing else was before the court) plainly indicate that the narcotic agents and the police officers had every reason to believe that Haggerty was in the very act of committing a crime at the time the policemen made the arrest. They saw the contraband paekage brought to his door and into his room, and by him received. Indeed, they took him in the actual commission of the crime. No warrant for his arrest was necessary. Marron v. United States, 275 U. S. 192, 48 S. Ct. 74, 77, 72 L. Ed. 231; Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 45 S. Ct. 280, 287, 69 L. Ed. 543, 39 A. L. R. 790. Having lawfully made tho arrest in his room, as incidental thereto they might lawfully and without search warrant seize \u201cthe tilings\u201d in his possession or control \u201cused to carry on the criminal enterprise\u201d or \u201cwhich may be used to prove the offense.\u201d Marron v. United States, supra; Carroll v. United States, supra. From the bill it appears they did this and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
