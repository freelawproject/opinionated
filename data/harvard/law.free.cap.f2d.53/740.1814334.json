Space and freight charges were arranged for by means of the following letter, which was confirmed by the appellant:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\u201cReferring to our telephone conversations during the past few days, we wish to confirm freight engagement with you as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201c2500 Long tons Nitrate of Soda March shipment per \u201cTokuyo Maru\u2019 from Nitrate Port to Honolulu at $7.00 per ton of 2240 lbs., gross weight delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\u201cFreight payable in San Francisco on receipt of weights from Honolulu.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">\u201cThis cargo to ho loaded according to custom of port in Chile and to be discharged at rate o\u00a3 400 tons per day, 2000 tons to be discharged at railroad wharf, Honolulu, and 500 tons at Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co.\u2019s wharf, which is adjacent to the railroad wharf and only necessitates the pulling ahead of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\u201cOne-half (\u00bd) cost of weighing to be borne by the consignee at Honolulu and one-half (<em>\u00bd) </em>to be paid by vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">\u201cAll on board to be delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">\u201cKindly confirm on copy of this letter attached herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">\u201cYours very truly,</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">\u201cW. R. Grace <em>&amp; </em>Co.,</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">\u201c[Signed] F. Doelker, Traffic Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">On the same day appellee\u2019s San Francisco office sent a letter to its shipping agent in Chile, Nitrate Agencies, Limited, notifying the latter that arrangements had been made for the shipment in question \u201cat a rate of freight of $7.00 per 2240 lb. gross weight delivered, from Nitrate Port to Honolulu, freight payable at San Francisco * * * on receipt of weight from Honolulu.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-17\">The letter ended with the following instruction: \u201cIn making up Bs/L we would ask you to kindly omit freight therefrom, and just let the same carry the clause \u2018freight as agreed.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-18\">Three days later, a similar letter, referring to another shipment covered by the same freight engagement of January 14, 3921, was sent by the appellee to its shipping agent in Chile.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-19\">On March 15, 1921, and on March 17, 1921, respectively, the cargo in question was received by appellant at the Chilean ports of Antofagasta and Iquique. Signed by the master of the ship and by appellee\u2019s agent, hills of lading were issued by the vessel, said hills providing that the freight for the cargo was \u201cto he paid, as per margin in DESTINATION.\u201d (Capitalization according to the record.) One hill of lading reads in the margin \u201cfreight as per agreement\u201d and the other \u201cfreight as agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-21\">Each bill of lading, in printed letters, provided that \u201csaid freight [is] to he considered as earned, lost or not lost,\u201d and that \u201call liability for loss or damage to goods shall he determined by their invoice cost plus freight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-22\">The steamship Tokuyo Maru proceeded northward on her voyage from Chile, touching at San Francisco and Portland, and was, with her cargo, subsequently lost by fire at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-23\">The steamship company, which was the libelant in the court below, sued for the amount of the freight on the cargo. The lower court dismissed the libel, and the steamship company appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-24\">The sole question presented herein is) whether or not the oral agreement, the confirmation by letter, and the marginal notations in the bills of lading, operated to defeat the libelant\u2019s claim to having earned the freight, \u201clost or not lost\u201d; or whether, on the other hand, the printed clause as to earned freight, appearing in the hills of lading, as noted above, gave the appellant the rig'ht to collect the freight, even though- the cargo was lost. The appellee insists that the intention of the parties, by the stipulation that freight was payable in San Francisco on receipt of weights from Plonolulu, was clearly expressed that the freight was not earned until the delivery of the cargo at Honolulu; and, in view of the destruction of ship- and cargo at sea, not earned at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-25\">The lower court, in its findings of fact, held that the clause \u201cearned, lost or not lost,\u201d is not binding upon respondent-appellee; and that the oral agreement and the letter confirming it \u201cconstitute the contract of affreightment between the parties.\u201d As a conclusion of law, the lower court found \u201cthat the hills of lading were merely receipts for the cargo, given subsequently to the making of the special contract of affreightment, and constitute no part of the contract of affreightment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-26\">The appellant, in its brief, concedes \u201cthat stipulations stamped on the face of a bill of lading before its delivery to the shipper re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>ferring to an earlier document incorporates the subject matter to which it refers 'as a part of the contract/\u2019 and urges that \u201cit is manifestly the court\u2019s duty to reconcile, if possible, the bills of lading with the earlier letter providing for the shipment in question regarding the time when and the place where the freight was to be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">While, as we shall see, there is authority for the trial court\u2019s holding that the bills of lading, under the circumstances, were merely receipts, it is not necessary thus to limit them in order to hold that, even if it is conceded that the bills of lading \u201csupplement\u201d the earlier contract, they cannot contradict or nullify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In its opening brief, appellant complains that \u201cit would certainly be an anomaly if freight was deemed earned but, without the carrier\u2019s fault, be not collectible.\u201d The answer to this objection, of course, is obvious; the \u201canomaly\u201d complained of disappears if one follows the directions on the bills of lading themselves, and looks to the prior agreement to ascertain what the parties contracted for in the matter of freight arrangements. That earlier agreement of January 14, 1921, is perfectly self-consistent, and does no violence to the bills of lading, provided we excluded from those bills, as is implied by their marginal directions, questions of freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Should there exist, however, an irreconcilable repugnancy between the prior written contract and the bills of lading, that conflict would have to be resolved in favor of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">On the threshold of our inquiry, we find that the provision for paying the freight after the goods were delivered, contained in' the prior agreement, accords with the dictates of good conscience, with the doctrines of general law, and, according to one of appellant\u2019s own witnesses, \u201cthe usual and customary method of shipping nitrate cargo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Leading text-writers on admiralty law and Supreme Court decisions agree that, in general, where the bill of lading is silent, the contract of affreightment carries with it the carrier\u2019s duty to deliver the cargo \u201csafely,\u201d and that freight is collectible only on delivery of the merchandise to the consignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">\u201cFreight,\u201d according to Pitman\u2019s Encyclopedia of Marine Law (2d Ed.) p. 151, \u201csignified, a sum of money to he paid by the freighter to the shipowner for the safe carriage of goods, wares and merchandise in a ship or vessel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">In Poor on Charter Parties and Ocean Bills of Lading we find the following, in section 28: \u201cBy the law, both of the United States and of England, in the absence of-some stipulation to the contrary, the goods must be carried to destination before any freight is earned. It makes no difference that the shipowner is prevented by some obstacle beyond his control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">So also Serutton on Charter Parties and Bills of Lading: \u201c \u2018Freight/ in the ordinary mercantile sense, is the reward payable to the carrier for the carriage and arrival of the goods in a merchantable condition, ready to be delivered to the merchant. The true test of the right of freight is the question whether the service in respect of which the freight was contracted to be paid has been substantially performed *' * * \u201d Article 136 (12th Ed.). See, also, Carver on Carriage of Goods by Sea (6th Ed.) \u00a7 543; Merriam, Claims Between Shippers and Carriers, \u00a7 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">In Pollard v. Vinton, 105 U. S. 7, 8, 26 L. Ed. 998, the Supreme Court said of a bill of lading: \u201cIt is a contract to carry safely and deliver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">That ease is cited with approval in Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. McFadden, 154 U. S. 155, 162, 14 S. Ct. 990, 38 L. Ed. 944, and in Louisville <em>&amp; </em>Nashville R. Co. v. Central Iron &amp; Coal Co., 265 U. S. 59, 67 note, 44 S. Ct. 441, 68 L. Ed. 900. See, also, The Gracie D. Chambers (C. C. A. 2) 253 F. 182, 183, affirmed 248 U. S. 387, 39 S. Ct. 149, 63 L. Ed. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">We have dealt at some length upon the principles of general law applicable to this case, for the reason that a consideration of such principles leads us to the conclusion that, a priori, there is no valid ground for not giving full effect to the provisions of the prior oral. and written agreements as to freight payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">Appellant\u2019s interpretation of this prior written agreement is not consistent. In some portions of its brief it asserts that the letter of. January 14 \u201cwas not such a complete contract. It required to be supplemented by the bills of lading\u201d; \u201cthe bills of lading taken together with this earlier space engagement contained in the letter of January 14 constitute the contract of carriage\u201d; \u201cwe concede that stipulations stamped on the face of a bill of lading before its delivery to the shipper referring\u2019 to an earlier document incorporate the subject matter to which it refers as part of the contract\u201d; \u201creading, then, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>these documents together and reconciling them as far as possible,\u201d etc.; but, on tho contrary, \u201cwe find the following language on another page of the brief: \u201c(8) That tho space engagement was silent as to the ports where the \u2018Tokuyo Maru\u2019 was to receive its cargo, as well as to many other details, for which reason it is apparent that this silence is to be construed as evidence of the intention of the parties to make a new contract, i. e., by the bills of lading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In other words, at times the appellant asserts that the bills of lading were merely \u201ca supplementary contract,\u201d and at another time it contends that it was a new, and, wq assume, superseding contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In another respect, too, the appellant\u2019s argument is not consistent. In one portion of its brief it maintains that \u201c \u2018the custom of the trade? [is] entirely irrelevant since the parties had made a definite agreement.\u201d Yet elsewhere the appellant seeks to answer the argument that freight was payable only \u201con receipt of weights from Honolulu,\u201d and that, \u201cas the weights were never received, the failure of such receipt defeats the carrier\u2019s right to its freight,\u201d by resorting to custom: \u201cFor the purpose of determining the outturn weights we have the custom to which we have referred, pleaded by appellee and admitted by appellant, of subtracting <em>\u00be </em>of <em>1% </em>from bill of lading weights to determine the weight at port of destination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Indeed, tho appellant itself admits that \u201cthere is no question but that the rate of freight had been agreed between tho parties prior to the delivery of the cargo to appellant\u2019s vessel.\u201d Yet, pursuing this argument to its logical conclusion, if the intention of the parties was indeed to make a \u201cnew contract\u201d by signing bills of lading, at what rate can the appellant claim to recover for freight, the bills of lading being silent as to such freight rate? It is clear that the bills of lading were not a \u201cnew contract,\u201d entirely replacing the prior agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">As a matter of fact, tho appellant seems to be anxiously running from letter to bills of lading to custom in an effort to- bolster up its claims; whereas the letter of January 14, 1921, constitutes the complete contract of affreightment, so far as freight rates and their payment are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">We believe that these very inconsistencies in the appellant\u2019s argument betray its essential weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">As we have already indicated, any contradiction between the letter and the bills of lading must be resolved in favor of the former, unless it is clear that the parties did, as a matter of fact, intend the bills of lading to constitute a new contract, entirely superseding the earlier oral and written agreements. Despite the statement as to a \u201cnow contract,\u201d quoted above, we do not believo that the appellant contends that the bills of lading entirely supersede the earlier letter. Tho final position of the appellant seems to bo that the bills of lading supersede the letter only in that portion of the letter which relates to collecting the freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">If the appellee\u2019s contention is correct, and the letter should be looked to alone for time of payment, appellant can, never collect the freight. If the appellant\u2019s view is sustained, it can collect its freight after a reasonable time \u201cafter the vessel should have arrived [but did not] at Honolulu.\u201d In this respect, as we have seen, the appellant has recourse to \u201ccustom,\u201d in the face of the plain stipulations of the letter, and in the face of appellant\u2019s own objection that \u201ccustom can only supplement a contract that is silent in some material respect for which tho law does not provide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">The Supreme Court has hold that a prior agreement, as to freight, even though made by parol, can be proved in the face of a bill of lading. In Mobile &amp; Montgomery R. Co. v. Jurey use of Factors\u2019 <em>&amp; </em>T. Ins. Co., 111 U. S. 584, 591, 4 S. Ct. 566, 569, 28 L. Ed. 527, the court said: \u201cIt is plain, upon this statement of the controversy, that evidence of the parol contract was perfectly competent, and it was a question to bo decided by the jury whether the understanding, as detailed by tho witnesses, or tho bill of lading expressed tho agreement of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">In The Energia (C. C. A. 2) 66 F. 604, 607, the court used the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">\u201cThe ease of The Montana [129 U. S. 397, 9 S. Ct. 469; 32 L. Ed. 788], however, expressly reserves for future decision cases where the contract itself expressly provides that any question arising under it should be governed by the law of some specified foreign country; and appellant seeks to bring himself within this exception by reason of the presence in the bills of lading of the following clause:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-17\">\u201c\u2018(8). The liability of the carrier under this bill of lading shall be governed by the law of England, with reference to which this contract is made.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b767-18\"><em>\u201cWe </em>are satisfied, however, from the evidence, <em>that the contract was fully expressed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>in the charter party, which contained no such clause, and that there was no intention to modify that contract in so important a particular merely by making use of a printed form of bill of lading which contained the so-called \u2018flag clame.\u2019\u201d </em>(Italics our own.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Eminent text-writers have expressed the same views. Thus Carver, supra, in section 57: '</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\u201cOn the other hand, the hill of lading is not always the expression of the contract; that may have been definitely concluded before it was given, as where the shipper had chartered the vessel or part of her. In such cases the original contract generally determines the relations between the shipper and the shipowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">\u201cAnd where the bill of lading is on its face manifestly not a complete statement of the contract, evidence may be given to complete it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">And Pitman, supra, at page 43: \u201cIt was held that the charter-party and bill of lading were to be read and construed together, that the conditions \u2018as per charter party,\u2019 etc., referred to the conditions as to payment of freight, one of which was the cesser of liability of the defendants, and that the defendants were not liable, their liability on the charter-party ending on the completion of the loading, no new liability being created by the bill of lading. [English ease cited.]\u201d See, also, Scrutton, supra, article 3; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. American Trading Co., 195 U. S. 439, 463, 25 S. Ct. 84, 49 L. Ed. 269; The Ethel, 8 Fed. Cas. 798, 799, 800, No. 4,540; Two Hundred and Sixty Hogsheads of Molasses, 24 Fed. Cas. 445, 446, No. 14,296; The Chadwicke (D. C.) 29 F. 521, 524; Citt\u00e0 Di Palermo (D.

C.) 82 F. 681, 683, \u201cthe stipulations stamped upon the face of the bills of lading under which the goods of the libelants were shipped are to be treated as parts of such bills of lading, and binding upon the libelants. * *\u2022 *\u201d This ease, indeed, is cited by the appellant in its \u201cconcession\u201d that such stipulations incorporate the subject-matter to which they refer as a part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">This being so, they are to he construed as part of the bill of lading itself. And a bill of lading is to be construed strictly against the carrier: \u201cAs the exceptions were introduced by the shipowners themselves in their own favor, they are to be construed most strongly against them.\u201d The Caledonia, 157 U. S. 124, 137, 15 S. Ct. 537, 543, 39 L. Ed. 644. See also, E. Gerli &amp; Co., Inc., v. Cunard S. S. Co., Ltd. (C. C. A. 2) 48 F.(2d) 115, 116; Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Doyle (C. C. A. 3) 142 F. 669; 673, in which latter case the court said: \u201cAny reasonable doubt as to the proper interpretation of the contract should be resolved against the railroad company. It chose the language incorporated in the printed portions of the bill of lading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">The principle that courts should look to all the attendant circumstances in construing a carrier\u2019s contract was emphasized by the late Judge Gilbert of this court in Pacific Coast Co. et al. v. Yukon Independent Transp. Co., 155 F. 29, 34. Referring to the opinion of the District Court, the learned jurist stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">\u201cThe court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-14\">\u201c \u2018For this reason the courts are compelled, when called upon to enforce them, to construe such contracts fairly, and to reject stipulations which are unreasonable, and to deny carriers all unfair advantages claimed by reason of exemptions from liability for negligence or plain violation of the carrier\u2019s obligation. In order to give a fair construction to a contract, all its parts must be considered, and conditions and circumstances which the evidence proves were known to the parties and contemplated by them in making it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">\u201cThis doctrine is well sustained by the authorities, and is applicable to bills of lading, no matter in what kind of type they are printed. In Marx v. National Steamship Co. (D. C.) 22 F. 680, Judge Brown thus expressed the recognized rule of construction:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">\u201c \u2018In construing bills of lading, as in construing other commercial instruments, it is the right and duty of the court to look, not only to the language employed, but to the subject-matter and to the surrounding circumstances, in order to determine the proper effect of the language used, by putting itself so far as possible in the place of the contracting parties.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-17\">Judge Gilbert cited the Yukon Case in support of his opinion in W. R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Frank Waterhouse <em>&amp; </em>Co., Inc. (C. C. A.) 264 F. 422, 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-18\">Without further reciting the evidence, we believe that a study of the record leads to the inevitable conclusion that, as to all matters relating to freight, the oral agreement and the confirmatory letter constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the contract between the parties in the instant case. The marginal notations on the bills of lading themselves would so indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">For the reasons stated, we see no reason for disturbing the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
