These blocks incline diagonally in the same direction crosswise of the tire, and the bloeks of each row are arranged in staggered relation to the blocks of the opposite spaces in the opposite row. Between these rhomboid bloeks are rectangular formations depressed below the level of the rhomboid bloeks and aligned throughout the length of the row. The foregoing features relate principally to the tire <em>tread. </em>On the sides of the tire there are a series of ornamental beads which follow the general curvature of the casing, and the rhomboid-shaped bloeks of the tread extend into intersecting relation with these beads.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-22\">Appellant emphasizes the faet that his design covers the <em>tire </em>or <em>casing as an entirety </em>and not merely the <em>tread </em>of the casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-23\">The rejection by the tribunals of the Patent Office was based upon design patents to Willshaw, Design 64,945, June 17,1924, and Wright, Design 69,339, of January 26; 1926, respectively. 'In the decision'of the Board of Appeals allusion was also made to a \u2018design patent to Copley, Design 65,433, August 19, 1924. The Wright patent states that it is a \u201cDesign for a Tire.\u201d The', Willshaw and Copley -patents, respectively, state \u201cDesign for a Tire Tread.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Als\">It is -not deemed necessary to give detailed, description' of the designs of the resp\u00e9ctive references; . -</p>\n<p id=\"At_\">The Board of-Appeals said:</p>\n<p id=\"AHj\">\u201cIt is quite the usual practice to provide tires; whatever the side ornamentation or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>sign may be, with the two central circumferential grooves. The references disclose this arrangement. Wilishaw discloses a design which is quite similar to that of the applicant, the difference being that the small slots or cut out portions of the central tread do not extend far into the tread and are reversed and staggered with respect to the depressed or cut cut portions of the sides of the tire. Designs of tire treads are mainly for utility purposes, the prevention of sliding and skidding, and the ornamental effect is quite secondary. The general appearance of the design of Willshaw, to the average observer, is quite similar to that of the applicant. The patent to Copley, Design 65,433, Augnst 19, 1924, of record in the companion application, discloses quite the same design ss to the side portions of the tread as the applicant discloses.\"</p>\n<p id=\"A3_\">There are, admittedly, features of similarity between appellant's design and the designs of the references; also it may he conceded that, when looked upon with the thonght of their respective appearances in mind, it requires no microscopic examination to discern differences between them. Appellant stresses those conceded differences.</p>\n<p id=\"AS6e\">Upon a thorough inspection and compari~on of the several designs, we are not convinced that the creation of the differences involved the exercise ol? the inventive faculties, nor do we think that appellant's design in its entirety was inventive ever thq prior art cited.</p>\n<p id=\"ArL\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AtaS\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
