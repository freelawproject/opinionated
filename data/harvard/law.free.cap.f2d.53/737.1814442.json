No one was on boar&lt;j at the time of the search; and, while liquors were found, no one was discovered in the act of transporting them in the Automatic; consequently no arrest was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In this situation there was no discovery warranting a seizure of the liquors and vessel until the search was had, and by the search the officers failed to \u201cdiscover any person in the act of transporting in violation of law, intoxicating liquors in\u201d the vessel, for the vessel was then tied up at' the wharf, and no person was present transporting liquors. We therefore regard the case as concluded by our opinion in Corriveau v. United States (Powell v. United States), 53 F.(2d) 735, decided November 28, 1931; and that the government was authorized to proceed under the provisions of section 4377 in the forfeiture of the vessel. See also Alksne v. United States (C. C. A.) 39 F.(2d) 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Since this case has been before us on appeal, the owner.has applied to us for release of the vessel on bond under the provisions of section 938 of the Revised Statutes (28 USCA \u00a7 751), and the question is whether this Court of Appeals is authorized under section 938 to make such order. We think it is not; that \u201cthe court\u201d mentioned in that section is the trial court, which, in this instance, is the District Court, and that such application should be made to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The appeal record does not show that an application was made to the District Court for release of the vessel on bond, and consequently the question of the owner\u2019s right to release of the vessel under section 938 is not before this court. But we held in United States v. Davidson, 50 F.(2d) 517, where the' question was saved for our consideration, that the District Court\u2019s order granting the release of a vessel on bond, seized for violation of law relating to the enrolling and licensing vessels, was proper, and that the statute was mandatory, where such a ground of forfeiture was relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">It is stated by counsel in open court, without contradiction, that application was made in the District Court for release of the vessel on bond and denied; and that this took place prior to the rendition of our decision in United States v. Davidson. In this situation we think the decree of the District Court should be affirmed, subject to the right of the owner to renew his application in the District Court for release of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, subject to the right of the claimant to apply to that court for release of the vessel on bond.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
