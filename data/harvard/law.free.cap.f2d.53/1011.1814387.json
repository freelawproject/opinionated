HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1035-24\">We have held the registered trade-mark \u201cMilk of Magnesia\u201d invalid because it was not in the actual and exclusive use of the defendant, or its predecessors, during ten years next preceding February 20, 1905, as required by section 5 of the Federal TradeMark Act (15 USCA \u00a7 85), and also because the defendant had abandoned the mark. But we said that this invalidity of the mark \u201cMilk of Magnesia\u201d did not affect the defendant\u2019s other trade-mark \u201cLeche de Magnesia.\u201d In reaching this conclusion about \u201cLeche de Magnesia,\u201d we gave too little consideration to tho fact that the name \u201cLeche de Magnesia\u201d ought not to have been registered under section 5 when \u201cMilk of Magnesia\u201d was an invalid trade-mark because not in the exclusive use of the defendant during the ten-year period, and when \u201cLeche d\u00f3 Magnesia\u201d might readily he taken for the English mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-25\">In the first place each mark employs the word \u201cMagnesia,\u201d and that fact when the compounds on which \u201cMilk of Magnesia\u201d and \u201cLeche de Magnesia\u201d are used are identical is likely to result in confusion. Moreover, \u201cLeche\u201d being the Spanish for \u201cmilk\u201d is a word that has always been known to the many Spaniards in the United States and Porto Rico and readily beeomes understandable by others. Thus it stands on quite a different footing from words taken from the language of Hottentots or Patagonians which might be so unfamiliar as to be in effect fanciful or arbitrary terms. That \u201cMilk of Magnesia\u201d is sold in the United States and called for under the name \u201cLeche de Magnesia\u201d is apparent from the record (pages 132-136) and from the inherent probabilities of the ease. Consequently \u201cLeche de Magnesia\u201d is the ready equivalent of \u201cMilk of Magnesia\u201d to many people.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-26\">It has been the general practice of the Patent Office and of the courts to deny registration to any misleading term even where it only becomes misleading through the understanding of a foreign language. This is a sound rule which has long been followed. The words \u201cexclusive use\u201d in section 5 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>the Trade-Mark Act have been regularly interpreted to mean exclusive use not only of the-specific mark, but also of any other confusingly similar mark or term.

C. 240; Kentucky Distilleries <em>&amp; </em>Warehouse Co. v. Old Lexington Club Distilling Co., 31 App. D. C. 223; Eastman P. M. Co. v. Comptroller-General, L. T. N. S. 195.

C. 235, 289 F. 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">For the foregoing reasons we hold that the complainant was entitled to a decree canceling the trade-mark \u201cLeche de Magnesia,\u201d as well as the mark \u201cMilk of Magnesia,\u201d and the 'decree of the District Court is accordingly in all respects affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1036-5\">MANTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">\u201cLeche de Magnesia\u201d is the Spanish for \u201cMilk of Magnesia.\u201d It cannot be said to be commonly understood by an English-speaking public. The trade-mark for this name was registered under the \u201cten-year\u201d clause of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 (section 5). Registration under this section was possible because of the exclusive use by its owner for ten years prior to 1905-, and the fact that the mark had acquired secondary meaning. It is no bar to registration that the words are somewhat descriptive. Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, 233 U. S. 461, 34 S. Ct. 648, 58 L. Ed. 1046; Rossmann v. Gamier, 211 F. 401 (C. C. A. 8). Section 5 contemplates that any mark which was not a technical trade-mark but which had been actively and exclusively used by the applicant, or his predecessors, for the required time, could be registered as a trade-mark. There is ample evidence that the term \u201cLeche de Magnesia\u201d was meaningless even to the drug trade. We are only concerned with its meaning within the United States. The decision as heretofore rendered should be affirmed. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
