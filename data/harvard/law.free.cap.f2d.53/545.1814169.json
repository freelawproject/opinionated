From that decision, appellant has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-27\">The references relied upon are: Maisch-Bitschenauer, Design 43986, May 13, 1913; Schurman, Design 68499, October 13, 1925; Tiedemann, Design 75880, July 24, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-28\">The design comprises stems, buds, and leaves of vines so arranged in diagonal lines and crossing each other that diamond-shaped spaees are formed between the crossing vines. Into each of the diamond-shaped spaees is placed what is said to he a representation of a cosmos blossom, which is connected by a stem to the vine on\u2019 one side of the diamond-shaped space.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-29\">The patent to Maisch-Bitsehenauer discloses diagonal lines of vinos forming diamond-shaped spaces, and in each space there is a representation of two flowers, each supported by a stem. Flowers are also shown at the intersections of the crossing stems. The blossoms shown are not materially different from the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-30\">In Sehurman, stems and blossoms are arranged in lines and cross each other so as to form the same kind of diamond-shaped space as is at bar. In the center is a single blossom somewhat different from the blossom at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-31\">The patent to Tiedemann shows a blossom quite similar to the blossom in appellant\u2019s design, hut in Tiedemann there are no diagonal lines forming the diamond-shaped spaees.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-32\">Appellant\u2019s design may be distinguished by the ordinary observer from any of the references if the four designs are closely scrutinized, and yet it is at once apparent that the broad idea of intersecting diagonal lines so as to form diamond-shaped spaees and then placing flowers in such spaces is old In the design patent art.-</p>\n<p id=\"b569-33\">The Patent Office tribunals rejected appellant\u2019s design, for the reason that there was no invention in what he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-34\">Appellant complains that:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-35\">\u201cThe Examiner and the Board not being able to And a design like appellant\u2019s, have taken several patented designs and, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>combining them, have sought to show that it did not amount to invention to produce appellant\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u201cThe courts have looked with disapproval on any attempt to dissect a design and reject it piecemeal,\u201d and cites numerous authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The well-settled principle of law which appellant invokes is not inconsistent with the action taken by the tribunals below. It is true that the design must be looked to as a whole, and the mere fact that the different items that compose it may be found separately in other designs is not of itself sufficient ground for rejection. But the test is, as we see it, when the design as a whole is considered in the presence of the prior art, does the new creation amount to invention? Design patents are granted to inventors for reasons which should not be confused with the reasons for granting registration of trade-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">It seems to be the thought of appellant that for every design, the details of which cannot be shown in the prior art, and which by close examination may be readily distinguished from every single design in the prior art, a patent should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The correct rule is laid down in Eloesser-Heynemann Co. v. Bayly-Underhill Mfg. Co., 29 F.(2d) 305, 307, in which the District Court for Colorado said: \u201cThe case of King Ventilating Co. v. St. James Ventilating Co., 26 F.(2d) 357, recently decided by the Court of Appeals of this circuit, is controlling in many important features of the ease at bar. A design patent for a ventilator was adjudged invalid. It was there held that a difference in amount of flare, or other differences in dimension, would not avoid anticipation; that the exercise of inventive faculty was as essential to a design patent as to a mechanical patent; that the combination of an old flared base to an old superstructure was not invention; that popularity and successful sales are not enough to sustain a patent. The facts presented by that .opinion are perhaps not as difficult as those here presented, but the principles are sound and controlling, and lead me to the conclusion that no inventive genius was required, in the creation of plaintiff\u2019s design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In the quite recent ease of Robertson v. Cooper, 46 F.(2d) 766, 768, where the Patent Office\u2019s rejection of an application for a design patent for a font of type was approved by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit, the court, after emphasizing the fact that invention was required in a design patent, said: \u201cIt is apparent that the design of any one of these groups would suggest to a skilled workman the design of all the others of the same group, and such a workman, having before him the word \u2018Asbestone,\u2019 could, without any inventive ingenuity whatever, by exercise of a high degree of skill only, construct the entire font of patent. * * * \u201d See, also, Gorham Mfg. Co. v. White, 14 Wall. 511, 20 L. Ed. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">It is argued by appellant, in urging the patentability of Ms design, that it \u201chas gone into extensive use and been proved valuable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Popularity and successful sales alone are not enough to sustain a patent. Eloesser-Heynemann Co. v. Bayly-Underhill Mfg. Co., supra; In re Earl Ackenbach, 45 F.(2d) 437, 18 C. C. P. A. 769; In re Alfred L. Phelps <em>&amp; </em>Arthur J. Carter, 47 F.(2d) 387, 18 C. C. P. A. 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
