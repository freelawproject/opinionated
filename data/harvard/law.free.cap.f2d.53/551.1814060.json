The ease was tried without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">Defendants contend that the court erred \u201cin ruling that there were before the court sufficient facts in the whole ease upon which could be predicated a finding in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s ease, defendants moved for a finding in their favor, and, to the overruling of this motion, noted an exception. Thereupon defendants introduced evidence by way of defense; thereby waiving the only exception taken during the trial. Main v. Aukam, 4 App. D. C. 51; Hazleton V. Le Duc, 10 App. D.
