Daltroff &amp; Cie, alleged that it had registered its mark in France, on July 1, 1927, and had used it continuously thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-24\">In its notice of opposition, appellee alleged that it was the owner of the trade-mark \u201cChez Lui,\u201d duly registered in the United, States Patent Office on September-11, 1923, on an application filed January 29, 1923, and has since continuously used it on \u201cface powders, face creams, perfumes, toilet waters, rouges, hair tonics, hair oils, dentifrices, tooth powders, nail polishes, deodorizing preparations, and sachet powders\u201d; that the goods of the respective parties possessed the same descriptive properties; that the marks were confusingly similar; and that the registra*tion to appellant of the trade-mark \u201cChez Moi\u201d would cause confusion in the mind of the public, and deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-25\">In its answer, the Caron Corporation of New York, assignee of .E. Daltroff &amp; Cie and substituted for the latter company as applicant for the registration of the trade-mark \u201cChez Moi,\u201d alleged that the involved marks were not confusingly similar; that the suffix \u201cLiu\u201d means \u201chis,\u201d whereas, the suffix \u201cMoi\u201d means \u201cme\u201d; that the prefix \u201cChez\u201d is a common French word meaning, \u201cat, in, or with,\u201d and that opposer was not entitled to its exclusive use, except as a part of the trademark \u201cChez Lui\u201d; and that the mark \u201cChez Lui\u201d has a strictly masculine meaning, whereas, the trade-mark \u201cChez Moi\u201d is not so restricted,, but may be used by either sex to express the idea \u201cmy home.\u201d It was also alleged that the prefix \u201cChez\u201d was registered in the United States Patent Office, in conjunction with other words, for use on goods possessing the same descriptive properties as those of the involved parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-26\">No testimony was introduced. However, certain registrations of trade-marks incorporating the word \u201cChez\u201d were introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-27\">The tribunals below held that the goods of the parties possessed the same descriptive properties; that the marks were confusingly similar; and that appellant was not entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-28\">It is contended, here by counsel for appellant that this court should take -judicial notice of the fact that perfumes axe sold, almost exclusively, for use by women; that the advertising of perfumes is generally directed to the attention of women; that, as the trade-mark \u201cChez Lui\u201d has a meaning masculine in character, it would tend to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>vey the \u201cidea of a perfume reminding a woman of some man,\u201d and, accordingly, the two marks would be readily distinguishable by women; that the prefix \u201cChez\u201d is incapable of exclusive appropriation as a trademark; and that, as the suffixes \u201cLui\u201d and \u201cMoi\u201d are not identical in spelling and are pronounced differently, the tribunals below erred in holding that the trade-marks were confusingly similar. It is also argued by counsel for appellant that trade-mark registrations, incorporating the word \u201cChez,\u201d although registered subsequent to appellee\u2019s registration, show clearly that the registration of appellant\u2019s mai\u2019k would not cause confusion in the minds of the public or deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">It is not claimed by appellant that it or its predecessor was the first to adopt and use a trade-mark with the prefix \u201cChez.\u201d Furthermore, it appears that the registrations offered in evidence, containing, in part, the word \u201cChez,\u201d were issued subsequent to the registration of appellee\u2019s trade-mark \u201cChez Lui.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"> The validity of appellee\u2019s trade-mark registration will not be considered by this court in a proceeding of this character. Furthermore, the question as to whether the involved marks are confusingly similar must be determined by considering them in their entirety, not by dissecting them, as argued by counsel for appellant. Celotex Co. v. Arthur Edward Millington, 49 F.(2d) 1053, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1484; Celotex Co. v. Bronston Bros &amp; Co., Inc., 49 F.(2d) 1048, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1490, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> It is true, as argued by counsel for appellant, that the involved marks are not identical in appearance, sound, or meaning. They differ slightly in each of those characteristics. However, the question before us is whether the marks are confusingly similar, not whether they are identical. Counsel for appellant has laid considerable stress upon the difference in meaning of the two marks. It is urged that \u201cChez Lui\u201d has a strictly masculine meaning, \u201chis home,\u201d whereas \u201cChez Moi,\u201d not so restricted, means \u201cmy home.\u201d From this, it is argued that the masculinity of the mark \u201cChez Lui\u201d is sufficient to cause women, who&gt; it is claimed, are practically the exclusive purchasers of perfumery, to distinguish between the two marks, and therefore confusion would not result.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Assuming that the bulk of perfume in the United States is purchased by women, it does not necessarily follow that they would be as discriminating as counsel fo-r appellant has argued. The marks, considered m their entirety, have a marked similarity, and, when used on goods possessing the same descriptive properties, would, in our opinion, bo likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">We are in accord with the conclusion reached by the Commissioner of Patents, and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
