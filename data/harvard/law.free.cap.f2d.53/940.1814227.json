In view of defendant\u2019s position that they had not complied with the iron safe clause, plaintiffs not only had the right, they were compelled, to offer these documents and memoranda as a necessary part of their case. They were the best evidence, in fact the only evidence, admissible on that issue; they were made so by the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Defendant did not make the objection that, though admissible as a tender of proof that the iron safe clause had been complied with, these documents, not being documents of original entry but compilations, wore not admissible as proof of the amount of lumber on hand before the fire, nor did they undertake to obtain a ruling limiting their effect. We need not therefore inquire whether such an objection or request would have been good; we need only determine, as we do, that the general objection should have been overruled. Wo come now to the decisive question, whether the court, in refusing defendant\u2019s request for an instructed verdict under the iron safe clause, and in submitting the issue to the jury, erred. We think it did not. It is true of issues under the iron safe clause, as of all other issues of fact, that, where upon the evidence the facts are all one way, and only one inference may be drawn from them, it is for the court to declare whether the tendered books comply with the policy clause. Home Ins. Co. v. Williams (C. C. A.) 237 F. 171; Houff &amp; Holler v. German American Ins. Co., 110 Va. 585, 66 S. E. 834. It is also true, however, that, in eases where there is any point made as to whether the books tendered constitute all of the books, or as to whether they contain complete records of the business, or are substantially incomplete, the matter is for tho jury. American Casualty Co. v. Cohen, 40 Ga. App. 593, 151 S. E. 56; \u00c6tna Ins. Co. v. Fitze, 34 Tex. Civ. App. 214, 78 S. W. 370; \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 127 Ga. 491, 56 S. E. 643; German Ins. Co. v. Pearlstone, 18 Tex. Civ. App. 706, 45 S. W. 832; Liverpool &amp; London <em>&amp; </em>Globe Ins. Co. v. Ellington, 94 Ga. 785, 21 S. E. 1006. In view of the charges of fraud and procurement in regard to the fire, in view of the loose-leaf character of the documents relied on, in view of the testimony of after prepared books, we think it was for tho jury to say whether they believed the evidence of the plaintiffs that the memoranda offered constituted all of their documents and memoranda, and whether they presented, in substantially complete form, evidence from which the state of plaintiffs\u2019 business could be fairly determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The hooks were indeed informal; in fact, in a literal sense they were not books at all, for they were not bound. In the liberal sense of the words, however, established in the law, they were books. \u201cIt is not necessary that the books should be kept according to any particular system, nor that they should be such a scientific system of books as would satisfy an expert accountant in a large business house in a city.\u201d Liverpool <em>&amp; </em>London &amp; Globe Ins. Co. v. Ellington, 94 Ga. 785, 21 S. E. 1006; \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 127 Ga. 491, 56 S. E. 643, 645. \u201cThe purpose of the requirement was that in ease of loss or damage tho assured would have kept such book accounts of his invoices, purchases, and sales as would show the amount of goods on hand at the time of the fire, and thus furnish data from which to make a reasonable estimate of the loss or damage.\u201d Id. Substantial compliance with tho provision is all that is essential. N. Y. Underwriters Fire Ins. Co. v. Malham (C. <em>C. </em>A.) 25 F.(2d) 416; Mass. Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Schneider (C. C. A.) 28 F.(2d) 658; Home Ins. Co. v. Williams (C. C. A.) 237 F. 171; Liverpool v. Kearney, 180 U. S. 132, 21 S. Ct. 326, 45 L. Ed. 460; Western Assurance Co. v. Redding (C. C. A.) 68 F. 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">\u201cThe provision does not necessarily require the records to be kept in the form of books of account, nor indeed in book form at all.\u201d Home Ins. Co. v. Flewellen (Tex. Civ. App.) 221 S. W. 630; Continental Ins. Co. v. Rosenberg, 7 Pennewill (Del.) 174, 74 A. 1073; 26 C. J. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">The invoices examined by themselves and in the light of the testimony explanatory of them we think satisfy the general requirements of the rule as to the character which such records should have, and the jury\u2019s verdict settles that they were complete. Though, then, we do think that the method employed by the plaintiffs in keeping their accounts was because of the informal and impermanent nature of the, records, undesirable in appearance and in character, and ,not at all to be commended, we are constrained, in view of the jury\u2019s verdict, which wo think tho trial court correctly took, to hold that plaintiffs\u2019 proof presented a substantial compliance with the provision of tho policy, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
