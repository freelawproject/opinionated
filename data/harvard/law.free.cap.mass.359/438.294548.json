L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, before a judge of the Municipal Court of the City of Boston, who found for each of two defendants. The case was retrans-ferred to the Superior Court and was tried there to a jury. After the return of the verdicts the judge declared a mistrial. Subsequently, the count against the other defendant being waived, the case was again tried to a jury, who found for the plaintiff. The defendant excepted to the refusal of the trial judge in the second jury trial to allow the introduction in evidence of the finding of the Municipal Court. This was error. Under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C, the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cof ... a district court shall be prima facie evidence upon such matters as are put in issue by the pleadings . . ..\u201d The applicability of the statute was not affected by the prior trial in the Superior Court which ended in a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
