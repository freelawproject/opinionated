Bianchi, executor under the will of Dr. Anthony F. Bianchi (executor), and Mary C. Bianchi, the widow of Dr. Bianchi (widow), against the retirement board of Somerville (board) and the auditor and treasurer of that city. The petitioners seek a declaration that Dr. Bianchi was entitled to retire as a veteran under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, and that his widow is entitled to the benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The executor seeks repayment of a sum of money which Dr. Bianchi paid to the board for membership in the contributory retirement system. The case is before us on the appeal of the petitioners from the final decree of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The parties filed a stipulation of certain, but not all, of the facts in issue. As to the remaining facts in issue the judge heard oral testimony and received exhibits, all of which are reported under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 18. At the conclusion of the hearing the judge filed a report of his findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of facts and rulings of law. He then entered a final decree declaring that the widow was only entitled to the contributory retirement benefits which she was then receiving under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (2), option (c), and not to the benefits payable under \u00a7 58B to a veteran\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As to those issues of fact upon which the parties have not stipulated, it is our duty to examine the evidence thereon and decide such issues according to our judgment as to the facts and the law, giving due weight to the findings of the judge which will not be reversed unless plainly wrong. <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Molloy, </em>335 Mass. 636, 637. <em>Hanrihan </em>v. <em>Hanrihan, </em>342 Mass. 559, 564. <em>Sulmonetti </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>347 Mass. 390, 391-392. We summarize the pertinent facts, including those stipulated, those found by the judge and not plainly wrong, and some additional facts found by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Dr. Bianchi was a veteran within the meaning of such word as defined in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, and as used in \u00a7 58. Thereafter he was a practising dentist in the city of Somer-ville, and he was continuously employed by the city as a part-time supervisory school dentist from May 21, 1930, to March 31, 1967. He served on a temporary basis , up to September 3, 1930, when he received certification by the Civil Service Department and a permanent appointment to the position. On January 26, 1966, he was notified by the board that he would reach the maximum superannuation age (of seventy years) on March 31, 1966, and that he could not be employed after that date. However, he was permitted by the Civil Service Department to continue to work in the position until March 31, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">As early as August 25, 1965, the board considered the possibility that Dr. Bianchi might request retirement as a veteran under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58. On that date the board decided that if Dr. Bianchi made such a request, he would be allowed \u201ca half year\u2019s service for each calendar year\u2019s service.\u201d The effect of that decision was (a) that the board would consider Dr. Bianchi\u2019s part-time service of almost thirty-seven years as the equivalent of eighteen and one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>half years of service, and (b) that Dr. Bianchi would not be eligible to retire under the provisions of \u00a7 58 which required a minimum of thirty years of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">After Dr. Bianchi received the board\u2019s letter of January 26, 1966, he made an oral request to the board that he be permitted to retire under \u00a7 58. On February 4, 1966, the board wrote his counsel that it had determined that Dr. Bianchi was \u201centitled to one half year credit towards his retirement for each calendar year of service.\u201d On the same date it sent a separate letter to Dr. Bianchi informing him that if he wished to join the contributory retirement system he would be permitted to \u201cpay a make up payment prior to March 30 and . . . [he] would be eligible to receive a retirement allowance.\u201d On February 14,1966, the board sent still another letter to Dr. Bianchi informing him that a \u201cmake up payment\u201d would be required of him to join the contributory retirement system and stating the amounts of the benefits he, and his widow as survivor, would receive under such an arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">On March 8, 1966, the board sent Dr. Bianchi an application for membership in the contributory retirement system. It was enclosed with a letter informing him of the amount of the required \u201cmake up payment.\u201d On March 15, 1966, the board received the required payment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the executed application from Dr. Bianchi\u2019s lawyer, together with the lawyer\u2019s letter stating that \u201cthese payments are made without prejudice to any rights of Dr. Bianchi.\u201d The quoted language indicates that by joining the contributory system Dr. Bianchi did not intend to waive his right to retirement under \u00a7 58. This was consistent with the action previously taken by him on February 16, 1966, in appealing to the contributory retirement appeal board (appeal board) from the Somerville board\u2019s refusal to retire him under \u00a7 58. On February 23, 1966, the Somerville board wrote to the appeal board questioning the latter\u2019s jurisdiction over \u201cnon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>contributory cases.\u201d On September 23, 1966, the appeal board voted that it had no jurisdiction of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In his application for membership in the contributory retirement system, Dr. Bianehi elected \u201coption (c)\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12 (2). This provided for payments to him for life at less than the full amount otherwise payable to him, and in consideration of such reduced payments it also provided for survivor benefits payable to his widow.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Bianehi started to receive benefits at the annual rate of $1,760.40 ($146.70 a month) in April, 1967; and he received a total of $811.74 to the date of his death on September 16, 1967. The widow has been receiving benefits at the annual rate of $1,173.60 ($97.80 a month) since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The principal legal question presented by the above facts is whether Dr. Bianehi was entitled to be retired as a veteran under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, when he applied for such retirement shortly after January 26, 1966. We hold that he was. \u201cIn order to be eligible for retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, as amended, a person must meet three requirements: (1) he must be a veteran within the meaning of the statute (c. 32, \u00a7 1) ...; (2) he must have been in\u201d the service of the Commonwealth, or subdivision thereof, for a total period of thirty years in the aggregate; and (3) he must be in active service at the time of retirement. Each of these three requirements is a condition precedent to eligibility for retirement. If any one of them is not met, the claim fails.\u201d <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 67, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Dr. Bianehi met the first and third requirements of \u00a7 58. The basic question is whether he had been in the service of the city of Somerville \u201cfor a total period of thirty years in the aggregate.\u201d Like Dr. Bianehi in the present case, the plaintiff in the <em>Weiner </em>case was also a part-time employee, serving as a public health physician for the city of Boston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>for at least thirty years. While Dr. Weiner was denied a pension under \u00a7 5'8, it was because it was found and ruled that he was not a veteran; and the question whether thirty years of part-time service satisfied the statutory requirement for a minimum of thirty years of service was not put in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On the record before us it is clear that the decisions of both the board and of the trial judge were based on the assumption that \u00a7 58 required a minimum of thirty years of full-time service and upon their finding that Dr. Bianchi\u2019s half-time service amoimted to an aggregate of only eighteen and one-half years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In our view both the board and the trial judge misconstrued \u00a7 58, and improperly applied to the case statutes which are not applicable to the retirement of a veteran under \u00a7 58. General Laws c. 32 represents an attempt to collect in one chapter most of the statutes regulating a large number and variety of separate and distinct contributory and non-contributory retirement and pension systems for public employees. The provisions regulating the retirement of veterans are contained in \u00a7\u00a7 56 through 60. Some of these sections in turn refer to other specified sections of c. 32. Generally speaking, sections of c. 32 other than \u00a7\u00a7 56-60 apply to the retirement of veterans only if they are expressly made applicable thereto by such other sections or by \u00a7\u00a7 56-60. The principal exceptions to this general statement are found in \u00a7\u00a7 90A through 102 which contain provisions of general application to some or all retirement systems or persons retired thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The board and the trial judge assumed that \u00a7 4 (2) (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>authorizing a board to determine how many years of part-time service are equivalent to one year of creditable service under the contributory retirement system applies to retirements under \u00a7 58. It does not. There is no language in \u00a7\u00a7 56-60 or in \u00a7 4 (2) (b) making the latter statute applicable to veterans\u2019 pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Section 58 does not expressly require that the thirty years of employment be full-time employment. It is silent on that subject. That silence is significant when \u00a7 58 is compared with many other sections of c. 32 where the Legislature saw fit to insert special language when it intended to make special provisions for part-time employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The most compelling reason for holding that each year of part-time service by Dr. Bianchi counts as one year of service 'under \u00a7 58 is that the pension payable imder that section when Dr. Bianchi retired on March 31, 1967, was \u201csixty-five per cent of the highest annual rate of compensation . . . payable to him while he was holding the grade held by him at his retirement.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His rate of compensation at that time was $5,050 annually for part time, and the board used that figure as the basis for computing the benefits payable annually to Dr. Bianchi and his widow under the contributory system and those which would have been payable to them upon Dr. Bianchi\u2019s retirement as a veteran under \u00a7 58. Since retirement benefits under \u00a7 58 are computed at a percentage of the employee\u2019s annual rate of compensation, it necessarily follows that the benefits for a part-time employee such as Dr. Bianchi will be at a correspondingly lower rate. To require two years of half-time work in order to qualify for credit for each of the statutory mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>mum of thirty years of employment would require sixty years of such half-time work. This is impossible with a compulsory retirement age of seventy. It would deprive part-time employees of any possibility of retiring under \u00a7 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">For all of the reasons discussed above, we hold that each calendar year of half-time employment by Dr. Bianchi must be considered as one year of the required minimum thirty years of employment under \u00a7 58. For similar interpretations of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56 and 57, see Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1949) 57, and Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1955) 80-83. See also Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1957) 68-69, limiting credit under \u00a7 58 for service as town moderator to the number of days actually worked in such capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">When Dr. Bianchi applied to the board shortly after January 26, 1966, for retirement as a veteran under \u00a7 58, he met all requirements for such retirement. Although \u00a7 58 says that such a veteran shall, at his own request, \u201cwith the approval of the retiring authority, be retired from active service\u201d and receive benefits as prescribed therein, we held in <em>Hoban </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>355 Mass. 681, 684, that this language \u201cwas intended to confer purely a ministerial role on the retiring authority.\u201d The board thus had no discretion to deny Dr. Bianchi retirement under \u00a7 58. On February 2, 1966, the board wrongfully denied him such retirement. On February 4 it informed him of this and simultaneously invited him to join the contributory system by making a lump sum make up payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In its answer the board contended that by joining the contributory retirement system and accepting the benefits thereunder Dr. Bianchi waived whatever rights he had to retirement as a veteran under \u00a7 58. The judge stated in his decision that \u201cby accepting the benefits under Section 12 [(2)3, Option C [of G. L. c. 32, relating to the contributory retirement system], both the deceased and the petitioner [the widow] waived any rights [they] may have had.\u201d We hold that there was no waiver by either Dr. Bianchi or by his widow of any rights under \u00a7 58 or \u00a7 58B. When Dr. Bianchi joined the contributory system he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>an appeal pending before the appeal board from the Somer-ville board\u2019s denial of his request for retirement under \u00a7 58. That appeal was not disposed of until it was denied on September 23, 1966. The board\u2019s argument on this point is, in effect, that despite its own wrongful denial of Dr. Bianchi\u2019s request for retirement under \u00a7 58, he was compelled to make an irrevocable decision whether to join the contributory system by the deadline of March 31, 1966, or to risk all future benefits for himself and his widow by relying solely on his appeal then pending before the appeal board and litigation, if necessary, to establish his rights under \u00a7 58. The board cannot use its own wrongful conduct as the basis for its claim of waiver by Dr. Bianchi. Additionally, in filing his application for membership in the contributory system and making the required \u201cmake up\u201d payment, Dr. Bianchi expressly and in writing conditioned his action on a reservation of his rights under \u00a7 58, and the board accepted the application and payment with knowledge of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">We have had occasion in the past to permit a former member of the contributory system, who had accepted a refund of all of her contributions to the system, to repay them and become eligible for benefits. In doing so we noted \u201cthe great complexity of the relevant provisions of c. 32,\u201d and concluded that her earlier withdrawal of her contributions was the result of \u201can honest error which can readily and fairly be corrected.\u201d <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692, 695-698. The error in the present case was that of the board, and that error can readily and fairly be corrected now without prejudice to the board, Dr. Bianchi\u2019s estate or the widow.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We hold that Dr. Biancbi\u2019s estate and his widow should now be placed in the same position which they would have enjoyed if the board had granted to Dr. Bianchi his retirement under \u00a7 58 starting on April 1, 1967. In that situation, he would not have been required to pay the sum of $9,041.48 to the board to join the contributory system. If he had made contributions to such a system at any time, he would have been entitled to a repayment of all of such contributions upon retirement under \u00a7 58. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 25 (3) (a), as amended through St. 1962, c. 682, \u00a7 1. The evidence permits an inference and therefore a finding that Dr. Bianchi would have exercised the same option available to him under \u00a7 58B which he exercised under the contributory system to take reduced payments for himself, with survivor benefits for his widow. Thus, the payments receivable by Dr. Bianchi from April 1, 1967, to his death on September 16, 1967, and by his widow after September 17, 1967, would have been at a higher annual rate under \u00a7\u00a758 and 58B than the payments which they actually received on the basis of the contributory pension system.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The final decree is reversed, and a new decree is to be entered ordering and declaring substantially as follows, with the amounts of payments or repayments and interest required thereby to the date of the decree to be determined by the Probate Court and inserted in the decree:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">(a) That the executor of the will of Dr. Bianchi repay to the treasurer of the city of Somerville the sum of $811.74 received by Dr. Bianchi in benefits prior to his death;</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">(b) That the widow, Mary C. Bianchi, repay to the treasurer of the city of Somerville a sum equal to the total benefits received by her from said city as survivor benefits from September 17, 1967, to the date such decree is entered;</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">(c) That the treasurer of the city of Somerville repay to the executor of the will of Dr. Bianchi the sum of $9,041.48 which was paid by Dr. Bianchi to the city on March 15,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">(d) That the treasurer of the city of Somerville pay to the executor of the will of Dr. Bianchi a sum computed at the rate of the payments which were due and payable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>him under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B, for the period from April 1, 1967, to September 16, 1967, inclusive;</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">(e) That the treasurer of the city of Somerville pay to the widow, Mary C. Bianchi, a sum computed at the rate of the payments which were due and payable to her -under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B, for the period from September 17, 1967, to the date of the decree; and that monthly payments be made to her thereafter dining her lifetime, computed at the rate or rates required by said \u00a7 58B or amendments thereto; and</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">(f) That all payments or repayments ordered by this decree shall include interest computed thereon from the date originally payable to the date of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-11\"> The pertinent provisions of these sections as of the date of Dr. Bianchi\u2019s retirement are as follows.
