L. e. 271, \u00a7 17, for being concerned in a lottery, G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 7, and for knowingly permitting his premises to be used fa^,gaming, G..L. c. 139, \u00a7 20. The defendant Cassino was indicted for being found with apparatus for registering bets, and for being present in a common gaming house, G. L. c. 271, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 23. The defendant Armenio was indicted for being present in a common gaming house. The defendants were tried together before a jury and found guilty of each charge, and the cases are before us on their exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">State police officers testified to the following facts. ,One or more of them, dressed in civilian clothes, went to a shop named \u201cWhirlaway\u2019s Smoke Shop\u201d on six occasions between October 28 and December 12,1968. On such occasions they saw copies of a racing newspaper entitled \u201cThe National Armstrong Daily News Review\u201d (Armstrong). On these occasions Cosolito accepted bets on horse races and numbers from the officers and others. Cosolito did not make notations of the bets, but \u201cjust kept them in his head.\u201d The police officers and other bettors often used Armstrongs in placing their bets, sometimes borrowing one carried by Cosolito. On at least four occasions Cassino was present, usually seated on a stool behind a counter. On December 12 two officers went to the shop and placed bets with money whose serial numbers had been listed. Later that day a raiding party of police officers arrived with search warrants. They seized an Armstrong from Cosolito\u2019s pocket, money from his pockets which included the identified bills, an Armstrong and a Daily Record turned to the race sheet from Cassino\u2019s hands, and two pens and a pencil and more Armstrongs on and under the counter in front of Cassino. Armenio was sitting reading an Armstrong. All three defendants were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">1. The defendant Cosolito excepted to the admission in evidence of an application for a license to sell cigarettes at the address of the shop. The application named Cosolito <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>as owner and purported to be signed by him, and was offered as evidence of his control of the premises. The Commonwealth argues that it was admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. See <em>Sawyer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>354 Mass. 481, 482-484. We need not pass on that contention, since the evidence was relevant only to the indictment under G. L. c. 139, \u00a7 20. That indictment was placed on file with Cosolito\u2019s consent after the verdict of guilty, and the exceptions taken in that case are not properly before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>224 Mass. 42, 44. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>338 Mass. 682, 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">2. The defendants argue that the Armstrong admitted in evidence as one taken from Cosolito should have been excluded. The bill contains no exception by any of the defendants on this point, and the question is therefore not properly before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacGregor, </em>319 Mass. 462, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">3. Each defendant excepted to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict on each indictment against him. The defendants now argue that proof of the presence of \u201capparatus\u201d for registering bets is essential to conviction under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17, and that money is not such an apparatus. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Demogenes, </em>349 Mass. 585, 587-588. In the <em>Demogenes </em>case we recognized that \u201ceven articles (taping, pens and pencils) which could be used for innocent purposes may, when used with items designed for betting purposes, be found to be \u2018apparatus.\u2019\u201d Apparently pursuant to the same principle, racing publications were treated as \u201capparatus\u201d in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jensky, </em>318 Mass. 350, 352, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mele, </em>358 Mass. 225, 227. We think that racing publications may become \u201capparatus\u201d even when not used with other items specially designed for betting purposes, if a person registering bets supplies the publications for use in placing the bets. On this basis the Armstrong which Cosolito carried in his pocket could be found to be an \u201capparatus . . . or . . . device, for registering bets.\u201d On such a finding he and Cassino could be convicted of being \u201cfound . . . with apparatus\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17. There was more than \u201cmere unwitting presence in the same place with apparatus,\u201d held insufficient in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>342 Mass. 393, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">4. Armenio was not charged with being \u201cfound with apparatus\u201d under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 17, which provides a maximum punishment of a $3,000 fine or imprisonment for three years, but with being present in a \u201cplace occupied, used or kept for the purposes described in\u201d G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 23. On such a charge G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 5, limits punishment to a fine of $50 or imprisonment for three months. One of the purposes proscribed by. \u00a7 23 is \u201cregistering of bets upon any race,\u201d and under \u00a7 23 \u201call persons present whether . . . participating [in any form of gaming] or not,\u201d are subject to \u00a7 5 \u201cif any . . . apparatus or materials of any form of gaming are found in said place.\u201d We think the Armstrong in Cosolito\u2019s pocket could be found to be \u201capparatus\u201d under G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 23, as well as under \u00a7 17. There was evidence that Armenio was present in a place used for registering bets upon a race, and that apparatus was \u201cfound in said place.\u201d His knowledge was immaterial. \u201cThe statute means that people enter such places at their peril. . . . [T]he law . . . may say that people are not likely to resort to a common gaminghouse without knowing it, and that they must take the risk of knowing the character of the place to which they resort, if the implements of gaming are actually present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>166 Mass. 370, 375-376. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 512-513.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">5. The defendants excepted to the judge\u2019s charge that one can \u201cregister\u201d a bet by committing it to memory. The judge was right on this point. The defendants also seem to argue that there was no proper instruction as to the meaning of \u201capparatus\u201d but we find no exception to this aspect of the charge. Since the portion of the charge dealing with \u201capparatus\u201d is not in the record before us, we could not consider it even if there were a proper exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
