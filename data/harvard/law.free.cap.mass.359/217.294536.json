A decree was entered dismissing the bill and granting to the plaintiffs the right, at their own expense, to make certain modifications, subject to stated terms and conditions, on the defendant\u2019s merchandise conveyor. The plaintiffs appealed. The judge made careful and comprehensive findings of fact. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Findings of the judge here pertinent include the following. The plaintiffs, who are the partners of a limited partnership called Charles River Park \u201cB\u201d Company (Park), are the owners and developers of a commercial development called Charles River Plaza Shopping Center on Cambridge Street, Boston. The defendant (Sarni) is a tenant of Park under a written lease and conducts a store and dry cleaning plant on the ground floor of the shopping center, a two-story building. Ventilation, heating and air conditioning equipment for the building are located on the roof. There is also on the roof an exhaust fan which another tenant had installed. Under section 10 of the lease Sarni is required to use and occupy the premises as a dry cleaning and laundry plant with a retail store providing dry cleaning and laundry services. Section 10 further provided that Sarni \u201cshall at all times maintain on the . . . premises sufficient, modem and efficient equipment and fixtures.\u201d Section 11 of the lease provided that Sarni shall not \u201cpermit any objectionable noise ... to eminate [sic] from the demised premises.\u201d One of Park\u2019s tenants, American Institute of Banking (American) which occupies premises on the second floor, complained to Park of noise and vibration and this was brought to the attention of Sarni. Thereafter, Sami purchased and installed certain new equipment designed to eliminate noise and vibration. At the time of the trial there was \u201cno air-borne sound audible in American\u2019s premises.\u201d There was, however, \u201cperceptible sound transmitted or created by tactile vibration \u25a0\u2014 sound conveyed by the structure itself from one point to another.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>judge, in accordance with the testimony of acoustical experts, found that \u201cthe sound level in American\u2019s premises is greater than is desirable and would be objectionable to the average person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The construction of the building, the judge found, was especially susceptible to the transmission of sound by vibration. He concluded that \u201cthe cause of the present undesirable sound level is to be found in the construction of the building, the operation of the heating and air conditioning equipment, the exhaust fan, and Sarni\u2019s \u2018finished merchandise\u2019 conveyor,\u201d but he was \u201cunable to determine the exact contribution of each.\u201d When Sarni\u2019s \u201cfinished merchandise\u201d conveyor was in operation a person in American\u2019s office would be conscious of it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201coperation of a laundry and dry-cleaning business with modern, efficient equipment and fixtures as required in the lease and as contemplated by Park and Sarni cannot be conducted without some sound or noise being transmitted by the building into the premises of American.\u201d The \u201clevel of sound caused by Sarni\u2019s operations as presently conducted does not exceed that of an average careful operation using modern, efficient equipment and fixtures in a building constructed as the one in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">On the basis of the foregoing findings, the judge ruled that the sound presently emanating from Sarni\u2019s premises did not constitute a violation of the lease. The plaintiffs contend that the judge\u2019s conclusion, that the operation of a dry cleaning plant cannot be carried on without some noise, even, as here, with the equipment called for in section 10 of the lease, fails to take into consideration section 11 of the lease which requires that Sami shall not permit any objectionable noise to emanate from its premises. In other words, it is said, the judge\u2019s ruling gives section 10 a preference over section 11. We do not agree. Neither clause can be considered in isolation; both must be read together. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>think that is what the judge did. In determining the meaning of the words \u201cobjectionable noise\u201d he had to consider not only Sarni\u2019s obligation to prevent such noise but also Sami\u2019s right under the lease to run a laundry and dry cleaning plant which, he found, \u201ccannot be noiseless.\u201d <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>322 Mass. 299, 302. Moreover, the judge made no finding that the noise emanating from Sarni\u2019s store was objectionable. He found only that the sound by vibration emanating from Sarni\u2019s and the sounds emanating from other sources in the building were objectionable in American\u2019s premises, but he was unable to determine the exact contribution of each sound disturbance. We see no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s conclusion on this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The judge also ruled that the lease did not \u201crequire Sarni to maintain a sales area in any particular part of the demised premises.\u201d An examination of the lease, as amended by the parties, convinces us that.this ruling was right. The plaintiffs, however, urge that in another respect Sarni violated the lease. Pertinent findings touching this issue were as follows. \u201cDuring the noise controversy between Park and Sarni, Sarni moved a shirt pressing machine to the front of the store near the front window of the . . . demised premises. . . . The machine and its operators are almost completely concealed from the view of passersby by a tasteful arrangement of either real or artificial greenery in the front window. The presence of the machine in its location is not distasteful or objectionable to customers who enter Sarni\u2019s store.\u201d There was a clause in the lease that the \u201cTenant shall not make any alterations, additions, replacements or improvements in, to and upon the demised premises without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord in each instance.\u201d No consent with respect to moving the shirt pressing machine was obtained. The plaintiffs contend that this amounted to an unauthorized alteration. The judge rightly rejected this contention. See <em>Zelinger </em>v. <em>Plisek, </em>162 Colo. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We have examined the evidence and are of opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the findings, subsidiary and ultimate, of the judge were not plainly wrong and that the rulings based on those findings reveal no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The bill should not have been dismissed, for some relief was granted to the plaintiffs. The decree should be modified in this respect and, as so modified, is affirmed, with costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> \u201cWhen the \u2018finished merchandise\u2019 conveyor is started in order to locate and deliver merchandise to a customer, there is an audible click. Also audible is its traveling sound.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
