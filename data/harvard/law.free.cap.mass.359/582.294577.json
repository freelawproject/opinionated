L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (h), as amended through St. 1968, c. 637, \u00a7 6. The case raises for the first time a question involving the construction of that statute, which provides for limited reimbursement of \u201c[V]ny person holding office or employment under permanent appointment in the official . . . services of the commonwealth . . . who has incurred expense in defending himself against an unwarranted discharge, removal, suspension, laying off, lowering in rank or compensation, or abolition of his position, ... if he engages an attorney for such defense . . ..\u201d The facts were stipulated by the parties in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The petitioner, the assistant superintendent of the Institute for Juvenile Guidance at Bridgewater, was the subject of eighteen charges preferred against him by the then Director of the Division of Youth Service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing held pursuant to c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), the director sustained sixteen of the eighteen charges and discharged the petitioner. After an appeal by the petitioner to the Civil Service Commission (commission), under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (b), a hearing was held before an officer of the commission, at which nine of the sixteen charges were withdrawn. The commission subsequently rendered a decision \u201cin which it found six of the remaining seven charges not to have been sustained.\u201d It affirmed the action of the director with respect to the seventh but ruled that the discharge was not justified and modified the penalty to a suspension for one month. The petitioner subsequently made a timely and proper application to his appointing officer under \u00a7 43 (h) for reimbursement of $800 of the expenses incurred by him in his defence. The appointing authority, while not disputing the truth of his claim or asking for additional proof, has refused to pay it on advice from the Attorney General that the case does not come within \u00a7 43 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The judge ruled that the petitioner was entitled to reimbursement under \u00a7 43 (h), although he had not been completely exonerated by the commission, but he construed the terms of the section limiting the amount of reimbursement as entitling him to only $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">1. We agree with the trial judge that the petitioner\u2019s claim comes .within the statute. The natural meaning of the listing of disciplinary actions connected by the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d is in an alternative and not a cumulative sense. Thus, if the claimant successfully defends himself against any one of the disciplinary actions invoked against him, so that that one is ultimately held to be \u201cunwarranted,\u201d he is entitled to reimbursement. It would strain the plain meaning of the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d to interpret it as requiring that all the disciplinary actions listed must be found to be \u201cunwarranted\u201d; in other wrords, that the claimant must be completely exonerated before he is entitled to reimbursement. There is no legislative history to suggest such a meaning was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We are not persuaded by the respondent\u2019s argufnent that the distinction in \u00a7 43 (b) between the commission.\u2019s power on the one hand to affirm or reverse the action of the appointing authority and its power on the other to \u201cmodify any penalty imposed\u201d has been carried over to \u00a7 43 (h) so that only when the commission has reversed the action of the appointing authority can the section apply. The language of the two sections is not the same. Section 43 (h) speaks of unwarranted penalties and not of reversals of actions of the authority. In addition, there is no reason why the terminology of \u00a7 43 (b) should be imposed upon \u00a7 43 (h), for the latter section applies as well to claimants who take their defence beyond the commission to a District Court or the Municipal Court of the City of Boston under \u00a7 45;</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">2. The judge was also correct as to the amount of reimbursement to which the petitioner is entitled under \u00a7 43 (h). The statute provides that reimbursement is to be limited to a total of $900. It then goes on to specify that not more than $200 shall be recovered \u201cin each instance\u201d for a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ing by the appointing authority, a hearing-by the commission, and judicial review by a District or Municipal Court. We construe \u201cinstance\u201d as an inclusive term incorporating any or all of the proceedings subsequently listed. It is not disputed that this specification allocates a maximum of $200 for each of these three proceedings, for an upper limit of $600 in any case and for $400 in the circumstances of this case. There is some difference of opinion, however, over the meaning of the next specification which reads: \u201cIn addition thereto, reimbursement in each instance shall be limited to a sum not to exceed one hundred dollars for: \u2014 (1) summons of witnesses; (2) cost of stenographic transcript; (3) any other necessary expense incurred in such defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">This language is concededly ambiguous on its face. The judge reasoned that the specification meant to limit reimbursement to $100 for each of the enumerated categories for- <em>the entire case, </em>thus interpreting \u201cin each instance\u201d to mean \u201cin each case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The judge\u2019s interpretation commends itself also to us because it allows the claimant to recover at most $900 under-the two statutory specifications', the maximum limit specified in the section. He thus may receive $200 for each of the two hearings and the judicial proceeding, and $100 for each of the three enumerated categories of expenses. The statute is so framed that expenses not included within either of the two specifications would appear not to be reimbursable. On the other hand, the maximum amount properly recoverable under the two specifications should not, added together, exceed the fixed maximum total of $900. It would be inconsistent if allowable specific items of expense in specific amounts could total more than $900. Therefore, we construe the second specification as allowing a maximum of $300, so that reimbursement under both specifications will have an upper limit of exactly $900.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The respondent suggests that if the statute is applicable, the second specification properly interpreted allocates $100 for the three enumerated categories of expense <em>combined, </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>each of the three proceedings referred to in the first specification, thus entitling the petitioner here to $200. This interpretation is consistent with the statutory total maximum reimbursement of $900, but it is inconsistent with the format of the first specification. That specification allots amounts for each of the listed proceedings. It is unlikely that the Legislature intended in the second specification to allot amounts not by the items listed therein but by the above fisted proceedings, incorporated in the phrase \u201cin each instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The petitioner, who claims be is due $400 under the second specification, interprets \u201cin each instance\u201d to mean \u201cin each proceeding,\u201d as does the respondent. However, he would allocate $100 to each of the three enumerated categories of expense for each of the three proceedings, giving an upper limit of $900 for second specification expenses only. Quite apart from the fact that this interpretation relies on the same doubtful meaning of \u201cin each instance\u201d as the respondent\u2019s, it is unacceptable because it would allow a total recovery under the specifications far in excess of the $900 maximum fixed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>Order for judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\"> The Division of Youth Service has since become the Department of Youth Services.
