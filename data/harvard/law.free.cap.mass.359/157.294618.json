L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7, and c. 231A) concerning certain regulations of the Rate Setting Commission (the commission) established under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 30K-30P (as appearing in St. 1968, c. 492, \u00a7 3). The defendants filed a demurrer, which was sustained on two grounds, viz. (no. 3) that M.G.H. cannot maintain a bill for declaratory relief under c. 30A, \u00a7 7, and c. 231A, because its \u201cexclusive remedy is under\u201d G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 300; and (no. 4) that M.G.H. has not exhausted its \u201cadministrative remedies under\u201d \u00a7 300. M.G.H. appealed from the interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer, and from a final decree dismissing its bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Attached to (and referred to in) the bill are the exhibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>listed in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The pertinent allegations of the diffuse bill are summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">(1) M.G.H. is a nonprofit hospital, which brings the bill, for itself and others similarly situated, against the commission and the commissioner. The State Department of Public Welfare (the State department) is the State \u201cagency responsible for the administration of the State [p]lan for . . . Medicaid.\u201d By St. 1969, c. 800, \u00a7 1, a new chapter, G. L. c. 118E, was enacted, establishing \u201cin conformity with . . . Title XIX of the Social Security Act ... a program of medical care and assistance for\u201d residents of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">(2) M.G.H. is a \u201cprovider\u201d under G. L. c. 118E and c. 7, \u00a7 30K, and furnishes inpatient hospital care. Among \u201cthe persons receiving hospital care are those who . . . have rights under . . . c. 118E,\u201d and 42 U. S. C. (1964, Supp. V, 1970) \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396g (Title XIX), to have part or all of their hospital care paid for as benefits \u201caccording to a program popularly known as Medicaid.\u201d M.G.H. \u201cexpects payment for hospital care from all of its in-patients, whether from the patient individually or . . . under Medicaid\u201d where payment is made on behalf of the patient direct to M.G.H. M.G.H.\u2019s published charges for its services \u201care established by . . . [the trustees of M.G.H.] annually and from time to time, as necessary, as a result of a detailed and comprehensive budget . . . based upon past operating experience, data, and statistics, as well as the projected operating expenses and income in the oncoming fiscal year. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>[The] budget is designed to produce charges to be used in . . . [that] fiscal year which will be equal to . . . operating expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">(3) On February 18, 1970, the commission \u201cwithout regard to any [Regulations of . . . [H.E.W.] or the law, made regulations for the determination of rates of payment to . . . [M.G.H.] and all other hospital institutions for Medicaid . . . in-patient care under\u201d G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 30L. These regulations are set forth in Exhibit C (fn. 2) attached to the bill. They \u201cprovide for the determination of a per diem rate of money payment which bears no relationship to the charges for the services furnished a patient [or] the costs of the hospital, and provides for no final settlement for underpayment or overpayment or any of the methods, standards, or procedures which are used and currently employed by . . . [M.G.H.] and . . . [H.E.W.] for the care of Medicare patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">(4) The State department pays the rates thus established by the commission\u2019s regulations (Ex. C.) to M.G.H. and other hospitals for the care of persons entitled to Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">(5) The bill then proceeds to allege or assert various legal principles in somewhat confused fashion, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">(a) The rights and duties of (i) persons entitled to Medicaid, (ii) the State department, (iii) the commission, and (iv) M.G.H. and all other \u201cprovider\u201d hospitals are governed by 42 U. S. C. (1964, Supp. V, 1970) \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396g (Title XIX), the approved State plan (Ex. B, fn. 2), and the H.E.W. regulations (Ex. D, fn. 2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 45 C. F. R. \u00a7 250.30 and 20 C. F. it. \u00a7\u00a7 405.401 to 405.454.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">(b) General Laws c. 7, \u00a7 30L (as appearing in St. 1968, c. 492, \u00a7 3; see later amendment by St. 1970, c. 714), requires the commission to establish \u201cfair and reasonable rates of payment to be used by governmental units,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>(at least with respect to \u201cthe rates to be paid by each governmental unit to providers of health services\u201d) are required \u201cbe consistent where applicable with the principles of reimbursement for provider costs in effect from time to time under Title XVIII and Title XIX ... of the Social Security Act governing reimbursements or grants available to the commonwealth, its departments ... or political subdivisions for general health supplies, care, services and accommodations.\u201d The \u201cprinciples of reimbursement for provider costs\u201d are found in 20 C. F. R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.401 to 405.454 (which cover at least twenty-two to twenty-three closely printed pages).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">(c) H.E.W. regulations for Medicaid (Title XIX) are then referred to (somewhat inaccurately) as requiring the Commonwealth to apply (under Title XIX) to \u201ceach hospital [also] participating in the Health Insurance for the Aged program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act . . . the same standards, cost reporting period, cost reimbursement principles, a.nd method of cost apportionment currently used in computing reimbursement to such hospital under title XVIII.\u201d Reference is made to 45 C. F. R. \u00a7 250.30(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">(6) M.G.H. has an agreement with H.E.W. to provide hospital care to Title XVIII (Medicare) patients and has done so since July 1, 1966. Under this agreement, M.G.H. is paid for care according to H.E.W. regulations describing the principles of reimbursement for provider costs, mentioned above. See 20 C. F. R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.401 to 405.454. These principles \u201cprovide for a method of payment, cost report forms, cost report periods, and an interim payment consisting of a certain percentage of the charges for the services furnished an individual patient at the time the services are furnished in a current year, a final audit after the close of a current fiscal year, and then a final settlement between . . . [H.E.W.] and the hospital to adjust for underpayment or overpayment based upon the actual cost data of the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">(7) The State plan, submitted by the Commonwealth to H.E.W. and approved by the latter\u2019s Secretary in 1966, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>provides that the Commonwealth will abide by ELE.W.\u2019s regulations. Because of action by the commission, see next par. (8), and the State department, it is alleged that the State plan (and the regulations under it) now are in violation of H.E.W. regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">(8) M.G.H.\u2019s principal complaint is that the commission has made regulations (Ex. C, fn. 2) \u201cfor the determination of rates' of money payment to . . . [M.G.H.] for the care of Medicaid . . . [i.e. G. L. c. 118E and Title XIX] patients\u201d entirely contrary to the requirements of (a) G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 30L (b) H.E.W. regulations, and (c) 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396g, \u201call of which require, in addition to fair and reasonable rates, that . . . rates must be derived, computed and paid on the same basis as [that on which] the . . . [M.G.H.] is paid and reimbursed under\u201d Medicare (Title XVIII) and the pertinent H.E.W. regulations. See 20 C. F. R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.401 to 405.454.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">(9) M.G.H. alleges the existence of a controversy between it, on the one hand, and the State department, on the other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">It may be that, because of the complexity of the applicable State and Federal statutes and regulations, M.G.H. could not have made allegations of fact, sufficient to be good against demurrer, without a very complete statement of the substance of the statutes and regulations. The statement, unfortunately, is diffuse and somewhat disorderly. Nevertheless, we think the following principal allegations have been set out adequately:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">(1) M.G.H. is a \u201cprovider\u201d of hospital care under Medicare (Title XVIII) and Medicaid (Title XIX, \u2014 and also G. L. c. 118E).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">(2) The applicable Federal statutes and regulations and also G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 30L, require that M.G.H. as a \u201cprovider\u201d be reimbursed by the State department for the care of Medicaid (Title XIX) patients on the same basis as that on which it is entitled to be reimbursed for the care of Medicare (Title XVIII) patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">(3) The Federal regulations under Title XVIII provide in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>great detail principles of reimbursement for provider costs (20 C. F. R. 405.401 to 405.454) on a basis which will give M.G.H. fair reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">(4) The commission has now prescribed by its Emergency Regulation No. 70-2 (Ex. C \u2014 February 18, 1970) a method of reimbursement of M.G.H. and other \u201cprovider\u201d hospitals for the Medicaid care of \u201cpublicly-aided\u201d patients (Title XIX) which is seriously inconsistent with the applicable Federal regulations under Title XVIII (Medicare).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">(5) The commission\u2019s regulations, if applied in computing reimbursement rates for M.G.H. and other \u201cprovider\u201d hospitals, will operate greatly to their detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">1. The trial judge sustained the demurrer on the grounds (a) that M.G.H. was barred from bringing a bill for declaratory relief (G. L. c. 231A) with respect to M.G.H.\u2019s rights under the commission\u2019s regulations (Ex. C) because G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 300, provided the exclusive remedy for testing the regulations, and (b) M.G.H. had not exhausted its administrative remedy under \u00a7 300. This necessitates analysis of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 30L and 300, and of the commission\u2019s emergency regulations (Ex. C).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">General Laws c. 7, \u00a7 30L (as appearing in St. 1968, c. 492, \u00a7 3; see later amendment by St. 1970, c. 714), provides that the commission shall \u201cdetermine . . . the rates to be paid by each governmental unit to providers of health services\u201d and that each such unit \u201cshall pay to a provider of health services . . . the rates for general health . . . care, services and accommodations [so] determined.\u201d The section then proceeds: \u201cEach rate established by the commission <em>shall be deemed a regulation and shall be reviewable as hereinafter provided. </em>The commission shall promulgate <em>rules and regulations for </em>the administration of its duties and <em>the determination of rates </em>as herein required subject to the procedures prescribed by . . . [c. 30A]. Every rate, classification and other regulation established by the commission <em>shall be consistent </em>where applicable <em>with the principles of reimbursement </em>for provider costs in effect from time to time under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act governing reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>bursements or grants available to the commonwealth, its departments . . . commissions or political subdivisions for general health supplies, care, services and accommodations\u201d (emphasis supplied). It will be noted that it is only \u201c[e]ach rate\u201d (even if deemed a regulation) which is to \u201cbe reviewable as hereinafter provided.\u201d On the other hand, \u201crules and regulations for . . . the determination of rates\u201d are to be promulgated \u201csubject to the procedures prescribed by\u201d c. 30A. General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 7, provides, \u201cUnless an exclusive mode of review is provided by law, judicial review of any regulation may be had through petition for declaratory relief\u201d under c. 231A. We think that nothing in \u00a7 30L prescribed \u201can exclusive mode of review\u201d for a regulation setting out the method of the determination of rates as distinguished from a particular rate (even though characterized as a regulation). The latter (a particular rate) is to \u201cbe reviewable as hereinafter provided,\u201d an obvious reference to \u00a7 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Section 300 (as inserted by St. 1968, c. 492, \u00a7 3) provides in part (emphasis supplied): \u201cAny . . . corporation . . . aggrieved by <em>any rate </em>established by the commission or by the <em>failure </em>of the commission <em>to set a rate or take other action required by law </em>and desiring a review thereof, shall, within thirty days after a rate is filed with the secretary of state or may at any time, if there is a failure to determine a rate or take any action required by law, file an appeal with the commission. On appeal the <em>rate </em>determined for any provider of service shall be adequate, fair and reasonable as to such provider based, among other things on the costs of such provider. . . . All such hearings shall be <em>adjudicatory proceedings </em>conducted in accordance with . . .\u201d c. 30A. Section 300 also provides: \u201cJudicial review by the court shall be governed by . . . [c. 30A, \u00a7 143 t\u00b0 *he extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding . . . [c. 30A, \u00a7 73 this section shall be the exclusive method of review of all rates\u201d (emphasis supplied). We think that \u00a7 300 deals only with the review of the rates of individual \u201cproviders\u201d (or the failure to set such individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>rates or take \"other action\u201d with respect thereto) and that the section has no application to <em>general </em>regulations prescribing methods of setting rates applicable to all \"providers.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is emphasized by the provision that a proceeding under \u00a7 300 is to be an adjudicatory proceeding, which in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1) is defined as one \"in which the legal rights ... of specifically named persons are required ... to be determined after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d Although the fixing of a particular rate, for a particular hospital \"provider,\u201d satisfies the definition (of an \"adjudicatory proceeding\u201d), the promulgation of a generally applicable regulation does not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">We now turn to the emergency regulations. They are in two parts which appear to have been promulgated at the same time on February 18, 1970. The first part (six typewritten pages) prescribes \"Rules and Regulations under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 30K-30P, governing the determination of rates of payment to be used by all governmental units for inpatient care provided to publicly-aided patients by hospitals . . ..\u201d A second part sets rates in dollars and cents for each of a great number of hospitals and is entitled \"Publicly Aided Reimbursement Rates \u2014 Hospitals.\u201d The first paragraph of Exhibit C reads (emphasis supplied), \"1. Effective for all inpatient hospital care and services rendered to publicly-aided patients during the period beginning January 1, 1970, and until new rates are promulgated, <em>rates </em>of payment shall be determined under the provisions of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 30K-30P and in accordance with these . . . regulations.\u201d Paragraph 10 provides (emphasis supplied) that any corporation \"aggrieved by any <em>rate </em>determined according to these . . . regulations\u201d may appeal under \u00a7 300. No method of testing the propriety of the regulations themselves is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">There is no indication on the face of the regulations (Ex. C) that there was any effort (in framing them) to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ply with the Federal regulations, especially those under Title XVIII, or that there is such compliance. Whether Exhibit C in fact complies is a matter which, on demurrer to a bill for declaratory relief, it would be premature for us to consider. Indeed, the determination of that issue (as to which M.G.H. is entitled to a declaration) may depend in part upon evidence concerning the application of the regulations and about Federal administrative policy and practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We conclude that, despite the simultaneous promulgation of general regulations and individual \u201cprovider\u201d rates, the general regulations are separable and individually reviewable. Since no other method of reviewing their propriety <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has been provided, M.G.H. may seek review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7, and c. 231A. See <em>First Agricultural Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>353 Mass. 172, 174-175.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">2. Although the demurrer should not have been sustained, this is a case where, before proceeding to a hearing on the merits, it would be appropriate for the trial judge to require clarification and simplification of the bill. The mass of Federal and State regulations involved and then relation to each other might well be made the subject of a stipulation by the parties which could greatly assist consideration of the issues in the Superior Court. Also, some inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>might be made concerning developments in the eleven months since the entry (April 29, 1970) of the interlocutory decree sustaining the demurrer. The State regulations (Ex. C) were originally promulgated on an emergency basis on February 18, 1970.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Inquiry, of course, should be made (a) whether and to what extent the first part of these regulations (concerning rate setting methods) has been altered in any material respects by more permanent regulations (see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 [3], and 3 [3]); (b) whether and to what extent the commission has consulted or agreed with H.E.W.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in an effort to coordinate State rate setting policy with the Federal requirements (see <em>Catholic Med. Center of Brooklyn &amp; Queens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rockefeller, </em>430 F. 2d 1297, 1298-1299 [2d Cir.], app. dism. 400 U. S. 931; see also <em>S. C. </em>305 F. Supp. 1256, 1263-1268 [E.D. N.Y.]); (c) whether new State regulations are soon to be promulgated which will render moot further prosecution of this proceeding, and (d) whether H.E.W. should be invited or permitted to intervene. In any event, this case appears to be one where the public officials concerned and M.G.H. should be able to stipulate promptly concerning many, if not all, the relevant facts, or to present an adequate case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"AJI\">3. The motion to dismiss M.G.H.\u2019s appeal to this court must be denied. That M.G.H. has obtained a satisfactory adjustment of the particular <em>rate </em>applicable to it, under the later part of the State regulations, does not render moot the bill seeking declaratory relief concerning the earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>general </em>regulations (Ex. C). While they remain in effect those general regulations may affect materially the operations and revenues of M.G.H. and other hospitals. Thus, M.G.H. continues to be entitled to declaratory relief concerning them.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">4. The interlocutory decree and the final decree are reversed. The case is to stand for further hearing in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>So ordered</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-6\"> The exhibits attached to the bill include: <em>Exhibit A, </em>letter of August 24, 1966, from, the office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (H.E.W.) transmitting Exhibit B; <em>Exhibit B, </em>the so called State Plan for Medical Assistance; <em>Exhibit C, </em>Emergency Rules and Regulations No. 70-2 under G.

The hearing officer set a rate for M.G.H. of $122.91, which the commission and M.G.H. accepted, and of which M.G.H. seeks no review. In the course of his decision, <em>the </em>hearing officer states that M.G.H. \u201c contends that the Regulations ... [Ex. C] are invalid and illegal in that obsolete data . . . [were] used without applying current costs to develop the rate; a per diem rate is not proper but posted charges should be allowed, and there are no provisions for year end or final settlement. The nature of such attack is one that is not <em>properly </em>recognized by the agency hearing officer.
