Several residents of the vicinity were permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>to intervene as plaintiffs. After trial the judge made a report and a final decree declaring that the taking by the defendants was valid and the subsequent attempted takings by the city were void, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The defendants are the members of the Board of Trustees of State Colleges established pursuant to G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 20A, as amended through St. 1965, c. 572, \u00a7 3. Their powers are set forth in G. L. c. 73, and by \u00a7 19 of that chapter, the Massachusetts College of Art is under their jurisdiction. The powers so granted do not include the taking of land by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u201cThe taking of real estate or of any interest therein by right of eminent domain may be effected in the following manner. A board of officers upon whom authority to take real estate by eminent domain on behalf of any body politic or corporate has been conferred by law . . . may adopt an order of taking . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 1. \u201cWhere no other provision is made by law, a taking of land by eminent domain by or on behalf of the commonwealth shall be made by the governor and council . . ..\u201d G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Statute 1968, c. 476, entitled, \u201cAn Act to provide for a capital outlay program for the commonwealth,\u201d provides in \u00a7 1 that \u201cthe sums set forth in section two of this act . . . are hereby made available . . ..\u201d In \u00a7 2, under the heading \u201cDepartment of Education\u201d and the subheading \u201cMassachusetts College of Art,\u201d is the following item 8069-52: \u201cFor the acquisition of certain land, or land with buildings thereon, by purchase or <em>by eminent domain under chapter seventy-nine of the General Laws . </em>. . and for the preparation of plans . . . including plans for . . . facilities on a site to be determined by the trustees of state colleges . . . $500,000\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">On November 14, 1968, the defendants voted to take the land in question \u201cby authority of Acts of 1968, Chapter 476, item 8069-52, under the provisions of Chapter 79 of the General Laws, in the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d No taking was made by the Governor and Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>We hold that no authority to take real estate by eminent domain was conferred on the defendants by St. 1968, c. 476, item 8069-52, and that the purported taking by them was invalid. In the absence of such authority, the taking could be made only by the Governor and Council under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Under art. 10 of the Declaration of Rights \u201cno part of the property of any individual can, with justice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own. consent, or that of the representative body of the people.\u201d Statutes delegating the power to appropriate private property for a public use \u201cmust be construed with reasonable strictness, so that no citizen shall be deprived of the use and enjoyment of his land except by a valid exercise of the appropriating power subject to which all private property is held.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Beverly, </em>309 Mass. 388, 389. See <em>Trustees of Reservations </em>v. <em>Stockbridge, </em>348 Mass. 511, 514. Numerous examples of explicit delegation are found in our statutes. \u201c. . . [The board of regional community colleges] shall have the power to construct, lease or otherwise provide any facilities required for such colleges, including the right to take land for such purposes by eminent domain under the provisions of chapter seventy-nine.\u201d G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 28, as amended. \u201cThe aldermen of any city, except Boston, . . . may purchase, or take by eminent domain under chapter seventy-nine, any land . . . within the city . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 14, as amended. No such explicit delegation of power to the defendants is found in St. 1968, c. 476, item 8069-52. The absence of such a delegation is emphasized by the explicit reference to the \u201csite to be determined bjr\u201d the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The defendants call our attention to an opinion of the Attorney General with respect to similar item appropriations made in 1965 and 1967, reaching a conclusion contrary to that reached here. Rep. A. G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1968) 180-181. They also point to numerous item appropriations containing language similar to that in issue here, and assert that such language is now commonly used by the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Court to confer eminent domain power. We agree with the Attorney General that \u201cthere is nothing to prevent the General Court from combining an appropriation of funds with a grant of land-taking power in a single piece of legislation, if it chooses to do so. See <em>Yont </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 365, 369.\" But the grant in this instance is limited, as the defendants concede, by the necessity of complying with G. L. c. 79; and unless other provision is made, G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 2, requires a taking by the Governor and Council if the taking is made by or on behalf of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The final decree is reversed. A declaration is to be made that the purported taking by the defendants was invalid. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a decree consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
