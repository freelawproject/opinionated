There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">The plaintiff, who had been employed as a track supervisor for The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company (railroad) brought this action to recover wages for overtime services rendered from 1961 until the plaintiff\u2019s retirement on October 30, 1965. On July 7, 1961, the operation of the railroad was assumed by a trustee, the defendant in this case. After a trial in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston to which the case had been transferred, there was a finding for the defendant. At a trial in the Superior Court upon retransfer, the judge directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is for those hours worked in excess of fifty-six a week, which he deems \u201cextraordinary.\u201d An agreement dated April 1, 1951, between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the railroad and The American Railway Supervisors\u2019 Association, Inc., covered the conditions of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. Among the provisions of this agreement were Rule 2, which stated in part that \u201cThis will not prohibit the performance of other service in excess of eight hours without additional compensation\u201d; Rule 19, which provided that, \u201cA Supervisor who believes that he has been unjustly dealt with in respect to the application of these rules of agreement shall file [V] complaint in writing\u201d; and Rule 22, which stated in part that \u201cComplaints as to compensation claimed and unpaid must be presented in writing to the Supervisor\u2019s immediate superior within sixty (60) days from the date the Supervisor received his pay check for the pay period involved.\u201d The agreement covered track supervisors. There is no merit to plaintiff\u2019s contention that the agreement of April 1, 1951, ceased to be effective after the trustee took over the operation of the railroad. See 6 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th ed.) if 3.23, n. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim is his noncompliance with the provisions for settling grievances set forth in the agreement. \u201cAs a general rule in cases to which federal law applies, federal labor policy requires that individual employees wishing to assert contract grievances must <em>attempt </em>use of the contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and union as the mode of redress.\u201d <em>Republic Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>379 U. S. 650, 652. 45 U. S. C. \u00a7 152, First (1964). In <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. </em>310 F. Supp. 1197, 1202, (S.D. W. Va.) an action for additional compensation by an employee, recovery was denied \u201cfor failure of the plaintiff to exhaust remedies available to him under the contract to which he is a beneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>\u00a1</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
