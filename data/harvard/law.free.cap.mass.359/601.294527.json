A Superior Court judge, sitting without a jury, made findings (a) for Dr. Shaw on count 1, with respect to a 1954 policy, for SI,400, with interest, and (b) for the insurer on count 2 with respect to a 1963 policy. Dr. Shaw (by an outline bill of exceptions) presents exceptions to the denial of certain requests for rulings and to the allowance of rulings requested by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Dr. Shaw was a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (M.G.H.). He took out an accident, health, and disability policy with the insurer in 1954 (the 1954 policy) and another dated September 3, 1963 (the 1963 policy). In pertinent respects, the two policies appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>be essentially similar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The application for the 1963 policy contained questions and answers as follows: Question No. 11. \u201cHave you been disabled by . . . illness or received medical attention or advice during the past five years?\u201d Answer \u2014 \u201cNo.\u201d Question No. 12. \u201cAre you now in sound condition physically and mentally?\u201d Answer \u2014 \u201cYes.\u201d Part VI, sec. A, of each policy (relating to attendance by a physician) was relied on by the insurer, and that portion of the 1963 policy is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 1963 policy contained a \u201ctime limit on certain defenses.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The trial judge made the following voluntary findings, warranted by the evidence, \u201cDr. Shaw, in the spring of 1963, had consulted for psychotherapy a Dr. Vanderpol with regard to . . . marital difficulties. On May 3, 1964, Dr. Shaw was voluntarily admitted to the McLean Hospital [McLean]. . . . The admission diagnosis at . . . McLean . . . was, \u2018Psychoneurotic depressive reaction, moderately severe, passive aggressive character disorder.\u2019 He was released [by Probate Court order, apparently because he was not so dangerously ill as properly to be held against his will] . . . August 6, 1964, at which time the discharge diagnosis was [in part], \u2018Schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type, chronic. Unchanged\u2019. . . . Dr. Shaw was in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>mentally ill in . . . 1963 at the time he signed the [insurance] application and had been mentally ill for some time in the past, although he had been able to control his mental illness so it did not begin to interfere with his work until sometime in 1964. His mental illness, however, did manifest itself in . . . problems with his wife. . . . [H]is schizophrenia had started long before 1963 but ... it had been controlled and was not readily apparent. . . . [I]n answering Questions 11 and 12 . . . Dr. Shaw, to his own mind, answered . . . truthfully. He never believed, even after the hospitalization at McLean, that he was or had been mentally ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\u201c[U]pan his release . . . [from McLean, Dr. Shaw] was <em>advised by members of the . . . </em>[M.G.Hi] <em>staff and other doctor friends ... to seek psychiatric treatment. </em>This he steadfastly refused to do, being of the opinion that the psychiatrists who diagnosed him as mentally ill were in error and that he was in no need of treatment. . . . [H]e was mentally ill [however] during and following his hospitalization . . . and . . . his . . . illness continued at least until July of 1966. . . . [A]fter his release from McLean, he was not allowed to do surgery at . . . [M.G.H.]' and did not perform any of the duties of either a surgeon or a physician. Most of Dr. Shaw\u2019s time and efforts in this period were spent <em>in attempting to get the opinions of the psychiatrists at McLean Hospital overruled ... by the [M.G.H.'} staff. . . . </em>[F]rom September 23, 1964 to November 1, 1964, Dr. Shaw was employed by the Army Air Force reviewing research studies, for which he received more than nominal compensation. . . . [D]uring this period he was performing duties encompassed in the general field of medicine, but not that of \u2018surgery\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Other parts of the trial judge\u2019s findings, rulings, and order in large measure deal with requests for rulings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These rulings are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">1. The judge ruled that two provisions in the 1963 policy, viz. (a) that the \u201cpolicy is issued in consideration of the statements in the application\u201d (fn. 1, <em>supra), </em>and (b) the provision (fn. 3, <em>supra) </em>under the heading \u201cPolicy Provisions <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 Time Limit on Certain Defenses,\u201d constituted \u201cthe equivalent of making the statements in the application conditions precedent to the [effectiveness of the] policy\u201d and \u201cthat such statements, being false, although not made fraudulently and with knowledge of their falsity\u201d barred recovery on the 1963 policy. Dr. Shaw saved exceptions to the action of the judge in ruling, as requested by the insurer, in this manner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Ordinarily, truthful \u201canswers to questions in an original application for insurance are either representations or warranties and not conditions precedent.\u201d See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>342 Mass. 649, 653-654. Interpretation of this written contract is a matter of law\u2019 for the court. See <em>Tri-City Concrete Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>A. L. A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Constr. Co. </em>343 Mass. 425, 427; <em>Quintin Vespa Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co. </em>343 Mass. 547, 551; <em>Charles L. Hazelton &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Teel, </em>349 Mass. 617, 621. As we read this policy (and we are in as good a position as the trial judge to interpret the contract), truthful statements in the application are not expressly made conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the contract nor is the policy to become void or voidable if the statements are untrue. Cf. <em>Faris </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>278 Mass. 204, 208; <em>Lopardi </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 492, 494-497; <em>Paratore </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>335 Mass. 632, 634-635. The trial judge misinstructed himself in ruling as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">2. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 186, reads: \u201cNo . . , misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy ... by the insured . . . shall be deemed material or . . . avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of loss.\u201d This section applies only to representations and warranties and \u201cdoes not apply to provisions in a policy which . . . are made conditions precedent to the duty of performance on the part of the insurance company.\u201d See <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Ins. Co. </em>333 Mass. 200, 203-204; <em>Charles, Henry &amp; Crowley Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>349 Mass. 723, 725-726. We thus must consider whether the statements in the application for the 1963 policy could have been found to pass the dual test of \u00a7 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Dr. Shaw\u2019s negative answer to the question whether he had \u201creceived medical attention or advice during the past five years\u201d could be found not to have been true. He, as the judge found, \u201cin the spring of 1963 . . . consulted for psychotherapy a Dr. Vanderpol with regard to . . . marital difficulties.\u201d Despite the judge\u2019s finding that \u201cDr. Shaw, to his own mind, answered these questions truthfully\u201d because he \u201cnever believed ... he was . . . mentally ill,\u201d he had received this psychotherapy from a medical doctor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>We need not decide whether under \u00a7 186, because of Dr. Shaw\u2019s subjective belief in the truthfulness of his answer, there was no \u201cactual intent to deceive.\u201d The negative answer could be found to have been a misrepresentation which \u201cincreased the risk of loss\u201d within \u00a7 186. See <em>Pahigian </em>v. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Life Ins. Co. </em>349 Mass. 78, 86-87. If the consultations with Dr. Vanderpol had been disclosed, inquiry by the insurer might have revealed Dr. Shaw\u2019s mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Whether the risk of loss indeed is increased \u201cis commonly a question of fact.\u201d See <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co. </em>325 Mass. 115, 119. Psychotherapy at the hands of a medical doctor could be found to constitute medical attention,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> although perhaps even a doctor might regard the term \u201cmedical attention or advice\u201d as encompassing only physical ailments and as not extending to psychotherapy. Any ambiguity in the question, as applied to particular facts, is to be construed (as in the case of a policy provision) against the insurer. See <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co. </em>352 Mass. 304, 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The judge\u2019s finding, that Dr. Shaw \u201cnever believed . . . that he was or had been mentally ill,\u201d leads us to conclude (as apparently the judge did) that his answer to question 12 might be found to be an honest expression of opinion which would pass the tests of \u00a7 186. See <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co. </em>325 Mass. 115, 119-120; annotations, 26 A. L. R. 3d 1061, 30 A. L. R. 3d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We think that the trial judge has not passed clearly upon the issues of fact concerning whether the answers to questions 11 and 12 were misrepresentations which increased the risk of loss within the dual test of \u00a7 186. These issues arising under count 2 must be dealt with by the trier of the facts when the case is reheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>3. Applicable to both the 1954 and the 1963 policies are issues with respect t.o Part VI, Sec. A, of each policy (see fn. 2, <em>supra). </em>That provision requires that \u201cthe Insured be regularly attended by a legally qualified physician . . . other than himself.\u201d The judge\u2019s findings and the evidence suggest that Dr. Shaw, even though he did not think- that he needed treatment or that he was mentally ill, was getting all the medical treatment to which his numerous medical colleagues and friends could persuade him to submit. A major symptom of his illness was his inability to recognize that he was ill. The questions thus arise (a) whether, in the circumstances, he could be regarded as excused from being \u201cregularly attended\u201d by a physician (as Dr. Shaw requested the judge to rule), and (b) whether the essentially undisputed facts, concerning the medical attention given to him, may be viewed as compliance with the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">It is argued in effect that the provision for attendance by a physician is ambiguous, that it should not be regarded as a condition of the policy, and that it should be construed against the insurer. The insurer relies upon the somewhat harsh construction of a similar policy provision in <em>Lustenberger </em>v. <em>Boston Cas. Co. </em>300 Mass. 130. We are not disposed to extend that decision in any degree and recognize that it runs counter to persuasive authority elsewhere. Cf. <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>268 F. 2d 812, 816 (2d Cir.), cert. den. 361 U. S. 948.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we think this provision of the policies sufficiently clearly requires an insured like Dr. Shaw, who claims to be disabled by mental illness, to consult and to be attended by a doctor, even in these circumstances. He is not shown to have been incapable of understanding the policy provision. He knew that others thought him ill. If he wished to collect pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>meats under the policies, he should have submitted to medical attendance even if he thought it unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">To be sure, Dr. Shaw did talk with doctors, but he could be found not to have entered into any patient-doctor relationship with any of them. They tried to help him but he would not permit them to do so. Even though his belief that he was not ill may have been a manifestation of the illness causing his disability, we see no basis for concluding that compliance with the provision was excused, at least while possibility existed that medical attendance might be beneficial. The judge did not err in refusing to rule that the evidence permitted a finding that compliance with the provision for \u201cregular attendance by a physician was excused,\u201d or in finding on the evidence that there was no such compliance except during the period of Dr. Shaw\u2019s stay at McLean. Under both the 1954 and the 1963 policies, the provision for medical attendance, by itself, does not preclude recovery by Dr. Shaw for the period during which he was at McLean.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">4. The exceptions with respect to count 1 are overruled and judgment is to enter for Dr. Shaw according to the trial judge\u2019s finding on that count. The exceptions dealt with in parts 1 and 2 of this opinion as to count 2 are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\"> The insurer\u2019s brief refers to no substantial difference between the policies. The 1963 policy states under the heading \u201cPolicy Consideration \u2014 Policy Period \u2014 Renewal Agreement\u201d that the policy \u201cis issued in consideration of the statements in the application for this policy, a copy of which is attachedand made a part hereof, subject to the terms and provisions and limitations herein contained and the payment of the initial premium . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> The provision, closely resembling a similar provision in the 1954 policy, appears under the heading, \u201cPart VI. sickness indemnity fob total loss of time,\u201d and reads: \u201cSec. A \u2014If such sickness shall wholly and continuously disable and prevent the Insured from performing every duty pertaining to his occupation, <em>and if the Insured be regularly attended by a legally qualified physician or surgeon, other than himself, </em>the Company will pay ... [a specified] weekly indemnity . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> This provision appeared under a heading \u201cpolicy provisions\u201d and reads: \u201ctime limit on certain defenses: (a) After two years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in and if covered by this policy) commencing after the expiration of such two-year period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\"> The findings continued, \u201cHe spent a month in the late fall of 1964 in Europe, having been <em>advised by .. . doctor friends </em>that a change in environment and the removal of himself from the scene might ... be helpful ....

However, Dr. Shaw <em>repeatedly refused, to accept the advice and recommendations of his fellow physicians that he seek psychiatric care\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). While in Europe, \u201che was paid out of a charitable trust fund and . . . this pay was minimal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> The judge by his helpful \u201cfindings, rulings, and order\u201d has greatly clarified the issues in this unusual situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-12\"> In his decision the trial judge erroneously quoted this general heading as \u201cPolicy <em>Conditions.\u201d </em>The word \u201cProvisions\u201d in fact was used in the 1963 policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b619-13\"> The judge granted the insurer\u2019s requests that he rule (no. 4) that G.
