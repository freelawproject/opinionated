The trustees applied to the building commissioner for a building permit which was denied. Upon appeal to the board, a variance was granted by a decision which in somewhat general language states the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>purported reasons for the board\u2019s action. The plaintiffs filed this appeal (from the board's action) under St. 1956, c. 665, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The trustees filed a motion that the plaintiffs be required to furnish a bond pursuant to \u00a7 11. In support of this motion, they submitted affidavits of (a) the building commissioner of Boston, (b) the engineer placed by the trustees in charge of coordinating all activities concerning a proposal to construct on the locus a thirty-story office building containing 670,000 square feet of rentable space, and (c) the general counsel of Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, which has had an option to purchase the locus. The affidavits, if believed, would warrant the conclusions that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal was the principal remaining obstacle to the construction of the building and that the loss from a year\u2019s delay to the persons interested in constructing the office building would be not less than $3,000,000. This was because (among other items) of increasing construction costs and a loss of interest on investment already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">A bond of $3,000,000 was required by an interlocutory decree on June 19, 1970. On July 2, 1970, after notice, a final decree was entered dismissing the bill because of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file the required bond. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The record contains no indication, other than the board\u2019s decision, of the grounds for granting the variance. We thus have no adequate basis for deciding whether the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is meritorious. There is no basis for knowing what harm, if any, will be caused to the plaintiffs if the variance is not set aside, or of other equitable considerations which, in accordance with our decision of today in <em>Damaskos </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, ante, </em>55, may properly be taken into account in determining what penal sum should be set for any bond to be furnished under \u00a7 11. It is obvious that few persons in the position of the plaintiffs could afford to take the serious risks, and to incur the costs, of a $3,000,000 bond, even to press a highly meritorious case in opposition to a variance seriously harmful to their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The case is governed directly by our decision in the <em>Damaskos </em>case. There is no occasion for repeating what is there said.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The interlocutory decree and the final decree are reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and with our opinion in the <em>Damaskos </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
