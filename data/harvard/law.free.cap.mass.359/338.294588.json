McGafiigan, were indicted under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 28, for receiving a stolen motor vehicle, knowing the vehicle to have been stolen. Both defendants were also indicted under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 139, for altering the identifying number of a motor vehicle with intent to conceal the identity of that motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">On November 1, 1968, upon the defendants\u2019 motions their cases were continued for one year without a finding-under the supervision of the probation department. Each motion was supported by an affidavit. The judge certified \u201cthat the cause relied on exists and that the interests of public justice require the allowance [[of the motions].\u201d The Commonwealth claimed an appeal. In October of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1969, the indictments ' against each defendant were dismissed by another judge and the Commonwealth appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">These cases are governed by our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, ante, </em>332.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The judgments are vacated and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, ante, </em>332.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-16\"> It should be noted that the two indictments under G.
