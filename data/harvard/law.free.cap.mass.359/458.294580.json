Mahoney. The trial judge entered a decree in favor of the defendant, from which the plaintiff appealed. The case is before us on a \u201cStipulation Concerning the Evidence,\u201d documents and a pre-trial deposition of Mahoney. In these circumstances, we are in as good a position as the judge to appraise the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiseman, </em>356 Mass. 251, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">On August 27, 1966, the plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle owned by Mahoney in Amherst, Massachusetts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>when it was involved in an accident in which Mahoney\u2019s son, Thomas P., and another passenger, Alfred E. Filadoro, were both killed. The elder Mahoney specifically purchased the vehicle for Thomas to be used while he attended the University of Massachusetts as a student. Thomas kept the car with him at Amherst and had it there for several months prior to the accident. The plaintiff, who was also a student at the university, had been dating Thomas about four or five times a week for approximately two or three months prior to the accident. On the evening of the accident, during the course of a date, they met Alfred Filadoro, an \u201cold friend \u201d of Thomas. Thomas requested the plaintiff to drive while he sat in the front seat and conversed with his friend who was sitting in the rear. The accident occurred on that trip. An action by the administrator of the estate of Filadoro against the plaintiff was settled by payment of $25,804.25 to the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Thomas and his father never discussed whether Thomas could permit anyone else to drive the car and he was unaware that anyone other than Thomas operated it. However, he had given Thomas general permission to use the car for any purpose for which a motor vehicle is commonly used and its use had never been restricted. The elder Mahoney did not know the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The policy of insurance issued by the defendant to the elder Mahoney provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) With respect to the insurance under Coverages B and C, the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes (1) the named insured and ... (2) any other person using the motor vehicle with the permission of the named insured . . . provided his actual operation or (if he is not operating) <em>Ms other actual use thereof is within the scope of such permission </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The sole issue before us <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is whether the plaintiff qualifies as an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the terms of the policy so as to be entitled to its benefits. In concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that the plaintiff did not so qualify, the judge\u2019s only ruling was that this case falls within the principles of these Massachusetts decisions: <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>291 Mass. 432, at 436, 437. <em>Kneeland </em>v. <em>Bernardi, </em>317 Mass. 517. <em>Woznicki </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>299 Mass. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We are of opinion that the foregoing cases are clearly distinguishable and do not control the disposition of the instant one. In the <em>Blair </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the owner of an automobile lent it on a Saturday evening to one Dion for the sole purpose of enabling Dion to take it to his house that night to show it to a prospective buyer on Sunday morning. Dion had no license to operate the car and did not have permission to use the car for any purpose other than that stated. He went for a pleasure ride and allowed another individual to drive it, who also had no license, when an accident occurred. In holding that the \u201cuse\u201d of the car at the time of the accident was not within the \u201cpermission\u201d of the owner, the court particularly relied on the fact that the car was given to Dion for a specific purpose and stated that \u201c[s]uch a ride was not within the express or implied purposes of the bailment, nor incidental to them, but amounted to a conversion of the automobile, [citing-cases]\u201d P. 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Similarly, in <em>Kneeland </em>v. <em>Bernardi, supra, </em>the owner of an automobile loaned it to Bernardi on a Sunday morning for the sole purpose of allowing Bernardi to go from East Boston to Lowell to seek employment. Bernardi had to return the car by 3 p.m. After going to Lowell and returning, Bernardi, by appointment, met a Miss Rowe, who was unknown to the owner. Bernadi allowed Miss Rowe, who was unlicensed, to make a practice drive around a race track and then she drove the car to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where an accident occurred. Citing the <em>Blair </em>and <em>Woznicki </em>cases, the court held that a \u201cpractice drive by an unlicensed novice as the operator, even though Bernardi was present, was not a \u2018use\u2019 of the automobile by Bernardi \u2018with permission of the named insured \u2019 within the terms of the policy.\u201d P. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The <em>Woznicki </em>case, <em>supra, </em>involved the liabihty of an insurance company under a policy issued pursuant to the compulsory motor vehicle insurance law where the owner had loaned his car to an unlicensed operator, one Loughlin, for the specific purpose of taking a girl friend to a particular place. Loughlin allowed one Rea to drive the car and an accident occurred. The question before the court was whether Loughlin was a \u201cperson responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with . . . [[the] express or implied consent\u201d of the owner within the provisions of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A. The court held that there was no such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In all of these cases, the owners loaned their cars for a specific and limited use. In addition, we note that in each case either the person to whom the car was entrusted or the subsequent operator was unlicensed, although only the <em>Kneeland </em>case appears to specifically rely on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In the present case, the elder Mahoney had given his son general dominion over the car. No restrictions had been placed on its use. Being away at college, the son, in effect, was solely responsible for its operation. Since the elder Mahoney appears to have delegated such broad responsibility to his son, it is reasonable to assume that the driving of the car by the plaintiff while the son was riding in it and for his purposes was impliedly sanctioned by the father.

Co. </em>v. <em>Rollanson, </em>246 F. 2d 105, 109 (4th Cir.); <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>New Amsterdam Cas.

Co. </em>v. <em>Freeport Ins. Co. </em>30 Ill. App. 2d 69, 75; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>176 So. 2d 453, 455, 457 (La.); <em>Hardware Mut. Cas.
