The parents had three automobiles, each covered by a separate insurance policy issued by the same insurer. Each policy included Coverage U \u2014 Protection Against Uninsured Motorists, with a limit of liability of $5,000 for \u201ceach person\u201d in each policy. The boy was an insured under each policy as a relative of the named insured while a resident of the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The insurer is willing to pay a total of $5,000, one-third on each policy, but asserts that its total, liability is limited to $5,000. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief as to the applicable limits. On the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts, the judge made findings of fact, declarations of rights, and an order for a decree. The insurer appeals from a decree that the plaintiffs may recover, when liability and damages are determined, a sum on each policy equal to one-third of the damages, with an upper limit of $5,000 on each policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">1. The critical clause is identical in each policy. With an exception not applicable here, it reads: \u201c. . .if the insured has other similar insurance available to him and applicable to the accident, <em>the damages shall be deemed not to exceed the higher of the applicable limits of liability of this insurance and such other insurance, </em>and the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss to which this coverage applies than the limit of liability hereunder bears to the sum of the applicable limits of liability of this insurance and such other insurance\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">A somewhat similar clause, applicable to Coverage A, the compjilsory, liability coverage under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, was <em>interpreted in Maryland </em>Cas. <em>Co. v. Hunter, 341 Mass. 238, </em>244-245, \u201cto mean that each insurer is to share propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tionately the total loss, so long as it is not required to pay more than its applicable limit of liability.But that clause did not contain the language italicized above. With the italicized language, the clause may be infelicitous and confusing, but it is not ambiguous. If the italicized language means anything, it must mean that total recovery against the insurer in the present case is limited to $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">2. So interpreted, the clause in each policy imposes a limit of one-third of $5,000 on payment under that policy on account of the death of the insured in this case. The governing statute in 1967 was G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34L, inserted by St. 1966, c. 260.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That statute required that each policy provide for payment \u201cwithin limits no less than those set forth in said\u201d \u00a7 34A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The definition of \u201cmotor vehicle liability pohcy\u201d in \u00a7 34A requires a pohcy which provides indemnity for or protection \u201cto the amount or limit of at least five thousand dollars on account of injury to or death of any one person.\u201d A clause providing a limit of one-third of $5,000 does not comply with a requirement that the limit be \u201cno less\u201d than \u201cat least $5,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>3. We therefore agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause conflicts with the statute and is ineffective to the extent of the conflict. Our conclusion is in accord with decisions reached by other courts in similar situations. <em>Bacchus </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins.

We need not analyze closely the differences in the particular clauses or in the governing statutes in such cases. Nor need we evaluate the arguments which have been made to us as to the wisdom of the statutory requirement. See Soich, Uninsured Motorist Coverage: Past, Present and Future, 6 Duquesne U. L.
