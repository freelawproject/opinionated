There was a verdict for Sparks. Microwave\u2019s bill of exceptions brings before us exceptions (a) to the judge\u2019s denial of a directed verdict; (b) to his charge; and (c) to his refusal to give certain requested instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testimony is stated in its aspect most favorable to Sparks.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Sparks, an electrical engineer, had been employed by a firm specializing in the development of yttrium iron garnet devices, known as YIG devices. He was hired by Microwave on June 6, 1966, as product manager of its YIG product line. At this time, Microwave\u2019s personnel director undertook to recommend to its board of directors that he be granted a stock option. On June 30, 1966, he was given a stock option for 1,000 shares under the plan. On April 6, 1967, Sparks was notified by his supervisor that Microwave had decided to discontinue the YIG product line and that his employment with Microwave was to be terminated. The next day, April 7, he signed two termination statements and removed his papers from his office. That was the last day he regularly reported to work at Microwave. He received accrued vacation pay and severance pay through May, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Sparks discussed with his supervisor \u201cthe question of his serving as a consultant while . . . orders in . . . [the YIG3 product area were still\u201d pending and undelivered. There was a total of $60,000 of such contracts, under which the last deliveries would probably take place near the end of August, 1967. Sparks also asked \u201cabout the possibility of remaining available as a consultant until he would have been able to exercise his stock option.\u201d The supervisor said \u201che would have to let Sparks know about it.\u201d Later that day, the supervisor told Sparks that \u201cMicrowave was agreeable to Sparks\u2019[s3 remaining available as a consultant during completion of the YIG orders.\u201d Sparks \u201ccould be con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>suited if any engineering problems arose on the YIG jobs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In late May, Sparks was called by one of Microwave\u2019s mechanical designers who \u201cunderstood that Sparks had agreed to render consultative assistance with respect to , . . delivery of the YIG orders. Sparks arranged to be available on Saturday, June 3, 1967 and went ... on that day to help solve some problems that had developed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sparks was anxious to retain affiliations with Microwave that would ensure that he could exercise the option and it was for that reason that he submitted his check on June 30 for the 200 shares which he believed he was entitled to purchase under the option at that time. Until he received . . . [a] letter of July 7, 1967 from Microwave\u2019s counsel, he had not had any indication that he would not be allowed to purchase stock under the option. Sparks went to work for Raytheon [a competitor of Microwave] some time in May or June\u201d and \u201cwas working for Raytheon\u201d on June 3, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Sparks attempted to exercise his stock option on June 30, 1967. On May 25, 1967, he wrote a letter to Microwave\u2019s personnel director (see fn. 2) indicating a belief that the \u201cofficial termination date\u201d of his \u201cemployment period\u201d with Microwave was May 31, 1967. Sparks\u2019s answers to certain interrogatories (introduced in evidence) stated that the last date on which he performed any services for Microwave was June 3, 1967, and that his employment by Microwave then ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Microwave contends that Sparks was not entitled to exercise the option because the attempt to do so on June 30, 1967, followed termination of Sparks\u2019s employment, which occurred before a full year had elapsed (see the plan, \u00a7 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and the one year minimum provision of \u00a7 7). Relevant provisions of the plan are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">1. The parties in effect have stipulated that the .option could not be exercised by Sparks unless he was an employee on June 30, 1967. That was the first day of the option period which began (under \u00a7 7) \"one year . . . from, the date the option is granted.\u201d Under \u00a7 8 of the plan, the option could be exercised only during the option period. If the cessation of his employment occurred before June 30, 1967, Sparks could not exercise the option during any thirty-day period given by \u00a7 7 (c) of the plan because the cessatioi. was not \"during . . . the period of years applicable to-. . . [his] option,\u201d as required by \u00a7 7 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"Az06\">The interpretation of the plan, a written contract, if not ambiguous, is a question of law for the court. See <em>Daley </em>v. <em>J. F. White Contr. Co. </em>347 Mass. 285, 288. The plan, we think, is properly to be interpreted as not including within the term \"employee\u201d a person who is merely a casual consultant and then only at the discretion of Microwave. The purpose of the plan and its description of who may be \"participants\u201d indicates that a more substantial relation-, ship with Microwave was contemplated. Of course, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>qualified to be a \u201cparticipant\u201d in the plan when an option was issued to him might cease to be so qualified during the period for exercise of the option. We assume that he would remain an \u201cemployee\u201d if he continued to be employed by Microwave on a regular (and not merely a casual) basis. If, however, he became merely a consultant subject to call at Microwave\u2019s sole discretion, we think that thereafter he would cease to be an employee within the meaning of the plan..</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">A verdict should have been directed for Microwave.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">2. In view of our decision on the motion for a directed verdict, it is unnecessary to discuss other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\"> The parties agreed \u201cat the beginning of the trial\u201d (a) that the \u201csole question before the jury was whether Sparks was an employee of Microwave on June 30, 1967,\u201d when he attempted to exercise the option; and (b) that, if Sparks was an employee on June 30, 1967, he was to recover $3,000; but otherwise there should be a finding for Microwave.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> Sparks\u2019s supervisor and an officer of Microwave each testified that Sparks, at or after the time his employment was terminated, never spoke about the option. One regarded Sparks\u2019s employment as terminated on April 7; the other gave him a letter of recommendation stating that Sparks was on the Microwave \u201cpayroll until May 30, 1967,\u201d a date which Sparks by letter claimed should be May 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> On that day he signed in on the visitor\u2019s log and stayed two hours and twenty minutes. He talked with some Microwave employees on the telephone after June 3, about the YIG orders. He was not paid for his work on June 3, and never made any claim for pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\"> The plan provides in part (emphasis supplied): <em>Section 1. \u201cPurpose. </em>The purpose of this Plan is to further the growth and development of the Company by granting to <em>certain officers, department heads and </em>other key employees, as an incentive and to encourage stock ownership, options to purchase shares of Stock of the Company and thereby obtain a proprietary interest in the enterprise and a more direct stake in its continuing welfare.\u201d <em>Section 7. \u201cOption Period. The period for exercising an option shall be the period beginning one year </em>and ending five years <em>from the date the option is granted, </em>except that <em>... (o) If a participant ceases to be an employee </em>of the Company for any cause other than retirement or death <em>during, </em>but more than ttdrty (30) days before the expiration of, <em>the period of years applicable to an option </em>held by him, such option shall be exercisable by him only during the thirty days following the cessation of his employment, and shall not be exercisable thereafter.\u201d <em>Section 8r \u201cExercise of Option. </em>An option may be exercised at any time and from time to time during\u2022 <em>the option period applicable to such option </em>except that an option may be exercised: (i) during the second year from the date it was granted only to the extent of twenty per cent of the number of shares covered by the option .... If one of the events referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b), or (c) of Section 7 occurs, the option shall be exercisable during . . . the thirty days following cessation of employment . . . only as to the number of shares, if any, as to which it was exercisable, immediately prior to the . . . cessation of employment, under this [s]ection.\u201d . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
