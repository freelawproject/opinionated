L. c. 231A in which the widow of the late sheriff of Suffolk County seeks to determine her pension rights under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B. The case was heard in the Superior Court on a stipulation which we treat as a case stated. The trial judge reported the case without decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">Subject to certain conditions not applicable here, a widow under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B, as amended through St. 1958, c. 669, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, is entitled to \u201can annual allowance consisting of two thirds of the actuarial equivalent to which ... \u00a1Tier husband] would have been entitled\u201d under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 700, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. It is apparent that the rights of a widow under \u00a7 58B depend on the rights of her deceased husband under \u00a7 58. Section 58 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cA veteran who has been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the service of the commonwealth, or of any county, city, town or district ... for a total period of thirty years in the aggregate, shall, at his own request, with the approval of the retiring authority, be retired from active service at . . . Qa percentage] of the highest annual rate of compensation . . . payable to him while he was holding the grade held by him at his retirement, and payable from the same source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s husband was a veteran who served as a member of the Boston school committee from January 1, 1934, to January 5, 1942, and as sheriff of Suffolk County from November 16, 1939, to January 19, 1968, the date of his death. As a member of the school committee he did not receive any compensation. As sheriff, the deceased lacked slightly less than two years of the thirty years of service required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58. If the period in which he served as a school committee member is tacked onto the period in which he served as sheriff, he would have had more than thirty-four years of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The sole issue we must decide is whether unpaid service as a school committee member should be included in computing the amount of service required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It is clear that a statute is to be so construed as to \u201cbe given an effect in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u201d <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State St. Ry. </em>230 Mass. 370, 374. Under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, the late sheriff\u2019s retirement allowance could only have been a percentage of \u201cthe highest annual rate of compensation . . . payable to him while he was holding the grade held by him at his retirement, and payable from the same source.\u201d If the deceased had never become sheriff, but had continued as an unpaid school committeeman for thirty years, he would not be entitled to any retirement allowance because at the time of retirement he would not have received any compensation. It is apparent that the decedent\u2019s service as a school committeeman must qualify under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, in order to tack it onto his service as sheriff. We are unable to conclude that in predicating the retirement allowance on the amount of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>pensation received by a veteran in the public service, the Legislature intended unpaid service to be included as \u201cservice\u201d within G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58. Compare <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>312 Mass. 248, 249, where this court said: \u201cIt is plain that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7 57, in authorizing the retirement of a veteran \u2018from active service, at . . . /a percentage of] the regular rate of compensation paid to him at the time of retirement/ contemplates the retirement only of persons still in \u2018active service\u2019 and receiving pay at the time of retirement and not that of persons who have previously been discharged or for some other reason separated from the service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We also note that the instant case involves one of the noncontributory retirement systems ultimately to be abolished under St. 1934, c. 285. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of the County of Middlesex, </em>312 Mass. 115, 120. In <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>330 Mass. 302, 304, this court said: \u201cIt appears to be settled so far as this Commonwealth is concerned that pensions or retirement allowances established on a noncontributory basis, even though in a sense they are granted in recognition of services rendered or to be rendered, do not have their origin in contract but are so far analogous to gratuities that the Legislature can change their incidents or reduce their amounts, even after the recipient has retired and has begun to receive their benefits.\u201d See also cases cited at p. 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Although this court does not appear to have decided whether noncontributory retirement statutes should be strictly construed, it was stated long ago that \u201cin all grants, made by the government to individuals, of rights, privileges, and franchises, the words are to be taken most strongly against the grantee.\u201d <em>Cleaveland </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>6 Cush. 380, 383, 384. We think that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, should be strictly construed to include only that service for which compensation has been received. See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>312 Mass. 248, 249, and <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>342 Mass. 67, 73, where a strict construction of the noncontributory retirement statutes was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"AjZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>In none of the opinions of the Attorney General cited by the plaintiff, on which she seems to place substantial reliance, is there a discussion as to whether unpaid service is to be included in computing the amount of service required by the statute. A decree is to be entered that the late sheriff would not have been entitled to be retired under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58, and therefore the plaintiff is not entitled to receive an annual allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 58B.</p>\n<p id=\"ado-dedup-0\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
