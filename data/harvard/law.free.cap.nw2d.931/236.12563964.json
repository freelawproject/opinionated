Hendrickson argues the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress because officers did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] Hendrickson was charged with actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol while being accompanied by a minor under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 39-08-01.4, a class A misdemeanor. Hendrickson moved to suppress evidence and to dismiss the charges against him. He argued officers did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him based on information from a 911 call. Hendrickson claimed the 911 caller was a Taco Johns employee and the employee alleged he was in the restaurant's drive thru and appeared to be \"beyond drunk.\" He alleged the caller said he was slurring his speech; his eyes were \"on and off,\" \"open and shut,\" and \"rolling to the back of his head;\" and she said, \"To us he looks drunk, but I wouldn't know.\" He claimed the responding officers did not observe any suspicious behavior or note any signs of intoxication when they spoke to him. Hendrickson argued the caller's information was not sufficient by itself to establish reasonable suspicion that he was intoxicated because the information was vague and did not contain any objective indicia which would lead a reasonable person to suspect intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] Neither Hendrickson nor the State requested an evidentiary hearing. The district court denied Hendrickson's motion based on the parties' briefs and the evidence submitted in support of the briefs, including a recording of the 911 call and video of the stop. The court found there was sufficient reasonable and articulable suspicion based on the information from the 911 call to justify the investigative stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] The State entered into a plea agreement with Hendrickson, and an amended complaint was entered, charging Hendrickson with actual physical control of a motor\n   vehicle, a class B misdemeanor. Hendrickson conditionally pled guilty to the amended charge, reserving the right to appeal the court's order denying his motion to suppress.

The court found the 911 caller, an employee of Taco Johns, was able to provide detailed information describing the vehicle, the license plate number, the name of the driver, and that the driver was \"beyond, beyond, beyond drunk.\" The court found the caller described in detail why she believed Hendrickson was drunk, including that Hendrickson slurred his speech, that he did not properly respond to questions concerning his order, and that his eyes were \"both on and off and rolling to the back of his head.\" The court found the caller equivocated regarding whether Hendrickson was under the influence of alcohol as opposed to some other substance, but she was steadfast that Hendrickson was under the influence of something. The court also noted the caller was within a few feet of Hendrickson when she made the observations. The court found the information provided was very specific and detailed, and the information relayed was of classic signs of intoxication which are commonly known. The court further found police were able to verify some of the information the caller provided including the vehicle description, license plate, and identity of the driver, which provided further indication of the reliability of the information, and the officers were justified in relying on the information.
