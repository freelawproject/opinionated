The city argues that the district court erred in concluding that the city's 2017 amendments to Title 7 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances (the amendments) violate Fletcher's substantive-due-process and equal-protection rights under the Minnesota Constitution. By notice of related appeal, Fletcher argues that the district court erred in concluding that the amendments do not implicate a fundamental right and in applying the rational-basis test to Fletcher's constitutional claims. Because we conclude that the amendments do not implicate a fundamental right and Fletcher's constitutional claims are subject to rational-basis analysis, and because the amended ordinance meets the rational-basis\n   test, we reverse and remand for the district court to conduct further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Section 8) provides, among other programs, tenant-based housing assistance through housing choice vouchers (vouchers). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437f(b)(1)-(2), f(o) (2012 &amp; Supp. V 2017). The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) administers the Section 8 program in Minneapolis. Under the Section 8 program, the MPHA determines the fair market rent for a rental unit and establishes payment standards that determine how much a voucher holder will pay toward the established fair market rent and how much the MPHA will subsidize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A 2016 survey of Minneapolis rental listings conducted by HOME Line, a nonprofit organization that provides legal advice to renters, revealed that only 57% of the particular listings surveyed were within rent limits that are affordable to voucher holders and, of those affordable listings, only 23% would accept vouchers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The HOME Line survey also revealed that, of the limited properties accepting vouchers, the vast majority were concentrated in high-poverty zip codes in north Minneapolis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each year the MPHA administers about 4,870 vouchers, serving approximately 17,000 people. Of those 17,000 people, 53% are children, 84% are people of color, 78% are families headed by women, and 41% include households where someone has a disability. The average income for voucher holders is just over $ 15,000. The inability to find housing is a daily occurrence for voucher holders. At any given time, about 250 voucher families are searching for housing in Minneapolis. Minneapolis has a tight rental market in general, with a vacancy rate of about 4%. There is even less availability for low-income households, with a vacancy rate of only about 2%. Some landlords explicitly state in their property advertisements that they will not accept vouchers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When a voucher holder identifies a qualifying rental unit, the MPHA conducts an inspection of the unit to determine whether it satisfies certain livability standards. If the unit passes the inspection, the MPHA enters into a payment agreement with the landlord by using a form known as a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contract. The MPHA must use the HAP contract or request approval from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to adapt the contract. The HAP contract has standardized language, is used nationally, and has been in effect for years. Hundreds of thousands of landlords have signed the agreement, and over 1,000 landlords participating in the Section 8 program in Minneapolis have used the HAP contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2015, the city council published a notice of its intent to introduce amendments to its civil rights ordinance, prohibiting discrimination based on any requirement of public assistance programs, including the Section 8 program. Following the notice, the city council engaged in nearly two years of discussion, study, research, and listening sessions with those who might be affected by the amendment, including landlords, voucher holders, and the MPHA. The city's request for committee action identified increasing affordable housing opportunities for voucher holders as a goal of the amendments. The request for committee action\n   noted that voucher holders experience \"a denial of housing opportunities in high opportunity areas based on their use of rental subsid[ies]\" and that \"the [c]ity would like to broaden the opportunities for access to housing that is otherwise not affordable to families and individuals without a Housing Choice Voucher.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March 2017, the Minneapolis city council enacted amendments to its civil rights ordinance, Title 7 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances (the amended ordinance), with an effective date of May 1, 2018. Minneapolis, Minn., Ordinance No. 2017-010 (Apr. 1, 2017). In December 2017, the Minneapolis city council adopted Ordinance No. 2017-078, further amending the amended ordinance. Minneapolis, Minn., Ordinance No. 2017-078 (Dec. 16, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The final amendments make it an \"unlawful discriminatory practice\" for a landlord or any agent to use \"any requirement of a public assistance program [as] a motivating factor\" to \"refuse to sell, rent or lease, or refuse to offer for sale, rental or lease; or to refuse to negotiate for the sale, rental, or lease of any real property.\" Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances (MCO) \u00a7 139.40(e)(1) (2017). Under the amended ordinance, a landlord's decision to refuse to rent a property for reasons related to the requirements of the Section 8 program constitutes an \"unlawful discriminatory practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the amended ordinance prohibits landlords from declining to rent to voucher holders who meet the landlords' other requirements, even if the landlords have legitimate business reasons not to participate in the Section 8 program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the amended ordinance, a landlord has an affirmative defense to a claim that the landlord's refusal to rent property constitutes an unlawful discriminatory practice if \"the refusal, denial, or withholding is due to a requirement of a public assistance program and that requirement would impose an undue hardship\" on the landlord.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Undue hardship\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [A] situation requiring significant difficulty or expense when considered in light of a number of factors to be determined on a case-by-case basis. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) The nature and net cost of complying with any requirement of a public assistance program, taking into consideration existing property management processes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) The overall financial resources of the landlord, taking into consideration the overall size of the business with respect to the number of its employees, and the number, type, and location of its housing stock; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (3) The impact of complying with any requirement of a public assistance program upon the business and dwelling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   MCO \u00a7 139.20 (2017). In addition, the amended ordinance exempts four classes of rental properties from its anti-discrimination provisions related to public assistance programs: (1) a room in an owner-occupied single-family dwelling; (2) a single-family dwelling or single dwelling unit being rented for no more than 36 months by an owner who homesteaded the unit at the start of the rental period; (3) a unit of an owner-occupied duplex; and (4) a previously homesteaded property of an owner\n   on active military duty. MCO \u00a7 139.30(b)(1)-(4) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When the city council passed the amendments, it also directed staff to report on the development of a landlord incentive fund to offset property-damage claims by landlords. The fund went into effect on January 1, 2018, and allows a landlord renting to a voucher holder to request reimbursement for damage in excess of the security deposit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In June 2017, Fletcher filed a complaint seeking a declaration that the amended ordinance is unlawful and violates the Minnesota Constitution. Fletcher moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the amended ordinance is preempted by Minnesota law, (2) the amended ordinance deprives Fletcher of its right to substantive due process, (3) the amended ordinance deprives Fletcher of its right to equal protection under the law, (4) the amended ordinance constitutes an unlawful regulatory taking, and (5) the amended ordinance deprives Fletcher of its right to freedom of contract. The city filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court granted Fletcher's summary-judgment motion and denied the city's summary-judgment motion, concluding that the amended ordinance deprives Fletcher of its rights to substantive due process and equal protection under the Minnesota Constitution. The district court did not address Fletcher's other claims. In a subsequent order, the district court enjoined the city from enforcing the provisions of the amended ordinance that it found to be unconstitutional and held that Fletcher's other three claims are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I.

The city argues that the district court correctly determined that the rational-basis test applies to Fletcher's constitutional claims but that the district court erred in concluding that the amended ordinance violates Fletcher's substantive-due-process and equal-protection rights. By notice of related appeal, Fletcher argues that the district court erred in concluding that the rational-basis test applies. Fletcher contends that the amendments implicate a fundamental right, requiring the application of strict scrutiny. Fletcher also maintains that the amended ordinance is unconstitutional under both the rational-basis test and strict scrutiny. We first consider whether the amendments implicate a fundamental right, requiring strict-scrutiny review, and then address Fletcher's substantive-due-process and equal-protection claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Yet, as the district court itself acknowledged, the amended ordinance serves the public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders. Increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders is a plausible public purpose that could satisfy rational-basis analysis. Additionally, the city's request for committee action specifically identified increasing housing opportunities as a goal of the amendments. The request for committee action noted that voucher holders experience \"a denial of housing opportunities in high opportunity areas based on their use of rental subsid[ies]\" and that \"the [c]ity would like to broaden the opportunities for access to housing that is otherwise not affordable to families and individuals without a Housing Choice Voucher.\" The fact that the amendments were codified in Minneapolis's civil-rights ordinance, and may also serve the public purpose of reducing prejudice-based discrimination, does not eliminate increasing housing opportunities as a public purpose that the amended ordinance serves. Because increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders is a plausible public purpose, and because the city identified increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders as an objective prior to passing the amendments, the district court erred in not considering whether the amended ordinance rationally serves that public purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On de novo review, we next consider whether the amended ordinance rationally serves the public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders. The amended ordinance satisfies the rational-basis test if the amended ordinance (1) serves to promote the public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders, (2) is not an unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious interference with a\n   private interest, and (3) uses means that bear a rational relation to the public purpose of increasing housing opportunities.\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11638095\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/591/711/#p716\">\n    591 N.W.2d at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The amended ordinance serves to promote the public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The city argues that the amended ordinance serves to promote the valid public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders. Fletcher argues that the amended ordinance does not serve to promote this public purpose because the MPHA already has a high placement rate for voucher holders. We agree with the city that the amended ordinance serves to promote the public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders. As this court has stated, \"[i]ncreasing affordable housing availability is a valid goal.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Hopkins Plaza Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7080815\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/783/171/#p179\">\n    783 N.W.2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (Minn. App. 2010). At any given time, about 250 voucher families are searching for housing in Minneapolis. Even if the MPHA has a high placement rate, further increasing the housing opportunities for voucher holders is a valid goal and serves a public purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The amended ordinance is not an unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious interference with a private interest.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The city argues that it undertook a long and deliberative process in adopting the amended ordinance and that the amended ordinance is not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. Fletcher argues that the amended ordinance is unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious because it fails to address actual impediments to placing voucher holders in stable housing. Fletcher contends that criminal background checks, credit histories, and rental backgrounds are significant barriers to voucher holders finding housing and that the city should have focused on those issues, rather than prohibiting landlords from declining to accept vouchers for business reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is undisputed that the amended ordinance will interfere with landlords' private interests. Under the amended ordinance, landlords may not decline to participate in the Section 8 program, even if they have legitimate business reasons to do so. And participating in the Section 8 program will require landlords to use the standardized HAP agreement, even if they object to certain provisions in the agreement. This is an interference with their private interests. But interference with a private interest alone is not enough to find that the amended ordinance violates a property owner's substantive-due-process rights.\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7329675\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/843/249/#p258\">\n    843 N.W.2d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The interference must also be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7329675\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/843/249/#p258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, the summary-judgment record shows otherwise. Over 1,000 landlords voluntarily participate in the Section 8 program in Minneapolis, and hundreds of thousands of landlords participate nationwide. Furthermore, the city reduced the degree of interference with landlords' private interests by providing significant time to adjust before the amendments went into effect, creating a hardship defense, and creating a landlord incentive fund to address property-damage issues. Thus, we cannot conclude that the interference is unreasonable. Nor can we conclude that it is arbitrary or capricious. The city council adopted the amended ordinance in an effort to increase housing opportunities for voucher holders after it found that there is a shortage of available housing. Its conclusions are supported by the HOME Line study. The interference with landlords' private interests created by the amended ordinance is not unreasonable, capricious, or\n   arbitrary in light of the amended ordinance's purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Fletcher argues that other options, such as credit counseling, would have been more helpful in increasing housing opportunities. But even if Fletcher is correct, the fact that other services might also increase housing opportunities does not make the amended ordinance unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. Where the reasonableness of an ordinance is debatable, we will not interfere with legislative discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7329675\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/843/249/#p258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 261 n.3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holt v.

Apr. 24, 1997). In light of the amended ordinance's purpose of increasing housing opportunities, it is more than merely debatable whether the amended ordinance's interference with landlords' private interests is reasonable.

Fletcher argues that the means that the amended ordinance uses are not rationally related to the purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders because there are other less burdensome ways to make the administration of the voucher program more appealing to landlords. Fletcher further argues that the amended ordinance will increase landlords' costs, requiring an increase in rent, which could reduce the number of units available for voucher holders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded by Fletcher's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Fletcher's argument seeks to put the burden on the city to prove that the amended ordinance is the best possible way to increase housing opportunities.

Fletcher's conjecture that increased costs could reduce housing opportunities is insufficient to demonstrate that there is no set of circumstances under which the amended ordinance would be valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Under this prong of the substantive-due-process analysis, the amended ordinance satisfies the rational-basis test if it uses a means that bears a rational relation to its public purpose.\n   <em>\n    Boutin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11638095\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/591/711/#p716\">\n    591 N.W.2d at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no dispute that certain landlords do not accept vouchers. The HOME Line survey that the city council considered before passing the amendments found that only 23% of housing units that were affordable for voucher holders actually accept vouchers. Requiring landlords who currently do not accept vouchers to accept them (except where a hardship is shown)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   bears a rational relation to the amended ordinance's public purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders.

The amended ordinance does not create an unconstitutional presumption.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The city argues that the district court erred in concluding that the amended ordinance violates Fletcher's substantive-due-process rights by creating an irrefutable presumption that a landlord's refusal to accept vouchers is due to prejudice-based discrimination.

Fletcher did not argue in district court that the amended ordinance's failure to allow landlords to prove that they have legitimate business reasons for refusing to participate in the Section 8 program violates Fletcher's substantive-due-process rights.

The rational-basis test applicable to an equal-protection claim under the Minnesota Constitution consists of three prongs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (1) The distinctions which separate those included within the classification from those excluded must not be manifestly arbitrary or fanciful but must be genuine and substantial, thereby providing a natural and reasonable basis to justify legislation adapted to peculiar conditions and needs; (2) the classification must be genuine or relevant to the purpose of the law; that is there must be an evident connection between the distinctive needs peculiar to the class and the prescribed remedy; and (3) the purpose of the statute must be one that the state can legitimately attempt to achieve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9222225\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/683/294/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9222225\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/683/294/#p298\">\n    at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). We address each prong in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The distinctions that separate the classifications are genuine and substantial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The city argues that the distinctions between the exempted rental properties and other rental properties are substantial and genuinely related to its goal of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders. Fletcher argues that the differences are neither genuine nor substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The amended ordinance exempts four classes of rental properties: (1) a room in an owner-occupied single-family dwelling; (2) a single-family dwelling or single dwelling unit being rented for no more than 36 months by an owner who homesteaded the unit at the start of the rental period; (3) a unit of an owner-occupied duplex; and (4) a previously homesteaded property of an owner on active military duty. MCO \u00a7 139.30(b)(1)-(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The exempted properties all rent out only a single unit and comprise a small percentage of the housing market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the exempted properties are a small part of the housing market, they contribute less to the amended ordinance's purpose of increasing the availability of housing opportunities to voucher holders than larger units. Furthermore, the landlords of such properties are renting only a single unit in a dwelling currently or recently occupied by the owner. Such landlords may be less likely to have property managers, and the burden of complying with the requirements of the Section 8 housing program may be greater on them than the burden imposed on landlords renting out larger properties with multiple\n   units. As such, some of the exempted landlords may qualify for the amended ordinance's hardship defense, and exempting such landlords as a class, rather than requiring individual determinations as to each landlord, allows the city to focus its oversight resources on landlords who provide the vast majority of housing units in Minneapolis. The classifications have genuine and substantial distinctions relative to the public purpose of increasing housing availability for voucher holders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Fletcher argues that the differences between an owner-occupied duplex, an owner-occupied triplex, and a duplex not occupied by an owner are insubstantial. But an owner renting out two units of a triplex or both units of a duplex has twice as many tenants as an owner renting out one unit of a duplex. As the Minnesota Supreme Court has noted, \"[T]here are manifest differences between a duplex and a large multiunit complex, and the fact that these differences diminish when comparing triplexes to four-unit properties goes to where the line should be drawn. For constitutional purposes, the line drawn need not be perfect.\"\n   <em>\n    Hegenes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10676612\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/328/719/#p722\">\n    328 N.W.2d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding a tax classification distinguishing between rental properties of three units or less and those with four units or more). In deciding\n   <em>\n    Hegenes\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court quoted with approval Justice Holmes's observation that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   When a legal distinction is determined, as no one doubts that it may be, between night and day, childhood and maturity, or any other extremes, a point has to be fixed or a line has to be drawn, or gradually picked out by successive decisions, to mark where the change takes place. Looked at by itself without regard to the necessity behind it the line or point seems arbitrary. It might as well or nearly as well be a little more to one side or the other. But when it is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the Legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10676612\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/328/719/#p722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Louisville Gas &amp; Elec.

Although the line between an owner renting out one unit of a duplex and an owner renting out both units of a duplex or two units of a triplex may seem small, the distinction is real, and we cannot say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark. We therefore conclude that the distinctions that separate the classifications are genuine and substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The classifications are relevant to the purpose of the law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The city argues that the distinctions are relevant to the purpose of increasing housing opportunities for voucher holders because the exempted properties are limited to single units and comprise a small percentage of the housing units available in Minneapolis. Fletcher argues that if the city wishes to increase housing availability for voucher holders, the amended ordinance should not exempt any landlords. We are not persuaded by Fletcher's argument that the city may not exempt any landlords when attempting to increase housing opportunities for voucher holders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The rational-basis test does not require the city to show that the exempted units could not provide housing to voucher holders, only that there is an \"evident connection between\" the classifications and the purpose of the amended ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9222225\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/683/294/#p298\">\n    683 N.W.2d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Because there is an evident connection between increasing housing availability for voucher holders and exempting certain classes that provide a small portion of the\n   rental market, we conclude that this prong of the rational-basis test is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The purpose of the amended ordinance is one that the city can legitimately attempt to achieve.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The city argues that attempting to increase housing availability for voucher holders is a legitimate public purpose that the city may attempt to achieve. Fletcher argues that, under our decision in\n   <em>\n    Healthstar\n   </em>\n   , the city must also show that the means the city uses to achieve its purpose are legitimate. Fletcher contends that the city's means are not legitimate because the amended ordinance allows the exempted classes to continue to discriminate against voucher holders based on their status with regard to public assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Healthstar\n   </em>\n   , this court noted that some previous cases suggested such a requirement but that those cases dealt with means that were \"constitutionally suspect or involved invidious discrimination.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7066149\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/827/444/#p449\">\n    827 N.W.2d at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Minn. Stat. \u00a7 363A.09, subd. 1 (2018). The amended ordinance goes further than state law by prohibiting most landlords from discriminating on the basis of the requirements of a public-assistance program. Creating such a prohibition, while exempting a class of properties that supplies only a small portion of the housing market, is a legitimate means to increase housing opportunities for voucher holders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Because the amended ordinance meets all three prongs of the rational-basis test, we conclude that the amended ordinance does not facially violate Fletcher's equal-protection rights under the Minnesota Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. We need not decide whether the district court erred in concluding that Fletcher's other claims are moot.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   After granting Fletcher's motion for summary judgment on its substantive-due-process and equal-protection claims, the district court dismissed as moot Fletcher's claims that the amended ordinance is preempted by Minnesota law, that the amended ordinance constitutes an unlawful regulatory taking, and that the amended ordinance deprives Fletcher of its right to freedom of contract. Fletcher argues that the district court erred in concluding that its other claims are moot. Because we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Fletcher's substantive-due-process and equal-protection claims and in denying summary judgment to the city on those claims, and because we remand for the district court to consider Fletcher's other claims, we need not decide whether the district court erred in concluding that Fletcher's other claims are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The district court correctly concluded that the amendments do not implicate a fundamental right and Fletcher's constitutional claims are therefore subject to rational-basis analysis. But the district court erred by limiting its analysis of the amended ordinance's public purpose to reducing\n   prejudiced-based discrimination, and the district court erred in concluding that the amended ordinance facially violates Fletcher's substantive-due-process and equal-protection rights. We reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to Fletcher and its denial of summary judgment to the city on Fletcher's substantive-due-process and equal-protection claims, and remand for the district court to consider Fletcher's other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Respondents/cross-appellants Fletcher Properties, Inc., et al. include 54 companies owning multi-tenant properties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The district court record contains a significant amount of information about the rental market and the Section 8 program in Minneapolis, including the HOME Line survey.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    References in this opinion to the amended ordinance refer to the final version of Title 7 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances adopted in December 2017.

On appeal, the city again stated in its brief that \"the vast majority of licensed rental units in Minneapolis are situated in multi-housing properties with 3 or more units.\" Fletcher did not dispute this assertion either in district court or in its appellate brief. Uncontroverted statements in briefs may be taken as true.\n    <em>\n     Loth v.
