In 2007, Bergman petitioned a district court for expungement of his conviction. In an order issued on October 5, 2007, the court found that Bergman sought to expunge his conviction in order to possess a firearm for the purpose of hunting because federal law prohibited him from possessing a firearm. The court also found that \"the benefits to Bergman of granting his request for expungement [were] commensurate with and outweigh[ed] any disadvantage to the public from the elimination of such records and any burden on th[e] Court in issuing, enforcing and monitoring an expungement order.\" Concluding that Bergman did not qualify for statutory expungement, \"within [its] inherent authority,\" the court granted Bergman an \"expungement of judicial records, pursuant to\n  <em>\n   State v.

On December 18, 2017, Bergman applied to renew his carry permit. A newly elected county sheriff, respondent Isanti County Sheriff Christopher Caulk, denied Bergman's application because of his 1996 domestic-assault conviction. Bergman sought reconsideration by the sheriff, and the sheriff refused to reconsider his application. Bergman then petitioned the district court to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the sheriff to issue him a carry permit. In September 2018, the court denied Bergman's petition, concluding that he is disqualified from possessing a firearm because his domestic-assault conviction was not expunged under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Is a conviction expunged within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(ii) when a district court expunges the conviction solely on the basis of its inherent authority?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An appellate court \"review[s] de novo a decision on a writ of mandamus based solely on a legal determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Madison Equities, Inc. v.

No party appealed the order. From 2008 until the Isanti County Sheriff denied Bergman's renewal application, Bergman had a carry permit. In its September 2018 order denying Bergman's writ of mandamus to compel the sheriff to issue him a carry permit, from which this appeal is taken, the district court stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Bergman]'s conviction was not ordered removed from executive\n   <em>\n    or judicial branch records\n   </em>\n   ; the expungement exception under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(ii) therefore does not apply.

In\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Laskie\n   </em>\n   , when a defendant received an honorable discharge from probation under state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a defendant had his conviction \"set aside\" for purposes of possessing a firearm under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084768\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/1047/#p1051\">\n    258 F.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1051-53 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit reasoned that because the defendant received a court order stating that he was \"released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the crime of which\n   he has been convicted,\" and that based on that order the defendant \"reasonably could have concluded that he was released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from his crime, including the prohibition against firearms,\" his conviction had been expunged or set aside.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084768\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/1047/#p1051\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084768\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/1047/#p1051\">\n    at 1050, 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). Similarly here, Bergman received a court order in 2007 that expunged his domestic-assault conviction and thereafter consistently obtained a carry permit, reasonably leading him to believe that he was released from the prohibition against possession of a firearm. In Bergman's case, the expungement order specifically notes that his purpose in seeking the order was to facilitate his ability to \"possess a firearm ... because federal law prohibits possession of a firearm based on this arrest and sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The county sheriff argues that because Bergman did not qualify for statutory expungement under Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 609A.01 -.04, \"he remained ineligible to possess a firearm,\" notwithstanding the district court's 2007 expungement order. The county sheriff cites no authority to support this position, and we reject it. The fact that Minnesota law allows for both statutory expungement and expungement based on a district court's inherent authority does not lead us to conclude that expungement under a court's inherent authority does not constitute expungement within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that Bergman's conviction was expunged within the meaning of the federal law, and that Bergman therefore did not have a disqualifying conviction under federal law for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.713\">\n    Minn.

Therefore, because executive-branch records of Bergman's conviction remain unaffected by the 2007 district court order, the conviction was not \"expunged\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(B)(ii) (2018).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.P.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9008238\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/707/699/#p705\">\n    707 N.W.2d at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If an expungement order does not completely eliminate the public's access to the sealed records, it has not achieved its statutory purpose.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, all evidence of Bergman's prior conviction\n   <em>\n    was not erased as if it never occurred.\n   </em>\n   Even though the judicial records of Bergman's offense were sealed by court order in 2007, the offense still appeared on a background check in January 2018, which provided the basis for the Isanti County Sheriff's denial of Bergman's firearm permit application. If the offense were truly expunged, the conviction would not show up on a routine background check. To adopt the majority's reasoning and overlook the fact that evidence of Bergman's conviction is readily obtainable negates the legislative intent to deny permits to carry to individuals convicted of domestic violence crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Bergman was excluded from possessing a firearm under federal law due to his un-expunged misdemeanor domestic violence conviction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(9) (2018), I respectfully dissent on the basis that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.714\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 624.714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 2(b)(4)(ix) (2018), required the sheriff to deny Bergman's firearm permit application. Therefore, the district court's denial of Bergman's petition for a writ of mandamus directing the sheriff to issue the permit was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    In 2014, the legislature amended Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.02, subd. 3(a)(3), to allow for statutory expungement of a misdemeanor conviction. 2014 Minn. Laws ch. 246, \u00a7 6, at 812. Therefore, Bergman is at least eligible to petition for statutory expungement, which, if granted, would afford him the relief he seeks. While the 2014 amendments to section 609A.02 contained a subdivision 3(c), which excluded domestic assault from expungement under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609A.02, subd. 3(a)(3), by its own terms that section expired on July 15, 2015.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.714\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20624.714\">\n     at 814\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
