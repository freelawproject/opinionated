The Section 8 program subsidizes housing for families who meet certain income criteria. Scott County calculates Ali's income on an annual basis to determine her eligibility for the Section 8 program and the amount of benefits that she receives.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     Ali also participates in a state government program known as the Consumer Direct Community Support (CDCS) program. The Minnesota Department of Human Services administers the CDCS program. The program provides an annual budget to families to assist in keeping developmentally disabled family members in their homes rather than in institutions. Ali is eligible for the CDCS program because she has a developmentally disabled child. From September 1, 2017, through August 31, 2018, the CDCS program provided Ali's family $ 73,248.20 in benefits.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     Under the CDCS program, families are assigned a total lump sum budget. The family decides how to allocate the total budget. Ali allocated part of her CDCS benefits to pay herself for care that she provides for her child. Ali's budget called for her to be paid $ 16.75 per hour for 36.75 hours per week for her care for her child, for an annual total of $ 32,009.25. Ali only receives these payments if she files a timesheet tracking her weekly hours. Ali pays income taxes on these payments. Ali's budget allocated most of the remaining funds to pay for respite staff and support staff to come into the home for a total of 48 hours per week.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     In late 2017, Scott County determined that the money that Ali receives from the CDCS benefits for care that she personally provides for her child (the parent-allocated portion) must be included when calculating her family's annual income under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     for the purposes of the Section 8 program, but that the rest of the CDCS benefits are excluded under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (c)(16). Ali disagreed with Scott County's interpretation of the federal regulation, arguing that Scott County should exclude the entire CDCS benefits package when calculating her family's annual income, and she requested an informal hearing on the issue.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     During the hearing, Scott County and Ali each presented their arguments as to whether the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits constitutes annual income under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Following the informal hearing, the hearing officer contacted an individual who works with the CDCS program to obtain further clarification\n     on Ali's benefits. The individual told the hearing officer that Ali had multiple options for how to allocate the CDCS benefits and chose to keep a portion \"as a wage for taking care of her child.\"\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n     The hearing officer determined that the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits constitutes annual income under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     for purposes of the Section 8 program.

Paragraph (c) lists a number of exclusions. One of the exclusions is for \"[a]mounts paid by a State agency to a family with a member who has a developmental disability and is living at home\n     <em>\n      to offset the cost of services and equipment\n     </em>\n     needed to keep the developmentally disabled family member at home.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (c)(16) (emphasis added).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-26\">\n     The parties disagree as to what amounts paid by the CDCS program to a parent of a child with a developmental disability are properly excluded under the language of paragraph (c)(16). Scott County argues that the language does not exclude the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits because that money does not offset any \"cost\" of services or equipment. Ali counters that she incurs an opportunity cost by staying home to care for her child and that the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits should be excluded from the annual income as a \"cost\" under paragraph (c)(16). The parties' disagreement turns on the meaning of the word \"cost.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-27\">\n     Because the word \"cost\" is not defined in the regulation, we consult the dictionary definition to ascertain the ordinary meaning of the word.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Sorchaga v.

In both places, the word \"cost\" is used according to its ordinary meaning of an amount paid. Paragraph (c)(4) of the regulation, another exclusion, provides that \"[a]mounts received by the\n     family that are specifically for, or in reimbursement of, the cost of medical expenses for any family member\" are not included in annual income.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (c)(4). In this context, the word \"cost\" can only be understood to refer to a monetary amount paid for medical services. Similarly, paragraph (b)(6)(ii) uses \"cost\" to mean an amount of money paid, as in \"the actual cost of shelter and utilities\" for a welfare recipient.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b)(6)(ii).

Ali's proposed reading of the language would render the phrase \"to offset the cost of services and equipment\" superfluous and insignificant. If the regulation was meant to exclude all amounts provided by a state agency to help keep a developmentally disabled family member at home, as Ali suggests, it would not have been necessary to include the language \"to offset the cost of services and equipment.\" Instead, the regulation could have omitted that language and simply provided an exclusion for \"[a]mounts paid by a State agency to a family with a member who has a developmental disability and is living at home needed to keep the developmentally disabled family member at home.\" To give effect to the phrase \"to offset the cost of services and equipment,\" we must read the regulation as excluding only amounts that offset monetary costs that a family incurs.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-31\">\n     We conclude that the language of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (c)(16) is clear and unambiguous.

As discussed above, \"annual income\" includes all amounts of money that the family receives which are not specifically excluded in paragraph (c) of the regulation.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a). The regulation excludes \"[a]mounts paid by a state agency to a family ... to\n     <em>\n      offset the cost of services and equipment\n     </em>\n     needed to keep a developmentally disabled family member at home.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (c)(16) (emphasis added). The money that Ali receives from the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits is money paid by a state agency to keep a developmentally disabled family member at home but does not offset any \"cost\" of services or equipment. Ali receives the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits for care that she provides for her child. The family incurs no \"cost\" for those services. The funds do not \"offset\" any monetary expenditure or \"cost\" that the family incurs. Accordingly, Scott County did not err when it determined that the parent-allocated portion of the CDCS benefits is not excluded from the calculation of annual income under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.609\">\n      24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.609\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-33\">\n     <strong>\n      II.

But when the plain language of a regulation is clear, we may not \"disregard the letter of the law under the pretext of pursuing the spirit.\"\n     <em>\n      Reichmann\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6862884\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/867/502/#p506\">\n      867 N.W.2d at 511\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (quotation omitted). Furthermore, we note that under Ali's interpretation of paragraph (c)(16), a parent allocating a portion of the CDCS benefits to herself would have that entire amount excluded from her annual income, but a parent working outside the home who hires someone else to come into the home to care for her child would have her income included in annual income, even if that income was the same as the benefit that the first parent allocated to herself. Ali did not point to any evidence that the intent or spirit of the regulation is to treat these two circumstances differently even though, in both situations, the CDCS money is used to keep developmentally disabled family members in the home. Nor does the plain language of the regulation suggest such an intent.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
