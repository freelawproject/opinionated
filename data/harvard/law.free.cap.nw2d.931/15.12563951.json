The precise details of the parties' dealings remained unproved when the trial court dismissed the case. For purposes of this appeal, it will suffice to say that the disputes at issue involve the allegedly wrongful conduct of Hundley and counterdefendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   /third-party defendant, David Byker, in connection with the Costa Rican projects. The projects were developed, financed, and managed, directly or indirectly, through a slew of entities that were owned or controlled by Hundley, Byker, or both men together. The causes of action raised in Daystar's\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   17-count\n   amended complaint and Hundley's 12-count amended counterclaim and third-party complaint assert\n   various theories of liability against the parties for alleged breaches of contract, misrepresentations, acts of conversion, and other wrongful acts committed in the course of the parties' dealings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hundley moved for leave to file a second amended counterclaim and third-party complaint which, in pertinent part, sought to add eight additional third-party defendants, all of which were business entities formed under the laws of foreign jurisdictions (Florida, Nevada, and the Turks and Caicos Islands). At a hearing regarding the motion, Hundley raised the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction. Specifically, Hundley noted that under\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak v. American United Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1799978\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/293/449/\">\n    293 Mich. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n    292 N.W. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1940), the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the \"internal affairs of foreign entities.\" The trial court agreed and denied the motion for leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hundley then moved for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4) and (C)(8) as to all of the remaining claims. Hundley argued that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims because each claim involved the internal affairs of foreign corporate entities. The trial court entered an opinion and order granting Hundley's motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4) and dismissing all of the parties' claims. The trial court held that all of the claims fell within the internal-affairs doctrine and that it therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.

See MCL 600.3605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court in this case held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1799978\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/293/449/\">\n    293 Mich. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n    292 N.W. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, Daystar argues that the claims involved in this case are distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   because the causes of action in Daystar's amended complaint do not require the court to interfere with the internal operations of a corporate entity. Daystar further argues that the internal-affairs doctrine implicates choice-of-law concerns and that\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   should not be construed as precluding the circuit court's subject-matter jurisdiction in this case. We agree that the trial court's conclusion that\n   it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   , the defendant, a life insurance company organized under the laws of Indiana and authorized to do business in Michigan, issued a life insurance policy to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 450,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n    292 N.W. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff, as a policy holder, filed suit to enjoin the defendant's performance of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

While this statement may suggest a jurisdictional bar at first glance, it is noteworthy that the\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   opinion concluded that Michigan courts \"\n   <em>\n    will not\n   </em>\n   assume jurisdiction,\" rather than stating that the courts of this state\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   exercise jurisdiction under the circumstances described.

Obviously no definite rule of general application can be formulated by which it may be determined under what circumstances a court will assume jurisdiction of stockholders' suits relating to the conduct of internal affairs of foreign corporations. But it safely may be said that jurisdiction will be declined whenever considerations of convenience, efficiency, and justice point to the courts of the State of the domicile as appropriate tribunals for the determination of the particular case.

A court that has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter may, as a matter of discretion, decline to exercise its jurisdiction \"when convenience of parties and ends of justice would be better served if action were brought and tried in another forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

In that case, the plaintiff requested that the trial court enjoin the defendant's performance of a contract that it had entered into on the basis of a strategic business decision.\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1799978\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/293/449/\">\n    293 Mich. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n    292 N.W. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, granting the requested relief would have clearly required the trial court to interfere with and exercise control over the ongoing internal operation and management of the defendant corporation. The\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   Court noted in particular that \"[t]he suit at bar [was] not upon any pecuniary obligation due plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 453,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n    292 N.W. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   , the claims in this case do not require the trial court to become involved in the\n   management of the internal affairs of a foreign business entity. Daystar's numerous claims assert wrongful conduct by Hundley, resulting in losses suffered by Daystar's assignors for which Daystar seeks to recover money damages. Hundley's claims likewise concern Byker's past conduct, undertaken directly or through various business entities, and similarly seek monetary damages. Although Hundley, Byker, and their associated entities were formerly business partners and the transactions underlying the complaint arose during the course of that partnership, the parties do not ask the trial court to \" 'interfere with, or control by injunction or otherwise, the management of the internal affairs of a corporation organized under the laws of another State....' \"\n   <em>\n    Wojtczak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1799978\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/293/449/\">\n    293 Mich. at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.%20364\">\n    292 N.W. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"79882\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/288/123/\">\n    288 U.S. at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"79882\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/288/123/\">\n    53 S.Ct. 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
