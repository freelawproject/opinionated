He argued the amendments were invalid because Elizabeth lacked testamentary capacity and was unduly influenced by Judith who was a beneficiary and trustee. In particular, he asserted Elizabeth was unable to read either of the amended trusts when she signed them at ages 89 and 92, respectively, due to her poor eyesight. Thomas also alleged that Judith breached her fiduciary duties as trustee; however, Thomas did not name Judith as a party defendant or commence an action against her in her individual capacity.\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-25\">\n    <em>\n     Economopoulos v.

The district court dismissed the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. The district court then certified the following question to this Court on the remaining cause of action.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     <strong>\n      Whether South Dakota recognizes tortious interference with inheritance or expectancy of inheritance.\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     [\u00b62.] In answer to the certified question from the district court, we decline to recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance or expectancy of inheritance.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     <strong>\n      Background\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     [\u00b63.] Thomas's federal complaint alleges that Thomas and Judith's parents, Elizabeth and Willard Briggs, each created a revocable living trust and will in 1995. Thomas attached a copy of Willard's trust to the complaint showing he and Judith were treated equally as beneficiaries, and he alleges on information and belief that he was also named as an equal beneficiary in Elizabeth's trust and will. Further demonstrating Willard's and Elizabeth's benevolent intent toward their children, Thomas alleges his parents deeded land they owned in Illinois to Thomas and Judith in equal shares, subject to a retained life estate.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     [\u00b65.] In 1997, Willard passed away, and Elizabeth became trustee of Willard's trust. According to Thomas's federal complaint, as Elizabeth's health declined, Judith developed a confidential relationship with her and became her primary caretaker. Thomas further claims Judith began isolating Elizabeth from others and began to control Elizabeth's personal and financial decisions. He identified that he last spoke to Elizabeth in 2006.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     [\u00b66.] Thomas alleges Elizabeth amended her trust on January 16, 2009, despite her declining health, and removed Thomas as a beneficiary. She amended the trust a second time on January 3, 2012, removing Thomas's daughter as a beneficiary. Elizabeth passed away on July 16, 2013. Thomas claims that he was unable to participate in the funeral services because Judith failed to inform him of Elizabeth's passing. He further claims he first learned of Elizabeth's death on approximately August 15, 2013, when he received a letter from Elizabeth's attorney explaining that Elizabeth had died and prior to her death had disinherited him. This letter also provided Thomas with notice of the time allowed for commencing judicial proceedings under SDCL 55-4-57(a)(2).\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     [\u00b68.] After the circuit court dismissed Thomas's petition as untimely under SDCL 55-4-57(a), Thomas appealed to this Court. We affirmed, determining that the petition was time barred.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      In re Elizabeth A.

We also held that the circuit court lacked\n     <em>\n      in personam\n     </em>\n     jurisdiction to review the claim that Judith breached her fiduciary duty because Thomas did not commence the action against Judith in her individual capacity or move to join her as a party defendant.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 14. Thomas subsequently filed the complaint pending before the federal district court, alleging, among other claims, a claim for tortious interference with inheritance or expected inheritance.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     <strong>\n      Decision\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     [\u00b69.] Tortious interference with inheritance, or at least a version of it, was recognized in Georgia in 1915.\n     <em>\n      Mitchell v.

However, most cases discussing the tort arose after the Restatement (Second) of Torts recognized the cause of action in 1979. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774B (1979). The Restatement explains the tort as: \"One who by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20S.E.%201050\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Unlike probate challenges, the tort exists between the intended beneficiary and the alleged tortfeasor outside of the decedent's estate.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20S.E.%201050\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     cmt. c.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      In re Meyer's Estate\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4664655\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sd/69/339/#p341\">\n      69 S.D. 339\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 341,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4664655\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sd/69/339/#p341\">\n      10 N.W.2d 516\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 517 (1943) (indicating that a will dispute is in the interest of the estate).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     [\u00b610.] Generally, the tort requires proof of five elements: \"(1) the existence of an expectancy; (2) defendant's intentional interference with the expectancy; (3) conduct that is tortious in itself, such as fraud, duress, or undue influence; (4) a reasonable certainty that the expectancy would have been realized but for the interference; and (5) damages.\"\n     <em>\n      In re Estate of Ellis\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627479\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/236/45/\">\n      236 Ill.2d 45\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20Ill.%20Dec.%20678\">\n      337 Ill.Dec. 678\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20N.E.2d%20237\">\n      923 N.E.2d 237\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 241 (2009) ;\n     <em>\n      accord\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Firestone v.

As support, he cites cases from other jurisdictions that have adopted the tort. Judith maintains the tort is unnecessary. She argues that existing South Dakota law provides an adequate remedy for any of the wrongs asserted by Thomas. She also\n     directs this Court to numerous cases refusing to adopt the tort.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     [\u00b612.] The cases cited by Thomas and Judith reflect abundant law on the issue-including the reasons for and against adopting the tort.

We initially consider SDCL 43-3-6, which provides that \"[a] mere possibility, such as the expectancy of an heir apparent, is not deemed an interest of any kind.\" Under this long-standing statute, an heir has no interest in, or right to inherit, property of another prior to that person's death. Therefore, a testator may, up to the moment of death, revise and amend the disposition of the estate, and a prospective beneficiary's right to inherit depends on the decedent's final testamentary disposition in favor of that beneficiary. However, the statute does not directly address whether a third party's intentional and wrongful interference with an intended disposition may create a compensable loss in tort to an expectant heir or beneficiary as against the wrongdoer.\n     <footnotemark>\n      5\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     [\u00b623.] More importantly, for the purpose of resolving the question before this Court, we recognize that our Legislature has created a broad statutory scheme for the formulation and administration of wills and trusts.

As compared to the loss of an expected inheritance, the pursuit of a contractual or business relationship differs because it often involves upfront economic costs that could never be recouped absent a claim for wrongful interference with the prospective contractual relationship.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-43\">\n     [\u00b631.] Finally, Thomas contends we should adopt the tort of intentional interference with inheritance because the short statute of repose for challenging the validity of a trust under SDCL 55-4-57 makes it impractical, or impossible in some instances, to discover wrongful interference before the statutory period expires. SDCL 55-4-57 requires that a proceeding to challenge a trust be commenced within the shorter of either: (1) \"[o]ne year after the settlor's death\" or (2) sixty days after proper notice is given to the person seeking to challenge the trust.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-44\">\n     [\u00b632.] Admittedly, sixty days, even after notice, is an abbreviated period to commence an action challenging a trust. Nonetheless, we have recognized that this repose period is a public policy decision of the Legislature intended to effectuate \"the expeditious distribution of the trust property following the settlor's death.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Briggs I\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335190\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/898/465/\">\n      2017 S.D. 40\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , \u00b6 9,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12335190\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/898/465/\">\n      898 N.W.2d at 469\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Thomas suggests the tort action would not run afoul of this legislative policy because the claim would lie against the individual wrongdoer rather than the trust. However, his suggestion, alone, does not lead us to conclude that the expeditious administration of trusts prioritized by the Legislature would be unaffected by recognizing the tort. Most importantly, Thomas makes no claim that he was unable to challenge the trust in this case because of the shortened repose period, and he only hypothesizes that a future litigant could be denied a remedy because of the repose period.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-45\">\n     [\u00b633.] Having considered the decisions from other jurisdictions and other policy considerations under existing law in this State, we are not persuaded to adopt a cause of action for intentional interference with inheritance and expand tort liability to the already existing panoply of remedies available to estate litigants in South Dakota. South Dakota law provides redress for the allegations asserted by Thomas in his federal complaint, and we believe it would be improvident to expand tort liability without a clear demonstration that a litigant has no adequate remedy at law.
