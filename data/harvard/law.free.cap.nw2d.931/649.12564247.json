In 2018, appellant moved for a new trial and asked the district court to appoint an attorney to represent him in the proceedings on his motion. As support for his motion, appellant asserted that his court-appointed attorney in the commitment proceedings was under the influence of a mood-altering substance and provided ineffective assistance of counsel as a result. The district court denied appellant's request for court-appointed counsel, as well as his motion for a new trial. Because Johnson did not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in the proceedings on his motion, and because the district court did not abuse its\n   discretion by denying the motion both as untimely and on the merits, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2011, respondent Freeborn County petitioned for indeterminate commitment of appellant Jeremy David Johnson as an SDP and an SPP. The district court appointed counsel to represent Johnson in the commitment proceedings and held a two-day trial on the county's petition in November 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March 2012, the district court indeterminately committed Johnson as an SDP and an SPP under Minn.

Johnson's motion papers stated that \"the newly discovered evidence of his attorney ... having been criminally charged in Blue Earth County District court [with] several Felonies, including but not limited to the sale of methamphetamine, marijuana and other drugs,\" is \"relevant, admissible, and likely to have an effect on the result of [his] civil commitment proceedings.\" Johnson asserted that his \"attorney was under the influence of a mood altering substance, and therefore could not ... do his duty as an attorney.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court held a hearing on Johnson's motion. Johnson appeared pro se and asked the district court to appoint an attorney to represent him in the proceedings. The county had previously indicated to the district court that it opposed appointment of counsel, arguing that because \"a Rule 60.02 motion is not a proceeding under the commitment act,\" Johnson was not entitled to court-appointed counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Civil Commitment of Moen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7055211\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/837/40/#p43\">\n    837 N.W.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43, 50-51, 50 n.2 (Minn.

As to the merits, the district court reasoned that Johnson failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that his former attorney was under the influence of chemicals during the commitment proceedings, that the record indicated that his former attorney's performance did not fall below an objective level of competence, that the evidence established that Johnson met the criteria for commitment, and that it is unlikely that a different strategy by Johnson's former attorney would have changed the result.

He argues that \"the due process clause of the constitution sometimes requires that an indigent respondent must be granted a court-appointed attorney in civil proceedings which affect important rights\" and that \"courts have widely recognized a constitutional right to court-appointed counsel in civil commitment proceedings.\" He further argues that \"courts have recognized the constitutional necessity of providing court-appointed counsel to committed persons even during various ancillary points in the proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Whether the district court violated a constitutional right to court-appointed counsel is an issue of law reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In doing so we noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Minnesota Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment confers a right to the effective assistance of counsel on a person who is the subject of a civil-commitment proceeding.

Johnson does not argue that his motion was timely. Instead, he argues that \"there is no way he could have filed the motion within 30 days, because he did not know at the time of his civil commitment [that] his attorney ... was using/selling drugs\" and did not become \"aware of this issue\" until February 2018. Johnson's argument is unavailing because the time limit in rule 59.03 is absolute and the district court could not excuse Johnson's noncompliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Civ.

We also note that some of Johnson's assertions are refuted by the record. For example, he argues that his court-appointed attorney\n   \"failed to object to or challenge ... the reports of both prepetition examiners as evidence\" and that \"[t]he State knew at the time of petition that one Court appointed examiner supported commitment and one did not.\" In fact, exhibits of record indicate that only one prepetition report was admitted as evidence at the trial and that both court-appointed examiners recommended commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, Johnson fails to provide record support for many of his assertions. For example, we cannot determine whether Johnson's assertions regarding his attorney's performance at the commitment trial are accurate because Johnson did not provide this court a transcript of the trial. It is an appellant's burden to provide any transcript necessary for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Custom Farm Servs., Inc. v.

The crux of Johnson's claim is that his court-appointed attorney's \"ineffective counsel was likely caused by his addiction to drugs and alcohol.\" Yet as the district court reasoned, Johnson has not provided any evidence that his attorney was using drugs or alcohol at the time of the 2011 commitment proceedings. Instead, Johnson points to his attorney's 2018 criminal charges and speculates that \"if [his attorney] was high on narcotics during the civil commitment proceeding ..., [his attorney] would not have been effective enough to raise issues in [his] best interest or rebut the state's allegations.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A party claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must provide adequate evidentiary and factual support for the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

But he does not provide any factual context for those assertions. Moreover, our ability to assess whether Johnson's assertions of prejudice have merit is compromised by his failure to provide a trial transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Once again, Johnson had the burden to provide adequate support for his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim and to provide a transcript that facilitates review of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10659490\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/398/558/#p563\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 563 ;\n   <em>\n    Custom Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"892086\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/306/571/\">\n    238 N.W.2d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He did neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The district court noted that Johnson's attorney in the underlying commitment proceeding \"was a vigorous advocate\" on his behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court explained that, based on the record evidence, including the opinions of both examiners supporting commitment, \"it was extremely unlikely that Johnson would have prevailed on the merits by objecting to witnesses or with different or additional cross-examination of the [county's] witnesses.\" Exhibits of record, including the prepetition report, the court-appointed examiners' reports, past psychosexual evaluations, and records regarding Johnson's past criminal offenses, support the district court's reasoning. Thus, Johnson has provided no basis to conclude that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In his reply brief, Johnson argues, \"In this case the interest[s] of justice favor (1) reserving decision on the portion of [his] motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, and (2) requiring [him to] submit an amended motion and affidavit in support of that claim.\" He also argues that \"[f]urther development of the record is ... necessary for this court to fully address\" his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. According to Johnson, this court \"must conclude that [he] is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and reverse and remand for the district court to conduct such a hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In requesting another opportunity to prove his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Johnson cites cases regarding postconviction relief. Because Johnson does not seek relief from a conviction, Minnesota's postconviction jurisprudence is inapplicable and does not provide a basis for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20590.01\">\n    Minn.

Johnson did not request an evidentiary hearing or argue that he needed an evidentiary hearing to establish factual support for his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Johnson has not identified, and we do not discern, a basis to remand this case for that purpose. And because Johnson failed to satisfy both the performance and prejudice factors under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , the district court did not err by denying his request for a new trial on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because the district court did not err by denying Johnson's request for court-appointed counsel in the proceedings on his motion for a new trial, or by denying that motion both as untimely and on the merits, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Although the relevant commitment statute refers to a \"hearing on the commitment petition,\" and not a \"trial,\" we refer to the two-day hearing as a trial, consistent with the parties' briefs, as well as the rules and caselaw discussed below.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Minn.
