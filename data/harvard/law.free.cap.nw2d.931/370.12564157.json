Respondent shall provide the Director with the names of four attorneys who have agreed to be nominated as respondent's supervisor within 2 weeks from the date the court's order imposing discipline is filed. If, after diligent effort, respondent is unable to locate a supervisor acceptable to the Director, the Director shall seek to appoint a supervisor. Until a supervisor has signed a consent to supervise, respondent shall on the first day of each month provide the Director with an inventory of active client files as described in paragraph (d) below.

With respect to each active file, the inventory shall disclose the client name, type of representation, date\n   opened, most recent activity, next anticipated action, and anticipated closing date. Respondent's supervisor shall file written reports with the Director at least quarterly, or at such more frequent intervals as the Director may reasonably request; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (e) Respondent shall initiate and maintain office procedures that ensure prompt responses to correspondence, telephone calls, and other important communications from clients, courts, and other persons interested in matters that respondent is handling, and that ensure that respondent regularly reviews each and every file and completes legal matters on a timely basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. By March 26, 2020, respondent shall comply with Rule 18(e)(3), Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR), by filing with the Clerk of the Appellate Courts and serving upon the Director proof of respondent's successful completion of the written examination required for admission to the practice of law by the State Board of Law Examiners on the subject of professional responsibility. Failure to do so shall result in automatic suspension pending proof of successful completion of the examination, under Rule 18(e)(3), RLPR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
