The circuit court's finding that the defendant had approximately 38 different convictions in 10 years, a characterization the Court of Appeals seemingly accepted, is not supported by the record. Accordingly, the circuit court sentenced the defendant on the basis of inaccurate information, and resentencing\n   is required. See\n   <em>\n    People v.

Although I concur in the majority's order of remand, I would not order that the sentencing proceedings on remand be conducted before a different judge.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
