The Petranos, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>removed the case to federal district court. They argued in the district court that the foreclosure action arose under federal law because the mortgage in question had to comply with the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the Americans with Disabilities Act governed the conveyance of the land to the Petranos\u2019 \u201cSpecial Needs Trusts,\u201d and because the property was subject to a railroad easement. The district court determined that those arguments were meritless and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. It remanded the case to state court. The Petranos filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing in part that removal was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443, and the district court denied that motion. This is the Petranos\u2019 appeal of the remand order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The Petranos argue that bringing a state-court action constituted a denial of Day-Petrano\u2019s race-based civil rights, making removal proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. To make their argument, they rely on what may be charitably described as fanciful racial theories. They claim that autism \u201cis a Jewish race-based disability\u201d and that being autistic means a person is \u201ca Native American Indian of the Jewish red hair, blue eye race.\u201d On that basis, they argue, Baylor\u2019s state-court suit violated Day-Petrano\u2019s \u201cAutistic Jew Native American aboriginal rights\u201d as conferred by the Nonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177. They contend that they have satisfied the two-part test for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1) because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 qualifies as a law providing specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality, and the Supreme Court has held that Jews and Native Americans are both \u201crace[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court has removal jurisdiction. <em>Henson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>261 F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir.2001). Because Mr. Petrano was an attorney licensed to practice law in Florida at the time the Petranos filed their brief, we do not give the brief the liberal construction we would otherwise grant to <em>pro se </em>litigants\u2019 papers. <em>See Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1194 n. 1 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Under \u00a7 1443(1), a defendant may remove to a federal district court a civil action initiated in state court if the action is \u201c[ajgainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce\u201d in state court \u201ca right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1). Defendants must show both that the right on which they rely \u201carises under a federal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality\u201d and that they have been denied or cannot enforce that right in state court. <em>Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1295 (11th Cir.2001). To meet the requirements of the second prong, the denial of civil rights generally must be \u201cmanifest in a formal expression of state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296 (quotation omitted). Under a narrow exception to this rule, \u201cif the very act of bringing the state court proceedings will constitute a denial of the rights conferred by the federal statute,\u201d removal under \u00a7 1443(1) is proper, even where the action is premised upon a facially neutral state law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The Petranos have not m\u00e9t either prong of that test. First, their brief merely mentions that \u00a7 1981 is a \u201cfederal law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality,\u201d and they point out that Jews and Native Americans are \u201crace[s].\u201d But they offer no argument to connect \u00a7 1981 and the rights they claim to be asserting under the Nonintercourse Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their bare statement that \u00a7 1981 is a statute of 'the right type is not an argument. <em>See Cont\u2019l Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>927 F.2d 1198, 1199 (11th Cir.1991) (holding that appellant had waived a claim when it made a \u201csimple contention that California law controls\u201d without \u201cpresenting] an argument based on California law\u201d); Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(4) (\u201cThe argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, <em>and the reasons therefor, </em>with citations to the authorities, statutes, <em>and parts \u25a0of the record relied on.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Second, the Petranos have not shown how a denial of their \u201cspecific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality\u201d is \u201cmanifest in a formal expression of state law\u201d or that the very act of bringing a foreclosure suit \u201cwill constitute a denial of the rights conferred by [a] federal statute.\u201d <em>See Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295-96 (quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1443(1). In particular, their brief argument cites no binding legal authority supporting their assertion that autism is protected under federal laws addressing <em>racial </em>equality. <em>See Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295. The Petra-nos make a conclusory argument that \u201cthe very act of bringing [Day-Petrano] to trial in the state court violates the Noninter-course Act,\u201d because \u201con the FACTS of this case, [she] has aboriginal rights of title\u201d to the land. But their brief makes no legally cognizable argument that Day-Petrano holds any such rights. To the extent we are able to discern a relevant argument in the Petranos\u2019 brief,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is that Day-Petrano\u2019s purported Native American ancestry (specifically Melungeon, Lumbee, and Cherokee) gives her \u201caboriginal rights of title\u201d over the land at issue. But the Petranos\u2019 own cited authorities say that land belonged to different tribes entirely\u2014 namely, the \u201cCreek and Seminole\u201d tribes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>See United States v. Arredondo, </em>31 U.S. 691, 691-92, 6 Pet. 691, 8 L.Ed. 547 (1832). They further argue that Day-Petrano\u2019s autism, red hair, and blue eyes are evidence that she is a member of an unidentified \u201cNative American Jewish\u201d tribe. But they do not specify how that ancestry \u2014 even if we took it as proven \u2014 would entitle her to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">. On June 8, 2013, we dismissed the Petra-nos\u2019 appeal in part for lack of jurisdiction, and allowed it to proceed only to the extent that it challenged the district court\u2019s implicit determination that removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 was improper. On August 9, 2013, we denied their motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on the ground that the appeal lacked legal and factual merit and was therefore frivolous. We granted the Petranos two extensions of time to file their brief, and then on January 24, 2014, we dismissed the appeal for want of prosecution because the Petranos had failed to file a brief within that twice-extended time. On May 22, 2014, we granted the Pe-tranos\u2019 motion to reinstate the appeal. Ms. Baylor did not file a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b764-13\">.In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. We surmise that the Petranos may instead have meant to tie those rights to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, but regardless of whether the assertion of rights is under \u00a7 1981 or \u00a7 1982, it fails for lack of argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">. Indeed, even if this theory were convincing, it is abandoned. \"Abandonment of a claim or issue can ... occur when ... passing references to it are made in the \u2018statement of the case\u2019 or \u2018summary of the argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sapup-po v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 681 (11th Cir.2014). The Petranos\u2019 inheritance-based theory is scattered throughout their brief's statement of the case and statement of facts, and mentioned only in the most conclusory fashion possible (\"on the FACTS of this case, [she] has aboriginal rights of title\u201d) in the argument section. <em>See id.; </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
