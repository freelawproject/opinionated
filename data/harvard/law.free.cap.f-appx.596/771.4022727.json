Briefly stated, Sookhoo argues in his petition for review that (1) the BIA abused its discretion by dismissing his appeal without considering his prior requests for a continuance; and (2) the BIA\u2019s dismissal order was insufficiently detailed to show that his case was fully and properly reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We lack jurisdiction to consider claims that were not raised before the BIA. <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>and we review factual determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350-51; <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). Under the substantial evidence test, we draw every reasonable inference from the evidence in favor of the decision; and we reverse a finding of fact only if the record compels reversal. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. That evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Id. </em>We may not review discretionary decisions, but we may review nondiscretionary legal decisions that pertain to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 321 </em>F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">\u201c[A] decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law....\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(b)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C). Pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), an immigrant is inadmissible if, at the time of application for admission, he \u201cis not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, ... or other valid entry document required by this Act,\u201d along with an accepted document of identity and nationality. INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). In removal proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) first bears the burden of proving alienage. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(c). Then, the alien bears the burden of (a) establishing that he is \u201cclearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted\u201d and is \u201cnot inadmissible under [INA \u00a7 212],\u201d or (b) showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that he is lawfully present in the United States pursuant to a prior admission. INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A)-(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A)-(B); <em>see Ganes v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1345-46 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">Parole is not admission. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(a)(13)(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(B); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>INA \u00a7 212(d)(5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5); <em>Leng May Ma v. Barber, </em>357 U.S. 185, 190, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 1075, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1958) (\u201cThe parole of aliens seeking admission is simply a device through which needless confinement is avoided while administrative proceedings are conducted. It was never intended to affect an alien\u2019s status____\u201d). When the purposes of the parole have been served, the alien returns to the status he had when he was paroled. INA \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(e)(2)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Because alienage was established by Sookhoo\u2019s consistent admissions that he was a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, he bore the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that (1) he was, for his most recent entry in July 2006, \u201cclearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted\u201d and not inadmissible; or (2) he is lawfully present in the United States pursuant to a prior admission. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A)-(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A)-(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(c). Here, the BIA\u2019s determination that Sook-hoo was an arriving alien and was removable \u2014 as was charged in the notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) \u2014 is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350-51. The record evidence shows that Sookhoo was paroled in July 2006 to pursue adjustment of status from USCIS, and that USCIS denied him adjustment of status in October 2009. While Sookhod\u2019s wife filed two 1-130 petitions for an alien relative, she withdrew the first petition; and the second was denied. Because the purpose (to pursue an adjustment) for Sookhoo\u2019s parole had been completed, he reverted back to his original status: an arriving alien without an appropriate entry document, not entitled to be admitted, and removable as charged in the NTA. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(d)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.5(e)(2)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Sookhoo argues that he is nonetheless entitled to admission based on a pending \u201cCSS/Newman (LULAC) Settlement Agreements\u201d or \u201cLULAC/LIFE program\u201d application.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But no evidence is in the record that he filed such an application or would have been eligible for such relief. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A)-(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A)-(B) (stating that it is the alien\u2019s burden to establish clearly and beyond doubt that he is entitled to admission). To the extent that Sookhoo\u2019s arguments on appeal rely on his denial of the other NTA charges, they are meritless. First, to the extent that Sookhoo continues to argue that he entered the United States in July 2006 pursuant to a grant of advance parole, he has submitted no evidence in support of the assertion. The record thus does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s determination that Sookhoo was paroled in July 2006 for the purpose of completing his application for adjustment of status. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">As for Sookhoo\u2019s remaining arguments, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a continuance, and the BIA\u2019s opinion is adequate to show that Sookhoo\u2019s case was fully and properly reviewed. Because Sookhoo did not establish that he had been granted advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>parole, the IJ \u2014 and therefore the BIA\u2014 lacked jurisdiction over USCIS\u2019s denial of Sookhoo\u2019s adjustment of status application. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(ii). Moreover, we lack jurisdiction to consider Sookhoo\u2019s claims about medical issues, which he did not raise before the BIA. <em>See Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1323. Accordingly, we deny Sook-hoo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\"> The claim refers to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (the \"Reform Act\u201d); subsequent litigation involving Catholic Social Services (\"CSS\u201d) and the League of United Latin American Citizens (\"LULAC\u201d), the latter of which is sometimes referred to as the \"Newman\u201d legalization case; and the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act Amendments of 2000 (\"LIFE Act Amendments\u201d). <em>See, e.g., </em>Reform Act, Pub.L.
