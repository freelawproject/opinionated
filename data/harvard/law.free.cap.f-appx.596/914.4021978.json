Cooper, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012), which alleged that his constitutional right to trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment was violated because he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to properly advise him about the government\u2019s pre-trial plea offer. After review of the record and briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"APm\">A. 1997 Conviction and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b936-26\">In February 1997, in a superseding indictment, a federal grand jury charged Wert with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court appointed attorney Charles L. Handlin III to represent Wert. Prior to trial, the government filed a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notice, notifying Wert that it would seek to enhance his sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1) based on two prior felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>During the 14-day jury trial, the evidence showed that Wert participated in a large drug organization operating in Florida and Texas that, from early 1992 through December 1996, distributed an estimated 20,000 pounds of marijuana and at least 300 kilograms of cocaine. The evidence also showed that, at the direction of the organization\u2019s leader, Wert murdered a co-conspirator, Eloy Benevides, in October 1993. In April 1997, the jury found Wert guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a guidelines range of life imprisonment based on a total offense level of 43 and criminal history category of IV. In particular, Wert received the maximum base offense level possible under the guidelines \u2014 43\u2014based on the killing of Benevides, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(d)(1), which required the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1 because a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder. In any event, Wert also faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment based on his two prior felony drug convictions under \u00a7 841(b)(1). In July 1997, pursuant to the then-mandatory guidelines, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s recommendations and sentenced Wert to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">B. 1997-1998 Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Wert appealed his conviction to this Court. On July 22, 1998, we affirmed, rejecting Wert\u2019s sole claim that the district court abused its discretion in admitting at trial evidence of Benevides\u2019s murder. <em>United States v. Ridgeway, </em>152 F.3d 934 (11th Cir.1998) (table).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wert did not seek a writ of <em>certiorari </em>in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">C. 2012 \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">In January 2012, more than 13 years after his conviction became final, Wert filed <em>pro se </em>the instant \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. In his motion, Wert alleged three grounds for relief: (1) he received ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel Handlin failed to properly advise him concerning a plea offer that would have resulted in a lower sentence; (2) his sentence was unlawfully enhanced under \u00a7 841(b)(1) based on his prior drug convictions; and (3) his sentence was unlawfully enhanced based on Benevides\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">Following a response by the government, the district court dismissed the second and third claims as untimely filed 13 years later. As to the first claim of ineffective trial counsel as to the alleged plea offer, the district court appointed Wert counsel and allowed him the opportunity to file an amended ineffective assistance claim addressing the timeliness of that claim given <em>Lafler, </em>566 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">Through counsel, Wert filed an amended \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that <em>Lafler </em>rendered his \u00a7 2255 motion timely because, in that case, the Supreme Court had newly recognized a right retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. As to the merits of his ineffective assistance claim under <em>Lafler, </em>Wert attached an affidavit in which he stated that, prior to trial, the government had indicated that it would \u201cguarantee\u201d him a sentence of less than life imprisonment if he provided informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>tion about three homicides. However, Wert alleged, trial counsel Handlin incorrectly advised him that he would not be subject to a life sentence, and Wert therefore rejected the government\u2019s offer and proceeded to trial. Wert alleged that, following his conviction, he was \u201cambushed\u201d with a life sentence at sentencing, and that he would have accepted the government\u2019s offer if he had known that he faced a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">After a response by the government, the district court denied Wert\u2019s amended \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that <em>Lafler </em>did not newly recognize a right and is not retroactively applicable in any event. Wert timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We granted Wert\u2019s motion for a certif\u00ed-cate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">Whether <em>Lafler v. Cooper, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1376 (2012) applies retroactively to cases on collateral review; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-7\">If so, whether Mr. Wert\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate was timely filed within one year of that decision, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 2255(f)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal issue of whether a \u00a7 2255 motion is time-barred. <em>Murphy v. United States, </em>634 F.3d 1303, 1306 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">A. Statute of Limitations for \u00a7 2255 Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). Relevant here, the one-year statute of limitations begins to run from the latest of either: \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f)(1), or \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">As to \u00a7 2255(f)(1), a conviction ordinarily becomes final after a direct appeal when the Supreme Court denies <em>certiorari </em>or when the 90-day period for filing a petition for <em>certiorari </em>expires. <em>See Close v. United States, </em>336 F.3d 1283, 1284-85 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">As to \u00a7 2255(f)(3), any court may determine whether a Supreme Court decision is retroactively applicable for the purposes of that provision. <em>See Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2004). In considering whether a Supreme Court decision newly recognized a right that is retroactively applicable, we apply the rubric developed in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). <em>Howard v. United States, </em>374 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">\u201cUnder <em>Teague, </em>a court must first answer whether the Supreme Court decision in question announced a new rule.\u201d <em>Figuereo-Sanchez v. United States, </em>678 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2012). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Teague, </em>\u201ca case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government. To put it differently, a case announces a new rule if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d 489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. at 1070 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">If we conclude that the Supreme Court decision announced a new rule, we then must determine whether the new rule applies retroactively. New substantive rules generally apply retroactively, while new rules of criminal procedure are generally not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522-23, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). An exception to the general rule of non-retroactivity for new rules of criminal procedure exists for \u201cwatershed\u201d rules that \u201crequire[ ] the observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311, 109 S.Ct. at 1076 (quotations and alteration omitted); <em>see also Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 355, 124 S.Ct. at 2524.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">B. The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in <em>La\u00f1er</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">In <em>Lafler, </em>the Supreme Court clarified that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), extends to the negotiation and consideration of plea offers that are rejected. <em>See Lafler, </em>566 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 1385. The Supreme Court held that, in order to show prejudice under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-part test, a defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that: (1) he would have accepted a plea offer but for counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance; and (2) the plea would have resulted in a lesser charge or a lower sentence. <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 1391.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">Subsequently, in <em>In re Perez, </em>682 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.2012), this Court considered whether <em>Lafler </em>announced a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, for purposes of filing a second or successive motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255(h)(2). This Court held that <em>Lafler </em>did not announce a new rule of constitutional law because it merely was an application of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as defined in <em>Strickland, </em>to a specific factual context. <em>Perez, </em>682 F.3d at 932. This Court further reasoned that the Supreme Court had long recognized that <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-part standard applied to ineffective assistance claims arising out of the plea process. <em>Id. </em>Applying <em>Teague, </em>this Court concluded that <em>Lafler </em>did not break new ground or impose new obligations on either the State or federal government, and its holding was dictated by <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">C. Timeliness of Wert\u2019s \u00a7 2255 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">In this case, as an initial matter, Wert\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely with respect to the 1998 date on which his judgment of conviction became final. Specifically, his conviction became final when the time for seeking <em>certiorari </em>review of the decision in his direct appeal expired on October 20, 1998. <em>See Close, </em>336 F.3d at 1284-85. Thus, Wert was required to file a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate by October 20, 1999, such that his 2012 motion was untimely by more than 12 years. Therefore, Wert\u2019s \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>motion is timely only if he can demonstrate that it was filed within one year of a Supreme Court decision newly recognizing a right-that is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Based on our precedent in <em>Perez, </em>we conclude that <em>Lafler </em>did not newly recognize a right for purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(3). <em>See Perez, </em>682 F.3d at 932-33. Although <em>Perez </em>was decided in the context of an application for a successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, the <em>Teague </em>analysis we applied in <em>Perez </em>\u2014 to determine whether <em>Lafler </em>announced a new rule of constitutional law\u2014 is the same analysis we apply to determine whether <em>Lafler </em>newly recognized a right for purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(3). <em>Compare id., with Figuereo-Sanchez, </em>678 F.3d at 1207, <em>and Howard, </em>374 F.3d at 1073-74. Because <em>Lafler </em>merely was an application of the established Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as defined in <em>Strickland, </em>to a specific factual context, and did not break new ground or impose new obligations on the government, we cannot say that it involved a newly recognized right within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(f)(3). <em>See Perez, </em>682 F.3d at 932-33. As we conclude that <em>Lafler </em>did not involve a newly recognized right, we do not consider whether <em>Lafler </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review or whether Wert\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was timely filed within one year of the <em>Lafler </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">For the above reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wert\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\">. While his direct appeal was pending, Wert filed <em>pro se </em>a six-page letter to the district court requesting removal of attorney Handlin as counsel and appointment of new counsel, alleging various reasons that he was dissatisfied with Handlin's representation. Notably, Wert did not mention any plea negotiations, any desire to have pled guilty, or any complaint with having gone to trial. A magistrate judge denied the motion because the district court was divested of jurisdiction over the matter due to Wert\u2019s pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\">. We recognize that the COA in this case, granted on two procedural issues, arguably is defective in that it does not also identify the underlying constitutional issue or issues for which the movant has satisfied the standard of making \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), (c)(3); <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132 (11th Cir.2014). However, the government has not raised the issue of a defective COA. Although we could <em>sua sponte </em>raise the defective COA issue, we exercise our discretion not to do so because the <em>Lafler </em>retroactivity issue involves a constitutional dimension and requires us to answer two underlying, subsidiary issues of whether <em>Lafler </em>recognized a new constitutional rule involving the Sixth Amendment right to counsel or merely applied the existing Sixth Amendment constitutional rule already announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to a specific set of facts involving plea offers (as opposed to limiting that Sixth Amendment right to trial proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
