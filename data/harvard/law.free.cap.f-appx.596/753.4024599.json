For the reasons that follow, and after careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">In October 2013, Mr. Rodriguez and a co-defendant were indicted on one count each of, while operating a vessel, knowingly failing to obey an order by a Federal law enforcement officer to heave to that vessel, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2237(a)(1). Both pled not guilty, and the government tried the cases together. The following testimony was adduced at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">On the night of September 28, 2013, a Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) Customs and Border Protection officer on a border security patrol airplane spotted two jet skis without navigation lights about 30 nautical miles off the coast of Florida. Because the jet skis were not moving, the officer thought the operators to be in\u2019 distress. The officer called the United States Coast Guard and relayed the jet skis\u2019 position. Then, the jet skis began to move, so the officer directed the Coast Guard to pursue them.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">Coast Guard Lieutenant Junior Grade James Heuser was aboard the Coast Guard cutter that received the DHS officer\u2019s call. The cutter moved toward the jet skis and, when it was about two miles away, activated its blue law-enforcement lights. Rather than stopping, however, Mr. Rodriguez and his co-defendant rode their jet skis away from the cutter. Coast Guard officers aboard the cutter then de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ployed a 25-foot \u201csmall boat\u201d to pursue the jet skis. Because the jet skis had fled when the cutter activated its blue lights, the officers turned off the lights on both' boats until the small boat came close enough to the jet skis to see their wakes. When the small boat activated its blue law-enforcement lights, Lieutenant Heuser used a loud hailer to tell Mr. Rodriguez and his co-defendant to \u201cgo over,\u201d both in English and Spanish. Again, the jet skis did not stop. They zig-zagged erratically at speeds of more than 30 miles per hour while Lieutenant Heuser and other Coast Guard officers aboard the small boat repeated the call, \u201cstop your vessel, U.S. Coast Guard,\u201d in English and Spanish and shone a light on the hull of the boat to illuminate the Coast Guard insignia.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">After about three to five minutes of pursuit by the small boat, Mr. Rodriguez and his co-defendant stopped their jet skis. When Coast Guard officers tied the jet skis to the small boat, Mr. Rodriguez admitted he saw the blue lights and heard the boat but thought the boat carried Cuban military, whom Mr. Rodriguez said had fired on the jet skis earlier in the evening. He told Lieutenant Heuser that he and his co-defendant were going camping in the Dry Tortugas but got lost. There was no camping gear aboard the jet skis. Mr. Rodriguez said it had fallen off during their flight from Cuban military fire. Mr. Rodriguez also said he and his co-defendant were lobster fishing, but there was no lobster-fishing equipment on board either jet ski. Lieutenant Heuser did find on each jet ski two extra life jackets and two extra five-gallon cans of fuel. Coast Guard officers also found a satellite phone on Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s jet ski. Mr. Rodriguez stated that he had not used the phone to call for help because it was a \u201cpiece of junk,\u201d but after the officers requested and received permission to look at the phone, Mr. Rodriguez admitted he had placed calls on it that evening. Although Mr. Rodriguez told Lieutenant Heuser that the calls were placed to Colombia, in fact they had been placed to locations in Cuba.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The jury found Mr. Rodriguez guilty on the count charged in the indictment. The probation office prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculating a base offense level of ten, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4. With no adjustments to that level, and a criminal history category of III, the PSI set Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s guidelines range at 10 to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the government requested a 16-month sentence, citing the need to deter the dangerous situation Mr. Rodriguez created for Coast Guard officers. The district court, after stating that he had considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the PSI, and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), imposed a 16-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">This is Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">When \u201cthe master, operator, or person in charge of a vessel of the United States, or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, ... knowingly fail[s] to. obey an order by an authorized Federal law enforcement officer to heave to that vessel,\u201d that offense is punishable by law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2237(a)(1). To sustain a conviction for failure to heave to, the government bears the burden of proving that: (1) the defendant was the master, operator, or person in charge of a vessel that (2) knowingly (3) failed to obey (4) an order by a Federal law enforcement officer to heave to that vessel. <em>See id. </em>Mr. Rodriguez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him on the second and fourth of these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>\u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and resolving all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Haile, </em>685 F.3d 1211, 1219 (11th Cir.2012). Mr. Rodriguez first contends that the government set forth insufficient evidence establishing he knew the Coast Guard was ordering him to heave to, emphasizing that the Coast Guard\u2019s small boat did not turn on its blue lights until it was upon the jet skis and noting that he stopped his jet ski shortly after the blue lights were illuminated and the hailer was employed. This argument, however, ignores evidence the jury heard regarding Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s actions before and after the moment the small boat\u2019s blue lights flashed. Coast Guard officers testified at trial that the larger cutter, from which the small boat was deployed, activated its blue lights (easily visible over the distance between the cutter and Mr. Rodriguez) minutes before, at which point Mr. Rodriguez and his co-defendant began to steer their jet skis away from the lights and pick up speed. Moreover, even after the small boat reached the jet skis and Coast Guard officers activated the blue lights and repeatedly called to the jet ski operators on the hailer, Mr. Rodriguez and his co-defendant fled for a number of minutes, performing evasive maneuvers as they went. This evidence, contained in the testimony of three Coast Guard officers, was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Mr. Rodriguez knowingly disobeyed the Coast Guard\u2019s orders to heave to.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We also find no merit in Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s contention that the government failed to establish that the Coast Guard officers intended to and were capable of physically boarding Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s jet ski. Assuming for argument that the statute requires this evidence, which the parties dispute, the government presented it. Lieutenant Heuser testified that his team \u2014 the team that pursued Mr. Rodriguez \u2014 was a \u201cboarding team,\u201d tasked with boarding vessels in United States territory to conduct safety checks or perform law enforcement operations. Moreover, Lieutenant Heuser testified that, once Mr. Rodriguez stopped his jet ski, officers tied the vessel to the small Coast Guard boat. They then searched the jet ski. This testimony was sufficient for the jury to infer that the Coast Guard officers both intended to board and did in fact board Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s jet ski.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Mr. Rodriguez also appeals his sentence on the grounds that it is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We review reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Rodriguez contends the district court\u2019s failure to explain why the sentence it imposed was appropriate under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrants a remand for resentenc-ing. The court did, however, state that it \u201cconsidered the statements of all the parties, the presentence report which contains the advisory guidelines[,] and the statutory factors as set forth in 18 U.S.C. section 3553(a).\u201d And, because this Court has held that \u201c \u2018nothing ... requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of [them],\u2019 \u201d under our binding precedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005)), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We now turn to the substantive reasonableness of Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s sentence. A substantively reasonable sentence is one that achieves the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A district court\u2019s sentence is unreasonable when it (1) \u201cfails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight,\u201d (2) \u201cgives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor,\u201d or (3) \u201ccommits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors\u201d by considering proper factors but balancing them unreasonably. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). We do not automatically presume a guidelines-range sentence to be reasonable, but we ordinarily expect it to be. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Mr. Rodriguez points to the Florida on-land offense of resisting arrest without violence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which carries a maximum sentence of 1 year of imprisonment, to suggest his 16-month sentence for committing a similar offense at sea was unreasonable. But he overlooks that the maximum sentence for failing to heave to under \u00a7 2237(a)(1) is 5 years\u2019 imprisonment, and he received a sentence considerably lower than that maximum and within the guidelines range for Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Further, the district court stated that it considered the government\u2019s argument that 16 months would be an appropriate sentence to deter Mr. Rodriguez and others who might engage in high-speed, low-visibility chases that endanger Coast Guard officers. These circumstances map appropriately onto the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that require an analysis of, among other factors, the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and the \u201cneed for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law,\u201d and \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), (B). Thus, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s within-guidelines sentence of 16 months was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-10\">. Because Mr. Rodriguez mounts a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence against him, we recite the facts relevant to his conviction ir/the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v.
