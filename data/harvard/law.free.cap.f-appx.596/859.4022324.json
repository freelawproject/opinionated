On appeal, Herrera argues that the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) applies to his claim because his sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) exceeded the statutory maximum for his offense. He argues that the district court sentenced him based on a quantity of drugs and drug type that were not charged in the indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of his claim, he relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>569 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013), and <em>Burrage v. United States, </em>571 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 881, 187 L.Ed.2d 715 (2014). He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>contends that his mandatory life sentence violates the Ex Post Facto Clause under <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>569 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Under the savings clause, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. We have held that the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, such that a petitioner must show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d before the district court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1338-40 (11th Cir. 2013), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Apr. 8, 2014) (No. 13-1221). The petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that' the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>Turner v. Warden, </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2873, 186 L.Ed.2d 923 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">We have stated that the savings clause \u201cat the very least, applies to actual-innocence claims due to a non-existent offense.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1281 (11th Cir.2013). Additionally, the savings clause allows a petitioner to bring a claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the statutory maximum penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 1274. To show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, a petitioner challenging his sentence must satisfy a five-part test: (1) throughout the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our precedent squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition; (2) the Supreme Court overturned that binding precedent after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding; (3) that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively to cases on collateral review; (4) as a result of that Supreme Court decision, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence; and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 reaches the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-64, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have explained that the enhanced penalties in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) cannot be applied unless the jury determines the drug type and quantity involved in the drug conspiracy offenses. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1309-10 (11th Cir.2012). However, we have determined that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>collateral review. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the Supreme Court applied the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>to conclude that the \u201cma-chinegun\u201d provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was an element of the offense that must be proved to the jury. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. at 235, 130 S.Ct. at 2180. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court further determined that any fact, other than the fact of a prior conviction, that increases the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence for a crime must be submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. 570 U.S. at-,-,-, 133 S.Ct. at 2155, 2160 n. 1, 2163. We recently held that <em>AUeyne </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285. In <em>DePierre, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe term \u2018cocaine base\u2019 as used in \u00a7 841(b)(1) means not just \u2018crack cocaine,\u2019 but cocaine in its chemically basic form.\u201d 564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2237.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">In <em>Burrage, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant cannot be held liable under the penalty enhancement provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) where the use of a drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victim\u2019s death or serious bodily injury unless the drug use is a but-for cause of the death or injury. <em>Burrage, </em>571 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 892. In <em>McQuiggin, </em>the Supreme Court held that there is an actual innocence exception to the statute of limitations in the AEDPA. 569 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. at 1932-35. In <em>Peugh, </em>the Supreme Court held that under the Ex Post Facto Clause, a defendant cannot be sentenced under Guidelines put into effect after he committed his criminal acts, where the subsequent Guidelines provide for a higher advisory sentencing range. 568 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2078.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">Herrera has failed to open the portal to \u00a7 2241 because he has failed to meet all five requirements of the five-part test established in <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1281. Herrera has failed to establish the third requirement because none of the cases upon which he relies apply retroactively on collateral review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Herrera\u2019s argument that the district court erred under <em>AUeyne </em>and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>with respect to the drug type and quantity found at sentencing is an Apprendi-based argument. We have held that both <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Alleyne </em>are not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See McCoy, </em>266 F.3d at 1258; <em>Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">Because the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>applied the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>to conclude that the \u201cmachinegun\u201d provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was an element of the offense that must be proved to the jury, it necessarily follows that <em>O\u2019Brien </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. at 235, 130 S.Ct. at 2180; <em>Cf. McCoy, </em>266 F.3d at 1258. Moreover, <em>DePierre </em>did not narrow the interpretation of \u00a7 841(b), as it expanded the definition of cocaine base to include all cocaine in its chemically basic form. <em>DePierre, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2237. Herrera\u2019s reliance on <em>Bur-rage </em>and <em>McQuiggin </em>is similarly misplaced because those cases are inapposite to his argument that the drug quantity and type needed to be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">We need not consider Herrera\u2019s argument that his sentence violates the Ex Post Facto Clause under <em>Peugh </em>because Herrera did not raise this argument before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>the district court. <em>See Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994) (concluding that we would not address an issue that was not raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition). However, Herrera\u2019s argument under <em>Peugh </em>fails in any event because it is in essence an argument under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and we have held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that <em>Booker </em>did not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Because Herrera fails to show that his claim satisfied the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, he cannot proceed under \u00a7 2241. Therefore, the district court did not have jurisdiction over Herrera\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, and did not err in dismissing the petition. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-14\">. This excludes the fact of prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-12\">. Furthermore, Herrera has failed to prove that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
