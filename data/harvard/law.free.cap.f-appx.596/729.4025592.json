On appeal, Courboin argues that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants because RICO allows for nationwide service of process and that his complaint stated valid claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">Courboin filed this action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in December 2013. The facts on which the complaint is based arose during and over the course of Courboin\u2019s divorce proceedings in New Jersey, which concluded in 2011. At some point during the proceedings, Courboin moved from New Jersey to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Courboin was represented in the divorce by James Jensen and the law firm of Laufer, Dalena, Cadicina, Jensen and Boyd, LLC (\u201cJensen defendants\u201d). Candace Scott, Denise \u201cWennogle, and the law firms of Candace Scott,' LLC, and Scott and Daly, LLC (\u201cScott Defendants\u201d), represented Courboin\u2019s ex-wife. Kalman A. Barson and the Barson Group (\u201cBarson defendants\u201d), and Arthur J. Smith and Arthur J. Smith Appraisals, LLC (\u201cSmith defendants\u201d), were hired by Scott to appraise marital assets for Courboin\u2019s ex-wife as part of the divorce proceedings. These attorneys and appraisers are the defendants in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Courboin alleged in his complaint that he was illegally deprived of about $200,000 from his pre-divorce household assets as a result of the following conduct: (1) Scott overbilled Courboin\u2019s ex-wife and depleted the marital assets by using large and unnecessary form interrogatories during the divorce proceedings, which caused Cour-boin to be billed large amounts by Jensen &lt; to respond to the interrogatories; (2) Scott hired Barson and Smith to appraise marital assets, and Barson and Smith charged his wife inflated rates and used outdated forms, again depleting the marital assets; and (3) Jensen refused to cross-examine Barson about his exorbitant fees during the proceedings. With respect to one of the appraisals, Courboin alleged that Bar-son charged his ex-wife $56,000 to appraise her interest in certain business assets, valued at around $190,000, whereas Courboin had had the same assets appraised by a more reputable firm at a cost of $6,250. Courboin further alleged that he had witnesses and a neutral appraiser who would testify that \u201cattorneys demand a \u2018cut\u2019 of up to 50% when they send an appraisal request to [appraisers].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Based on these allegations, Courboin asserted that the defendants had violated RICO and the Sherman Act by stealing his and the people of New Jersey\u2019s money through their legal and appraisal practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The Smith and Scott defendants filed motions to dismiss based on, among other things, lack of personal jurisdiction, asserting that they had no substantial contacts with Florida and that all acts or omissions alleged in the complaint occurred outside of Florida. Courboin responded to the Smith defendants\u2019 motion, but he did not address personal jurisdiction. The Barson and Jensen defendants did not file responsive pleadings or motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The district court granted the two motions to dismiss and dismissed the complaint in its entirety as to all defendants. The court first found that it lacked personal jurisdiction over all defendants because Courboin had not alleged any facts showing that the defendants had sufficient \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with Florida. Furthermore, assuming that it had jurisdiction to decide the controversy, the court found that (1) Courboin failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted under either \u2022RICO or the Sherman Act; (2) the complaint should be dismissed as to all parties because it was frivolous, the non-moving defendants were similarly situated to the moving defendants, and the claims against all defendants were integrally related; and (3) venue was improper. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of 'an action for lack of personal jurisdiction <em>de novo. Madam v. Hall, </em>916 F.2d 1510, 1514 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In the context of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in which no evidentiary hearing is held, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1514; <em>Morris v. SSE, Inc., </em>843 F.2d 489, 492 (11th Cir.1988). In assessing a plaintiffs prima facie case, the court must accept the facts alleged in the complaint as true to the extent that they are uncontro-verted by the defendant\u2019s affidavits. Madam, 916 F.2d at 1514.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">When analyzing a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction, \u201cwe first determine whether the applicable statute potentially confers jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d <em>Republic of Panama v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A., </em>119 F.3d 935, 942 (11th Cir.1997). Jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant may be based upon a federal statute or a state long-arm statute. If a basis exists for exercising jurisdiction, we \u201cthen determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">We have held that there is a potential statutory basis for personal jurisdiction under RICO because the statute provides for nationwide service of process. <em>Id.; see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1965(d). The Sherman Act, by contrast, does not have a nationwide service-of-process provision, so we must look to the state long-arm statute as a basis for -exercising jurisdiction. <em>See Delong Equip. Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co., </em>840 F.2d 843, 847-48 (11th Cir.1988). For that reason, the personal-jurisdiction analysis differs for each type of claim. We address the RICO claims first.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">\n<em>1. RICO Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Despite the fact that RICO contains a nationwide service-of-process provision, Courboin is entitled to take advantage of it only if his \u201casserted federal claim is not wholly immaterial or insubstantial.\u201d <em>Republic of Panama, </em>119 F.3d at 941-42 (stating that, under RICO and other statutes with nationwide service-of-process provisions, a court \u201cshould dismiss for lack of jurisdiction only if the right claimed is so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In other words, whether a basis exists for exercising personal jurisdiction under RICO depends on whether Courboin has stated a \u201ccolorable\u201d RICO claim. <em>Id. </em>at 942. If Courboin has not stated a colorable claim, we do not address the applicable due-process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">The federal civil RICO provision \u201cpermits any person injured in his business or property by reasons of a violation of RICO\u2019s criminal provisions to recover treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>McCaleb v. A.O. Smith Corp., </em>200 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.2000) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). In order to establish a RICO violation, a plaintiff must prove four elements: \u201c(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">In his complaint, Courboin alleged the following: (1) his ex-wife\u2019s attorney, Scott, hired a business appraiser, Barson, who charged an exorbitant rate; (2) Scott hired a real-estate appraiser, Smith, who used an outdated form, charged 60% more than Courboin\u2019s appraiser, and did not advertise in the phonebook; (3) Courboin\u2019s attorney, Jensen, refused to cross-examine Barson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>on the amount of his fees, ostensibly for the tactical reason of not gaming the judge\u2019s ire; (4) Scott sent Courboin burdensome discovery requests not needed for the divorce proceeding, which Jensen charged an excessive amount to respond to and failed to challenge; (5) over $200,000 went to pay attorneys and experts in his divorce proceedings; and (6) an appraiser not affiliated with his divorce has indicated that unnamed attorneys demand a 50% cut when they send an appraisal referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Upon review of Courboin\u2019s complaint, we conclude that he has not stated a colorable federal RICO claim, so he may not rely on RICO\u2019s nationwide service-of-process provision. <em>See Republic of Panama, </em>119 F.3d at 941-42. First, assuming that the conduct alleged on the part of the defendants in this case was highly unethical, Courboin still has not identified any predicate acts that could constitute \u201cracketeering activity\u201d under RICO. The phrase \u201cracketeering activity\u201d is defined as including any predicate act which is indictable under a lengthy list of federal criminal offenses, including robbery and mail and wire fraud, as well as certain limited state offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). A \u201cpattern\u201d of such activity is two or more related predicate acts. <em>Williams, </em>465 F.3d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">While Courboin makes broad allegations of corruption and theft in the New Jersey family courts, he does not connect these allegations to any predicate act as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. Nor does our review of that provision indicate any qualifying predicate act that is implicated by Cour-boin\u2019s specific factual allegations. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1961(1)(A)-(B). The closest match we can find appears to be federal wire or mail fraud, but Courboin alleges no mailings and no signals transmitted interstate by wire, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343, respectively. Robbery under New Jersey law does not work because, among other reasons, Courboin has made no allegations of \u201cintimidating or assaultive conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Lopez, </em>187 N.J. 91, 900 A.2d 779, 784 (2006). No other qualifying predicate acts appear even conceivably to be implicated. Thus, Courboin has not shown any \u201cracketeering activity,\u201d let alone a \u201cpattern\u201d of such activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Courboin also did not allege any facts plausibly supporting an inference that the defendants \u201cconducted] ... an enterprise.\u201d To show \u201cconduct of an enterprise,\u201d a plaintiff must establish that a group of persons associated together for the common purpose of engaging in an ongoing course of criminal conduct. <em>Williams, </em>465 F.3d at 1283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">While Courboin asserts that the defendants\u2019 goal was to steal money, at most, his allegations support a claim that (1) Barson and Smith overbilled his wife, (2) Courboin disagreed with Jensen\u2019s tactical choices, and (3) Scott and Jensen performed work that Courboin thought was unnecessary to Courboin\u2019s divorce. The mere fact that attorneys and appraisers interact in divorce proceedings, however, does not mean or even plausibly suggest, in and of itself, that all of the defendants were in cahoots and were conducting an \u201centerprise.\u201d Moreover, even if some attorneys generally demand a \u201ccut\u201d of appraisal fees, Cour-boin has not stated any factual allegations indicating that any attorneys in this case did so. While we are certainly troubled by Courboin\u2019s allegations of unethical behavior on the part of the defendants in this case, the allegations simply do not support a colorable claim that an enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity in this case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Consequently, we conclude that Cour-boin\u2019s allegations under' RICO do not rise to the level of a colorable federal controversy. <em>See Republic of Panama, </em>119 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>at 941-42. Courboin cannot, therefore, take advantage of the nationwide service-of-process provision in RICO as a basis for exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">2. Sherman Act Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Because the Sherman Act does not contain a nationwide service-of-proeess provision, we look to the long-arm statute of Florida to determine whether it authorizes exercising jurisdiction over the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Delong Equip. Co., </em>840 F.2d at 847-48; Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e). Under the Florida long-arm statute, specific personal jurisdiction exists if, among other things, the defendant injures persons within Florida due to an act or omission outside Florida if, at the time of injury, (1) the defendant was engaged in solicitation or service activities within Florida or his services were used within Florida in the ordinary course of business. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(l)(a)6. The statute also provides for general jurisdiction over a defendant \u201cwho is engaged in substantial and not isolated activity\u201d in Florida. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 48.193(2). Florida\u2019s Supreme Court has held that economic injury, unaccompanied by physical injury or property damage, is insufficient to subject a non-resident defendant to personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 48.193(l)(a)6. <em>See Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Therm-O-Disc, Inc., </em>511 So.2d 992, 994 (Fla.1987) (concerning Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(l)(f), which later became \u00a7 48.193(l)(a)6).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">When a state long-arm statute provides the basis for jurisdiction, the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with due-process requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Madara, </em>916 F.2d at 1514. In essence, jurisdiction is proper only \u201cwhere the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum proximately result from actions by the defendant <em>himself </em>that create a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 with the forum state,\u201d such that the defendant \u201cshould reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1516-17 (emphasis in original) (citing <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 474-75, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 2182-83, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985)). Therefore, \u201cthe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239-40, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">The district court did not have a basis for exercising jurisdiction over the moving defendants pursuant to the Florida long-arm statute. The Scott defendants presented uncontroverted testimony that they did not solicit or conduct business in Florida. Moreover, Courboin alleged only economic injury and did not contend that the Scott or Smith defendants solicited or conducted business in Florida. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(l)(a)6; <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>511 So.2d at 994. In any case, the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over these defendants would not comport with Fourteenth Amendment due-process requirements. <em>See Madara, </em>916 F.2d at 1514. The defendants had no \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>connection\u201d with Florida either through the conduct out of which Courboiris complaint arose or more generally. <em>See id. </em>at 1516-17. Further, Courboiris unilateral decision to move to Florida during the divorce proceedings was insufficient to create jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 1516.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">\n<em>3. Non-Moving Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">For the same reasons discussed above, the district court also did not err in dismissing Courboiris complaint based on its lack of personal jurisdiction over the non-moving defendants. A district court' may on its own motion dismiss an action as to defendants who have not moved to dismiss where such defendants are in a position similar to that of moving defendants or where claims against such defendants are integrally related. <em>Loman Dev. Co. v. Daytona Hotel &amp; Motel Suppliers, Inc., </em>817 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir.1987); <em>see Tazoe v. Airbus S.A.S., </em>631 F.3d 1321, 1336 (11th Cir.2011) (stating that a district court can dismiss an action on its own motion only if it does so fairly, usually by providing notice and an opportunity to respond, but noting an exception to this rule where reversal would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Here, the non-moving defendants were similarly situated to the moving defendants, as all acts or omissions alleged in the complaint occurred in New Jersey during Courboiris divorce proceedings. <em>See Loman Dev. Co., </em>817 F.2d at 1537. Any potential unfairness of the district court\u2019s dismissal was eliminated by Courboiris opportunity to respond to the jurisdictional issues raised by the Scott and Smith defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, Courboin made no jurisdictional allegations as to any of the defendants, and apart from citing to RICO\u2019s nationwide service-of-process provision, makes no jurisdictional argument under Florida law on appeal. Thus, reversal as to these defendants would be futile. <em>See Tazoe, </em>631 F.3d at 1336. Accordingly, we affirm the part of the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Although the district court correctly concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over all defendants, the court addressed the merits of Courboiris claims. We understand and appreciate the district court\u2019s motivation to address the merits of the claims in the alternative. Nevertheless, \u201ca defendant that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the court cannot be bound by its rulings,\u201d so jurisdictional questions generally should be decided before reaching the merits. <em>See Republic of Panama, </em>119 F.3d at 940; <em>Madara, </em>916 F.2d at 1514 &amp; 1514 n. 1. Moreover, where no personal jurisdiction exists and a dismissal on the merits would be with prejudice, it is particularly appropriate to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds and not address the merits. <em>Republic of Panama, </em>119 F.3d at 940; <em>Madara, </em>916 F.2d at 1514 &amp; 1514 n. 1. For these reasons and because we find no personal jurisdiction over the defendants in this case, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim and for frivolity.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Courboiris complaint without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and we vacate the part of the district court\u2019s order that dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-11\">. In response to Courboin\u2019s summons, Kal-man Barson wrote a personal letter to Cour-boin, which was then entered on the docket as an \"Answer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">. To the extent that Courboin also alleged claims under the Florida RICO Act, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 772.101, the analysis of personal jurisdiction for such claims would also be addressed under the Florida long-arm statute and is therefore the same as for the Sherman Act claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-13\">. By contrast, when a federal statute like RICO provides the basis for personal jurisdiction, the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with due-process requirements under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Republic of Panama, </em>119 F.3d at 942. While similar, the due-process protections offered by the respective amendments are not identical. <em>See id. </em>at 944-46.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
