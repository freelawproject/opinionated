Nnaji challenged his 240-month sentence for forced labor, harboring an illegal alien for financial gain, document servitude, making false statements to federal agents, and conspiracy. He contended, based on <em>Alleyne v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), that his statutory minimum sentence was unconstitutionally increased based on facts not admitted or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Since Nnaji sought to attack the validity of his sentence, he had to meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) to raise his claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e). To meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), Nnaji had to show that his claim was \u201c(i) ... based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] ... may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence must be submitted to a jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 133 S.Ct. at 2163. Since the decision in <em>Alleyne </em>implicates the validity of a sentence, <em>Alleyne </em>does not establish that Nnaji was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002). Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing Nnaji\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for failure to satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
