In 2008, another panel of our court summarized the action to date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">This dispute has a long and complicated history. For our purposes, however, we need only the basic facts. David Jump and Dennis Joslin have each at various times asserted their alleged rights as priority lien holders to property interests of Rory McFarland. Jump\u2019s claims are based on a 1991 judgment against McFarland from the United States District Court for the Western District of Colorado, which Jump subsequently registered in the Western District of Louisiana. Pursuant to his 1991 judgment, Jump collected proceeds attributable to McFarland\u2019s interest in an offshore oil and gas lease, OCS-310. Jump later purchased McFarland\u2019s interest in OCS-310 pursuant to a seizure and sale in execution of his judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">Joslin\u2019s claims, on the other hand, are based on a 1984 mortgage and assignment from McFarland of certain onshore oil and gas leases, and on a 1993 judgment against McFarland from the Western District of Louisiana. Pursuant to the 1984 mortgage, Joslin sought to foreclose on McFarland\u2019s interests in the onshore oil and gas leases. Jump intervened and objected to the foreclosure and sale, arguing that his 1991 judgement primed Joslin\u2019s 1984 mortgage because the mortgage had been reinscribed after the requisite 10-year period under Louisiana law. On appeal, this court held in <em>FDIC v. McFarland (.McFarland </em>II) that Jump\u2019s 1991 judgment could not prime Joslin\u2019s 1984 mortgage because Jump\u2019s registered judgment in Louisiana was based on a non-final Colorado judgment and was therefore premature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-15\">After <em>McFarland II, </em>Joslin filed a third-party complaint to annul the Marshal\u2019s sale of OCS-310 to Jump. He argued that <em>McFarland II </em>held that Jump\u2019s 1991 judicial lien on OCS-310 is invalid, and that therefore his 1993 judgement against McFarland is the only valid lien on OCS-310. Joslin claimed that he is entitled to an unraveling of the Marshal\u2019s sale as well as disgorgement of any proceeds attributable to McFarland\u2019s interest in OCS-310 that had been previously distributed to Jump. Joslin filed a motion for partial summary judgment declaring the 1996 Marshal\u2019s sale to be a nullity, and the district court granted the motion in 2003 (the \u201c2003 order\u201d). In 2004, the district court issued another order (the \u201c2004 order\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>directing the proceeds attributable to McFarland\u2019s and Jump\u2019s interests in OCS-310 to be deposited with the Clerk of the Court, who is to withhold distribution of the funds until further order. On motions from the parties, the court certified both the 2003 and 2004 orders as final pursuant to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 54(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Jump appealed, arguing that our court lacked appellate jurisdiction because the 2003 and 2004 orders were improperly certified. We agreed. We recognized that Joslin, in his complaint, had alleged that the sale of OCS-310 to Jump was null and void, and as such \u201crequested an unravell-ing of the sale, as well as disgorgement of any proceeds Jump had already collected.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 2003 and 2004 orders, however, only addressed Joslin\u2019s request that the OCS-310 sale be voided, it did not address the disgorgement of any proceeds from Jump.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because only a \u201cfully adjudicated whole claim\u201d could be certified under Rule 54(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we concluded that the 2003 and 2004 orders, which only addressed part of Joslin\u2019s claim, were improperly certified, and we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">On June 12, 2013, Joslin amended its complaint. In response to our court\u2019s 2008 opinion, it deleted the original prayer for relief requiring Jump to \u201creturn to the registry of the court all sums which they have received pursuant to and as a result of, disbursements from the property.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It also added a new prayer for relief requiring that \u201call of the moneys accumulated and to be accumulated in the court clerk\u2019s account related to OCS Lease 310 be distributed to [Joslin].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Joslin then moved to recertify the 2003 and 2004 orders as final judgments pursuant to Rule 54(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">The district court granted the motion, concluding that the additional prayer for relief is not a \u201cnew <em>claim </em>for relief.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also held that, in any event, the \u201cissue was addressed in the 2004 order,\u201d which had declared that Joslin was the only individual with any lien on the \u201cruns or minerals of federal lease OCS-320.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Jump appeals the certification of the 2003 and 2004 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Rule 54(b) provides that \u201c[w]hen an action presents more than one claim for relief \u2014 whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim \u2014 or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As discussed earlier, a claim must be \u201cwholly determined\u201d to be certified,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by which \u201cthe judgment must ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mately dispose of an individual claim.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s certification decision for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Here, Joslin\u2019s amended complaint requests an unravelling of the sale of OCS-310 as well as, pending amendment, the distribution of all funds related to that lease and held in the court clerk\u2019s account to Joslin. Neither the 2003 order, which addressed the interest in the lease, nor the 2004 order, which decreed that Joslin was the only party to have a hen on the OCS-310 lease and ordered that Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cChevron\u201d), a third-party, deposit the current and future proceeds of the lease into court clerk\u2019s account, directly addressed the question of <em>disbursement </em>of proceeds. Nor did the district court do so via its 2014 order, which re-certified\u2014 but did not amend \u2014 the original 2003 and 2004 orders dictate the disbursement of the lease funds. As a result, we are essentially in the same position as in 2008, where: \u201c[t]he 2003 order addressed part of Joslin\u2019s claim by declaring that the sale of COS-310 was null and void. But the order did not address Joslin\u2019s request for disgorgement. In other words, the 2003 order did not dispose of the entirety of Joslin\u2019s claim, because it did not address Joslin\u2019s request for the recovery of the funds allegedly improperly distributed to Jump.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, the district court has yet to address Joslin\u2019s request for <em>disbursement </em>of funds, and Joslin\u2019s claim is incomplete.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Even were we to construe the 2003 and 2004 orders as completely disposing of Jos-lin\u2019s claim, Rule 54(b) certification would be inappropriate. Here, as the district court noted in a separate order, there are at least eight interpleaded defendants who claim proceeds from the lease under various legal theories.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the district court had previously ordered that \u201cthe Clerk of Court shall deduct and disburse to Chevron from the funds deposited in the registry to the Court, and prior to the disbursement of the funds to this prevailing party or parties in this action, such attorney fees and costs, if any, awarded by this Court to Chevron in response to its motion [for appropriate attorney fees and costs].\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This order would conflict with a ruling that funds from that account be distributed exclusively to Joslin. We have previously held that certification of a Rule 54(b) motion is inappropriate where it might prejudice a party, or where it fails to \u201ctake into account judicial administrative interests.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here, both concerns counsel against certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Accordingly, we GRANT Jump\u2019s motion and dismiss this appeal without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Also pending is a motion by Rory McFarland to join this appeal as an appel-lee. We DENY this motion as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
