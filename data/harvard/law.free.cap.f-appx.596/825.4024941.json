After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">A. Claims on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">In the district court, Sturdivant voluntarily dismissed her race discrimination claims, all of her claims against Mayor Kasim Reed and City Council President Caesar Mitchell, her Title VII claims against Police Chief Turner and Sergeant John Ludwig, and her \u00a7 1983 claims against Sergeant Ludwig and against Chief Turner in his official capacity. In addition, on appeal, Sturdivant does not challenge the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the City of Atlanta on her Title VII disparate treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>ment gender discrimination claim or the district court\u2019s decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims against Sergeant Ludwig and to dismiss those state law claims without prejudice. Thus, these claims are abandoned. <em>See Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root Serv., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">As a result, the only claims on appeal are Sturdivant\u2019s Title VII hostile work environment sexual harassment claim against the City of Atlanta and her \u00a7 1983 gender-based equal protection claim against the City of Atlanta and Chief Turner in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">B.Text Messages to Sturdivant</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Sturdivant works for the Atlanta Police Department\u2019s (\u201cAPD\u201d) human resources department as the Assistant Commander of Human Resources and holds the rank of sergeant. Sturdivant\u2019s duties include overseeing payroll, drug screening, and the grievance procedure, and also acting as the EEOC liaison between APD and the City\u2019s human resources department.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Sometime in 2009, another APD officer, Sergeant Ludwig, began to send text messages to Sturdivant\u2019s city-issued cell phone that commented on her physical appearance and asked about her private life. Sturdivant did not work or socialize with Sergeant Ludwig and had met him only a couple of times through work. Ludwig sent Sturdivant these text messages intermittently, every three to four months, until June 2010. Sturdivant responded to Ludwig that he was being disrespectful, but did not report his text messages to her superiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">On June 9, 2010, Ludwig sent Sturdivant a series of text messages commenting on her body, which she ignored. Later that evening, Ludwig sent her a photograph of his erect penis, stating, \u201c[T]his is what happens to me when I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d Sturdivant told Ludwig he had crossed the line and that she would report him to the Office of Professional Standards (\u201cOPS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">C. Sturdivant\u2019s First Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">The next morning, June 10, 2010, Sturdi-vant reported Ludwig\u2019s text to her work supervisor and another superior officer, who immediately called OPS. Two days after receiving the photograph, on June 11, 2010, Sturdivant went to OPS and filed a formal complaint. Ten minutes after giving her statement to OPS, Sturdivant received a text message from Ludwig stating he \u201creally blew it this time\u201d and indicating he knew she had made the complaint against him. Sturdivant complained to OPS that her complaint had not been kept confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">D. Text Messages Stop After Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">A few days after Sturdivant\u2019s OPS complaint, OPS interviewed Ludwig. OPS told Ludwig to have no further contact with Sturdivant. Sturdivant admits that she has received no further texts from Ludwig.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">After filing her OPS complaint, Sturdi-vant did see Ludwig three or four times in the police headquarters building where she worked, but Ludwig never approached her or spoke to her. About a week after Stur-divant\u2019s OPS complaint, at a staff meeting, Ludwig laughed and smirked at Sturdi-vant, but did not say anything to her. On another occasion about two weeks after her OPS complaint, Sturdivant saw Ludwig standing in the hallway outside her office talking to his superior officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">E. Formal Investigation and Discipline</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">A few weeks after filing her OPS complaint, Sturdivant learned that OPS had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>not yet begun a formal investigation and had not retrieved and preserved the text messages and the photograph on her cell phone, even though OPS is supposed to investigate sexual harassment complaints immediately. Sturdivant told OPS that if it did not start the formal investigation by assigning her case a control number, she would call an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">OPS started the formal investigation on July 1, 2010, about three weeks after her OPS complaint was filed. During the interim, there were no further text messages from Ludwig. Because she felt OPS was not taking her complaint seriously, Sturdi-vant called Deputy Chief Shawn Jones. Deputy Chief Jones called OPS to inquire about Sturdivant\u2019s complaint, and OPS told him that \u201cit\u2019s just [Sturdivant], she\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">During the OPS investigation, Ludwig did not deny sending Sturdivant the texts and photograph. In January 2011, disciplinary proceedings against Ludwig began, but then were postponed so that OPS could interview additional witnesses. Disciplinary proceedings concluded in late March 2011, and Ludwig was found guilty of failing to follow directives, namely, the City\u2019s sexual harassment policy. On April 7, 2011, almost ten months after Sturdi-vant filed her OPS complaint, Ludwig was suspended for ten days and restricted from accessing the headquarters building where Sturdivant worked without prior approval. Ludwig\u2019s discipline was in accordance with the City\u2019s sexual harassment policy, which called for disciplinary action ranging from a ten-day suspension to dismissal for an employee\u2019s first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">A. Title VII Claim of Hostile Work Environment Sexual Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The district court did not err in concluding that Sturdivant\u2019s Title VII hostile work environment claim was time-barred. Sturdivant did not file her EEOC charge until April 19, 2011, more than 180 days after Ludwig\u2019s June 2010 laughing and smirking at Sturdivant, the last acts that could arguably be said to have contributed to the alleged hostile work environment. <em>See Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2001); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1) (requiring an employee in a non-deferral state such as Georgia to exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge of discrimination with the- EEOC within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice); <em>Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 116-17, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2074, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (concluding that for hostile work environment claims, which involve the cumulative effect of many separate acts, the charge is timely if \u201can act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Sturdivant contends that her EEOC charge was timely because the APD\u2019s delayed and inept handling of her OPS complaint up to April 2011 were acts contributing to the hostile work environment. The district court properly rejected this argument based on <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370 (11th Cir.2008), in which this Court concluded that claims that \u201ccomplaints of discrimination were subject to retaliation and not investigated\u201d could not \u201cbe brought under a hostile work environment claim that centers on \u2018discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\u2019 \u201d but rather \u201cmust be challenged as separate statutory discrimination and retaliation claims.\u201d <em>McCann, </em>526 F.3d at 1378-79 (quoting in part <em>Morgan, </em>536 U.S. at 116, 122 S.Ct. at 2074).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">In any event, assuming the EEOC charge was timely, summary judgment on the merits was appropriate because Stur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>divant failed to establish a prima facie hostile work environment claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show, among other things, that the employer is responsible for the hostile work environment \u201cunder either a theory of vicarious or of direct liability.\u201d <em>McCann, </em>526 F.3d at 1378 (quotation marks omitted). Where, as here, the harasser is a coworker, rather than a supervisor, the employer is responsible for the conduct only \u201cif it knew or should have known of the harassing conduct but failed to take prompt remedial action.\u201d <em>Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">It is undisputed that Sturdivant\u2019s supervisors at APD knew nothing of Ludwig\u2019s behavior until Sturdivant reported it on June 10, 2010, at which point they referred Sturdivant to OPS to file a formal complaint. Further, once Sturdivant reported Ludwig\u2019s text messages to OPS, OPS told Ludwig to have no further communication with Sturdivant, and Ludwig complied. Ludwig was disciplined according to the City\u2019s sexual harassment policy. Ludwig also was instructed not to go in the building where Sturdivant worked without prior authorization. Most importantly, Ludwig admitted sending the text messages, and the text messages stopped immediately after her formal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Sturdivant stresses that the City\u2019s investigation and disciplinary proceedings took about ten months to complete and contends that OPS deliberately dragged out the investigation and disciplinary proceedings and intentionally failed to preserve Ludwig\u2019s text messages. Sturdivant did not produce any evidence to support her contention, however. Further, APD officials involved in the OPS investigation testified that attempts were made as early as June 14, 2010, to obtain Ludwig\u2019s text messages from Verizon once OPS realized Sturdivant\u2019s cell phone had automatically deleted them and that the disciplinary proceedings were suspended while OPS conducted interviews of additional witnesses who could support Sturdivant\u2019s complaint. Given these undisputed facts, no reasonable jury could conclude that the City was responsible for Ludwig\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">B. Section 1983 Equal Protection Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">The district court also did not err in granting summary judgment to the City and Chief Turner on Sturdivant\u2019s gender-based equal protection claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The gravamen of Sturdivant\u2019s equal protection claim is that the City and Chief Turner were deliberately indifferent to a practice at APD of discouraging female employees from filing formal sexual harassment complaints and failing to promptly investigate and resolve female employees\u2019 sexual harassment complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">As there is no respondeat superior theory of liability under \u00a7 1983, to hold an individual supervisor liable, the plaintiff must show either that the supervisor personally participated in the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>deprivation or that there was a causal connection between the supervisor\u2019s actions and the constitutional deprivation. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). Sturdivant does not contend Chief Turner personally participated in the deprivation of her constitutional rights, but tries to show a causal connection between Chief Turner\u2019s actions (or inactions) and the alleged constitutional deprivation. To demonstrate the requisite causal connection, the plaintiff must show a \u201chistory of widespread abuse\u201d that would put the supervisor \u201con notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]solated occurrences\u201d are insufficient; rather, the plaintiff must show widespread abuse that is \u201cobvious flagrant, rampant, and of continued duration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Similarly, to hold a municipality liable, the plaintiff must show that the deprivation of rights was caused by a custom or policy of the municipality. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). A \u201ccustom\u201d is a practice \u201cso widespread as to have the force of law.\u201d <em>Bd of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). Further, the plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with \u201cdeliberate indifference to its known or obvious consequences.\u201d <em>Davis v. DeKalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>233 F.3d 1367, 1375-76 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Here, it is undisputed that the City had a sexual harassment policy, that APD provided Ludwig with sexual harassment training, and that APD had not received any prior sexual harassment complaints involving Ludwig. \u25a0 Moreover, as soon as Sturdivant reported Ludwig\u2019s text messages, her superiors contacted OPS and told Sturdivant to file a formal complaint. After the OPS investigation, Ludwig was suspended for ten days, in accordance with the City\u2019s sexual harassment policy. As already noted, while the investigation and disciplinary process took about ten months, Sturdivant did not present any evidence that these delays were deliberate or based on her gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Additionally, Sturdivant did not provide any evidentiary support for her claim that there was a custom or practice at APD of encouraging female officers to resolve sexual harassment complaints informally and of dragging out investigations of female officers\u2019 formal sexual harassment complaints, while promptly resolving those of male officers. Sturdivant\u2019s conclusory assertions in her declaration that such a custom or practice existed and that Chief Turner knew of it are not facts simply because Sturdivant avers that they are based on her \u201c29 years with APD.\u201d Stur-divant\u2019s declaration did not provide any supporting facts from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the purported custom or practice was so widespread and obvious that the City and Chief Turner could be said to be on notice of it. <em>See Evers v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cThis court has consistently held that conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Sturdivant argues, without explanation, that her duties as the EEOC liaison gave her personal knowledge of these matters, but her declaration does not make this claim and the record does not support it. In fact, in her deposition, Sturdivant testified that her duties did not involve sexual harassment complaints, which are handled exclusively by OPS, a department in which she has never worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Indeed, Sturdivant further testified that, as a supervisor, she received only one com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>plaint of sexual harassment from a direct report, a female officer named Cassandra Pruitt, and that Sturdivant and Deputy Chief Shawn Jones (a male) together contacted OPS and then transported Pruitt to OPS to file a formal complaint. On another occasion, Sturdivant gave a statement in an OPS investigation into a sexual harassment complaint filed by a female recruit at the police academy. In other words, as to Sturdivant\u2019s only personal experiences with other female officers\u2019 sexual harassment complaints, Sturdivant did not claim the female officers were discouraged from filing a formal complaint or that their complaints were not properly investigated. On this record, Sturdivant\u2019s conclusory statements about a custom or practice in handling male and female officers\u2019 sexual harassment complaints and Chief Turner\u2019s awareness of it do not appear to be based on Sturdivant\u2019s personal knowledge and carry no probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the City and Chief Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-6\">. We review a district court's grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga\u201e </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-13\">. Because the factual basis for Sturdivant's \u00a7 1983 equal protection claim is the same as her Title VII hostile work environment claim, the elements of her \u00a7 1983 claim mirror the elements of her Title VII claim. <em>See Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 970 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Stallworth v. Shuler, </em>777 F.2d 1431, 1433 (11th Cir. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
