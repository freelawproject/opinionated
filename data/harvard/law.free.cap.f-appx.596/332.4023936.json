Generally, we review revocation sentences under the plainly unreasonable standard in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4). <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Because Moreno did not object in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence, however, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Also, a presumption of reasonableness applies to the within-policy-statement-range sentence. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-21\">According to Moreno, his 24-month sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because it did not account for his decision not to contest the revocation charges or his acceptance of responsibility for the violations. He argues that not contesting the revocation petition \u201cis \u2018a nature and circumstance of the offense\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 3553(a). He further contends that he should have received leniency because he saved judicial resources and, while he acknowledges that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 is not applicable, he cites the guideline as persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-22\">Moreno cites no authority for the argument that failing to contest the revocation charges constitutes the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a), and he fails to show that his presumptively reasonable sentence does not account for a sentencing factor that should have received significant weight. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 809. Moreover, the factual premise for his claims \u2014 that he did not contest the revocation charges and accepted responsibility for his violations \u2014 is belied by the record. Moreno denied several of the charges, asserting that he had not consumed alcohol or used drugs and that he had paid more in restitution than alleged in the amended petition. We therefore find no merit in his claims and no error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>plain or otherwise, in the 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
