On appeal, he contends for the first time that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to certain offense level calculations and failing to advise the district court about mitigating factors such as his hearing loss, memory loss, and dementia.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">\u201cWe have held that \u2018Sixth Amendment claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should not be litigated on direct appeal, unless they were previously presented to the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>503 F.3d 431, 436 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Partida, </em>385 F.3d 546, 568 (5th Cir.2004)). Only in rare cases, when the record allows this court to \u201cfairly evaluate the merits of the claim,\u201d will this court consider such claims on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>Casas\u2019s claims were not raised in the district court, and an evidentiary hearing was not conducted. The record is not sufficiently developed to permit review of the claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 123, 190 L.Ed.2d 94 (2014). Accordingly, we deny the claims without prejudice to Casas raising them on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-27\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
