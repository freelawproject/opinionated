Baker is a private investigator who operates the HIV Innocence Group under the federally registered \u201cHIV Innocence Group\u201d trademark. Baker, who believes that HIV does not cause AIDS, markets his services through the HIV Innocence Group to criminal defendants charged with violations of health-related laws, such as criminal HIV transmission cases. DeShong publishes information that is highly critical of Baker and the HIV Innocence Group on his website www.hivinnocence grouptruth.com. Baker\u2019s complaint alleged that the website infringes the HIV Innocence Group trademark. The district court dismissed Baker\u2019s Lanham Act claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>Ferrer v. Chevron Corp., </em>484 F.3d 776, 780 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(5th Cir.2007). While we accept all-well pleaded facts as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we do not accept \u201cconclusory allegations, unwarranted factual inferences, or legal conclusions\u201d as true. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Based on a careful review of the record, the parties\u2019 respective briefs, and the relevant district court opinion, we conclude that the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss was properly granted on Baker\u2019s Lanham Act claims. Because the district court\u2019s careful analysis thoroughly explains our reasoning, we need not engage in a redundant analysis simply to reach the same result. We therefore AFFIRM for essentially the same reasons as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-16\">. We do not disturb the district court's corresponding holding that Baker\u2019s state-law claims be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
