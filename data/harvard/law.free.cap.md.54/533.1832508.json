The objection of the plaintiff to the admissibility of the said evidence as \u25a0offered, or as proposed to be followed up, being insisted on by the plaintiff, the Court, (Wilson,'J.,) sustained the said objection of the plaintiff, and refused to allow the \u25a0evidence as offered, and also as proposed to be followed up, to go to the jury, but ruled that the defendant was at liberty to prove that he had received no part of the purchase money of the said Lewis.

That if the jury shall he of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled, under the pleadings and issues in this cause, to recover from the defendant on account of the sale of the said sloop to Wingate Lewis, they should, in making up their verdict, take into consideration whatever -amounts or sums of money they may, from the evidence in the cause, find to he due from the plaintiff to the \u2022defendant on account of the original purchase of the said vessel by the plaintiff from the defendant, or any of the \u25a0other claims offered in evidence, and their verdict must be for the defendant, unless they find that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a greater amount, in .which \u25a0case their verdict should be only for the excess of the demand of the plaintiff over that of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">1.

A bill of sale of the sloop was not to be given till the purchase money should be paid, and then the bill of sale was to be given to appellee\u2019s wife, \u25a0 and the appellee was to create no bills on the sloop.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In pursuance of the contract, the possession of the vessel was delivered to the appellee, who paid $150 in part of the purchase money, and used her in the oyster business until the latter part of February 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">At that time, a conversation took place between the parties, in which the appellee in answer to the appellant\u2019s question whether he would be able to pay the balance of the purchase money by the end of the oyster season, said '\u201che did not think that he could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The appellant then asked the appellee whether lie could put repairs on the sloop as she would need at the end of the season, he said \u201c he could not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Whereupon appellant sold the sloop to <em>Wingate Lewis </em>for $500, and asked appellee to give her up to Lewis, which the appellee consented to do, upon the promise by the appellant \u201c to settle with him satisfactorily.\u201d Upon this agreement the possession of the sloop was delivered to Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">It appears from the proof that no part of the price, which Lewis agreed to <em>pay, has </em>been received by the \u2022appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The declaration originally filed contained <em>seven </em>counts, but these need not be particularly noticed, as the jury were instructed by the <em>third prayer </em>of the defendant, which was granted, that \u201c if the defendant sold the sloop to Lewis with the consent of the plaintiff, but never received any part of the price from Lewis, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover on the <em>first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh counts </em>of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The only questions before us on this appeal, arise, 1st. Upon the demurrer to a part of the <em>third </em>plea. 2nd, the demurrer to the <em>eighth count </em>of the <em>narr., </em>and 3rd, to the ruling by the Circuit Court on the prayers, and 4th, to the ruling upon the questions of evidence. These will be disposed of in the order above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">ls\u00a3. The <em>third </em>plea alleged a set-off, \u201c for money payable by the plaintiff to the defendant, for goods bought by plaintiff of defendant prior to September 18*76 and since that time; for bills on said sloop <em>\u2018 </em>Anna Willets/ paid by defendant and created by plaintiff; for loss on sale of said sloop; for use of said sloop, and for sundry matters properly chargeable in account, as per account thereof herewith filed,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The demurrer was to so much of said plea as is contained in the following words, <em>\u201cfor bills on said sloop Anna Willets, paid by the defendant, and created by the plaintiff,\u201d </em>and also the following words, <em>\u201cfor loss on sale of said sloop,\u201d \u201cfor use of said sloop.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">It was not error to sustain this demurrer, a portion of the plea being good, it was proper for the plaintiff to reply to the part thereof which was well pleaded, and to confine his demurrer to the portion which was bad. 1 <em>Chitty on Pl., Set-off, </em>608 m.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The claims for <em>\u201closs on sale of the sloop\u201d </em>and \u201cfor the use of <em>the said sloop,\u201d </em>are for unliquidated damages and therefore not proper subjects of set-off. <em>Smith vs. Washington Gas Light Co., </em>31 <em>Md., </em>12.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The claim for money paid for bills on the sloop, created by the plaintiff, is not a good plea, it not being alleged that the same were paid at the instance or request of the plaintiff. A voluntary payment made by one of a debt due by another; without his request, creates no assumpsit or liability on the part of the latter to the former. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. vs. Hughes\u2019 Adm\u2019r, </em>1 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>480.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">2nd. As to the demurrer to the eighth count of the declaration, which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>This count alleges the sale of the stock by the defendant to the plaintiff for the prices mentioned, the delivery of the possession thereof to the plaintiff, the payment by the latter of $150 as part of the purchase money; \u201c and that afterwards, the said defendant sold and delivered the said boat or vessel to one Wingate Lewis, at and for a large sum of money, to wit; the sum of $1000, and undertook and promised to account therefor to the plaintiff; but the said defendant hath not accounted for nor paid to the plaintiff, the purchase money nor any part of the proceeds of said sale, but hath wholly refused and neglected so to do, and doth still refuse, whereupon the plaintiff claims $500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In the ingenious argument on the part of the appellant, several objections have been urged to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">It is argued that the sale of the vessel to Lewis by the appellant, not being alleged to have been made with the appellee\u2019s consent, must be understood as tortious, and an action of <em>assumpsit </em>cannot be maintained thereon, there being nothing in the count whereby the <em>tort </em>is alleged to have been waived. 2nd, That no sufficient consideration is stated to support the alleged promise of the appellant, to account for the proceeds of the sales. 3rd, If the count is to be construed to mean, that the sale to Lewis was made with the consent of the appellee, then the relation of principal and agent was created between the parties; the appellant was acting as the agent for the appellee, and is not liable to account, except for the proceeds of sale actually received by him from Lewis, and it is not alleged that the same have ever been received by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The question of the right of the plaintiff to waive the <em>tort </em>and sue in <em>assumpsit </em>does not arise. Here no tortious act on the part of the defendant is alleged as the ground of action. Taking the whole averment together, it imports that the possession of the boat was delivered by the plaintiff to Lewis, on the request of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u25a0and this is a sufficient consideration to support the promise of the defendant to account for and pay to the plaintiff the value of his interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">There is no foundation for the idea that the relation of principal and agent existed between the parties. The \u2022sale hy the defendant to Lewis was made without authority, not in any respect as agent for the plaintiff. Nor was it afterwards adopted or ratified hy the plaintiff. After the sale to Lewis, a distinct contract was made hy the defendant with the plaintiff, that if the latter would \u201cdeliver the possession of the boat to Lewis, the defendant would account to him for her. This contract is sufficiently stated in the <em>eighth count. </em>The demurrer was therefore properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">3rd. The prayers are next to he considered. The <em>second </em>prayer of the defendant, which was refused, relies upon an alleged variance between the original contract of sale of the sloop to the plaintiff as stated in the declaration, and that contract as proved. The supposed variance consists in the failure to allege as parts of the contract, \u201c that the purchase money was tobe paid at the end of the ensuing oyster season, and that the plaintiff was to make no hills on the boat without the defendant\u2019s consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">It is a sufficient answer to this objection to say that the \u2022original contract of sale to the plaintiff, is alleged merely -as inducement, and forms no part of the ground or cause of action. It was not necessary to set out all the elements or particulars of that contract, hut only so much as showed that the plaintiff was rightfully in possession of the property. The ground of action is the promise on the part of \u25a0the defendant, to account to the plaintiff for the property, made in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s giving up the possession to Lewis. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel is in error in supposing that the agreement to pay the purchase money at the end of the oyster season, and the agreement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>make no bills on the boat, were in their nature conditions precedent to the vesting of the right of possession in the plaintiff. \u201cAn objection for variance between the averment and proof will not be valid where the averment does not arise out of or form an essential part of the contract sued on.\u201d 3 <em>Robinson\u2019s Practice, </em>562; 1 <em>Chitty Pl., </em>262 <em>m, </em>318.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b559-11\">(Decided 28th July, 1880.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The defendant\u2019s <em>fourth </em>prayer was properly refused. The fact that Lewis failed to pay the defendant for the boat, was wholly immaterial, and in no manner affected the right of the plaintiff to recover. As before said the sale to Lewis was the act of the defendant, not made as plaintiff\u2019s agent; the latter did not agree to accept Lewis as purchaser from him, or to look to Lewis for the purchase money; but delivered the possession of the boat on the promise of the defendant to account to him for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">There was no evidence to support the hypothesis of the defendant\u2019s <em>seventh </em>pr&amp;yer, and it was for that reason properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We find no error in granting the <em>four </em>prayers of the plaintiff. The objection that the <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>leave out or omit to state material facts, relating to the original contract of sale to the plaintiff, has been answered in disposing of the defendant\u2019s second prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">We affirm the ruling of the Circuit Court on the <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>bills of exception. The evidence therein offered was properly rejected for reasons before stated. The faihrre of Lewis to pay for the boat did not affect the right of the plaintiff to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The motion in arrest was properly overruled for reasons stated in disposing of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
