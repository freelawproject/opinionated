Gittings and Fielder C. Slingluff. On the same day the administrators <em>pendente lite </em>were directed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court to give the notice required by law to the creditors of the said Noah Worthington, deceased, to exhibit their claims against his estate. Notice was accordingly given by publication in two county papers, by the administrators <em>pendente lite.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The litigation terminated, and the will dated the 8th of January, 1879, was admitted to probate on the 17th of March, 1880, about thirteen months after the granting of the letters <em>pendente lite, </em>and after the expiration of the time fixed for creditors to file their claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">The administrators <em>pendente lite </em>made report to the-Orphans\u2019 Court, under oath, that the order directing notice to he given to creditors had been complied with, and the Court endorsed on said report their certificate \u201cthat it had been proven to the satisfaction of the Court, that notice to the creditors of Noah Worthington of John,, had been given as therein reported, and it is hereby ordered that said report and this certificate he recorded among the records of this Court.\u201d This report and endorsement were made as prescribed by the Code of Public General Laws, Art. 93, sec. 111.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">After the will had been admitted to probate, letters of administration, with the will annexed, were granted to Joshua E. C. Worthington and Richard J. Gittings, on the 23rd of March, 1880. These administrators, on the-30th of March, 1880, hv petition applied to the Court for an order directing notice by publication to creditors in conformity with Art. 93, sec. 110, of Public General Laws. The Court deeming the notice to creditors already given by the administrators <em>pendente lite </em>sufficient, decided no-further notice was necessary, and that the administrators might safely proceed to make distribution of the personal estate of the testator, under said will, and they accordingly dismissed the petition. From the order dismissing' the petition, the administrators appealed.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b375-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>(Decided 1st July, 1880.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-4\">The cause was submitted on brief to Bartol, C.
