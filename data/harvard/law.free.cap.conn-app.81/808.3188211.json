We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The court found the following facts. A mortgage was given by Aaron L. Bernstein and Doris D. Bernstein more than twenty years ago on November 7, 1983, in the face amount of $7000 to the defendant. The mortgage was recorded on November 17, 1983, in volume 317, pages 784-88 of the Newtown land records. Credible evidence was offered to establish satisfaction of the mortgage by Sylvia Bernstein, and no credible evidence was offered to rebut her testimony. On the basis of the testimony of Doris D. Bernstein and Joseph Kasper, Jr., the court further found that it was reasonable to infer that the mortgage was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The complaint alleged and the defendant\u2019s answer admitted that the mortgage was due either within two years from its making or upon the transfer of title by the Bernsteins, whichever occurred earlier. The court further found that there was credible testimony from Joseph Kasper, formerly of the defendant, that neither the original mortgage note nor the deed could be found. The plaintiff M &amp; E Land Group (M &amp; E),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the owner of the mortgaged property at the initiation of this litigation, and its immediate predecessors in title held an undisturbed possession of the property for more than six years. The court further found that a release of mortgage had been demanded but that the defendant had failed to deliver a release, despite the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The defendant first contests the standing of the plaintiffs, attorney Robert H. Hall and M &amp; E, to bring an action under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-13 and 49-8. As to Hall, the defendant claims that he never purchased or possessed the land to meet the undisturbed six year possession requirement of \u00a7 49-13, nor had he made any payment to qualify him for damages as an \u201caggrieved person\u201d under \u00a7 49-8. In the case of M &amp; E, the defendant claims that it had no standing to bring the action initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>and no standing to continue the action because M &amp; E did not own the property for at least six years and sold the property before the start of the trial. The defendant further argues that the plaintiffs cannot tack prior possession by other predecessors in title to reach the six year requirement imposed by \u00a7 49-13 to bring a mortgage discharge action. The defendant also claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence an affidavit by the Bernsteins\u2019 attorney, who had represented them at the time of the conveyance to M &amp; E. We will address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We first set forth the standard of review and legal principles that guide our analysis in determining the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. \u201c[B]ecause [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. ... In order for a party to have standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the court, that party must be aggrieved. Standing is the legal right to set judicial machineiy in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless [one] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action .... Standing is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring suit [in other words, statutorily aggrieved] or is classically aggrieved. . . . The fundamental test for determining [classical] aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all the members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Edgewood Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>265 Conn. 280, 288, 828 A.2d 52 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We first address Hall\u2019s standing. It is not disputed that Hall represented clients Roland Roehrich and Jeanne R. Koon (Roehrich-Koon), who purchased the Bernsteins\u2019 land. When Roehrich-Koon conveyed the land to M &amp; E, the unreleased mortgage to Kasper was discovered, and Hall was required to sign an indemnity agreement with the Connecticut Attorney\u2019s Title Insurance Company (title insurer) that insured over that encumbrance to facilitate the sale to M &amp; E. General Statutes \u00a7 49-13 (a) provides that \u201cthe person owning the property, or the equity in the property, may bring a petition to the superior court\u201d seeking a judgment that the mortgage is invalid. The defendant urges that this statute must be inteipreted literally and that, because Hall was neither the owner of the property nor the owner of the equity in it, he lacked standing to bring this action. The indemnity agreement in evidence clearly set out Hall\u2019s agreement to indemnify the title insurer from any loss to induce it to certify over the unreleased Kasper mortgage. Practice Book \u00a7 9-23 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n action may be brought in all cases in the name of the real party in interest . . . .\u201d We agree with the plaintiff that pursuant to this rule, Hall, as an indemnitor, was authorized to proceed in his own name as a real party in interest and was classically aggrieved. See <em>Wilkinson v.Boats Unlimited, Inc., </em>236 Conn. 78, 88, 670 A.2d 1296 (1996). The defendant\u2019s refusal to release this mortgage triggered Hall\u2019s contractual obligation to bring a legal action for its discharge. As an indemnitor to the title insurer by virtue of his agreement to hold the title insurer harmless from any financial loss, he had a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, and that interest was specially and injuriously affected by the defendant\u2019s refusal to release the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The prayer for relief annexed to the complaint sought relief not just under the provisions of \u00a7 49-13, but also under the provisions of \u00a7 49-8. The latter statute provides in pertinent part that when a demand for release has been delivered to a mortgagee and no release has been delivered, the mortgagee \u201cshall be liable for damages to any person aggrieved . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-8 (c). As a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under the plain words of the statute, Hall was both statutorily and classically aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We conclude that Hall was classically aggrieved under provisions of \u00a7 49-13 and was both statutorily and classically aggrieved under \u00a7 49-8. Hall demonstrated a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, in that he agreed to indemnify the title insurer from loss arising from the unreleased mortgage. Therefore, Hall successfully established that the specific personal and legal interest was specially and injuriously affected. See <em>Edgewood Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 11-3 provides that the exclusive remedy for misjoinder of a party is a motion to strike. The defendant never moved to strike Hall as an improper party but instead filed an answer and special defense, thereby waiving any claim that Hall was not a proper party to the proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Thibault v. Frechette, </em>135 Conn. 170, 172, 62 A.2d 863 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that M &amp; E lacked standing because it had sold lots and ceased to be an owner of the property or the equity in the property as required by \u00a7 49-13. This argument is without merit. M &amp; E was still a party in interest because of the war-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>rarities in its deeds to lot purchasers that required it to \u201cprotect the land granted from all lawful claims and demands [made] at the time of the grant . . . .\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Kilbride, </em>58 Conn. 109, 116, 19 A. 519 (1889). In the event that the mortgage was not declared invalid by the action brought under \u00a7 49-13, M &amp; E would have been required to defend any foreclosure of the Kasper mortgage that was brought against its grantees who had received warranty deeds from M &amp; E.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that M &amp; E lacked \u201cundisturbed possession\u201d of the real property for at least six years as required by \u00a7 49-13. Essentially, the defendant argues that \u00a7 49-13 does not permit a party bringing the action to \u201ctack\u201d a prior owner\u2019s possession to the party\u2019s period of possession to accrue the required six years of possession necessary to invalidate a mortgage under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Our analysis necessarily involves statutory interpretation, and, therefore, our review is plenary. <em>Durso </em>v. <em>Vessichio, </em>79 Conn. App. 112, 116, 828 A.2d 1280 (2003). \u201cIn interpreting statutes, we are guided by well established tenets of statutory construction. [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 444, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The defendant cites <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>176 Conn. 613, 410 A.2d 453 (1979), which was decided under a special taxation statute applicable to farmland, for the proposition that tacking is not permitted. <em>McKinney </em>involved a statute that provided for the imposition of a conveyance tax when land classified as farmland was sold within ten years from the time of its initial acquisition or classification, whichever event occurred earlier. Id., 618. The <em>McKinney </em>plaintiffs claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in that it failed to provide a clear direction as to whether tacking was available to exceed the ten year holding period and thereby avoid imposition of the tax. Id., 616. In construing the statute to determine whether it was unconstitutionally vague, the court placed great reliance on language that treated a change in use as a conveyance for imposition of the tax. Id., 621. Our Supreme Court concluded that the legislature did not intend to permit tacking if the mere change of use by an owner who had not conveyed the land would trigger the imposition of the tax. We have no similar language in \u00a7 49-13 indicating a legislative intent that tacking is not permissible in calculating a statutory period of six years. The plaintiffs properly point out that \u00a7 49-13 (a) (1) (A) expressly authorizes the court to declare a mortgage invalid when <em>\u201cthe mortgagor or those owning the mortgagor\u2019s interest therein </em>have been in undisturbed possession of the property for at least six years . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) That statute does not require the petitioner to be in personal possession for six years before the action can be brought. Furthermore, subsection (c) of the statute expressly provides that \u201cif no evidence is offered of any payment on account of the debt\u201d within the six year period provided in subsection (a) \u201cthe court may render a judgment . . . declaring the mortgage . . . invalid as a lien against the real estate. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-13 (c). It is the six years of undisturbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>possession that is crucial to obtaining relief under \u00a7 49-13 (c), not six years of possession by one owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute would literally deprive a widow who inherited real estate from her husband of statutory relief until she had owned the land for six years in her own name. In <em>Lesser </em>v. <em>Lesser, </em>134 Conn. 418, 58 A.2d 512 (1948), our Supreme Court rejected such a view. It concluded that the mortgage in question was invalid under the predecessor statute to \u00a7 49-13 even though a widow had held the property for only two years following her husband\u2019s death. Id. It held that \u201cleaving the plaintiff in the possession of property which she might never be able to sell to advantage because of the unenforceable but undischarged mortgage of record does not make sense.\u201d Id., 427-28. We conclude that tacking may be used to fulfill the six year time requirement of \u00a7 49-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The defendant also claims that the court should not have admitted into evidence an affidavit by Mark Oppenheimer, an attorney who represented the Bern-steins in the sale of their land to Hall\u2019s clients, Roehrich-Koon. In the affidavit, Oppenheimer attested that he had paid the balance of the note secured by the Kasper mortgage as part of his responsibilities as a closing attorney representing the Bernsteins. We note that the court placed no reliance on the Oppenheimer affidavit in its findings. In fact, on the basis of the testimony of Bernstein and Kasper, which the court credited, it concluded that it was reasonable to infer that the mortgage was satisfied. We employ an abuse of discretion standard of review in challenges to evidentiary rulings and will not disturb those rulings on appeal when that discretion has not been abused, nor will we reverse a judgment on the basis of an evidentiary ruling unless that ruling was harmful. <em>Lusas </em>v. <em>St. Patrick\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corp., </em>125 Conn. 206, 209, 4 A.2d 333 (1939). There is no indication that the court placed any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>reliance on this evidence, and, thus, there is no showing of harm to the defendant. We therefore reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We need not address the defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence for the court\u2019s finding that the mortgage loan had been paid. The court found that M &amp; E, and its immediate predecessors in title, held undisturbed possession of the property for more than six years after the expiration of the time limited in the mortgage for full performance of the conditions thereof and prior to commencement of this action. The court also credited Kasper\u2019s testimony that there was no original mortgage note or deed in his possession or in the possession of either corporate entity. No evidence of the mortgage could be found, and no action was taken in furtherance of the mortgage until this case arose. On the basis of these findings, the court ordered the mortgage discharged pursuant to \u00a7 49-13. Therefore, this finding supports the discharge of the mortgage, and we need not address the sufficiency claim as to the payment of the mortgage loan, which is an alternate statutory ground for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\"> The plaintiffs are Robert H. Hall and M &amp; E Land Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\"> By virtue of a similar failure by the defendant to file a motion to strike against M &amp; E, we conclude that the claim of misjoinder also is waived as to M &amp; E.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
