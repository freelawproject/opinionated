Arcano, Jr.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants argue on appeal that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was totally disabled from March 6,1998, until the close of the evidentiary record. The defendants also argue that the method of calculation of attorney\u2019s fees awarded was not articulated by the commissioner and that the defendants were not given an opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiffs counsel regarding the amount of his fee petition. Because there is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s decision, and because we find that the claim regarding attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>fees is without merit, we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The basic facts of this case as found by the commissioners<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are not in dispute. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant board of education as a custodian. On January 13, 1997, the plaintiff suffered a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) while working in his capacity as an employee of the board of education at Rogers Magnet School. The plaintiff had been lifting credenzas weighing between 250 and 400 pounds with the assistance of his coworkers. Just after lifting one credenza by himself, he began to feel ill. He was subsequently taken to see Leonard Vinnick, his physician. Vinnick examined the plaintiff and found that he had speech difficulty and referred him to Evangelos Xistris, a neurologist, who concluded that the plaintiff had suffered a stroke. The plaintiff began to suffer paralysis to his left side, particularly to his head, arm and leg. As a result of the paralysis, the plaintiff began to drag his left foot and developed an infectious ulcer on the bottom of his foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Commissioner Robin L. Wilson concluded in her June 7, 2000 finding and award that the plaintiffs stroke had been caused by lifting the credenzas and therefore was work related and compensable. Commissioner Wilson also determined that the plaintiffs foot ulcer was caused by his paralysis, which resulted from the stroke, and was therefore also compensable. Commissioner Wilson ordered the defendants to issue voluntary agreements accepting liability for the plaintiffs injuries, to reimburse the plaintiff for any sick or vacation time used while he was out on total disability, to pay the plaintiff temporary total and temporary partial disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>benefits as determined, to reimburse the plaintiff for any out-of-pocket medical expenditures, to pay all reasonable and necessary medical bills related to the claim and to reimburse the plaintiff for the cost of deposing a particular physician. The commissioner\u2019s finding and award was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">After a formal hearing was held to determine the type and amount of benefits due the plaintiff, Commissioner James J. Metro issued his finding and award on October 2, 2001. Commissioner Metro concluded that the plaintiff was totally disabled from January 14 to August 3, 1997, and from March 6, 1998, to July 12, 2001, and ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiff temporary total disability benefits owed to him for these time periods at the stipulated base compensation rate of $364.67 per week. Commissioner Metro determined that the plaintiff was entitled to statutory interest on unpaid temporary total disability benefits during these periods and was also due attorney\u2019s fees as a result of the undue delay caused by the defendants\u2019 lack of compliance with Commissioner Wilson\u2019s June 7, 2000 order. He awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3850, i.e., 22 hours at the rate of $175 per hour. Commissioner Metro broke down the hours as follows: 9.5 hours at workers\u2019 compensation hearings; 4 hours of office conference time; and 8.5 hours of telephone conference time. The case was then appealed to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The board was presented with the primary issue that is now facing this court: Whether the commissioner had sufficient evidence on which to find that the plaintiff was totally disabled after March 6, 1998. In affirming Commissioner Metro\u2019s finding and award, the board emphasized the deposition testimony of Vinnick, which it found sufficient to support the finding of total disability. On the matter of attorney\u2019s fees, the board concluded that the record amply supported Commissioner Metro\u2019s conclusion of undue delay by the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>and held that the defendants effectively had waived their right to cross-examine the plaintiffs counsel. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">At the outset, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cWhen the decision of a commissioner is appealed to the board, the board is obligated to hear the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner and not to retry the facts. . . . The commissioner has the power and duty, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . Our scope of review of the actions of the board is similarly limited.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Lindon Tree Service, Inc., </em>80 Conn. App. 670, 673, 836 A.2d 1268 (2003). Although the court may not supplant its conclusions for those of the board, the court \u201cretains the ultimate obligation to determine whether the administrative action was unreasonable, arbitrary, illegal or an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saf-ford </em>v. <em>Owens Brockway, </em>262 Conn. 526, 534, 816 A.2d 556 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The defendants first claim that the board acted improperly as a matter of law by affirming Commissioner Metro\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was totally disabled as of March 6, 1998. The defendants rely entirely on Vinnick\u2019s deposition testimony in support of their claim. Specifically, the defendants argue that Vinnick testified that the plaintiff was disabled after March 8,1998, only by virtue of medical conditions that pre-existed his work-related accident, namely, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes and nephrotic syndrome. The defendants noted that Vinnick testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>that the plaintiffs foot ulcer did not exist prior to his work-related accident, but that it had \u201chealed\u201d as of March 3, 1999, and did not \u201cbreak down\u201d again until January, 2001. The defendants argue that because Vin-nick testified that the other conditions were not a result of the compensable injury and that the foot ulcer had healed, the plaintiff was not disabled during the relevant time periods because of his work-related accident, but rather as a result of his other preexisting conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We agree with the plaintiff that the defendants presented only the portion of Vinnick\u2019s testimony that was favorable to their position. The defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiff did not suffer from any work-related disability as of March 6,1998, presupposes that the foot ulcer suffered by the plaintiff did not result from his stroke.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, accepting this argument ignores Vin-nick\u2019s testimony that the plaintiffs stroke caused the foot ulcer in that the damage done to his central nervous system by the stroke triggered a change in his ambulatory pattern wherein more weight was placed on one of his feet. The physician further testified that even if the plaintiff had not suffered from a foot ulcer, he could not have gone back to work due to right hand tremors and changes in his mentation that were caused by the stroke.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The defendants argue that Vinnick\u2019s testimony that they have cited in support of their argument was \u201cunambiguous and uncontroverted\u201d as well as \u201cuncontra-dicted.\u201d However, Vinnick summed up the sequence of the plaintiffs maladies as follows: \u201cI think he developed a stroke .... As a result of that stroke, he developed this disequilibrium. As a result ... he developed a foot ulcer. This foot ulcer has been the harbinger of all sorts of bad things for him. It has prevented him from working because, as a result of his foot ulcer and after his surgery for his foot ulcer ... he went into congestive heart failure, and from then on, it has been nothing but a spiral downhill for him.\u201d Although the defendants refer to the plaintiffs stroke as entirely separate from his other conditions, Vinnick testified that the plaintiffs congestive heart failure \u201cwas contributed to by the fact that he had an infection going on in his foot ... as well as the fact that he had this foot ulcer that set all this up and that ... he developed, whether it was in Boston or a nursing home, he probably had ... a heart attack.\u201d The physician further testified that the stroke could have aggravated the plaintiffs diabetes, small vessel disease and hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">In addition to Vinnick\u2019s testimony, a letter from the plaintiffs podiatrist, James Gunipero, was admitted into evidence. Gunipero wrote: \u201cIn my opinion, [the plaintiff] has been totally disabled since [March, 1998] due to the repeated ulcerations and breakdown of his left foot. ... If [the plaintiff] had stayed in his job, he would have lost his foot, his leg and possibly more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We conclude that sufficient evidence existed to support Commissioner Metro\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs stroke caused or exacerbated conditions that prevented the plaintiff from working during the relevant time periods. Therefore, the board properly affirmed the findings of the commissioner on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The defendants\u2019 next claim is that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is well settled that a trial court has discretion to award a party attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Gianquitti </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>53 Conn. App. 72, 83, 728 A.2d 1133 (1999). This standard applies both to the amount of fees awarded and to the determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 252, 828 A.2d 64 (2003). Workers\u2019 compensation commissioners similarly have discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees, which is squarely bestowed on them by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a731-300 and 31-327.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The defendants argue that the commissioner\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was not detailed enough to ascertain the method of calculation used to determine the fee. The commissioner set out the award of attorney\u2019s fees as follows: \u201c[T]he [plaintiff] is entitled to have his attorney\u2019s fees, i.e., twenty-two hours at the rate of $175 per hour for a total of $3850 paid to [the plaintiffs counsel]. \u201d The commissioner also detailed the number of hours the attorney claimed to have spent working on various tasks. There is no mystery as to how the commissioner arrived at the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. If the commissioner had set forth the attorney\u2019s rate and time spent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>but then awarded a significantly higher or lower amount, then the commissioner would have been required to explain his or her deviation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Toth </em>v. <em>American Frozen Foods, Inc., </em>04069 CRB-04-99-06 (August 9,2000) (remanded for articulation where commissioner subtracted $1700 from amount requested without explanation).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also note that the defendants implied in their argument that this award may have risen above the 20 percent cap on attorney\u2019s fees set forth in the workers\u2019 compensation fee guidelines promulgated by the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This does not affect our decision in that (1) the attorney\u2019s fees awarded did not comprise more than 20 percent of the temporary total disability payments owed to the plaintiff and (2) this percentage may be exceeded where fees have been awarded because of undue delay, as in this case. See <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>59 Conn. App. 816, 823 n.10, 757 A.2d 1267 (noting \u00a7 5 of fee guidelines permits commissioner to determine attorney\u2019s fees based on time spent in contested cases or formal hearings), cert. denied, 254 Conn. 945, 762 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>A.2d 900 (2000); see also <em>Heene </em>v. <em>Professional Ambulance Service, Inc., </em>03743 CRB-06-97-12 (January 8, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The defendants also claim that they were denied the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiffs counsel regarding the amount of his requested fee. In support of their argument, the defendants cite the board\u2019s decision in <em>Cirrito </em>v. <em>Resource Group Ltd. of Connecticut, </em>4248 CRB-1-00-6 (June 19, 2001). In <em>Cirrito, </em>the board remanded the matter on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees because the denial of the defendants\u2019 request to cross-examine the plaintiffs counsel regarding the amount of his requested fee constituted a denial of procedural due process. The board concluded that the defendants\u2019 counsel had <em>adequately preserved </em>an objection for review and that the commissioner\u2019s ruling \u201c[cast] a shadow of doubt over whether the [defendants] were afforded a meaningful right to respond to this item of evidence, <em>given their articulated desire to cross-examine the preparer of the document.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\"><em>Cirrito </em>is plainly distinguishable from the present case. The record indicates that the defendants\u2019 counsel did not request an opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiffs counsel and also failed to object to the request for attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiffs contend that this lack of objection constituted a waiver of the right to cross-examine the plaintiffs counsel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">It is axiomatic that a trial court must \u201c[afford] the parties the opportunity to present evidence and to be heard on the issue of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. . . . [A] party seeking attorney\u2019s fees must satisfy the undisputed requirement that the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees and costs ... be proven by an appropriate evi-dentiary showing. . . . This protects the opposing party\u2019s right to litigate fully the reasonableness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Resurreccion </em>v. <em>Normandy Heights, LLC, </em>76 Conn. App. 642, 651, 820 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 917, 826 A.2d 1159 (2003). Until recently, it was unclear whether a party\u2019s right to litigate the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees is waived if it was not asserted at trial. Our Supreme Court has afforded us guidance on this issue in its recent decision, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>267 Conn. 456, 839 A.2d 589 (2004). In that case, the court clarified the evidentiary burden required in setting forth attorney\u2019s fees, holding that \u201cthe proponent must present to the court at the time of trial ... a statement of the fees requested and a description of services rendered.\u201d Id., 479. The <em>Smith </em>court determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 bare request for attorney\u2019s fees was inadequate under this standard, but the court did not reverse the award due to the opposing counsel\u2019s failure to object or to respond in any way to the request. Id., 481. The court concluded that \u201cthe defendants, in failing to object to the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees, effectively acquiesced in that request, and, consequently, they now will not be heard to complain about that request.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In this case, we note that although the defendants are not expressly challenging the evidence produced by the plaintiffs counsel regarding his requested fees, the record reveals that the plaintiffs counsel provided to the commissioner a detailed description of the tasks he performed and the time spent on each task. The record does not indicate that defendants\u2019 counsel in any way objected to this award or requested an opportunity to question the plaintiffs counsel on this issue. In light of the holding in <em>Smith, </em>we find this fact to be dispositive and will not overturn the board\u2019s affirmation of the commissioner\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-12\"> Frank A. Arcano, Jr., died in December, 2001. The commissioner\u2019s subsequent order in February, 2002, directed the defendants to remit payment for benefits to the plaintiffs estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> The issues of compensability and the amount of compensation benefits owed to the plaintiff were bifurcated, and findings were made by both Commissioner Robin L.

Metro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> The defendants emphasized Vinnick\u2019s testimony that the ulcer had not healed until March 3, 1999. Accepting this fact as true, their argument contesting the plaintiffs disability from March, 1998, until March, 1999, would be baseless unless it could be established that the foot ulcer did not result from the stroke.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\"> \u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: But the right hand tremors and the processing delay, would that have inhibited him from returning back to work?</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: Absolutely, in addition to all the other problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: [SJtanding alone, if he had processing delays and tremors in his hand\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: I don\u2019t see how he could go back to work with changes in his mentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: And that condition has remained the same since March 3, 1999, until the present?</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">\u201c[The Witness]: If anything, it has gotten worse. He\u2019s even more confused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\"> The defendants challenge the award of attorney\u2019s fees partly on the basis of their contention that they were not required to make temporary total disability payments to the plaintiff and that attorney\u2019s fees were therefore inappropriate because if no benefits were owed, then no undue delay was committed. We need not address this argument for two reasons. First, the defendants were ordered to do several things in Commissioner Wilson\u2019s finding and award on compensability, which they did not do. As they did not challenge that award, they cannot now contend that they were not obligated to perform these tasks. Second, because we have determined that the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was totally disabled during the contested time periods, the defendants\u2019 argument is not valid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\"> The plaintiffs counsel actually requested $4068.75 in attorney\u2019s fees and claimed to have spent 23.25 hours on this case. However, when the number of hours that the plaintiffs counsel testified to have spent on this case were calculated, they in fact equated to twenty-two hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> \u201c [I] t is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . .
