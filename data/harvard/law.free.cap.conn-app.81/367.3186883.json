We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. On December 18, 2000, the victim was in his room at the Madison Motel in East Hartford. At approximately 11 p.m., he answered a knock on his door. He opened the door slightly, and a man later identified as the defendant asked if \u201cBob lived here.\u201d Answering no, the victim opened the door and pointed to the door number. As he did so, he saw the defendant\u2019s hand move and felt a hard object strike his head. The victim was unsure whether the defendant had struck him with a knife, a hand or another object. The victim began to bleed profusely from a scalp wound, which eventually left a visible scar.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">As the victim staggered backward, the defendant entered the room, closed the door and ordered him to \u201cgive me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d The victim saw what he perceived to be the end of a folding knife in the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>dant\u2019s right hand, although he never saw a blade. He based that conclusion on forty years of experience with knives, including ownership of a knife company. The victim retreated into his bedroom, pursued by the defendant. After the defendant again stated, \u201cGive me what you\u2019ve got,\u201d the victim gave him his money clip, which contained about $200. Seeing a telephone, the defendant warned the victim not to call the police and stated, \u201cI have a gun in my pocket; I don\u2019t want to use it because it will bum a hole in my pocket.\u201d The defendant then left the room, taking the telephone with him. The victim called the police on his cellular telephone, and they arrived shortly thereafter. Officer Anthony Piacenta of the East Hartford police department observed both the victim bleeding from the head and blood on the carpeted floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">On March 25, 2002, the defendant was charged by substitute information with burglary in the first degree, burglary in the second degree and robbery in the first degree. After a trial by jury, the defendant was convicted on all charges and sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment, execution suspended after eleven years, and five years probation. At sentencing, the defendant acknowledged that he had committed the charged offenses. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The defendant first claims that as there was insufficient evidence in the record to support his conviction, the court improperly charged the jury in violation of his right to due process under article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution. The defendant failed to preserve his claim and now requests review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the claim under <em>Golding </em>because it is of constitutional magnitude and the record is adequate for review. As the defendant acknowledges, whether the evidence supporting the conviction was sufficient is a threshold issue to the resolution of his state constitutional claim. We must therefore consider first that threshold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence claim employs a two part test. \u201cFirst, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [jury] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nie-meyer, </em>258 Conn. 510, 517, 782 A.2d 658 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201cWhile . . . every element [must be] proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offensels], each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Newsome, </em>238 Conn. 588, 617, 682 A.2d 972 (1996). \u201c[I]n determining whether the evidence supports a particular inference, we ask whether that inference is so unreasonable as to be unjustifiable. . . . [A]n inference need not be compelled by the evidence; rather, the evidence need only be reasonably susceptible of such an inference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>omitted.) <em>State v. Niemeyer, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 519. Moreover, \u201c[i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 195, 672 A.2d 488 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Finally, we must remember that it is the jurors who are the arbiters of fact. \u201c[W]e do not sit as the seventh juror when we review the sufficiency of the evidence . . . rather, we must determine, in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 838, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The defendant first claims that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Section 53a-134 (a) (3) requires the use or the threatened use of a dangerous instrument. A dangerous instrument as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (7) is \u201cany instrument, article or substance which, under the circumstances in which it is used ... or threatened to be used, is capable of causing death or serious physical injury . . . .\u201d We must therefore determine whether, under the facts of this case, there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant used or threatened the use of such an instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The following evidence was before the jury. On December 18, 2000, the victim, answering a knock on his door, was struck violently over the head by the defendant. The skin of the victim\u2019s scalp was broken, and there was immediate and profuse bleeding. The defendant then entered the victim\u2019s room and closed the door, leaving the victim no means of escape. Facing his attacker, the victim saw what he perceived to be the end of a folding knife in the defendant\u2019s right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">From that evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, the jury reasonably could have inferred that a dangerous instrument, whether the end of a folding knife or some other object,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>in the attack. At the moment of the attack, the victim was facing the defendant. The victim saw the defendant\u2019s hand move and was then struck on the left side of the head. The location of the injury, when combined with the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant was holding in his right hand an instrument resembling the end of a knife, reinforces the inference that the defendant hit the victim in the head with the instrument in his hand. For that reason, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the defendant used a dangerous instrument in the course of committing the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Furthermore, we conclude that there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant threatened the use of a dangerous instrument. Although there is no definition of the word \u201cthreaten\u201d in our statutes, General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) provides that the commonly approved usage of the language should control. <em>State </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>8 Conn. App. 528, 541, 513 A.2d 1261 (1986). To threaten is \u201cto charge under pain of punishment.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Similarly, a threat is \u201c[a] person or thing that might well cause harm.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">' We have concluded that the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant used a knife or other object to strike the victim on the head. After striking the victim, the defendant entered the room and closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the door, leaving the victim no means of escape. With an object resembling the end of a folding knife in his hand, the defendant repeatedly ordered the victim to \u201cgive me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u201cJurors do not live in a fishbowl.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>37 Conn. App. 482, 486, 657 A.2d 654 (1995). \u201cIn considering the evidence . . . [j]uries are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>39 Conn. App. 502, 517, 664 A.2d 1185 (1995). A threat need not be explicitly uttered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>supra, 486; <em>State </em>v. <em>Littles, </em>31 Conn. App. 47, 54, 623 A.2d 500, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 902, 630 A.2d 72 (1993). Because the defendant had once inflicted severe punishment in the form of a blow to the victim\u2019s head, the jury had evidence from which it could infer that the defendant\u2019s subsequent orders to \u201cgive me what you\u2019ve got\u201d were made under pain of punishment. We conclude that the cumulative effect of the evidence, including reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s verdict that the defendant was guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of burglary in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) and burglary in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-102 (a). Specifically, the defendant argues that there was no evidence to support a finding that the defendant intended to commit the crime of threatening while in the dwelling, as was alleged in the information.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because we have concluded that the juiy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>finding that the defendant threatened the victim was supported by ample evidence, those claims, too, must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Because we conclude that sufficient evidence existed to support the defendant\u2019s conviction, his claim fails to satisfy the third prong of Golding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly instructed the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant acknowledges that his claim is controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s precedent, but raises it to preserve it for future review. The state argues, and the defendant concurs, that the instructions provided in this case have been held not to constitute reversible error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of that precedent, we conclude that the court\u2019s instructions were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

The first two questions relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>64 Conn.
