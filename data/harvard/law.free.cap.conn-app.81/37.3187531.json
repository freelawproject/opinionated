General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-111 and 17b-257. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the asset is inaccessible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The plaintiff, Andrew G. Evans, appeals from the judgment of the trial court, which dismissed his appeal from the decision of the fair hearing officer of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>dant department of social services (department). The hearing officer had determined that the plaintiff was not eligible for medical coverage for the months of January and February, 2001, a determination based on the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs accessible assets exceeded the limit permitted by the general assistance program during those months.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The pertinent facts are undisputed and are as follows. The plaintiff was admitted to Hartford Hospital on January 28, 2001, following a snowmobile accident. He remained in a medically induced coma from that time until March 15, 2001. An application for benefits under the general assistance program was submitted by the plaintiffs brother on March 9, 2001, which the plaintiff amended on March 18, 2001, after regaining consciousness. The plaintiffs amended application revealed assets in the amount of $6302.58, the bulk of which represented his individual retirement account (retirement account), which no one, other than the plaintiff, had knowledge of or access to while he lay in a coma. On March 19, 2001, the department sent the plaintiff a letter requesting verification that he had reduced his assets to less than $1000, the asset eligibility limit for the general assistance program. The plaintiff redeemed the full value of his retirement account, placing his assets below the $1000 limit by March 30, 2001. The department granted the plaintiff medical coverage commencing March 1, 2001, the first day of the month in which his assets were reduced below the limit required for eligibility under the general assistance program. The department denied the plaintiff retroactive eligibility for the months of January and February, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The plaintiff claims that the hearing officer and the court improperly concluded that his medical condition could not render his retirement account, an otherwise accessible asset, inaccessible for purposes of establish-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>mg general assistance program eligibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That claim hinges on the legal meaning of the term \u201cinaccessible asset\u201d as used in the department\u2019s Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4001.01.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Prior to reaching the plaintiffs arguments, we first must set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cAdministrative rules and regulations are given the force and effect of law.\u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 154, 285 A.2d 352 (1971). \u201c[I]t is [a] well established practice ... to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . This principle applies with even greater force to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own duly adopted regulations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MacDermid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>257 Conn. 128, 138-39, 778 A.2d 7 (2001). That traditional deference, however, \u201cis unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Municipal Employees Assn., </em>259 Conn. 251, 261-62, 788 A.2d 60 (2002). Neither party has contended that the department\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cinaccessible asset\u201d as contained in \u00a7 4001.01 is time tested. When presented with a question of statutory interpretation, our review is plenary. <em>Smith v. Yurkovsky, </em>265 Conn. 816, 821, 830 A.2d 743 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u201cAccording to our long-standing principles of statutory construction, our fundamental objective is to ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. . . . In determining the intent of a statute, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>80 Conn. App. 155, 159, 834 A.2d 725 (2003). In this instance, there are no extratextual sources to guide our construction of the term \u201cinaccessible asset,\u201d and we therefore focus our attention on the words of the statute to determine whether the plaintiffs retirement account was an inaccessible asset at the time he was in a medically induced coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4001.01 defines an inaccessible asset as \u201can asset which someone owns but, for some reason beyond his or her control, cannot readily convert to cash.\u201d The definition as contained in \u00a7 4001.01 of the manual is not limited to any particular class or classes of assets, but rather encompasses all assets that otherwise fit into the definition contained in \u00a7 4001.01 of the manual. The crux of the question presented in this appeal is whether a medical incapacity that renders the affected individual incapable of converting an asset to cash creates a situation that is beyond the control of the incapacitated individual. The manual contains no criteria for determining when conversion of an asset is \u201cbeyond [the individual\u2019s] control . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u201cWhere the legislature has not provided a specific definition of a word in a statute, we look to the common understanding of [that word] as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lehn </em>v. <em>Dailey, </em>77 Conn. App. 621, 626, 825 A.2d 140 (2003); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 17b-10 (b) (directing policy manual to be written in plain language as described in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-152 and 38a-295 to 38a-300, inclusive).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993) defines \u201cbeyond\u201d as \u201cout of the reach or sphere of,\u201d and defines \u201ccontrol\u201d as \u201cto exercise restraining or directing influence over\u201d and \u201cpower or authority to guide or manage.\u201d While the plaintiff was medically incapacitated, he had no actual power or authority to manage his retirement account; the retirement account was out of his reach for purposes of converting it into cash. Therefore, for the months of January and February, 2001, when the plaintiff was in a medically induced coma, his retirement account was an inaccessible asset as defined by the department\u2019s Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4001.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The department claims that the plaintiffs retirement account would be considered an available asset under federal medicaid law as that law has been construed in other states. The department argues that this construction should be imputed to \u00a7 4001.01 because eligibility under the general assistance program is modeled on medicaid eligibility. We disagree. One of the purposes of the general assistance program was to implement \u201ca state medical assistance program for persons ineligible for Medicaid . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17b-257. It is axiomatic that in choosing to construct that independent program, the state may establish its own independent eligibility criteria. We find, therefore, that medicaid decisions from other jurisdictions are unpersuasive for purposes of determining the breadth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>definition of an inaccessible asset contained in Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4001.01 for <em>Connecticut's </em>general assistance program.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The department also claims that \u00a7 4015.05C<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the manual provides a more specific definition of an inaccessible asset than does \u00a7 4001.01, one that requires an impediment raised by a third party. We disagree with that construction of \u00a7 4015.05C. Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4015.05C lists five assets considered inaccessible; the regulation provides, however, that inaccessible assets \u201cinclude, but are not limited to\u201d those contained in the list. \u201c[T]he statutory language \u2018but is not limited to\u2019 which is coupled with the enumeration of specific . . . [assets] is indicative of a legislative intent not to occupy the entire field by express definition . . . .\u201d <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 90, 411 A.2d 42 (1979). Concluding that this nonexhaustive list constitutes a legal definition of the term \u201cinaccessible assets\u201d for purposes of general assistance program eligibility would render the definition contained in \u00a7 4001.01 unnecessary. \u201c[Statutes should be construed so that no part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant and unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>omitted.) <em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 65, 81, 735 A.2d 321 (1999). To give purpose to the complete wording of both \u00a7 4015.05C and \u00a7 4001.01, the list of inaccessible assets contained in Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4015.05C must be read as illustrating types of inaccessible assets as opposed to defining inaccessible assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-12\"> In its memorandum of decision, the court raised, as an afterthought, whether it would not have been prudent to have appointed a conservator for the plaintiff. We leave for another day the question of whether the appointment of a conservator would affect the accessibility of an asset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> If the plaintiffs retirement account were considered an inaccessible asset for January and February, 2001, his assets during those months would total $570.94, placing those assets below the $1000 asset limit and making the plaintiff eligible for the general assistance program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> Uniform Policy Manual \u00a7 4001.01 provides in relevant part: \u201cAn inaccessible asset is an asset which someone owns but, for some reason beyond his or her control, cannot readily convert to cash.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\"> One of the tests established by General Statutes \u00a7 42-152 to determine whether a document is written in plain language is whether that document uses everyday words.
