(Wyatt), appeals from the judgment of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>granting the application for a prejudgment remedy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed by the defendants,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Motiva Enterprises, Inc., Shell Oil Company, Shell Oil Products Company and Equiva Trading Company (collectively Motiva), in connection with their breach of contract counterclaim. On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wyatt\u2019s sole claim is that the court, <em>Hodgson, J., </em>failed to consider properly its defense that its contract with Motiva had become illegal and unenforceable as a result of allegedly anticompetitive conduct by Motiva.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On October 16 and 17, 2002, the court held a hearing on the cross applications for a prejudgment remedy. In a twenty page memorandum of decision, the court granted Motiva\u2019s application, authorizing it to attach Wyatt\u2019s assets in the amount of $1,156,930 and denied Wyatt\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On December 16, 2003, after oral argument before this court, Motiva filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, alleging mootness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By that motion, to which there was no opposition filed, Motiva claimed that the appeal is moot because there is no practical relief that this court can render. Together with its motion, Motiva has filed a memorandum of decision by the court, <em>Sheedy, J., </em>dated December 8, 2003, of which we take judicial notice, rendering summary judgment in favor of Motiva on Wyatt\u2019s illegality defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201cMootness presents a circumstance wherein the issue before the court has been resolved or had lost its significance because of a change in the condition of affairs between the parties. . . . Since mootness implicates subject matter jurisdiction . . . it can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. ... A case becomes moot when due to intervening circumstances a controversy between the parties no longer exists. ... An issue is moot when the court can no longer grant any practical relief. . . . Whenever a claim of lack of jurisdiction is brought to the court\u2019s attention, it must be resolved before the court can proceed. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\u201cThe test for determining mootness of an appeal is whether there is any practical relief this court can grant the appellant. . . . [I]t is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... If no practical relief can be afforded to the parties, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>71 Conn. App. 43, 46, 800 A.2d 641 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal is moot because there is no practical relief that this court can render. The sole issue on appeal, whether Judge Hodgson failed to consider Wyatt\u2019s antitrust illegality defense or applied an improper legal standard in considering it, is no longer in the case. In light of Judge Sheedy\u2019s ruling that Wyatt\u2019s antitrust illegality defense was insufficient as a matter of law, which was a ground different from that addressed by Judge Hodgson,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we no longer have an appealable issue to consider for which we can grant practical relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\"> The granting or denial of a prejudgment remedy is deemed a final judgment for the purposes of appeal. General Statutes \u00a7 52-2781 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> The defendants, in addition to Motiva Enterprises, Inc., are Shell Oil Company, Shell Oil Products Company and Equiva Trading Company. We will refer to the defendants collectively as Motiva, as did the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> Wyatt appealed from the \u201cruling on the application for prejudgment attachments,\u201d which also denied Wyatt\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy. Wyatt\u2019s brief, however, is limited to its claim that the court improperly granted Motiva\u2019s application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> The appeal was argued before this court on December 8, 2003. We will address only those facts and procedures necessary for a disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\"> The illegality defense was pleaded by Wyatt as a special defense to Motiva\u2019s counterclaim. While this appeal was pending, Motiva filed a motion for summary judgment in the trial court on that special defense, as well as on other issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> In rendering summary judgment on that issue, Judge Sheedy found that the defense fails as a matter of law because the agreement did not require a violation of law and was capable of execution without violating the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\"> Even if we assume arguendo that Judge Hodgson improperly rejected Wyatt\u2019s illegality defense on the grounds as challenged, we could not vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the prejudgment ruling in light of Judge Sheedy\u2019s ruling rejecting that defense on another ground, not challenged in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
