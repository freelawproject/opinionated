The principal issue on appeal is whether the trial court properly rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>present defendant\u2019s special defense of reliance on the advice of counsel. We disagree with the court\u2019s holding. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and direct the entry of judgment for the present defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The plaintiffs, Theodore A. Verspyck and Patricia J. Verspyck, filed a two count complaint against the defendant Marilyn P. Altsheler.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that the defendant had brought a federal action against them \u201cwithout probable cause, and with a malicious intent unjustly to vex and trouble them.\u201d They sought damages for violation of subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 52-568.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The defendant had brought the federal action to contest the validity of a conveyance to the present plaintiffs of property located at 19 Valeview Road in Wilton. The issue she brought to the court was whether a deed of conveyance, signed by only one of two alleged cotrus-tees of an irrevocable trust, gave the plaintiffs good title to trust property. The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Squatrito, J., did not address the merits of this issue. It dismissed the defendant\u2019s complaint because the trust had not availed itself of the opportunity of recordation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 state court action for vexatious litigation, the defendant filed an answer and special defenses. The centerpiece of her defense was that she did not lack probable cause to bring the federal action because she had relied in good faith on the advice of her attorneys.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After a court trial, the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded them damages of $142,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the court held that the plaintiffs had not established malicious intent on the part of the defendant, it held that she had brought the federal action without probable cause to do so. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s special defense of reliance on the advice of counsel on the ground that she had failed to disclose relevant information to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On appeal, the defendant asks us to reverse the judgment of the trial court on five grounds. We agree with the defendant that the court was mistaken in rejecting her special defense. We therefore do not need to address the four other issues that she has raised.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>64 Conn. App. 624, 630-31, 781 A.2d 352 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">THE FEDERAL LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">To understand the present litigation, we must first examine the facts underlying the claim that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>dant presented to the federal court concerning ownership rights to a disputed parcel in Wilton. The focus of the defendant\u2019s claim was a 1978 conveyance of property to the plaintiffs by her deceased husband in a deed signed by her husband as trustee. The defendant claimed that this deed did not convey good title to the plaintiffs because it lacked the signature of her sister-in-law, a cotrustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The defendant\u2019s federal action was based on her interpretation of the terms of an irrevocable trust created in 1955 by Leonard Altsheler and Eleanor Altsheler, the defendant\u2019s parents-in-law. Although originally funded only with securities, the trust contemplated that it would include \u201call other property, real and personal, which, from time to time, the [settlors] may place under the operation of the trust . . . .\u201d The trust named the defendant\u2019s husband, Richard A. Altsheler, and Marilyn M. Altsheler, her sister-in-law, as cotrustees and principal beneficiaries under the trust. The trust was never recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In 1971, one of the settlors, the defendant\u2019s mother-in-law, transferred to the defendant\u2019s husband some real property that included the parcel that is the subject of the present litigation. This property was conveyed to \u201cRichard A. Altsheler, trustee,\u201d for $175,000. Although the sister-in-law attended the closing and served as a witness to the conveyance, her name was not on the deed. The defendant claims that the words \u201cas trustee\u201d were intended to identify the real property as trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In 1978, after a subdivision, the defendant\u2019s husband conveyed the disputed parcel to the plaintiffs by warranty deed, which he signed as Richard A. Altsheler, trustee. In the deed, her husband retained a right of first refusal with respect to any future sale of the parcel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>by the plaintiffs. The deed was not signed by the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In 1988, more than nine years after this conveyance, the defendant was appointed as the trust\u2019s sole trustee because of the death of her husband. She had been named successor trustee in 1985 after the death of her sister-in-law. She was also designated as the trust\u2019s sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Until April, 1997, neither the defendant nor any one else had ever challenged the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the disputed parcel. At that time, when the plaintiffs contemplated sale of the disputed parcel to a third party, a question was raised about whether the defendant might claim a right of first refusal. Relying on the advice of counsel, the defendant did not pursue such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In the process of consultation with counsel, the defendant noticed that the 1978 deed from her deceased husband to the plaintiffs was signed only by her husband and not by her sister-in-law, whom the trust had named as cotrustee. This discovery triggered her unsuccessful federal court action against the plaintiffs, the third party purchasers from the plaintiffs, and the financial and real estate institutions that had been involved in the sale of the property. She allegedly acted with the advice of counsel throughout the pursuit of her federal litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The federal court dismissed the defendant\u2019s action for failing to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Without addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim under the law of trusts, the court held that \u00a7 47-20 gave the defendant\u2019s husband statutory authority to uphold the 1978 conveyance of the property to the plaintiffs. The court stated that because the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>had never been memorialized by a \u201cseparate duly executed and recorded instrument,\u201d the plaintiffs were not bound by any trust related restrictions on the husband\u2019s power of conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">THE PRESENT LITIGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">At the conclusion of the federal proceedings, the plaintiffs brought the vexatious litigation action that is the subject of this appeal. The trial court held that the plaintiffs had proven that the defendant lacked probable cause to initiate her federal lawsuit. The court awarded damages in accordance with \u00a7 52-568 (1) to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The defendant\u2019s most persuasive contention on appeal from this judgment is that, even if the trial court properly concluded that she did not have probable cause to initiate the federal litigation, she is not hable to the plaintiffs because she established the special defense that she had acted on the advice of counsel. The court addressed and rejected this special defense. Our review of the court\u2019s conclusion of law is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>255 Conn. 268, 279, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001). We conclude that the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Under Connecticut case law, \u201c[a]dvice of counsel is a complete defense to an action of . . . vexatious suit when it is shown that the defendant . . . instituted [her] civil action relying in good faith on such advice, given after a full and fair statement of all facts within [her] knowledge, or which [she] was charged with knowing. The fact that the attorney\u2019s advice was unsound or erroneous will not affect the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The trial court found that the defendant had not been properly advised about the merits of her federal action. It is now conceded that her counsel in the federal litigation had failed to discover \u00a7 47-20, which was the basis for the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s federal claim. The court nonetheless concluded that the defendant had not established her defense of reliance on counsel because, in its view, the defendant had not disclosed to counsel all the information that counsel needed to give informed advice about the viability of the federal action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Counsel\u2019s View of Consultation with the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The record reveals that the defendant\u2019s counsel, Michael J. Franco, was an experienced trusts and estates lawyer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He testified that his advice about the merits of the defendant\u2019s trust claim was based on documentation that the defendant had supplied to him and his own independent legal research.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In his professional view, the 1955 trust required that a conveyance of the disputed party be signed by both cotrustees of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The defendant had provided for counsel copies of (1) the May 8, 1997 letter from the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney stating that the defendant did not have a right of first refusal, (2) the 1978 deed from her husband to the plaintiffs, (3) the 1971 deed from her mother-in-law to her husband that described her husband as trustee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>(4) the 1955 trust.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition to supplying these documents, the defendant had advised counsel of the importance of the dates of these various documents and their bearing on her contention that the disputed parcel was part of the trust.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Attorney Franco testified at trial that the defendant had fully complied with his requests for documentation. Moreover, he continued to advise the defendant that her lawsuit had merit even when he was alerted of the existence of \u00a7 47-20 by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel subsequent to the initiation of the federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Perhaps the trial court discounted the weight of this testimony as an effort by defense counsel to make amends to his client. The court did not, however, make such a finding in its memorandum of decision. Instead, it relied on two specific facts that the defendant, in the court\u2019s view, improperly failed to disclose to her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The Letter of Resignation</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The trial court held that the defendant should have disclosed to counsel a 1960 letter, signed by the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law, in which she resigned as trustee of the trust. This letter predated the 1978 conveyance of the disputed parcel to the plaintiffs. In the court\u2019s view, access to the resignation letter would have alerted counsel to a significant weakness in the defendant\u2019s federal claim. Knowing of this letter, counsel would have recognized that the 1978 conveyance to the plaintiffs did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>require the signature of a cotrustee because there was no longer a cotrustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The court discounted the defendant\u2019s assertion that she had not been aware of the existence of the resignation letter. The court held, and we agree, that as successor trustee, the defendant had a duty to familiarize herself with trust files maintained by the firm that had long represented the settlors and the trust. See <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 258, 597 A.2d 807 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The court did not, however, take sufficient account of the fact that the resignation letter was not the only relevant document in the trust files.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the defendant had examined the files, as she should have, she would have discovered several documents raising questions about the viability of the 1960 resignation letter. The files contained (1) a 1982 amendment to the 1955 trust that was signed by both the defendant\u2019s husband and her sister-in-law as cotrustees, accompanied by a statement expressing their mutual desire to amend the trust, and (2) various stock certificates and federal tax documents for the years 1983 and 1985 that identified the defendant\u2019s husband and her sister-in-law as trustees, and a 1978 letter addressed to her husband and her sister-in-law that canceled insurance of the disputed parcel. This documentation would have raised doubts about the effectiveness of the letter of resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">We recognize that the trial court made no finding about the significance of the contents of the file as a whole. It would have been good practice for the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>dant to have asked the court for an articulation. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs have not disputed the fact that each of the contradictory documents was in the trust files. Indeed, they themselves refer to the existence of the unexamined files as evidence of lack of good cause. They cannot now be heard to complain about the significance of the contents of these files.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We are persuaded that counsel could not have been misled by the defendant\u2019s failure to disclose the resignation letter. Knowing of the letter, counsel would have been obligated to conduct a comprehensive search of the trust files. If he had done so, he would have discovered the other documents that undermine the significance of the defendant\u2019s nondisclosure. Indeed, upon discovery of this contradictory documentation, the defendant\u2019s counsel made a deliberate decision that the defendant\u2019s federal action should go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s inference that the defendant\u2019s counsel would have reached a different legal conclusion if the letter had been discovered prior to the initiation of the federal action. We know of no authority for the proposition that, before initiating litigation, the defendant had the burden of deciding which of various inconsistent documents accurately described her sister-in-law\u2019s trust status at the time of the 1978 conveyance of the disputed parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Friendly Relationships with the Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The court also held that the defendant should have alerted her counsel to the fact that her husband and her sister-in-law had been on friendly terms with the plaintiffs throughout their residence at the disputed parcel. The court found it significant that, throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that nineteen year period, neither the defendant nor her sister-indaw had challenged the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 title.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Although the court concluded that the long period of acquiescence demonstrated that the defendant lacked probable cause to initiate her federal action, that conclusion is irrelevant with respect to reliance on advice of counsel. The documentation provided to counsel would necessarily have informed counsel of the existence of this time gap. Indeed, the record reveals that, before developing his legal strategy, the defendant\u2019s counsel knew that no complaints had been filed previously.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At trial, during cross-examination, Franco stated: \u201c[The defendant] didn\u2019t withhold that information from me. That was just a conclusion that I had already reached that nobody challenged the title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The court found it telling, however, that the defendant did not expressly inform counsel of the fact that her sister-in-law had never complained about the absence of her signature in the 1978 conveyance. We disagree. The record at trial did not establish that the sister-in-law, who did not attend the 1978 closing, was aware of the terms of the conveyance to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">According to the court, the defendant should have informed counsel of the long-standing friendly relationship between the plaintiffs and her husband and her sister-in-law. This is a puzzling conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">At trial, the plaintiffs testified that they had had only a few conversations with the defendant\u2019s husband during their residence at the disputed parcel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>period, according to the record, the plaintiffs had never had a conversation with the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law even though for some time she had lived near the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We disagree, therefore, with the court\u2019s conclusion that these nondisclosures materially impaired Franco\u2019s ability to assess the merits of the defendant\u2019s challenge to the validity of the 1978 deed. Even a friendly relationship would not have diminished the validity of the defendant\u2019s contention that the disputed parcel was trust property that had been conveyed in disregard of the terms of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In sum, we conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant was not entitled to rely on a defense of advice of counsel. None of the information that the court found the defendant to have withheld from counsel had any demonstrated impact on counsel\u2019s decision to file the federal action on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs did not establish their claim for damages for vexatious litigation. We empathize with the plaintiffs\u2019 understandable frustration with the length and expense of the litigation about their property rights. Nonetheless, the defendant established that she had brought her misguided federal action on the advice of counsel, who concededly should have discovered the dispositive statute before initiating the federal action. It follows that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the federal action was brought without probable cause to do so. <em>See Ancona </em>v. <em>Manafort Bros., Inc., </em>56 Conn. App. 701, 709, 746 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 953, 749 A.2d 1202 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-568 provides: \u201cAny person who commences and prosecutes any civil action or complaint against another, in his own name or the name of others, or asserts a defense to any civil action or complaint commenced and prosecuted by another (1) without probable cause, shall pay such other person double damages, or (2) without probable cause, and with a malicious intent unjustly to vex and trouble such other person, shall pay him treble damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 action originally included three additional counts. The plaintiffs withdrew one count charging the defendant Marilyn P. Altsheler with slander of title and withdrew two counts charging her attorneys, Michael J. Franco and Tiziana M. Scaccia, with having improperly represented her in the federal action. Thus, Altsheler was the only defendant at trial.

As noted previously, the federal court based that dismissal solely on the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 47-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> Although the plaintiffs also brought suit against attorney Franco\u2019s associate, Tiziana M.

In the alternative, the defendant also claimed that the 1960 resignation letter was never properly authenticated at trial.
