Knight, appeals from the judgment of the habeas court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and denying his petition for certification to appeal to this court. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion by failing to grant certification to appeal and (2) improperly found that he was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>We dismiss the petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. On March 2, 1998, the petitioner pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford? </em>doctrine to robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) and burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1). He was sentenced to a total effective term of imprisonment of thirteen years, suspended after nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>years, and four years probation, in accordance with a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The petitioner subsequently filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the petitioner claimed that his attorney, Martin Zeldis, was ineffective in that he (1) did not adequately advise the petitioner concerning options with regard to the guilty plea, (2) did not adequately advise the petitioner regarding options concerning potential defenses, (3) failed to challenge adequately the photographic identification procedure and eyewitness identification, (4) failed to pursue adequately his claim for exculpatory evidence, and (5) failed to ensure that the petitioner\u2019s pleas were knowing, voluntary and intelligent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the habeas court found that the petitioner had failed to prove any of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court stated that the petitioner had failed to prove that Zeldis\u2019 representation was deficient in any of the ways alleged in the amended petition or in any other way. The court further found that the petitioner had failed to prove actual prejudice as a result of Zeldis\u2019 representation. The court, therefore, dismissed the habeas petition and denied the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. The petitioner then filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201cIn a habeas appeal, although this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bewry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>73 Conn. App. 547, 548, 808 A.2d 746 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>cert. denied, 266 Conn. 918, 837 A.2d 801 (2003). \u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . For the petitioner to prevail on his [underlying] claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must establish both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s mistakes, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bewry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">After reviewing the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing that he has been denied a state or federal constitutional right. See id., 549-50. Additionally, the petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of persuasion that the court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that some type of injustice has been done. See id.; see also <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\"> Specifically, the petitioner claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in that he failed (1) to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation, (2) to challenge adequately the identification process and (3) to ensure that the petitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent Our review of the record reveals that at the habeas trial, the petitioner specifically abandoned his claims that counsel had \u201cfailed to conduct a sufficient investigation of the petitioner\u2019s case and his defenses thereto,\u201d and \u201cfailed to conduct a sufficient investigation into the petitioner\u2019s consistent claims of innocence.\u201d We therefore will not review the petitioner\u2019s challenge to counsel\u2019s pretrial investigation.

App. 313, 320, 759 A.2d 118 (2000) (declining to review claim not distinctly raised at trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\"> <em>North Carolina v.
