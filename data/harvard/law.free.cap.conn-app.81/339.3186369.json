Wilson, appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) reversing the determination by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the seventh district (commissioner) that the plaintiff was entitled to health insurance while he was receiving medical benefits for a compensable injury. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the board improperly determined that he was not entitled to benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b (a). We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">The commissioner found the following facts. The plaintiff was a member of the Stamford police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ment. On approximately July 8, 1991, the plaintiff suffered from a heart condition commonly referred to as a myocardial infarction. The plaintiff established his claim pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-433C<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and began receiving benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing before the commissioner, the parties narrowed the issue to whether the plaintiff was eligible to receive benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b when the plaintiff was receiving medical benefits, but not indemnity benefits. The commissioner determined that the plaintiff was entitled to receive benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b while he was receiving either indemnity or medical benefits, as a result of his compensable injury of July 8, 1991. The board reversed the commissioner\u2019s determination on the basis of its holding in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>University of Connnecticut Health Center, </em>4418 CRB-6-01-7 (July 23, 2002), and our holdings in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>61 Conn. App. 9, 762 A.2d 480 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>933, 767 A.2d 104 (2001), and <em>Auger </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>64 Conn. App. 75, 779 A.2d 773 (2001). The board held that the plaintiff was not entitled to benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b while receiving only medical benefits. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. \u2018The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). . . . It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 24-25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995)....\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cThe interpretation of \u00a7 31-284b is a matter of statutory construction. \u2018Statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u2019 . . . <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dohmann, </em>247 Conn. 274, 286, 722 A.2d 1205 (1998); <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 195, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The plaintiff argues that the board improperly interpreted the statutes. Section 31-284b provides in relevant part that an employer \u201cshall provide to the employee equivalent insurance coverage or welfare plan payments or contributions while the employee is eligible to receive or is receiving compensation pursuant to this chapter . . . The plaintiff contends that the word \u201ccompensation,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 31-284b, is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (4). Section 31-275 (4) provides in relevant part that \u201c \u2018[compensation\u2019 means benefits or payments mandated by the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, indemnity, medical and surgical aid or hospital and nursing service required under section 31-294d and any type of payment for disability ... or any adjustment in benefits or payments required by this chapter.\u201d The plaintiffs argument is that under \u00a7 31-275 (4), compensation includes medical benefits and because he was receiving medical benefits, he qualified for benefits under \u00a7 31-284b.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 9, we held that an employee who is receiving only medical benefits is not eligible for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b. Part of our holding in <em>Kelly </em>was premised on the language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-284b, which contained language different from the current statute. Section 31-284b was revised in July, 1991, by Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, \u00a7 8 (P.A. 91-32). Prior to the revision, \u201cthe employer\u2019s obligation to provide insurance coverage\u201d was conditioned on the \u201cemployee\u2019s receipt of . . . \u2018workers\u2019 compensation payments pursuant to this chapter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 14 n.4. Section 8 of P.A. 91-32 eliminated the phrase \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation payments pursuant to this chapter\u201d and substituted \u201ccompensation pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>this chapter . . . .\u201d In <em>Kelly, </em>\u201cwe [concluded] that the term \u2018compensation payments\u2019 as used in \u00a7 31-284b (a) does not include payments for medical care after the indemnity compensation period has ceased. The statute mandates that an employer is required to continue insurance benefits only while an employee is receiving \u2018compensation payments\u2019 for disability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [(act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.].\u201d <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The Supreme Court has, in <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992), interpreted the importance of the changes wrought by P.A. 91-32. In an illuminating opinion, the Supreme Court stated that the \u201clegislative history of No. 91-32 of the 1991 Public Acts indicates that it was intended to be a technical amendment. In commenting on the bill on the floor of the Senate, Senator James H. Maloney, senate chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, described the bill as \u2018the bill that makes technical recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation statute\u2019 and that \u2018cleans up the statute in regard to Workers\u2019 Compensation.\u2019 34 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1991 Sess., p. 836. Similarly, in presiding over a hearing of the joint standing committee, Maloney described the bill as \u2018a technical revision in [e]ffect to the existing statute.\u2019 Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, 1991 Sess., p. 16. He went on to state: \u2018So we\u2019re not really dealing with changes in the substantive legislation today. If there are substantive changes that are made because of the draft, we do want to hear about that because that\u2019s not what\u2019s supposed to have occurred with this instrument.\u2019 Id. Commissioner John Arcudi of the compensation review division, who participated in formulating the proposed revisions, also testified at the hearing that \u2018the purpose of the bill [was] not to change substance, but to try to simplify language and eliminate archaic language, reduce language if pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>sible . . . .\u2019 Id., p. 17. Finally, in commenting on the bill on the House floor, Representative Joseph A. Adamo, house chairman of the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, stated that the bill \u2018brings into focus a new section of describing all the definitions that were utilized and sprinkled throughout the entire chapter.\u2019 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1991 Sess., pp. 1959-60. When viewed together, the foregoing statements make clear that <em>the definition of 'compensation\u2019 provided in the 1991 amendment merely clarified the term as it had already been used throughout the act and did not enact any substantive change in the law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>supra, 346-47; see also <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>247 Conn. 126, 136-37, 717 A.2d 747 (1998) (P.A. 91-32 was technical amendment that did not change substantive law).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Because our Supreme Court has determined that P.A. 91-32 was a technical amendment, P.A. 91-32 did not change the law, but merely clarified the law. See <em>Greenwich Hospital </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>265 Conn. 511, 520-24, 829 A.2d 810 (2003). On the basis of the doctrine of stare decisis, we stand by our holding in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 16, that compensation \u201cdoes not include payments for medical care after the indemnity compensation period has ceased.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff accordingly was not entitled to benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In this opinion FOTI, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c provides in relevant part that \u201cin the event a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn order to maintain, as nearly as possible, the income of employees who suffer employment-related injuries, any employer who provides accident and health insurance or life insurance coverage for any employee or makes payments or contributions at the regular hourly or weekly rate for full-time employees to an employee welfare plan, shall provide to the employee equivalent insurance coverage or welfare plan payments or contributions while the employee is eligible to receive or is receiving compensation pursuant to this chapter ....

Id., 351 <em>(Covello, J., </em>dissenting). The plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (4) defines compensation to include medical benefits, stating: \u201c \u2018Compensation\u2019 means benefits or payments mandated by the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to . . . <em>medical . . . </em>aid . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)
