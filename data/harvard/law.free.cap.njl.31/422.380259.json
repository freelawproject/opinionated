Fraser and said bank to the plaintiff and to said Beckett, the said bank filed in the Court of Chancery of New Jersey, a bill of foreclosure of said mortgage against the said Jane <em>W. </em>Fraser and others, but the plaintiff was not made defendant in said foreclosure and no notice was taken of the said conveyance and release to him; and a decree of the said court for a sale of the whole of said mortgaged premises was had, to satisfy the residue remaining unpaid on the said bond and mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-8\">Under this decree and execution issued thereon, the sheriff of the county of Burlington duly advertised and sold the whole of said mortgaged premises to the bank, and made a deed for the whole, bearing date September 27th, 1851, which was duly acknowledged and recorded on the 30th day of the same month, <em>(pro ut </em>the deed and certificate of record).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-9\">The bank having purchased said property by deed dated May 29th, 1852, duly executed and recorded, conveyed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u25a0said property by the same description to the defendant, John L.

At the date-aforesaid, she sold and conveyed to the plaintiff a parcel of her said tract, described in the deed as beginning at the northwest corner of a lot of land belonging to Henry Beckett,, thence running along other land of said Jane W. Fraser,, north, sixty feet to a stake standing eighty-three feet from Third street, and bounding on an eight foot alley; thence west, along said eight foot alley seventeen feet to a siakej thence, still west along a continuation of said alley or street, said street being thirty feet wide, to a stake; thence south, sixty feet to a stake, corner to other land of said Hopkinsou; thence east, along said Hopkinson\u2019s land one hundred and thirty-three feet, to the place of beginning. Shortly after-wards Miss Fraser sold and conveyed that part of her land which laid north of Beckett\u2019s lot and between Third street- and the parcel sold to the plaintiff, to the said Henry Beckett, and in her deed to him abuts it on the north along an eight foot alley. The defendant became the owner of the other part of Miss Fraser\u2019s land in 1852, and has since enclosed it. It is stated in the case, in connection with the conveyance to the plaintiff, that the land conveyed \u201c is described as bounded upon an alley and street proposed to be laid out;\u201d and it is further stated that \u201cthe street and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>alley mentioned in the conveyance to the plaintiff and said Beckett were never opened and used as a street.\u201d Had such alley and street been opened as referred to, they would have \u25a0extended from Third street nearly half way to Second street.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The-cases relied upon in the argument, in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the use of the alley and street referred to in his deed, are cases where it was held, that the circumstances showed that the street in question had been dedicated to the public use. Where the party owning land in a city or village lays off streets, <em>sells </em>lots in conformity with a plan made public, especially if a map made by the public authority is referred to, and the streets are opened and used, it is justly held that he thereby dedicates the streets so laid off as public highways. <em>Den </em>v. <em>Dummer, Spencer </em>86; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 <em>Zab. 712; Cincinnati </em>v. <em>White, 6 Peters </em>438; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Mayor of N. Y., </em>11 <em>Wend. </em>493 <em>; Matter of 29th street, N. Y, </em>1 <em>Hill </em>189; <em>Walter </em>v. <em>City of Worcester, </em>6 <em>Grey </em>548.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">But no facts are stated in this case which will justify us in holding an alley or street to have been thus dedicated. No reference is made to a street extending through the block from Third to Second streets, the west line of the plaintiff\u2019s land not being half way between these streets; nor do any \u25a0circumstances show an intention to open a street as a public thoroughfare. We are not informed who proposed to lay \u25a0out the alley and street referred to. For anything that appears, the plaintiff may have intended to incur that expense; or, as is more probable, such an alley and street may have been proposed to be opened by the public authorities of the borough. It is expressly stated, after the lapse of nearly twenty years, that they were never in fact opened and used; that is to say, no such alley or street ever existed. They are not alleged to be ways of necessity. They do not appear to have been laid down upon any public or private map of the premises. The question then resolves itself into this: \u25a0does the description in the plaintiff\u2019s deed, of itself or in connection with the description in the deed to Beckett, amount to a grant to the plaintiff of the alley and road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>described, or of a right- of way, or to a covenant that he shall have such a right ?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As to the coincidence of a similar description in two deeds for adjoining parcels of land, it can have no effect upon the case before us, unless it would justify us in holding that there was a dedication of an alley and road to the public use. No authority has been produced for the projiosition that the reference in a conveyance of land by definite metes and bounds to an alley or road, as abutting on the premises conveyed, where no such alley or road exist, can be construed to be a grant of such an alley or road. In the case of <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>2 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>96, a lease had been made of a piece of ground abutting upon an \u201c intended way of thirty feet,\u201d which would have been on the land of the lessor. The defendant having purchased this land, built a wall which extended three feet upon the intended way. It appeared that the plaintiff was entitled to a way of necessity over this intended way, but the court held that he had no right to the whole thirty feet; and Justice Holroyd said, I think correctly, \u201cthe intended way is no jiart of that which was granted, and the declaration of an intention is not an implied grant. In the case before us the abuttal is not upon an intended way, that is upon a way not yet opened, but which the grantor says he intends to open; but upon an alley and street described as actually existing, and which, so far as appears by the deed, both parties supposed actually did exist. It is a case of misdescription. Had the land over which this alley and street were described as running been at the time the property of any other person than the grantor, it would jiot have been supposed that they were included in the grant which, in terms, excludes them. That it happened to belong to the grantor, does not enlarge the description of what was granted. Nor is there any authority for holding that such a description implies a covenant to open a street or to allow a right of way. There are apt and plain words customarily used for granting a right of way, or as a covenant that a way shall be opened, which are not used in this conveyance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>which, I think, we must presume were not used because no such thing was intended. What equitable rights the evident misdescription \u25a0 in the plaintiff\u2019s deed may entitle him to, we are not called upon to consider. In my opinion, our judgment must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
