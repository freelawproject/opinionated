Dig. </em>801, <em>pl. </em>57.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">Without stopping to consider these objections to the mode of proceeding by the commissioners of appeal, a sufficient and conclusive objection to the additional assessment is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that it was made upon property which, at the time, was neither owned nor occupied by the prosecutors. Had the opportunity been afforded, they could have shown to the commissioners of appeal, as they did to this court by proof taken under rule, that the property had been sold aud conveyed by a judicial sale to another person, and that the title had passed out of them nearly three months before the time when the additional assessment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The act provides that all personal and real estate within .this state, owned by individuals or by corporations, shall be liable to be taxed. But no one is to be taxed for property -which he neither owns nor occupies.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Let the assessment be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Elmer, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AeG\">Cited in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardin, </em>5 <em>Vroom </em>81.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-16\"><em>Rev., p. </em>1149, <em>\u00a7 </em>56.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
