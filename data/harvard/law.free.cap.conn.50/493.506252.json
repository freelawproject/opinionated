Eight years later the plaintiffs obtained a judgment against <em>O, </em>the widow, for $418, and recorded a judgment lien upon the real estate, and now sought to foreclose the lien.

By the act of 1878 any real estate subject to an execution is subject to a judgment lien. The interest vested in the judgment creditor by such a lien is as permanent as a mortgage and of the same nature. <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>47 Conn., 408. And the lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as mortgages. Sec. 5 of the act. <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>White, </em>26 Conn., 317. It is of no consequence just what the interest of the judgment debtor is, the court will foreclose it without defining it. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>16 Conn., 517; <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Haviland, </em>18 id., 102; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>23 id., 592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-13\">2. Mrs. Underwood took a life estate in the land. <em>Larned </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>17 Pick., 339. And under the provision with regard to the use of the principal of the estate so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>necessary, slie took a fee in so much of the land as should be thus needed.

Underwood, all the rents, profits and income of my estate, both real and personal, and so much of the principal as may be necessary for her support and maintenance, and the support, maintenance and education of my daughters, Ellen J\u201e Lizzie G., Ada J., Annie H., and Miriam L. Underwood, for and during the natural life of my said wife Emily C.\u2019,\u2019 The testator died in 1872. A part of the property bequeathed was real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The plaintiff in 1880 recovered a judgment against the said Emily C. Underwood for $418.83, and filed a lien to secure the same, under the statute, upon the real estate devised to her. This suit is a proceeding to foreclose that lien. The Superior Court found the facts and reserved the case for the advice of this court. In the finding it appears that the personal property is practically exhausted and that the real estate remaining is now worth about $3,400. Of the daughters named two are dead, one is married, and two remain dependent for their support and education upon the property so given.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The first question is,\u2014what estate did the widow take in the property ? We think she took a life estate only. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>appears to be the clear intention of the testator. It is given for life expressly. A life estate in express terms is not a fee simple in the lands remaining unsold. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>46 Conn., 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Did she take an estate in her own right, or in trust? In <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>40 Conn., 438, it was held that similar language, but identical in substance and meaning, raised a trust. A reference to that case and the authorities cited is all that is now necessary. The cases are not entirely harmonious, but the current of the authorities seems to be in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The next and principal question is,\u2014did Mrs. Underwood take an attachable interest in the property? The general rule is that all one\u2019s property is liable for his debts. But to that rule there are many exceptions. All property exempt by statute from attachment is within the exception; so is ordinary trust property designed to secure a maintenance for some unfortunate debtor; so also the income of trust property where it is payable to the beneficiary at the discretion of the trustee. The exceptions indicate unmistakably that it is the policy of the law not to take from the debtor his means of subsistence\u2014not to take from him his necessary daily food and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Now in this case the estate is small, barely sufficient to raise an annual income of two hundred dollars, out of which, except as the principal may be resorted to for that purpose, three persons are to be supported. While a court of equity will lend its aid to appropriate the surplus of trust funds, after affording a reasonable support to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>to the payment of his debts, yet we apprehend that it will not interfere to deprive a widow of a pittance, confessedly too small for her support, left by her husband for that purpose. ' In <em>Genet </em>v. <em>Beekman, </em>45 Barb., 382, the marginal note is : \u201c It is only in cases where a clear surplus will exist, after a reasonable sum has been appropriated to the support of the person for whose benefit a trust was created, that courts of equity are authorized to interfere in behalf of judgment creditors, and divert a portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>income or annuity to the payment of the debts of such person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Again: the interest of this mother, even if it was capable of separation, could not be separated from the interests of the daughters and transferred to creditors without seriously interfering with or entirely defeating the purposes of the trust. <em>The </em>supposed justice to creditors may and probably would work grievous injustice to third persons; and when such will be the result it requires no argument to show that a court ought not to interfere. But the interest of the widow is inseparable from that of the daughters. The income is small\u2014clearly insufficient for their comfortable support\u2014 and some portion of the principal, how much the court was unable to find\u2014will be required for that purpose. It is equally impossible to tell how much will hereafter be required for the support of the widow alone, or either of the daughters. Any one of the beneficiaries may at any time be in a situation to require the whole income. Under these circumstances it is impossible to fix upon any definite portion of the income and say that that shall be appropriated to the payment of the widow\u2019s debts. We are therefore disposed to approve the principle enunciated in <em>Ontario Bank </em>v. <em>Boot, </em>3 Paige, 482, so far at least as to apply it to a case in which the trust fund is as small as it is in the present case, that \u201c the interest of a judgment debtor in a trust created partly for his benefit and partly for the benefit of another, cannot be taken on execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We advise judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
