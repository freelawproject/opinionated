Ash-mead, * * the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged,\u201d Clarence bargained, sold and conveyed to William all his, Clarence\u2019s, interests in the assets of Aslimead Bros. On the 24th day of the same month William EL. executed a written instrument whereby he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>assigned and transferred to JolmT. Walker all moneys that he, William, ;,mav be entitled to have from insurance effects from Ashmead Bros, on property of all kinds which was lost by fire in the building on Bay street, * * * destroyed by fire on the night of the 23rd instant, in trust, however, that lie shall collect the said money and at once distribute the same pro rata without any discrimination or preference among all my creditors.\u201d It constitutes <em>* </em>* Walker his attorney in fact to demand, sue for and receive all said moneys for the purpose aforesaid, and in his, WTilliam\u2019s, name and stead, or in that of Ashmead Bros., of whom William is \u201cthe successor by purchase and assignment,\u201d to execute all proper receipts and releases. On the 27th of the month the plaintiffs sued William and Clarence, doing business as Ashmead Brothers, in an action of assumpsit, and on the 29th procured a writ of garnishment, which was served the same day on one Foster, an agent of the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company. The plaintiffs' action was brought to recover on two promissory notes dated January 22nd, 1884, each for the sum of $200 principal, and maturing, one thirty, and the other sixty days after date. \u2019 To this action defendants appeared on April 7th, the day the declaration was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b692-6\">On April 24th William H. and Clarence, partners under the firm name aforesaid, parties of the first part, executed a deed to Whitfield Walker, reciting that they were indebted to divers persons in sundry sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of money which they were unable to pay in full, and granting, bargaining, selling and assigning to said \"Walker, his heirs and successors, all the lands, tenements, goods, chattels, stock, promissory notes, debts,' claims, demands, property and effects' of every description belonging to them, either as partners or individuals, wherever the same may be, in trust, to sell and convert the property into money, and to collect the debts and demands, and out of the proceeds of such sales and collections to pay: 1st, expenses, costs and charges of the trust; 2nd and 3rd, out of the proceeds of the sales of the individual property of each partner to pay his individual debts, and the surplus to carry into the fund for the payment of partnership creditors ; 4th, to pay rent due for premises occupied by them; and, 5th, to apply the residue to the liabilities of the said parties of the first part, in full or ratably, according to the sufficiency, giving him full power to demand, recover and\u2018receive of and from every person or persons all property, debts and demands due, owing and belonging to the parties of the first part-, or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b693-5\">On May 5th there was judgment by default, followed by a final judgment on the 17th for $405.54 and costs. On the same 5th day of May the garnishee answered, stating that the loss by fire had been adjusted at $3,000, and that the company was indebted to Ash-mead Bros, in this sum; but that on the morning next after the fire, and before the writ of garnishment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>served, tlie garnishee was notified that Ashmead Bros, had assigned all their interest under the said fire loss to John T. Walker, and that since then a copy of the assignment had been served, the same being annexed to the answer. The answer admits the question, as to whom the money is due, to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b694-5\">On the 24th of August John T. Walker filed an affidavit- entitled in the above cause, and to the effect that the money in the possession of the garnishee was <em>bona fide </em>his property 'as trustee for the purposes mentioned in the above deed of assignment to him, and upon this claim a jury was sworn on January 11th, 188\u00bb, to try the issue thus made between plaintiffs and said Walker; and having heard the evidence they found for the claimant. A motion for a new trial was made and overruled, and judgment was rendered that claimant had the right of property in the hands of the garnishee, and that he recover costs of the plaintiffs, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b694-6\">The bill of exceptions shows that upon this trial the plaintiffs, who are plaintiffs in error, introduced -in evidence the record of their suit, and rested, and thereupon the claimant introduced the above bill of sale from Clarence to William H. Ashmead, and the deed of assignment from the latter to such claimant, John T. Walker, and rested. The plaintiffs then put in evidence the deed of assignment from the Ashmeads to Whitfield Walker, and also placed on the stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>William H. Aslimead, who testified as follows : My name is William H. Ashmead ; I was one of the firm of Ashmead Bros., composed of Clarance H. Ashmead and myself; I am the William EL Ashmead to whom the bill of sale was made by Clarence El. Ashmead, and I am the person also who made the assignment to John T. Walker, and also one of the parties who made the assignment in the name of Ashmead Bros, to Whitfield Walker. At the time I made the assignment to John T. Walker I was indebted individually in small amounts to one or two persons, and owed my brother, Clarence El. Ashmead, the six thousand dol lars mentioned in the assignment from my said brother to myself. My brother and myself finding it best to continue the business after the said bill of sale was executed, rescinded the sale, and afterwards executed the assignment to Whitfield AValker. At the time we executed the assignment to Whitfield Walker we were insolvent. At the time that my brother Clarence sold out to me, we did not announce any dissolution of our copartnership in the papers, or any other way. We afterwards found that I could not go on in business satisfactorily to both of us, and we thus rescinded the sale and made the subsequent assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b695-5\">The following instructions were asked by the paintift's, but refused and the refusal of each of them excepted to :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b695-6\">1. If the jury find from the evidence that at the time of the execution of the assignment to John T. Walker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>'William. H. Ashmead was indebted to Clarence II. Ashmead. his former partner, in the sum of five thousand and odd dollars, as a part of the consideration of liis purchase, then the said assignment to Walker, as-a. matter of law, is fraudulent and void, and the jury-must find for the plaintiffs, and that the funds in the hands of the garnishee is subject to plaintiffs\u2019 garnishment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b696-5\"><em>2. </em>Partners may make <em>bona fule </em>sales of their proper! y at any time before their creditors acquire a lien, but a sale directly or indirectly to one of the partners with a stipulation that he will pay the firm\u2019s debts, is not such a <em>boom fide </em>sale so as to divest the property of its character as firm property primarily liable for firm debts, and a partnership creditor by his attachment or garnishment create a lien paramount, to the claim of the partner so purchasing, or an assignee of said partner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b696-6\">The Judge, however, charged the jury at the request of the claimant as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b696-7\">1. If you believe from the evidence that the assign rneht from Clarence Ashmead to William Ashmead, and -the assignment to John T. Walker, were made in good faith, and without any intent to hinder, delay or defraud the plaintiffs or other creditors of Ashmead Bros., you w-ill find for the claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b696-8\">2. If you believe from the evidence that tlie assignment from Clarence Ashmead to William Ashmead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was not made in contemplation of insolvency, and was made without intent to hinder, delay or defraud the plaintiffs o\u00ed1 other creditors of Ashmead Bros., and that the assignment to Walker was in good faith, and without any such intent, you will find for the claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-5\">There were also charges as to the form <em>of </em>the verdict, which need not be recited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-6\">Each of the charges given at the request of the claimant was excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-7\">The other huts in the case are stated in the opinion of ilie court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b697-8\"><em>A. </em>W. <em>Cockrell </em>&amp; <em>Son </em>for Plaintiffs in Error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-9\">The appellants sued Ashmead Bros., the Insurance Company being impleaded as garnishee, and recovered judgment. John T. 'Walker, as assignee of Wm. II. Ashmead, claims the funds disclosed in the answer of the garnishee, and the question raised by the Record' is whether the claim of the assignee or the appellants as judgment creditors is superior.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-10\">The evidence makes it clear that the funds sought to be condemned to the partnership debts were partnership assets, at the time Clarence H. Ashmead sold out to his brother, Wm. H. Ashmead, his interest in the partnership concern. And it further appears that at the time of the transfer, the appellants were part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>nership creditors of the firm, and that the firm was in fact insolvent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-5\">Bnrwell on assignment says in relation to the power of one partner to assign his interest:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-6\">\u2018 \u2018The power of each partner over his own share or \u2018 \u2018interest of the partnership property stands upon an \u201centirely different footing from his power over the-\u201cpartnership property generally. No partner owns \u2018 \u2018absolutely any part of the property. His interest is-\u201can interest subject to the interest of his co-partners. \u201cWhile therefore he cannot transfer his share of any \u2018 \u2018specific partnership property, he may transfer the interest which he has in the firm property, subject to \u201cthe rights of his copartners; and he may make a \u201cvalid assignment of his interest to trustees for the-\u201cbenefit of his creditors. But such an assignment will \u201cpass only so much as may remain after the payment \u2018 \u2018of 'the firm debts and a settlement with his copartners.\u201d Page 126, and cases cited. To the same effect is Arnold vs. Wainwright, 80 Am. Dec. 449, note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-7\">Conceding that the sale by Clarence H. Ashmead worked a dissolution of the partnership, the rules of law applicable to such a dissolution, as well as the terms of the sale, impressed upon Wm. H. Ashmead, in reference to the partnership \u2018funds, the relation of trustee to effect a fair settlement and distribution thereof. Stephens vs. Orman, 10 Fla., 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-8\">This principle is thus formulated elsewhere. The relation of partners, their rights and duties, as between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>themselves, are to be governed by the rules applicable to trustees and agents ; and the trust relation which exists between them is not terminated with the dissolution, but continues until a final adjustment and settlement of the partnership affairs is had. Story\u2019s Part. (5 Ed.), Secs. 174, 378; Pomeroy vs. Benton,. 57 Mo., 531; Filbarn vs. Ivers, 4 Southwestern Rep., 674, (Missouri) June 6th, 1877.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-5\">So too, in the case of Marsh vs. Bennett, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Michigan, it was held that by the dissolution of a partnership, provision being made in the articles of dissolution for the payment equally of all the creditors of the firm, by the partner who purchases the interest of the retiiing partner and continues the business, such partner is a, trustee for the creditors of the firm; and a subsequent assignment by such partner of the partnership effects, preferring certain creditors to others, and contrary to the stipulation in the articles of dissolution, is fraudulent and void. 5 McLean, 117; Yale vs. Yale, 33 Am. Dec., 393; Wilson vs. Robertson, 21 N. Y., 587; Dimon vs. Hazard, 32 N. Y., 65; Roop vs. Henon, 17 N. W. Rep., 353; same case, 15 Nebraska, 73.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b699-6\">In the case at bar Clarence H. Ashmead sold his interest in the partnership asssets for five thousand dollars, the purchase money being evidenced by the note of W. H. Ashmead for that amount executed to Clarence H. Ashmead. And this note was outstanding at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tlie time of the assignment to Walker, and being an indebtedness of Win. H. Ashmead, was protected by the terms of the assignment; Clarence II. Ashmead was therefore an equal beneficiary to the' extent- of five thousand dollars in <em>that </em>assignment thus made to do double duty, in that it shields partnership assets from partnership debts and secures to the retiring partner a lien on partnership funds to secure an individual debt-, due from his late partner, growing out of partnership transactions to the disparagement of Clarence\u2019s partnership debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b700-5\">The protection we rely c&gt;n is thus stated in a recent Alabama decision:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b700-6\">\u201cOne member of a firm, whether existing or dissolved, cannot appropriate the assets of the firm in \u201csatisfaction of his individual debts.\u201d 3 Southern Rep., 677; Cannon vs. Lindsey (Alabama), Feb. 2, 1888; 85 Ala., 198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b700-7\">And Conroy vs. Woods (California), 78 Am. Dec., 605, and notes, supports the proposition that although partners may make a <em>bona fide </em>sale of their property at any time before their creditors acquire a lien; a sale directly or indirectly to one of the partners. with a stipulation that he will pay the firm debts, is not such a <em>'bona Hele </em>sale as to divest the property of its character as firm property, primarily liable for firm debts, but that where partner buys interest of copartners in firm, agreeing to pay the firm debts, the property of the firm remains bound for such debts just as before the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The result wrought by the decision of the court denying the right of the judgment creditor to appropriate any part of the funds garnisheed is striking.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b701-5\">Clarence II. Ashmead who, as a member of the firm of Ashmead Bros., stood to the appellants, as to the judgment they were seeking to enforce, in the relation of a defendant therein, has not only placed the assets of the firm beyond the reach of his creditors, but by the contrivance of two conveyances, one from him to his brother, and the otlier from his brother to an assignee for the use of Clarence as a creditor of William, has managed to get <em>an interest </em>in the proceeds of the firm assets, discharged by the ruling of the court, from the claims of <em>Ms </em>creditors. This is not an accidental but a necessary result of the judgment assigned, as error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b701-6\">Tlie assignee is bound, by the terms creating his trust relation to this fund, to pay to Clarence H.

J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">In Griffin vs. Orman, 9 Fla., 22, and 10 Fla., 9, there had been a partnership between Sewell, Orman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Young, tinder the name of Orman &amp;\u2022 Young, and the period for which, by the articles, it was to last, had expired, but there had been no settlement between the partners when, in January, 1829, Orman and Young sold their entire interest in tlm assets of the concern, for the consideration of $17,500, payable out of such assets, which payment was so made, to Sewell, he assuming the payment of the debts of the firm, and executing to them a bond, with surety, conditioned for the payment to the same. It \u00abwas contended that Or-man and Young had an equitable lien upon the partnership property for amounts which they had paid for the firm subsequent to the sale. This court held that this would, notwithstanding the dissolution, have been so, but for the agreement represented above, the effect of which was, in its opinion, that the partnership stock became the exclusive property of Sewell, and that Sewell should pay all the debts, and the indemnity bond being for security that he would do so. It will be borne in mind, says the opinion, that the partnership property was not left in the hands of Sewell to pay the debts with, he assuming the trust. \u201cThe partnership is dissolved, a final settlement made, an ageement entered into between the partners, m which the creditors are not parties, that Sewell as a part of the purchase money will pay all the debts, not specifically out of the partnership property, but that he would pay them, and as an indemnity against their suffering he executes a bond with security.\u201d That the fact of taking this bond .with security, and the fact of Orman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Young covenanting to warrant and defend against tlieir claim seemed conclusive that it was the intention of the parties that the effects assigned to Sewell should be appropriated to his private use. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In West vs. Chasten, 12 Fla., 315, there was an agreement between the remaining and the retiring partner by which the former assumed the debts of the firm, and agreed to save the latter harmless from the same, the latter transferring and assigning all his interest in the goods to the remaining partner, and it was held that by virtue of this agreement the partnership property ceased to be joint property and the lien or equity of the retiring partner to have a sale of the property and an application of it to the joint debts was destroyed. See also Upson vs. Arnold, 19 Ga., 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">It is true that these decisions wrere in ('.ases between former partners, but it must be remembered that the right or equity of a creditor of a partnership to have partnership assets applied to partnership debts as against the individual creditor of any one member of the firm is through that lien or equity of the other member or members, which constitutes the right of the latter to such application.

Not only do the authorities cited above affim this proposition, but the two decisions of \u25a0this court are in conflict with the theory of the second instruction asked by the plaintiffs in error, that a stipulation upon the part of the purchasing partner to pay the firm debts would be fatal to the good faith of the transfer and to the divestiture of the joint ownership or partnership character of the property. There are numerous authorities in which the transfer has been sustained and the vesting of the property in the purchasing partner as his individual property has been upheld as against the claims of firm creditors, notwithstanding the presence of such a covenant; and such covenant may be the sole consideration of the. transfer. West vs. Chasten, 12 Fla., 315; Story on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Partnership, sec. 359; Croone vs. Bivens, 2 Head, 339; Dimon vs. Hazard, 32 N. Y., 65; Ladd vs. Griswold, 4 Gilmer, 25. The fact, however, is that in the case before us there was no such stipulation, and whether such an obligation upon the purchasing partner is implied by the terms of the agreement is a proposition which has not been argued. If it is implied, the same result follows as if it had been expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">It is also- settled that where one partner transfers his entire interest in the partnership concerns to his copartner so as to vest in him the partnership assets as his sole property, a dissolution of the partnership results' and the purchasing partner may as against any simple creditor of the partnership, assign the property thus vested in him as his sole property, for the pay ment of his individual indebtedness. He can exercise the same dominion over it that he might over any other individual property. A partnership creditor can of course sue him and his former partner, and can levy his execution on the separate property of either, just as he could have sued both before the transfer and have levied upon the joint property of the firm or the several property of either member; but if before a lien has been thus or otherwise acquired by the firm creditors, the purchasing partner shall have transferred or applied in good faith the effects which have thus become his sole property; to the payment of his individual indebtedness, such transfer or assignment will be sustained in fayor of such individual creditor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Tlie selling- partner by liis sale parts with the equity which he would have retained had. he not sold his interest to his copartner, and thus falls the support of any claim to such, equity by the partnership creditors. The pm-chasing- partner as sole owner has as against partnership creditors the same right to apply this sole property to his individual debts, as he has against individual creditors who have not acquired a lien thereon by attachment or execution, or in other lawful manner.

Ashmead, the plaintiffs in error had no lien on the partnership assets. This is clearly affirmed by the authorities cited above. Clarence had the right to make, and William the right to receive the transfer, and if done in good faith the partnership creditors cannot complain. Its validity depends upon the <em>bona fides </em>of the transaction. Ex parte Williams, 11 Vesey, 3. Where, at the time of the transfer, the firm and each of the partners are insolvent, as in Ex parte Mayon, 4 De G., J. &amp; S., 663. or the firm had become insolvent, as in Yale vs. Yale, 18 Conn., 185; Roop vs. Herron, 15 Neb., 73; and Wilson vs. Robertson, 21 N. Y., 587, the transfer it seems should be held fraudulent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>void as to tlie partnership creditors, yet tlieie is authority in the effect that insolvency at such time will not of itself avoid the transfer. Howe vs. Lawrence, 9 Cush., 553; Allen vs. Center Valley Co., 21 Conn., 130. These parties'may have been entirely solvent at that time, notwithstanding their subsequent insolvency; Ex parte Fell, 10 Vesey, 347; Ex parte Walker, 4 De G., F. &amp; J., 508; and if they were, such subsequent condition will not defeat a transfer which was not otherwise fraudulent. That they were insolvent when the second assignment was made, does not prove that they were so a month and a half before, when the sale was made by Clarence to William H. Ashmead. Though there is testimony that this sale was rescinded, there is none that John T. Walker was a party to the rescission, or that it was before the assignment to John T. Walker, or that the assignment of the insurance money to John T. Walker was ever abrogated. The questions of the good faith of the sale to William and of his assignment to John T. Walker, and of .intent to hinder and defraud creditors, and of whether or not such sale was made in contemplation of insolvency, were fairly submitted to the jury and they have passed upon them, and there is no testimory in the record that justifies interference by an appellant court with their verdict ? To justify such interference it must appear at least clearly that they have erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The authorities cited by plaintiffs in error do not conflict with the views we have announced. The lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>guage quoted from Burrill on Assignments, sec. 88, p. 120, refers to an assignment by one partner to 'a third person, and in the same section it is said that an assignment by one partner of all his interest to the other partner or partners works a dissolution of the firm, and the remaining partner may thereupon execute an assignment of all his property, whether belonging to the previous firm or not, in trust for the payment of his individual creditors. Pomeroy vs. Benton, 57 Mo., 531; was a suit, involving questions between partner's, as was Filburn vs. Ivers, 92 Mo., 388. In Marsh vs. Bennett, 5 McLean, 117, the assignment by the retiring partner to the remaining one was expressly \u201cfor the purpose of paying \u201d off the partnership creditors, thus constituting or continuing him a trustee for such creditors. Conroy vs. Woods, 23 Cal., 626, holding that where a partner buys the interest of his copartners and agrees to pay the firm debts, the property of the firm remains bound for such debts just as before the sale, is in conflict with the above decisions of this court and the weight of authority. Yale vs. Yale, and Wilson vs. Robertson are explained above, as is Dim on vs. Hazard, Cannon vs. Lindsey holds that the appropriation of partnership assets by one partner to the payment of his own debts, without the assent of the other partner is a fraud on the latter; and Arnold vs. Wainwright, 6 Minn., 358, in so far as it should be noticed, involves the question of the rights of the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>cliaser of land, partnership assets, where the legal title stood in the name of a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We will not be understood as expressing an opinion whether or not the assignment to John T. Walker is, one for the benefit of his individual creditors, and excluding creditors of the firm; nor as intimating that Clarence Aslnnead would be permitted to be paid out of the proceeds of the assignment as against the plaintiffs in error, even if the sale to him had not been rescinded ; Strattan vs. Tabb, 8 Ill., App., 225; nor as committing ourselves as to whether the use made of the \u201cclaim\u201d proceeding in this case is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
