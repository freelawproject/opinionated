This amicable division took place shortly after the date of the will, within two or three years, and the parties have since that possessed the shares as allotted to them by said amicable division.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">\u201c The said Nancy is now living, and has no children; the said Sarah Parkinson and Rachel Hall are dead.

Manifestly the words in the will, \u201c but if my daughter Nancy should he called away by death, without an law\u00f1il heir,\u201d mean if she should die without issue, for the devise over is to her sisters. And the sisters are not to take while any issue of the first taker is in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The limitation over, is therefore after an indefinite failure of issue. The case is governed by the principle laid down in EichT elberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 9 Watts 450. It is quite unlike Turner <em>v. </em>Fowler, 10 Watts 325, where, the gift of the particular estate was to the first takers for life, and the devise over was to take effect at a defined point of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
