The legislative history of section 5-323 of the General Obligations Law shows a strong legislative concern with safety. III. Defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff waived its right to proceed against defendants is invalid, in light of section 5-323 of the General Obligations Law, which renders void and unenforceable any agreement whereby a contractor attempts to exculpate himself from liability to others arising from his negligence in the construction of real property. <em>(Cullen v Naples, </em>31 NY2d 818.) IV. Even if section 5-323 of the General Obligations Law did not exist, the exculpatory clause would be void because it does not explicitly include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>negligent conduct. <em>(Ciofalo v Vic Tanney Gyms, </em>10 NY2d 294; <em>Van Dyke Prods. v Eastman Kodak Co., </em>12 NY2d 301.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b707-4\"><em>John F.

II. The subject waiver clause was entered into by the parties at arm\u2019s length, did not contract away liability and did not violate public policy. <em>(Ciofalo v Vic Tanney Gyms, </em>10 NY2d 294; <em>B.V.D.

The insurer paid the owner its damages pursuant to the policy, and then this action was commenced against the contractor and subcontractors, in which the owner is the named plaintiff but the actual plaintiff in interest is the insurer as a subrogee.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Defendants argue that the contractual provisions quoted above constitute a defense to this action. Plaintiff contends, however, that so viewed, those contractual provisions are unenforceable pursuant to section 5-323 of the General Obligations Law, which provides as follows: \"Every covenant, agreement or understanding in or in connection with or collateral to any contract or agreement affecting real property made or entered into, whereby or whereunder a contractor exempts himself from liability for injuries to person or property caused by or resulting from the negligence of such contractor, his agent, servants or employees, as a result of work performed or services rendered in connection with the construction, maintenance and repair of real property or its appurtenances, shall be deemed to be void as against public policy and wholly unenforceable.\u201d In response, defendants contend first that this section is applicable only to building maintenance contracts, and alternatively, that even if it is applicable to contracts such as this, the General Obligations Law section does not speak to the provisions involved in this dispute. As to defendant\u2019s first argument, although it may not be without some support in the legislative history of the section, such arguments are inappropriate in the face of the clear, explicit, and unambiguous language of the statute, speaking as it does of \"any contract or agreement affecting real property\u201d. However, we agree that the section does not prohibit contractual provisions of the type involved in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Insofar as damages for injuries are in fact compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>under an insurance policy mandated by contract, a provision waiving all rights to recover for those same injuries other than from the proceeds of the insurance policy does not constitute a violation of the statute. A distinction must be drawn between contractual provisions which seek to exempt a party from liability to persons who have been injured or whose property has been damaged and contractual provisions, such as those involved in this suit, which in effect simply require one of the parties to the contract to provide insurance for all of the parties. Absent any indication of overreaching or unconscionability, such provisions violate neither section 5-323 of the General Obligations Law nor any other public policy (see <em>Hogeland v Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr Co., </em>42 NY2d 153).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
