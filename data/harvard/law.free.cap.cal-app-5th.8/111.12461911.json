On February 18, 2014, he entered into a plea agreement in Fresno County Superior Court case No. F14901527 (the current case) whereby he pled no contest to felony grand theft involving property with a value exceeding $950 (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 487, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>subd. (a)) and admitted having served three prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)), one of which resulted from his 2010 conviction for three counts of second degree commercial burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (b)). In return for the plea, the People dismissed a count of second degree commercial burglary and a separate case, and agreed to have the five-year term, to which the parties stipulated, run concurrent with the sentence in a misdemeanor matter. On March 18, 2014, defendant was sentenced to five years pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h)(5), calculated as the middle term of two years for the current offense plus one consecutive year for each of the prior prison term enhancements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, \u201cthe Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act\u201d (Proposition 47 or the Act), which went into effect the next day. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1089 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 362].) The Act reduced certain felony or wobbler drug- and theft-related offenses to misdemeanors, unless committed by an ineligible defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lynall </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1108 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 129]; see \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (i).) Insofar as is pertinent here, it also provided a mechanism by which a person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction of a felony that was made a misdemeanor by the Act, can apply to the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction and have the felony offense designated as a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">One of the felonies reduced to a misdemeanor by the Act was second degree commercial burglary. Now if a person \u201center[s] a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours\u201d and takes or intends to take property with a value not exceeding $950, that person has committed shoplifting, absent circumstances not present here. (\u00a7 459.5, subd. (a).) This change affects the convictions underlying one of defendant\u2019s prior prison term enhancements. We hold, however, that a previously imposed sentence enhanced by a section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term is not altered by the granting of a Proposition 47 application reducing the felony that gave rise to that prior prison term to a misdemeanor. Accordingly, although the trial court should have formally designated defendant\u2019s 2010 convictions as misdemeanors, it correctly refused to alter defendant\u2019s current sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>PROPOSITION 47 PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Proposition 47 went into effect on November 5, 2014. (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 10, subd. (a).) On November 12, 2014, defendant filed a handwritten \u201cPetition Request\u201d seeking reclassification of his current grand theft offense to a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">On December 2, 2014, defendant\u2019s attorney filed a formal motion to recall defendant\u2019s sentence under Proposition 47, declare his current grand theft offense to be a misdemeanor, and have defendant immediately released from custody. The People opposed the motion on the ground the property stolen was valued at over $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">A hearing was held on defendant\u2019s motion on December 17, 2014. Defense counsel acknowledged she had no evidence to controvert the information contained in the probation report that the property taken was above the $950 threshold, but she requested a continuance to check defendant\u2019s prior record. She asserted one of his 2010 convictions was potentially reducible to a misdemeanor, which could affect the sentencing in the current case. The court granted the request. The prosecutor confirmed with the court that the continued hearing would be to address whether defendant\u2019s 2010 convictions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(Super. Ct. Fresno County, 2010, No. F10901079) were reducible to misdemeanors under Proposition 47 and, if reduced, whether that reclassification invalidated the use of the resulting prison commitment as a section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Through counsel, defendant filed a supplemental motion to recall his sentence. Defendant requested that the court declare his 2010 convictions in case No. F10901079 to be misdemeanors, and resentence him in his current case without the section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement that was based on his 2010 case. The People responded that they did not oppose defendant\u2019s application to designate his three burglary convictions in case No. F10901079 as misdemeanors. However, they objected to defendant\u2019s motion to strike or dismiss any enhancement imposed pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b) in defendant\u2019s current case as a result of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">A further hearing was held on March 4, 2015. The court observed defendant had abandoned his claim that his current offense should be reclassified as a misdemeanor, and so the issue was whether defendant\u2019s section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement that was based on felony convictions for second degree burglary, was no longer valid because of the reduction of that crime to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47. After argument on that issue, the court concluded reduction of the offense to a misdemeanor did not negate the status of the offender having served a prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>term and being a recidivist subject to enhanced imposition of sentence. Accordingly, it denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The issue before us is whether the additional one-year term imposed by the trial court pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), for defendant\u2019s prior convictions in case No. F10901079, must now be stricken because, subsequent to defendant\u2019s March 18, 2014, sentencing in the current case, those prior convictions were reduced to misdemeanors pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant says it must. The Attorney General disagrees, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Section 1170.18, enacted as part of Proposition 47, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c(1) A person who has completed his or her sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c(g) If the application satisfies the criteria in subdivision (f), the court shall designate the felony offense or offenses as a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In 2010 defendant was convicted, in case No. F10901079, of second degree commercial burglary. (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (b).) At the time, every form of second degree burglary was a \u201cwobbler,\u201d meaning it could be a felony or a misdemeanor, depending on the punishment imposed. (\u00a7 461, former subd. 2; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>see \u00a7 17, subd. (a); <em>People v. Williams </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 461, fn. 6 [111 Cal.Rptr.3d 589, 233 P.3d 1000].) As defendant served a prison term for the offenses, they were classified as felonies. (See \u00a7 17, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Proposition 47 added section 459.5 to the Penal Code. Under subdivision (a) of that statute, shoplifting is now \u201cdefined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed\u201d $950, and it \u201cshall be punished as a misdemeanor,\u201d unless the offender has certain specified prior convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the probation officer\u2019s report, defendant has no such prior convictions, and the Attorney General does not claim otherwise. Thus, had the Act been in effect when defendant committed the offenses for which he was convicted in case No. F10901079, he could only have been convicted of misdemeanor shoplifting under section 459.5, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Subdivision (k) of section 1170.18 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny felony conviction that is . . . designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, except that such resen-tencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 29800) of Division 9 of Title 4 of Part 6.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Defendant argues his convictions in case No. F10901079 are now misdemeanors \u201cfor all purposes\u201d except certain firearm restrictions. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).) We find <em>People </em>v. <em>Park </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 782 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 307, 299 P.3d 1263] <em>(Park) </em>instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In <em>Park, </em>the defendant\u2019s sentence for his current crimes was enhanced by five years under section 667, subdivision (a), based on his prior conviction of a serious felony. <em>Prior to </em>the defendant\u2019s commission of his current crimes, however, the trial court reduced the prior offense to a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 787.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In <em>Park, </em>the Court of Appeal held the conviction remained a prior serious felony for purposes of sentence enhancement under section 667, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(a), but the California Supreme Court disagreed: \u2018\u201c[W]hen the court in the <em>prior proceeding </em>properly exercised its discretion by reducing the . . . conviction to a misdemeanor, that offense no longer qualified as a prior serious <em>felony </em>within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a), and could not be used, under that provision, to enhance defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 787, first italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In <em>Park, </em>the reduction occurred prior to the defendant\u2019s commission of his current crimes. <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 787.) Here, the reduction to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (1) occurred <em>after </em>defendant\u2019s commission, conviction, and sentence for his current crimes. In <em>Park, </em>in response to an argument that <em>People </em>v. <em>Feyrer </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 426 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 226 P.3d 998] (cited by the trial court here) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 370 [1 Cal.Rptr. 669, 348 P.2d 102] were contrary to its conclusion, the court stated: \u201cThere is no dispute that, under the rule in those cases, defendant would be subject to the section 667[, subdivision ](a) enhancement <em>had he committed and been convicted of the present crimes before the court reduced the earlier offense to a misde</em>meanor.\u201d <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 802, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The issue before us is not whether defendant\u2019s convictions and prison commitment in case No. F10901079 can now be used to enhance a future sentence pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), should defendant commit a new felony upon release from custody on his current sentence. Rather, the issue is whether defendant\u2019s current sentence, enhanced pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), must now be altered because, <em>subsequent </em>to defendant\u2019s sentencing, the convictions that gave rise to that enhancement were reduced to misdemeanors pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (1). In other words, does the Act operate retroactively? To make that determination, we look to the language of section 1170.18 and to voter intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Section 3 specifies that no part of the Penal Code \u201cis retroactive, unless expressly so declared.\u201d This language \u201cerects a strong presumption of prospective operation, codifying the principle that, \u2018in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, a statute will not be applied retroactively unless it is very clear from extrinsic sources that the Legislature [or electorate] . . . must have intended a retroactive application.\u2019 [Citations.] Accordingly, \u2018 \u201ca statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed ... to be unambiguously prospective.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 324 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 824, 278 P.3d 1182].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">An \u201cimportant, contextually specific qualification\u201d to the prospective-only presumption regarding statutory amendments was set forth in <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948] <em>(Estrada). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>(People v. Brown, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 323.) That qualification is: \u201cWhen the Legislature [or electorate] has amended a statute to reduce the punishment for a particular criminal offense, we will assume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the Legislature [or electorate] intended the amended statute to apply to all defendants whose judgments are not yet final on the statute\u2019s operative date. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Although <em>Estrada\u2019s </em>language is broad, the California Supreme Court has emphasized the rule\u2019s narrowness <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hajek and Vo </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 1144, 1196 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 234, 324 P.3d 88], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rangel </em>(2016) 62 Cal.4th 1192, 1216 [200 Cal.Rptr.3d 265, 367 P.3d 649]): <em>\u201cEstrada </em>is today properly understood, not as weakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in section 3, but rather as informing the rule\u2019s application in a specific context by articulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative [or voter] act mitigating the punishment for a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The question of retroactivity is ultimately one of legislative\u2014or, in this case, voter\u2014intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shabazz </em>(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 303, 312-313 [187 Cal.Rptr.3d 828]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Nasalga </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 784, 793 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 88, 910 P.2d 1380].) \u201cTo resolve this very specific retroactivity question, we apply the well-settled rules governing interpretation of voter intent . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shabazz, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.4th at p. 313.) \u201c \u2018In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, . . . \u201cwe turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u201d [Citation.] . . . The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate\u2019s intent]. [Citation.] . . . When the language is ambiguous, \u201cwe refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] In other words, our \u2018task is simply to interpret and apply the initiative\u2019s language so as to effectuate the electorate\u2019s intent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Robert L. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 900-901 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 69 P.3d 951].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Act clearly was intended to lessen punishment for \u201cnonserious, nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 3, subd. (3), p. 70), in order \u201cto ensure that prison spending is focused on violent and serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>offenses . . . .\u201d <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7 2, p. 70.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This purpose was conveyed to voters, both in the text of the then-proposed law and in the arguments supporting Proposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38; <em>id., </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39; <em>id., </em>text of Prop. 47, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, p. 70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Nowhere, however, do the Act or the ballot materials reference section 667.5, subdivision (b) or mention recidivist enhancements, and the Act made no amendments to any such provisions. Two of the Act\u2019s expressly stated purposes, however, are to \u201c[ajuthorize consideration of resentencing for anyone who is currently serving a sentence for any of the offenses\u201d that would be made misdemeanors by the Act, and to \u201c[r]equire a thorough review of criminal history and risk assessment of any individuals before resentencing to ensure that they do not pose a risk to public safety.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 3, subds. (4), (5), p. 70.) Voters were assured the Act would keep dangerous criminals locked up (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), and that it would not require automatic release of anyone: \u201cThere is no automatic release. [Proposition 47] includes strict protections to protect public safety and make sure rapists, murderers, molesters and the most dangerous criminals cannot benefit.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u201cImposition of a sentence enhancement under . . . section 667.5 requires proof that the defendant: (1) was previously convicted of a felony; (2) was imprisoned as a result of that conviction; (3) completed that term of imprisonment; and (4) did not remain free for five years of both prison custody and the commission of a new offense resulting in a felony conviction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Tenner </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 559, 563 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 840, 862 P.2d 840].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cSentence enhancements for prior prison terms are based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the defendant\u2019s status as a recidivist, and not on the underlying criminal conduct, or the act or omission, giving rise to the current conviction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gokey </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 932, 936 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 134]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 158-159 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dutton </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 505, 507 [71 P.2d 218].) Thus, the purpose of an enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b) \u2018\u201cis \u2018to punish individuals\u2019 who have shown that they are \u2018 \u2018\u201chardened criminal[s] who [are] undeterred by the fear of prison.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Preston </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1115 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 340].) The enhancement\u2019s focus on the service of a prison term \u201cindicates the special significance which the Legislature has attached to incarceration in our most restrictive penal institutions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Levell </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 749, 754 [247 Cal.Rptr. 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">A person who refuses to reform even after serving time in prison is clearly and significantly more dangerous than someone who merely possesses drugs for personal use or shoplifts. We cannot conclude, from the language of the Act or the ballot materials, that voters deemed such persons to be nonserious, nondangerous offenders, and so intended the Act to reach back to ancillary consequences such as enhancements resulting from recidivism considered serious enough to warrant additional punishment. Accordingly, section 3\u2019s default rule of prospective operation, and not Estrada\u2019s narrow rule of retroactivity, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>People v. Flores </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 461 [154 Cal.Rptr. 851] (Flores) does not lead to a different result. In that case, the defendant was convicted in 1966 of possessing marijuana. In 1977, he sold heroin. His sentence for the 1977 offense was enhanced by one year, pursuant to section 667.5, because of his 1966 conviction. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>at pp. 464, 470.) On appeal, the defendant claimed the enhancement was improper under <em>Estrada, </em>because of a 1975 statutory amendment that made possession of marijuana a misdemeanor. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>at p. 470.) The appellate court agreed, finding the statutory language clear and unambiguous on the issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 472.) The court concluded: \u201cIn view of the express language of the statute and the obvious legislative purpose, it would be unreasonable to hold that the Legislature intended that one who had already served a felony sentence for possession of marijuana should be subjected to the additional criminal sanction of sentence enhancement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473.) The court found the new laws constituted \u201ca legislative declaration that the old laws were too severe for the quantum of guilt involved\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>and distinguished a situation in which the California Supreme Court refused to give retroactive effect to an amendment to section 17 in part because \u201c[t]here was no suggestion there, as there is here, that the Legislature intended retroactive application\u201d <em>(Flores, supra, </em>at pp. 473, 474).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In <em>Flores, </em>as in <em>Park, </em>and in contrast to the present case, the current offense was committed <em>after </em>the earlier offense was reduced to a misdemeanor. Moreover, the Act contains no clear expression with respect to retroactivity as was found in <em>Flores. </em>The closest it gets is the statement, in subdivision (k) of section 1170.18, that \u2018\u201c[a]ny felony conviction that is . . . designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) shall be considered <em>a misdemeanor for all purposes, </em>except [specified firearm laws].\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">This language, the italicized portion of which is identical to that contained in section 17, subdivision (b), is not necessarily conclusive, however. <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at pp. 793, 794.) It has not been read to mean a defendant can avoid an imposed sentence enhancement in his current sentence by having the prior offense subsequently reduced to a misdemeanor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 802.) Nothing in the language of the Act or the ballot materials indicates an intention to override the operation of section 667.5, subdivision (b), at least retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Defendant served a prison term for the prior convictions at a time when the offenses were felonies. It is the service of that prison term, coupled with defendant\u2019s continuing recidivism, that section 667.5, subdivision (b) punishes. Absent a clear statement of the electorate\u2019s intent to the contrary\u2014 which we do not find\u2014we conclude that, because defendant served a prison term for his convictions in case No. F10901079 at a time when the offenses were felonies, and had his current sentence enhanced accordingly <em>before </em>the convictions were reduced, he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">This conclusion does not render surplusage or eviscerate the \u2018\u201cfor all purposes\u201d language of section 1170.18, subdivision (k). Our determination is one of the electorate\u2019s intent. \u2018\u201cRules such as those directing courts to avoid interpreting legislative enactments as surplusage are mere guides and will not be used to defeat legislative intent.

Although defendant expressly asked the trial court to declare them to be misdemeanors, the trial court apparently overlooked making a formal order to that effect. Defendant asks us to remedy this oversight. The Attorney General agrees that if we find defendant\u2019s request was for reclassification (we do) and it is unclear whether an order was entered to that effect (none was), then the 2010 convictions should be reduced to misdemeanors pursuant to Proposition 47. So that the record is clear, we will direct the trial court to enter a formal order designating defendant\u2019s convictions in case No. F10901079 as misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">The question whether a defendant is eligible for resentencing on a section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement after the underlying felony has been reclassified as a misdemeanor pursuant to Proposition 47, is pending review in the California Supreme Court.
