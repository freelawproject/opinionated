The hospital suspended Plaintiff, who requested a peer review hearing challenging the suspension. Every level of administrative review upheld the suspension. Plaintiff did not seek mandamus review of these decisions. Plaintiff then filed suit against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Cedars), its medical staff, and the specific doctors involved in the summary suspension decision. The hospital filed an anti-SLAPP motion, contending that Plaintiffs claims arose out of a protected activity\u2014 the medical staffs peer review process\u2014and that Plaintiff could not show a probability of success on the merits. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Known as the anti-SLAPP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> statute, section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that a \u201ccause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">Resolving an anti-SLAPP motion is a two-step process. Lirst, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity. <em>(People ex rel. Fire Ins. Exchange v. Anapol </em>(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 809, 822 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 224].) If the defendant makes that showing, the trial court proceeds to the second step, determining whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on the claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(People ex rel. Fire Ins. </em>Exchange, at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">Subdivision (e) of section 425.16 delineates the type of speech or petitioning activity protected. Such acts include \u201c(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7425.16, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Courts have not precisely defined the boundaries of a cause of action \u201carising from\u201d such protected activity. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b).) \u201c[T]he statutory phrase \u2018cause of action . . . arising from\u2019 means simply that the defendant\u2019s act underlying the plaintiffs cause of action must <em>itself </em>have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. [Citation.] In the anti-SLAPP context, the critical point is whether the plaintiffs cause of action itself was <em>based on </em>an act in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech.\u201d <em>(City of Cotati </em>v. <em>Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 78 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Whether the statute applies is determined from the <em>\u201cprincipal thrust </em>or <em>gravamen\u201d </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>(Martinez v. Metabolife Internat., Inc. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 188 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 494].) In making these determinations, the trial court \u201cconsiders \u2018the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].) We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to strike independently under a de novo standard. <em>(Flatley </em>v. <em>Mauro </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 325 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2].) We do not weigh credibility, but accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff. We evaluate the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine whether it defeats the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as a matter of law. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">A. <em>The Surgery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">On July 11, 2011, Plaintiff performed elective surgery on a 12-year-old patient for scoliosis. Plaintiff selected the operating table and also positioned the patient on the table. Due to the patient\u2019s small size, however, Plaintiff ran into trouble during the surgery. The patient\u2019s back was unstable and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>pelvis dipped, which exacerbated her spinal curvature and made the surgery extremely difficult. Plaintiff then realized he had chosen both the wrong sized table as well as hip and thigh pads for this patient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">During the surgery, Plaintiff asked the nurses if he could get much bigger pads than what he had chosen but was told those pads were not available. He then asked a nurse to go under the operating table to stabilize the patient. Plaintiff also asked for a different kind of operating table but was told the specific kind of table he had requested midsurgery was not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Although he was unable to physically stabilize his patient, Plaintiff continued, and even expanded, the surgery. As a result, the operation lasted eight to 11 hours, rather than the normal three to five hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">The surgery left the patient in far worse condition, and she now had an exaggerated inward curvature of the lower spine as well as abrasions on her face and body. Indeed, Plaintiff described the deformity as \u201cclearly obvious\u201d and needing correction within a few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">B. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Summary Suspension</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">On July 13, 2011, the hospital\u2019s operating room manager (Kyung Jun) visited the patient to check on the abrasions caused by her prolonged surgery. The patient\u2019s parents were present at the time. According to the parents, Plaintiff had told them that the patient was too small for the table he had used during the surgery, and that he needed a special table, which the hospital did not have. Jun reassured the parents that the hospital had the necessary equipment for the patient\u2019s corrective surgery. Jun then spoke with Plaintiff to discuss what he needed for the upcoming surgery. Plaintiff confirmed that the hospital did in fact have the equipment he needed for the surgery. Jun e-mailed this information to Dr. William Brien that same day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">On or about July 14, 2011, Dr. Brien initiated a peer review investigation into the surgery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hospital expedited its investigation because the patient was still hospitalized and awaiting additional corrective surgery. Dr. Brien called Plaintiff about the case that day. Plaintiff confirmed he was responsible for choosing the wrong surgical table and for positioning the patient. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>denied complaining to anyone, including the patient\u2019s parents, that the hospital did not have the appropriate surgical table available. Plaintiff also admitted he had not yet completed his required postoperation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">According to Plaintiff\u2019s description of the call, however, Dr. Brien began by immediately asking, \u201cAre you going around the hospital and telling everyone that Cedars doesn\u2019t have the capability to do this case?\u201d Plaintiff says he told Dr. Brien that it had been difficult to stabilize the patient due to the inadequate table and pads, and that if the correct equipment had been available, the patient would have had a successful surgical outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Dr. Brien consulted with the chairman of department of surgery, who concurred that Plaintiff posed an immediate and imminent risk to hospital patients, especially since Plaintiff had chosen to continue surgery on his 12-year-old patient even though he could not stabilize her body, and would have to perform corrective surgery on her within the next few days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">On July 15, 2011, Cedars summarily suspended Plaintiff\u2019s medical staff privileges. As required, the hospital provided Plaintiff with a notice of action, advising Plaintiff of the charges and his hearing rights. The hospital based the summary suspension on the surgery, which raised \u201cconcerns regarding [Plaintiff\u2019s] judgment, technical skill, and competency in managing scoliosis cases.\u201d These concerns were based on his choice of the wrong table for the patient\u2019s size and procedure, his failure to adequately stabilize the patient, and his continued attempts to manipulate the patient\u2019s spine despite his inability to stabilize her. In addition, the notice stated, \u201cthe surgery lasted in excess of 11 hours, which apparently contributed to the pressure areas that the patient sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">That same day, Plaintiff belatedly dictated his operative report.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The report noted the difficulty Plaintiff had during the surgery. It also noted that Plaintiff had asked for a different table and pads during the surgery but was told they were not immediately available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">On July 21, 2011, Plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote the hospital, challenging the summary suspension. The letter did not criticize the hospital for failing to provide a different table and pads once Plaintiff realized he had chosen the wrong equipment. Instead, it stated that the table chosen by Plaintiff was in fact medically appropriate for this type of surgical procedure, noting that the surgeon who subsequently operated on the 12-year-old patient had used the same table. Notably, the letter did not contend that the hospital had suspended Plaintiff in retaliation for any complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>On July 27, 2011, Plaintiff filed a petition for mandamus and a temporary restraining order to set aside the summary suspension. As with the letter from Plaintiffs counsel, these filings did not suggest Plaintiff was concerned with equipment safety or believed he had been suspended in retaliation for any complaints.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, Plaintiff\u2019s primary challenge focused upon his suspension by a hospital administrator rather than a peer review committee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On August 1, 2011, the hospital reported Plaintiffs summary suspension to the state medical board and the National Practitioner Data Bank as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\">C. <em>The Peer Review Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">On August 29, 2011, Plaintiff requested a peer review hearing to challenge his summary suspension. The hospital issued an amended notice of action, lifting the suspension as to adult patients. It maintained the suspension with respect to pediatric patients. The evidentiary portion of the peer review hearing lasted from September 2012 to November 2013. The hearing committee heard from 17 witnesses and had 60 exhibits at its disposal. As before, Plaintiff did not contend he had complained to the hospital about available equipment or patient safety. Nor did he contend that his summary suspension or his peer review hearing were retaliation for making that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">The hearing committee issued its report on January 13, 2014. The committee found that the department of surgery had \u201cacted reasonably in conducting an investigation of the case\u201d due to the \u201cunsatisfactory correction of the patient\u2019s spinal curvature and the harm to the patient of a worsened post-surgical spinal curvature, pressure sores, an extended fusion, a prolonged hospitalization and a second surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Based on this evidence, the hearing committee found that Plaintiff\u2019s summary suspension had been reasonable and warranted. However, the committee concluded that terminating Plaintiff\u2019s clinical privileges to treat pediatric, adolescent and adult scoliosis was not reasonable or warranted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>Plaintiff appealed the hearing committee\u2019s decision to uphold the summary suspension.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs appeal did not claim that the hospital had suspended Plaintiff for any retaliatory reasons. Each level of review upheld the hearing committee\u2019s finding Plaintiff\u2019s summary suspension reasonable and warranted. Plaintiff did not seek mandamus review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">D. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Subsequent Lawsuit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Plaintiff filed suit on July 11, 2014\u2014exactly three years after the surgery. On July 21, 2014, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC), the operative complaint in this case, against Cedars, its medical staff, and the specific doctors involved in the summary suspension decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For the first time, Plaintiff alleged that the hospital\u2019s actions were taken in retaliation after Plaintiff had complained about patient safety at the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Centered on this allegation, the FAC presented seven causes of action: (1) violation of Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, (2) tortious interference with prospective economic relations, (3) tortious interference with contractual relations, (4) unfair competition in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., (5) violation of Business and Professions Code section 16700 et seq., (6) violation of Business and Professions Code sections 510 and 2056, and (7) wrongful termination of hospital privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">The hospital filed an anti-SFAPP motion, contending that Plaintiff\u2019s claims arose out of a protected activity\u2014the medical staff\u2019s peer review process\u2014 and that Plaintiff could not show a probability of success on the merits. According to the hospital, Plaintiff could not prevail on his claims because they were barred by the statute of limitations. Moreover, Plaintiff had failed to exhaust his judicial remedies and could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RULING</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">As correctly noted by the trial court, an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step process: \u201c(1) the defendant must establish that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity; and (2) if the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability of success on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">With respect to the first step, the court found that \u201d[a]ll of Plaintiff s causes of action are based on the allegations that he made reports of unsafe and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>substandard hospital conditions and services that posed a threat to patients.\u201d Plaintiff also contended that \u2018\u201cDefendants responded to this action by summarily suspending his medical staff privileges, reporting the summary suspension to state authorities, and subjecting Plaintiff to a protracted and unfair peer review process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">Citing <em>Kibler v. Northern Inyo County Local Hospital Dist. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 192, 198 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 41, 138 P.3d 193] <em>(Kibler), </em>and <em>Nesson v. Northern Inyo County Local Hospital Dist. </em>(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 65, 78 [138 Cal.Rptr.3d 446] <em>(Nesson), </em>the court found that Plaintiffs allegations all related and arose from the hospital\u2019s peer review proceedings, which qualified as an \u201cofficial proceeding authorized by law\u201d and thus constituted protected activity under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because Plaintiffs claim arose from Defendants\u2019 protected activity, the burden shifted to Plaintiff to submit admissible evidence supporting a prima facie case in his favor. However, Plaintiff could not establish a probability of success on the merits on any of his seven claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">A. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s First Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Health and Safety Code section 1278.5 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o health facility shall discriminate or retaliate, in any manner, against any . . . member of the medical staff\u2019 because that person has \u201c[p]resented a grievance, complaint, or report to the facility ... or the medical staff of the facility\u201d or \u201c[h]as initiated, participated, or cooperated in an investigation or administrative proceeding related to, the quality of care, services, or conditions at the facility that is carried out by an entity or agency responsible for accrediting or evaluating the facility.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1278.5, subd. (b)(1)(A), (B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">The statute expressly provides a rebuttable presumption that discriminatory action was taken by the health facility in retaliation against a member of the medical staff if responsible staff at the facility knew about the medical staff member\u2019s actions and the discriminatory treatment occurred within 120 days of the medical staff member filing a grievance or complaint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1278.5, subd. (d)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>With respect to Plaintiff\u2019s first claim, the court found that Plaintiff had failed to submit a sufficiently explicit complaint regarding improper or inadequate procedures at the hospital. Thus, Plaintiff could not show, as required by Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, subdivision (b)(1)(A) and (B), that he had filed \u201ca grievance, complaint, or report\u201d regarding \u201cthe quality of care, services, or conditions at the facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Although the hospital had two channels for reporting safety and quality concerns, Plaintiff did not use either one. Instead, he \u201cmerely reported his surgical procedures and complications to the parents of his patient and in his post-operation surgical report.\u201d While protected activity does not require a formal procedure, the court observed, \u201cit at least requires a clear communication that puts the employer on notice as to what wrongful conduct it should investigate or correct.\u201d Plaintiffs routine postsurgical reports did not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Even if Plaintiff s postsurgical reports did meet the statutory notice requirements, the court found he could not show a causal connection between this protected activity and the hospital\u2019s allegedly retaliatory conduct. Although Plaintiff contended that the hospital initiated the peer review process based on his complaints, the court found this was not the case. Instead, the hospital began the process because of a complaint that a surgical manager made <em>against </em>Plaintiff. Indeed, Plaintiff\u2019s postsurgical report was not transcribed, let alone received by the hospital until after Defendants had initiated the peer review process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, in addition to failing to present a sufficiently detailed grievance regarding conditions at the hospital. Plaintiff could not establish a presumption of retaliation under Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, subdivision (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">B. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Remaining Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">The trial court also held that Plaintiff did not show a reasonable probability that he could succeed on his remaining causes of action. Citing <em>Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 465, 469 [131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410] <em>(Westlake), </em>the court found that although the claims were expressly based on Plaintiff\u2019s summary suspension and the hospital\u2019s peer review process, Plaintiff had not attempted to overturn any aspect of the peer review determinations in a mandamus action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Consequently, these claims were barred for failure to exhaust judicial remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\">We review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to strike de novo. <em>(Flatley </em>v. <em>Mauro, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 299, 325.) Thus, we must determine whether Defendants have made a prima facie showing that the challenged cause of action arises from the hospital\u2019s protected activity. <em>(People ex rel. Fire Ins. Exchange v. Anapol, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.4th 809, 822.) If Defendants have made that showing, we then proceed to the second step, determining whether Plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on his claims. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">\n<em>A. The Hospital Engaged in Protected Activity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">In <em>Kibler, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at page 198, our Supreme Court held that an anti-SLAPP motion was available to a hospital and its medical staff regarding their actions in a peer review proceeding where the disciplined physician later sued for interference with his practice of medicine. There, the hospital summarily suspended the physician\u2019s staff privileges for two weeks, but reinstated them after he agreed to refrain from certain behaviors. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 196.) <em>Kibler </em>reasoned that a lawsuit arising from a peer review proceeding is subject to a special motion to strike because it qualifies as \u201c \u2018any other official proceeding authorized by law\u2019 \u201d pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). <em>(Kibler, </em>at p. 198; <em>DeCambre v. Rady Children\u2019s Hospital-San Diego </em>(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1, 14 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 888] [applying <em>Kibler </em>to anti-SLAPP motion filed by hospital in lawsuit arising from peer review proceedings].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">In so holding, the court relied on three considerations. First, peer review proceedings are required of hospitals and heavily regulated. <em>(Kibler, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 199-200.) Second, because hospitals are required to report the results of peer review proceedings to the state medical board, peer review proceedings play a \u201csignificant role\u201d in aiding the appropriate state licensing boards in their responsibility to regulate and discipline errant practitioners. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 200.) Third, \u201c[a] hospital\u2019s decisions resulting from peer review proceedings are subject to judicial review by administrative mandate. [Citation.] Thus, the Legislature has accorded a hospital\u2019s peer review decisions a status comparable to that of quasi-judicial public agencies whose decisions likewise are reviewable by administrative mandate.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Kibler, </em>at p. 200.) As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>such, peer review proceedings constitute \u201cofficial proceeding^] authorized by law\u201d under section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2). To hold otherwise would discourage participation in medical peer reviews by allowing disciplined physicians to sue hospitals and their peer review committee members rather than seeking administrative relief. (Kibler, at p. 200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">The Court of Appeal reached a similar result in <em>Nesson, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.4th 65 (revd. in part on other grounds in <em>Fahlen </em>v. <em>Sutter Central Valley Hospitals </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 655 [168 Cal.Rptr.3d 165, 318 P.3d 833] <em>(Fahlen)). </em>In <em>Nesson, </em>a radiologist sued a hospital for breach of contract, retaliation, and discrimination after the medical executive committee summarily suspended his medical staff privileges and the hospital terminated his contract to provide radiology services. <em>(Nesson, </em>at p. 72.) The hospital filed a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, arguing the complaint targeted a protected activity and that the radiologist could not demonstrate a probability of success on the merits given that he had not exhausted his administrative or judicial remedies. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 75.) The trial court granted the hospital\u2019s motion, and the radiologist appealed, contending that his summary suspension and subsequent termination did not constitute protected activity. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 76, 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal. The court characterized <em>Kibler, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 192 as holding that hospital peer review proceedings, including the discipline imposed upon a physician, constitute official proceedings authorized by law. <em>(Nesson, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.4th at p. 78.) The gravamen of each cause of action asserted by Nesson was that the hospital \u201csomehow acted wrongfully when it terminated the [radiology service agreement] because Nesson\u2019s privileges were summarily suspended, as he was deemed by the [medical executive committee] to be a likely imminent danger to patient safety.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Kibler, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 192 is unavailing. Plaintiff maintains that his claims, unlike the claims in <em>Kibler, </em>concern retaliation by Defendants in violation of a specific statute that precludes such conduct. However, \u201cthe first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis focuses on the acts the plaintiff alleges as the basis for his or her claims, not the motive or purpose the plaintiff attributes to the defendant\u2019s acts; the first step considers whether those acts constitute acts in furtherance of the constitutional rights of free speech or petition.\u201d <em>(Collier v. Harris </em>(2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 41, 53-54 [192 Cal.Rptr.3d 31].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Indeed, \u201c \u2018[a]ny \u201cclaimed illegitimacy of the defendant\u2019s acts is an issue which the plaintiff must raise <em>and </em>support in the context of the discharge of the plaintiff\u2019s <em>[secondary] </em>burden to provide a prima facie showing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>merits of the plaintiffs case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Collier v. Harris, supra, </em>240 Cal.App.4th at p. 54, second italics added.) Thus, even if Plaintiffs case differs from <em>Kibler, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 192 in this respect, it is immaterial when analyzing the <em>first </em>step, determining whether Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arises from the hospital\u2019s protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Nesson, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.4th 65 is similarly unavailing. Although <em>Fahlen, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th 655 did disapprove one portion of <em>Nesson, </em>this holding does not affect our first step analysis. <em>Fahlen </em>held that a \u2018\u201chospital staff physician who claims a hospital decision to restrict or terminate his or her staff privileges was an act in retaliation for his or her whistleblowing in furtherance of patient care and safety need not seek and obtain a mandamus petition to overturn the decision before filing a civil action under [Health and Safety Code] section 1278.5.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Fahlen, </em>at p. 687.) To the extent <em>Nesson </em>was inconsistent with this particular conclusion, the decision was disapproved. <em>(Fahlen, </em>at p. 687.) However, this holding is relevant only at the <em>second </em>step of our review, when we examine whether a plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust alternative remedies precludes us from reaching the merits of a claim. <em>(Westlake, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Nevertheless, Plaintiff maintains \u2018\u201c[t]his is not a situation where the plaintiff is claiming that a statement made during the process was defamatory; or that the process itself was not fair, as in <em>Kibler[, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 192.]\u201d Nor is this \u2018\u201ca situation where the claim arises out of the process itself, as in <em>Nessonl supra, </em>204 Cal.App.4th 65.]\u201d In short, Plaintiff insists the decision to institute proceedings against Plaintiff and what occurred during those proceedings are legally distinct concepts. According to Plaintiff, the decision to institute proceedings is not a reviewable aspect of the peer review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">However, here, as in <em>Kibler, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 192, Plaintiff\u2019s causes of action arise out of the hospital\u2019s peer review process in relation to a summary suspension. Moreover, the act of summarily suspending Plaintiff is a part of the peer review process, as set forth in the hospital\u2019s bylaws, and as analyzed by the Supreme Court in <em>Kibler.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed, <em>Kibler </em>expressly held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>the peer review summary suspension was protected conduct because it is a component of an official proceeding, subject to judicial review by administrative mandate, that hospitals have been tasked with in order to monitor the professional conduct of physicians licensed in California. (Kibler, at pp. 198-201.) Like the plaintiff in <em>Kibler, </em>Plaintiff was suspended through the hospital\u2019s peer review process. The hospital\u2019s suspension of Plaintiff is likewise protected conduct. Thus, Defendants\u2019 acts relating to Plaintiff\u2019s suspension and peer review process constituted protected activity for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute and Plaintiff\u2019s claims arise from that protected activity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">B. <em>Plaintiff Cannot Show a Probability of Success</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Once a defendant makes a prima facie showing that the anti-SLAPP statute is applicable to the conduct or speech at issue, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a \u201cprobability\u201d that plaintiff will prevail on whatever claims are asserted against the defendant. (\u00a7425.16, subd. (b)(1).) The plaintiff \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust demonstrate that the <em>complaint </em>is <em>both legally sufficient </em>and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 464, 476 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">As noted above, \u201c \u2018[w]e consider \u201cthe pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits . . . upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d . . . However, we neither \u201cweigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, [we] accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff .. . and evaluate the defendant\u2019s evidence only to determine if it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1036 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">With respect to Plaintiffs first claim, Defendants contend that the claim must fail because it was filed past the applicable two-year statute of limitations. Defendants also contend that even if a three-year statute of limitations applies here, which would render the claim timely, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case for this claim and thus cannot prevail. With respect to Plaintiffs remaining claims, Defendants contend that Plaintiff failed to exhaust his judicial remedies and thus cannot prevail on his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">C. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s First Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">1. <em>Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">Plaintiff filed his FAC on July 21, 2014. This was nearly three years after the hospital suspended him and reported the suspension to the medical board as well as the National Practitioner Data Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Health and Safety Code section 1278.5 does not specify a time period in which a claim for a violation of the statute must be filed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends the three-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a) applies, while Defendants argue that the two-year time limit in section 335.1 should be used here. Under section 338, subdivision (a), \u201d[a]n action upon a liability created by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture\u201d must be brought within three years. Under section 335.1, which addresses the time for commencing general tort claims, a plaintiff has two years to file suit. No California appellate case has addressed the issue. Nor did the trial court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">However, it actually appears that a <em>one-year </em>statute of limitations may be appropriate here. Section 340 specifies a limitations period of one year for an action upon a statute for a penalty, unless the statute imposing the penalty prescribes a different limitation. (\u00a7 340, subd. (a).) A penalty is mandatory under Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, subdivision (b)(3), which states that \u2018\u201c[a] violation of this section <em>shall </em>be subject to a civil penalty\u201d of not more than $25,000. (Italics added.) The statute\u2019s legislative history supports the proposition that Health and Safety Code section 1278.5 is a statute for a penalty. (See Sen. Health &amp; Human Services Com., Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 97 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Mar. 10, 1999, p. 2 [bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>\u201crequires a health facility that violates this provision to be subject to a civil penalty\u201d]; see also Assent. Com. on Health, Analysis of Assent. Bill No. 632 (2007-2008 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 21, 2007, p. 1 [although existing law subjects a health facility to civil penalty, this bill extends penalty provision to health facilities that retaliate against physicians].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Thus, even if the FAC does not address whether Plaintiff seeks to recover the mandatory civil penalty imposed by Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, subdivision (b)(3), Plaintiffs first cause of action is still an action upon a statute for a penalty.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Neither Plaintiff nor Defendants briefed the applicability of section 340 to this case. Furthermore, as discussed below, Plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case for this particular claim. Consequently, we need not, and do not, decide which limitations period is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">2. <em>Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Prima Facie Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">To establish a prima facie case under Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, Plaintiff must satisfy three elements and show that he (1) \u201c[presented a grievance, complaint, or report\u201d to the hospital or medical staff (2) regarding the quality of patient care and (3) the hospital retaliated against him for doing so. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1278.5, subd. (b)(1)(A); see <em>Fahlen, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 667, fn. 6 [although statute does not explicitly state \u201c \u2018grievance, complaint, or report\u2019 \u201d must involve concerns about quality of patient care, limitation is implicit in other provisions of statute].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-7\">With respect to the first element, the trial court found that although the hospital had two channels for reporting safety and quality concerns, Plaintiff did not use either one.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Instead, he \u201cmerely reported his surgical procedures and complications to the parents of his patient and in his post-operation surgical report.\u201d While reporting such concerns does not require a formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>procedure, \u201cit at least requires a clear communication that puts the employer on notice as to what wrongful conduct it should investigate or correct.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiffs routine postsurgical reports did not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s other purported communications suffer from the same deficiency. Asking a nurse midsurgery if larger pads or a different operating table were available did not constitute whistleblowing. Plaintiff made his requests after realizing he had made a mistake in his operating room choices. Thus, Plaintiffs midsurgery request did not, and indeed could not, alert the hospital that it needed to investigate and correct a problem with the facility itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Plaintiffs postsurgery conversation with the patient\u2019s parents also proves inadequate. Statements must be made to \u201cthe facility, to an entity or agency responsible for accrediting or evaluating the facility, or the medical staff of the facility, or to any other governmental entity\u201d in order to be protected under the statute. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1278.5, subd. (b)(1)(A).) Plaintiff\u2019s conversation with the parents clearly does not fall under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Nevertheless, Plaintiff maintains that Dr. Brien later learned about the conversation, thus transforming it into a protected complaint. Dr. Brien received an e-mail informing him that Plaintiff had told the parents that the patient was too small for the table he had used during the surgery, and that he needed a special table, which the hospital did not have. Furthermore, according to the e-mail, Plaintiff later assured the hospital that it did in fact have the equipment needed for the patient\u2019s upcoming surgery. Thus, rather than put his employer on notice as to what wrongful conduct it should investigate or correct, Plaintiff informed the hospital it did <em>not </em>have an equipment problem to remedy.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This cannot suffice as a protected complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">Nor can Plaintiff\u2019s postoperation report be deemed a protected complaint. An operative report must be documented within 24 hours for all patients following any inpatient or outpatient procedure. They are considered part of a patient\u2019s medical record and are not accessed by the hospital\u2019s leadership or administration \u201cunless a specific question about quality, payment, or other health care operations has arisen.\u201d They are <em>not </em>used to alert the hospital or its leadership about suspected unsafe patient conditions or quality of care concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">Furthermore, neither the content nor the tinting of the report supports Plaintiff\u2019s contention that it constituted a \u201cgrievance, complaint, or report\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>under Health and Safety Code section 1278.5, subdivision (b)(1)(A). In the report, Plaintiff noted his unsuccessful midsurgery request for larger pads and a different table. Just before filing the report, however, Plaintiff admitted that he had underestimated the patient\u2019s small size and had chosen the wrong table as a result.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">The timing of the report also undercuts Plaintiffs claim. Although the surgery took place on July 11, 2011, the report was not dictated until July 14, 2011, and was not transcribed until July 15, 2011. Until an operative report is transcribed, it is not documented and is not available for viewing by anyone. By the time Plaintiffs report was transcribed, the hospital had already heard from other staff members concerned about the prolonged surgery. These concerns, rather than the belated and nonaccusatory operative report, triggered the inquiry that caused Plaintiffs summary suspension. Thus, the report cannot suffice as a protected complaint and the hospital\u2019s decision to suspend Plaintiff cannot be deemed retaliatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">3. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s Remaining Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">In <em>Westlake, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 465, our Supreme Court held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applies to hospital peer review proceedings. Thus, \u201cbefore a doctor may initiate litigation challenging the propriety of a hospital\u2019s denial or withdrawal of privileges, he must exhaust the available internal remedies afforded by the hospital.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">Furthermore, \u201cwhenever a hospital, pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding, reaches a decision to deny staff privileges, an aggrieved doctor must first succeed in sehing aside the quasi-judicial decision in a mandamus action before he may institute a tort action for damages.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>(Westlake, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 469.) Once a court determines the hospital\u2019s quasi-judicial decision to be improper in a mandate action, the \u201cexcluded doctor may proceed in tort against the hospital, its board or committee members or any others legally responsible for the denial of staff privileges.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">In sum, before filing suit, Plaintiff had to exhaust both his administrative remedies (by undergoing the peer review process) and his judicial remedies (by seeking mandamus review of the peer review determinations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">Plaintiff repeatedly claims he emerged the victor in the peer review process and that judicial exhaustion was not required because \u201cthere were no rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>he would want set aside\u201d and \u2018\u201cpursuing anything further would have been moot.\u201d However, Plaintiff also agrees, as he must, that the peer review process yielded at least one adverse finding\u2014that his initial suspension was reasonable and warranted. Indeed, each level of review found this to be the case. As Plaintiff admits, and alleges in his complaint, this holding had real world consequences. Plaintiffs suspension was reported to the medical board and National Practitioner Data Bank, which, in turn, damaged his reputation and career. Although Plaintiff appealed this determination throughout the peer review process, he did not seek mandamus review of this holding. Therefore, he may not challenge it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\">Nevertheless, Plaintiff notes that the parties did not litigate whether the hospital\u2019s decision to suspend Plaintiff was retaliatory. Indeed, they could not since Plaintiff failed to raise the allegation during the peer review process. Therefore, Plaintiff contends, judicial exhaustion has no application here. <em>Westlake, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 465 holds otherwise. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 484 [\u201cso long as such a quasi-judicial decision is not set aside ... the decision has the effect of establishing the propriety of the hospital\u2019s action\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">The judgment is affirmed.

The next day, the employer had the plaintiffs escorted from the office and sent them letters \u201c \u2018temporarily\u2019 modifying\u201d their'job duties and instructing them not to come to the office, not to use company e-mail, not to attend any client or industry functions, and not to have telephone conversations or communications with clients or other employees. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 172.) The plaintiffs then amended their lawsuit to add retaliation and wrongful termination claims. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The employer filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court denied the motion, finding the two claims did not arise from protected activity.

In fact, other hospital staff members submitted MIDAS reports (and sent e-mails to management) outlining their' concerns with the surgery, especially the dermal abrasions the patient had suffered as a result. Thus, Plaintiff was the subject of safety concerns, not its champion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1257-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Yanowitz </em>v. <em>L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1047 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 436, 116 P.3d 1123] (\u201cvague or conclusory remarks that fail to put an employer on notice as to what conduct it should investigate will not suffice to establish protected conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1257-10\"> Indeed, when directly questioned by Dr. Brien, Plaintiff denied telling the parents that the hospital did not have the appropriate surgical table available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1258-10\"> Plaintiff would later reverse course and maintain that the table he had chosen was in fact medically appropriate for this type of procedure.
