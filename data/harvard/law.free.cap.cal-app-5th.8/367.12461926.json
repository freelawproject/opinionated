Marlon Wayans (Wayans) co-wrote, produced, and starred in the movie. In August 2014, Daniel sued Wayans and others, alleging, inter alia, that he was the victim of racial harassment because during his one day of work on the movie he was compared to a Black cartoon character and called \u201c \u2018[n]igga.\u2019 \u201d In response, Wayans, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 425.16, moved to strike Daniel\u2019s claims against him as a SLAPP suit (strategic lawsuit against public participation), arguing that all of Daniel\u2019s claims arose from Wayans\u2019s constitutional right of free speech because the core injury-producing conduct arose out of the creation of the movie and its promotion over the Internet. The trial court agreed with Wayans and also found that Daniel had failed to establish the probability that he would prevail on any of his claims against Wayans. As a result, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Wayans and awarded him his attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On appeal, Daniel argues that the trial court erred with regard to its determination of the threshold issue in Wayans\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion\u2014that is, the conduct at issue was not part of the \u201c \u2018creative process\u2019 \u201d inherent in making the movie because it occurred when the cameras were not rolling and, as a result, did not involve the right of free speech or an issue of public interest. In the alternative, Daniel contends that even if the conduct at issue implicated Wayans\u2019s right to free speech, he presented sufficient evidence to the trial court to establish a probability of prevailing. We find both of Daniel\u2019s arguments to be unpersuasive. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">I. <em>Daniel\u2019s complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">On August 25, 2014, in an unverified complaint, Daniel alleged that defendants EFS Entertainment, ICM Partners, and IM Global employed him as an actor for A Haunted House 2. He further alleged that Wayans was a manager, officer, shareholder, director, supervisor, managing agent, owner, principal, or employee of all of the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The complaint asserted a total of 13 different causes of action, eight of which were asserted against Wayans: a race-based harassment claim brought pursuant to Government Code section 12940 et seq.; a claim alleging a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.); a claim brought pursuant to Civil Code section 3344 for the unauthorized use of another\u2019s photograph for advertising; a common law misappropriation of likeness claim; a common law \u201cfalse light\u2019Vinvasion of privacy claim; a common law claim for breach of a quasi-contract; a common law claim for unjust enrichment; and a common law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Daniel\u2019s claims against Wayans stem from two different but related contexts of alleged misconduct. The first alleged misconduct occurred solely on the movie set (the on-set comments and conduct). Specifically, Daniel alleged that Wayans subjected him to \u201coffensive and derogatory language regarding his race/national origin,\u201d such as repeatedly referring to him \u201cin a demeaning manner, as \u2018Nigga,\u2019 a derogatory term and racial slur used to refer to African-Americans\u201d; \u201crepeatedly mocking [Danielj\u2019s \u2018afro\u2019 \u201crepeatedly and negatively referring] to [Daniel] as \u2018Cleveland Brown,\u2019 an African American cartoon character in the adult cartoon comedy series \u2018Family Guy\u2019 routinely leering, staring, and rolling his eyes at Daniel; ridiculing Daniel in the presence of other crew members; and treating Daniel \u201cdifferently, disparately, and negatively because of his race/national origin, including making demeaning, abusive, and derogatory comments and gestures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The second arena or context of alleged misconduct evolved primarily on the Internet (the Internet posting). Specifically, Daniel alleged that Wayans took Daniel\u2019s photograph without his consent and then posted it on the Internet and \u201cDefendants\u2019 websites alongside a photograph of [a] popular African-American cartoon character, \u2018Cleveland Brown\u2019 with the inappropriate caption, \u2018Tell me this nigga don\u2019t look like . . . THIS NIGGA!!! 01 Cleveland Brown ass lookin @ahhmovie 2 @whatthefunny I\u2019m hurtin!\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">II. <em>Wayans\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">On November 5, 2014, Wayans filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section 425.16. Wayans\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion challenged all causes of action in which he was named. Wayans argued that he met his burden under the anti-SLAPP statute because his creative spark in referring to Daniel as \u201cCleveland\u201d resulted in the birth of a character in the film; his use of the word nigga, a term liberally used throughout the film, helped advance or assist in the creation of dialogue for the film; and by promoting Daniel in the Internet and Twitter post as a Cleveland Brown look-alike, Wayans helped promote the film. The motion was supported by three declarations: one by Wayans himself; one by the movie\u2019s leading actress, laime Pressly (Pressly); and one by Rick Alvarez (Alvarez), \u201ca producer and cowriter\u201d of both A Haunted House and A Haunted House 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>A. <em>Wayans\u2019s declaration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In his declaration, Wayans admitted joking with Daniel about his resemblance to the Cleveland Brown cartoon character. Wayans stated he then named the character portrayed by Daniel \u201cCleveland\u201d and used that name as he improvised dialogue for the scene in which Daniel appeared. Wayans emphasized that on-set improvisation, including \u201c[jjoking around,\u201d constituted a key part of the creative process both in A Haunted House 2 and in his other movies, as the scripts for those movies were often just an \u201coutline of scenes.\u201d To demonstrate the improvisational nature of the movie\u2019s creative process, Wayans submitted the certified transcript of three different \u201ctakes\u201d of the scene in which Daniel appeared; in each of those takes the action is the same\u2014Wayans's character calling Daniel\u2019s character to help get a heavy safe off of his dog\u2014but the dialogue is markedly different each time as Wayans experiments or improvises.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Wayans also admitted taking Daniel\u2019s photograph, but declared that Daniel consented and posed for the photograph. Wayans then \u201cjuxtaposed the photo with a humorously similar photo of Mr. Daniel\u2019s cartoon look-alike, Cleveland Brown, with the caption\u201d alleged in the complaint and previously quoted herein. Wayans continued: \u201cMy reference to \u2018@ahhmovie2\u2019 was a link to the Twitter and Instagram pages for A Haunted House 2. My reference to \u2018whatthefunny\u2019 is a reference to my website, which posts humorous videos. I then posted the juxtaposed photos and caption to my Twitter account, which at that time had over a million followers.\u201d (Italics omitted.) Wayans stated that Daniel at no time objected or stated he was uncomfortable when Wayans joked with him, took the photo, or posted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">B. <em>Pressly\u2019s declaration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In her declaration, Pressly stated that she observed Wayans and Daniel interacting on the set and declared that Daniel laughed at Wayans\u2019s joke that Daniel looked like the Cleveland Brown cartoon character and noted that Wayans was so struck by the resemblance that he decided to use Cleveland as the name for Daniel\u2019s character. Pressly further declared that Daniel not only agreed to be photographed by Wayans but posed for the photograph and later joined in the laughter among the cast and crew on the set once the photograph and the image of the Cleveland Brown character were posted to the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">With regard to the creative process for the movie, Pressly affirmed that \u201c[mjany of the scenes in A Haunted House 2 were improvisational in nature,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe actors and actresses spontaneously make up jokes as they go along.\u201d On a related note, Pressly stated that much of the comedy in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>movie derived from making fun of various stereotypes, including racial stereotypes. As a result, the word nigga was used \u201cdozens of times throughout the movie\u201d; in fact, at one point in the movie Wayans\u2019s character calls Pressly\u2019s character nigga, even though Pressly is Caucasian. In addition, Pressly noted that Wayans has called her \u201c \u2018nigga\u2019 in the past, and frequently uses it as a term of endearment with his friends and family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">C. <em>Alvarez\u2019s declaration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">One of Alvarez\u2019s roles with regard to A Haunted House 2 was to \u201coversee the entire production of the film.\u201d Alvarez affirmed that Daniel was hired as a nonspeaking extra for the movie and attached to his declaration a copy of a standard union voucher signed by Daniel in connection with his work on the movie (the voucher). The voucher, in part, states that Daniel agreed to give the movie\u2019s production company broad rights with regard to the use of his image: \u201cI hereby grant to the Production Company of The Production, its successors, assignees, licenses or any other person or company who might gain title or rights to the production, the right to photograph me and record my voice to use, alter, dub, edit, and or otherwise change such photographs and recordings, in any manner whatsoever and for any reason in connection with The Production, such right to be worldwide and in perpetuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">As with Wayans and Pressly, Alvarez described the creative process for the movie as improvisational: \u201cA Haunted House 2 is an R-Rated comedy. To make the film as funny as possible, much of the dialogue was intended to be, and was, developed on the set through improvisation. The actors were encouraged to improvise, ad lib, and have fun as part of the creative process. Mr. Wayans and the other actors regularly joked amongst themselves and with others on the set to develop dialogue and create an atmosphere that was humorous and conducive to comedy.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Alvarez, like Pressly, noted that the word nigga, and variants such as \u201cnigger\u201d and \u201cniggie,\u201d are used \u201cdozens of times, throughout the movie as part of the comedy.\u201d Alvarez goes on to note that the movie \u201cincludes a scene that specifically explores the idea that the use of the terms \u2018nigga\u2019 and \u2018nigger\u2019 are sometimes considered socially acceptable for black people to use but not people with other racial backgrounds.\u201d Like Pressly, Alvarez affirmed that Wayans uses the term nigga as a term of endearment, noting that Wayans \u201chas even called [him] \u2018nigga\u2019 during the time [they] spent writing together, and [he is] not black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">III. <em>Daniel\u2019s opposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Daniel opposed Wayans\u2019s motion, arguing, inter alia, that the anti-SLAPP statute does not reach claims for racial harassment and that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cpublic interest\u201d in the photo of him and the Cleveland Brown character that Wayans posted to the Internet. In addition, he argued that there was sufficient evidence to show a probability of prevailing on each of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In support of his opposition Daniel submitted a declaration of his own in which he, inter alia, elaborated upon Wayans\u2019s alleged harassment of him on the set. Daniel stated that Wayans first called him Cleveland while he was \u201cwaiting off camera to receive [his] acting directions,\u201d when filming was not underway. Wayans also said, \u201c \u2018O\u2019l Cleveland Brown with your afro and thick mustache, you need to shed some pounds.\u2019 \u201d Wayans then called Daniel a \u201c \u2018black fat ass\u2019 and began laughing at\u201d him. Daniel declared that throughout the day, while he was on break and cameras were not rolling, Wayans repeatedly approached him and called him Cleveland at least 15 more times, looked and pointed at him while saying nigga at least three to four times, called Daniel\u2019s hair an \u201c \u2018Afro\u2019 \u201d while laughing on at least 10 occasions, called Daniel a \u201c \u2018black fat ass\u2019 \u201d in the presence of others at least twice, and \u201ccontinuously\u201d approached Daniel and leered, \u201csneeringly smile[d],\u201d rolled his eyes, and watched Daniel. Daniel stated that at no time did he laugh when Wayans called him Cleveland and that he found Wayans\u2019s use of nigga when directed at him to be \u201cracially offensive and derogatory.\u201d However, Daniel did not assert that Wayans\u2019s conduct and/or comments on the set adversely affected his work in any way on the movie.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">As for the photograph of him that was posted to the Internet, Daniel disputed that he gave his consent and/or laughed about the posting while on the set. According to Daniel, he did not learn of the posting until later that night after he left the set when his brother informed him of the post. When he finally did view the post, Daniel felt \u201cextremely offended.\u201d Because other people besides his brother have called him and approached him to ask if he is \u201cthe \u2018Cleveland Brown\u2019 character\u201d from the post, Daniel has suffered apprehension when going out in public, nightmares, anxiety, depression, and stress headaches as a result of Wayans\u2019s alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In his declaration, Daniel did not dispute the improvisational nature of the movie\u2019s creative process, as described by Wayans, Pressly and Alvarez. Nor did he dispute that the signature on the voucher is his. Instead, he objected to the voucher on various evidentiary grounds, including lack of foundation. Daniel did not submit any declarations by any experts or any other members of the cast or crew of A Haunted House 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">IV. <em>The trial court\u2019s findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">On December 11, 2014, the trial court heard oral argument on the motion. On December 31, 2014, the trial court issued a 17-page ruling, which, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>alia, overruled Daniel\u2019s objection to the voucher and granted Wayans\u2019s motion in its entirety. On January 23, 2015, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of Wayans. On March 13, 2015, the trial court, in accord with the anti-SLAPP statute (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c)), awarded attorney fees to Wayans in the amount of $96,040. Daniel filed a timely appeal with regard to both the judgment and the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">I. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We review an order granting or denying an anti-SLAPP motion de novo. <em>(Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 256, 250 P.3d 1115].) We consider the \u201cpleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d (\u00a7425.16, subd. (b)(2).) We do not \u201cweigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. [Our] inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. [We] accept[] the plaintiffs evidence as true, and evaluate[] the defendant\u2019s showing only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff\u2019s claim as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Baral </em>v. <em>Schnitt </em>(2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 384-385 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 475, 376 P.3d 604].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">II. <em>Anti-SLAPP principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u201cA SLAPP suit\u2014a strategic lawsuit against public participation\u2014seeks to chill or punish a party\u2019s exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances. [Citation.] The Legislature enacted . . . section 425.16\u2014known as the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014to provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>(Rusheen </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1055-1056 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 516, 128 P.3d 713].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">To determine whether a lawsuit or cause of action should be disposed of as a SLAPP suit, section 425.16 establishes a two-part test. \u201cFirst, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. (\u00a7425.16, subd. (b)(1).) \u2018A defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff\u2019s cause [of action] fits one of the categories spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e) . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Navellier v. Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].) A cause of action arises from protected activity if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s acts underpinning the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action involve [s] an exercise of the right of petition or free speech.\u201d <em>(Gerbosi </em>v. <em>Gaims, Weil, West &amp; Epstein, LLP </em>(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 443 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>If the defendant makes this showing, the court proceeds to the second step of the anti-SLAPP analysis. <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) In the second step, the court decides whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing at trial on the merits of its challenged causes of action. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Conversely, if the defendant does not meet its burden on the first step, the court should deny the motion and need not address the second step. \u201cOnly a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit\u2014is a SLAPP, subject to being stricken under the statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 89, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">III. <em>Step one: Wayans met his burden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Under the two-step process applicable to anti-SLAPP motions, we must first determine whether Wayans made a threshold showing that Daniel\u2019s claims arise from a protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">A. <em>Wayans\u2019s burden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In assessing whether a cause of action arises from protected activity, \u201c \u2018we disregard the labeling of the claim [citation] and instead \u201cexamine the <em>principal thrust </em>or <em>gravamen </em>of a plaintiffs cause of action [Citation.] We assess the principal thrust by identifying \u201c[t]he allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct . . . that provides the foundation for the claim.\u201d [Citation.] If the core injury-producing conduct upon which the plaintiffs claim is premised does not rest on protected speech or petitioning activity, collateral or incidental allusions to protected activity will not trigger application of the anti-SLAPP statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tuszynska v. Cunningham </em>(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 257, 267 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 63].) \u201c[T]he critical point is whether the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action itself was <em>based on </em>an act in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech.\u201d <em>(City of Cotati </em>v. <em>Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 78 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P3d 695].) \u201cIn other words, \u2018the defendant\u2019s act underlying the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action must <em>itself </em>have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Peregrine Funding, Inc. v. Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton LLP </em>(2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 670 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 31].)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">When evaluating whether the defendant has carried its burden under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute, \u201ccourts must be careful to distinguish allegations of conduct on which liability is to be based from allegations of motives for such conduct. \u2018[C]auses of action do not arise from motives; they arise from acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People ex rel. Fire Ins. Exchange v. Anapol </em>(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 809, 823 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 224].) \u201c \u2018The court reviews the parties\u2019 pleadings, declarations and other supporting documents to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>what conduct is actually being challenged, not to determine whether the conduct is actionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A defendant need only make a prima facie showing that the plaintiffs claims arise from protected activity. <em>(Mundy </em>v. <em>Lenc </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1408 [138 Cal.Rptr.3d 464]; <em>People ex rel. Fire Ins. Exchange v. Anapol, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.4th at p. 822.) \u201cThe Legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 294, 305 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 906].) \u201cInstead, under the statutory scheme, <em>a court must generally presume the validity of the claimed constitutional right in the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, </em>and then permit the parties to address the issue in the second step of the analysis, if necessary. [Citation.] Otherwise, the second step would become superfluous in almost every case, resulting in an improper shifting of the burdens.\u201d <em>(Chavez v. Mendoza </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1083, 1089 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 825], italics added; see <em>City of Los Angeles v. Animal Defense League </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 606, 621 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Daniel argues that Wayans\u2019s conduct necessarily falls outside the protections of the anti-SLAPP statute because the gravamen of his complaint is race-based harassment and such conduct is not a protected activity. We are unpersuaded by Daniel\u2019s argument because the exercise of free speech here was central, not incidental, to his alleged injuries. (See <em>Nam v. Regents of University of California </em>(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1176, 1190 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 687] <em>(Nam) </em>[\u201cprotected activity that is incidental to a cause of action [does not] justify an anti-SLAPP dismissal\u201d]; see also <em>Hunter v. CBS Broadcasting Inc. </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1521, 1525 [165 Cal.Rptr.3d 123].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The distinction between communicative conduct that is central versus that which is incidental to the exercise of the right to petition or the right of free speech is illustrated by the two cases upon which Daniel relies: <em>Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing v. 1105 Alta Loma Road Apartmen ts, LLC (2007) </em>154 Cal.App.4th 1273 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 469] <em>(Department of Housing); Martin v. Inland Empire Utilities Agency </em>(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 611 [130 Cal.Rptr.3d 410] <em>(Martin). </em>In both <em>Department of Housing </em>and <em>Martin, </em>the alleged injury-producing conduct was acts of discrimination largely, if not completely, untethered to the exercise of the defendant\u2019s free speech/petitioning rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In <em>Department of Housing, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 1273, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion and the Court of Appeal affirmed because, although the complaint discussed in detail a number of communications, those communications were not the source of the alleged injury. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u201cthe allegations of wrongdoing in [the Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing\u2019s] complaint arose from [the landlord]\u2019s alleged acts of failing to accommodate [the tenant]\u2019s disability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In <em>Martin, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.4th 611, the court found the employee\u2019s claims for discrimination and retaliation against his former employer were not based on protected activity, because although the complaint contained some references to protected activity\u2014namely, poor performance reviews and a discussion of plaintiff\u2019s performance during a board meeting\u2014those references were \u201cmentioned only minimally in plaintiff\u2019s pleadings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 625.) Instead, the focus of plaintiff\u2019s claims was the harassing and retaliatory acts by plaintiff\u2019s supervisor (e.g., \u201che hired plaintiff\u2019s employees without his input, restructured plaintiff\u2019s division, and announced the latter decision in a manner allegedly meant to disgrace him\u201d), none of which were based on the rights of petition or free speech. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 624.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Similarly, in the more recent decision in <em>Nam, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.5th 1176, the core conduct at issue did not implicate defendant\u2019s petition or free speech rights. In <em>Nam, </em>while there was some allegedly protected activity (the defendant\u2019s disciplinary process and related communications), the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s complaint focused on defendant\u2019s acts of \u201cretaliation for her public challenge of department policies and her rejection of [a supervisor\u2019s] inappropriate overtures.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1192.) Accordingly, the Court of Appeal affirmed the denial of defendant\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion because \u201cthe basis of [plaintiff\u2019s] claim, as in <em>[Department of Housing, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 1273] and <em>Martin[, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.4th 611] was defendant\u2019s retaliation,\u201d not the defendant\u2019s exercise of its petition or free speech rights. <em>(Nam, </em>at p. 1193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Here, in contrast (and as discussed in more detail below), the gravamen of Daniel\u2019s complaint stems not from any conduct incidental to Wayans\u2019s free speech rights; rather, all of the alleged misconduct is based squarely on Wayans\u2019s exercise of free speech\u2014the creation and promotion of a full-length motion picture, including the off-camera creative process. As such, Daniel\u2019s complaint is subject to an anti-SLAPP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">B. <em>The acts at issue arose out of protected activity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Section 425.16, subdivision (e) sets forth four categories of protected activity. Wayans contends that the conduct underlying Daniel\u2019s claims falls within section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) and (4), which defines protected activity to include the following: \u201c(3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\u201d As discussed below, we agree with Wayans.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>As noted above, the acts at issue fall into two basic categories: the on-set comments and conduct and the Internet posting. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">1. <em>The on-set comments and conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The allegedly harassing and offensive conduct and comments by Wayans on the set of A Haunted House 2 were made in furtherance of his constitutional right of free speech in connection with an issue of public interest. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">a. <em>Free speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Movies and films generally are considered \u201cexpressive works\u201d subject to First Amendment protections. <em>(Guglielmi v. Spelling-Goldberg Productions </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 860, 871 [160 Cal.Rptr. 352, 603 P.2d 454].) Movies are a \u201csignificant medium for the communication of ideas. They may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of ways, ranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression. The importance of motion pictures as an organ of public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed to entertain as well as to inform.\u201d <em>(Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 495, 501 [96 L.Ed. 1098, 72 S.Ct. 777], fn. omitted.) Whether exhibited in theaters or on television, a him is a medium which is protected by the constitutional guarantees of free expression. (U.S. Const., 1st &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 2; <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc., </em>at pp. 501-502; <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 367, 386-390 [23 L.Ed.2d 371, 89 S.Ct. 1794].) Nor do films and movies lose their constitutional protection because they are undertaken to generate a proht. <em>(Guglielmi v. Spelling-Goldberg Productions, </em>at pp. 867-868.) In short, \u201cit is beyond dispute that movies involve free speech.\u201d <em>(Dyer v. Childress </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1280 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 544].) Because a him is an expressive work, its creation is also an exercise of free speech. (See <em>Tamkin v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. </em>(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 133, 143 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 264] [creating, casting and broadcasting TV episode is exercise of free speech].)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Although it is undisputed that the conduct and comments at issue were made on the set of A Haunted House 2, Daniel argues that they were not made in furtherance of Wayans\u2019s free speech rights because they occurred \u201cduring breaks, while no cameras were rolling.\u201d Daniel\u2019s argument is unavailing for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">First, Daniel\u2019s argument that the movie\u2019s creative process occurred only when the cameras were rolling rests on an unreasonably narrow or constrained view of the creative process generally. \u201cAs stated in a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>context, \u2018[t]he creative process [for a raunchy comedy] must be unfettered, especially because it can often take strange turns, as many bizarre and potentially offensive ideas are suggested, tried, and, in the end, either discarded or used. ... [\u00b6] ... We must not permit juries to dissect the creative process in order to determine what was <em>necessary </em>to achieve the final product and what was not, and to impose liability ... for that portion deemed unnecessary. Creativity is, by its nature, creative. It is unpredictable. Much that is not obvious can be necessary to the creative process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Tamkin </em>v. <em>CBS Broadcasting, Inc., supra, </em>193 Cal.App.4th at pp. 144-145, quoting <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Warner Brothers Television Productions (2006) </em>38 Cal.4th 264, 298 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 2, 132 P.3d 211] (cone. opn. of Chin, J.) <em>(Lyle) </em>[addressing workplace sexual harassment claim];<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Brodeur </em>v. <em>Atlas Entertainment, Inc. </em>(2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 665, 677 [204 Cal.Rptr.3d 483] [declining \u201c \u2018 \u201cto dissect the creative process\u201d \u2019 \u201d and affirming granting anti-SLAPP].)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Second, Daniel\u2019s argument about the boundaries of the creative process for A Haunted House 2\u2014it only occurs on-set when the camera is rolling\u2014is flatly contradicted by the undisputed testimony offered by Wayans, Pressly and Alvarez, who affirmed that the creative process for A Haunted House 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>was highly improvisational in nature and occurred when the camera was rolling and when it was not. As Wayans explained, \u2018\u201c[j]oking around on set is part of my creative process for making a comedy film.\u201d According to Pressly, it is \u2018\u201cimportant\u201d on the set of any comedy to have a \u2018\u201clight, funny atmosphere,\u201d and on the set of A Haunted House 2 \u2018\u201c[e]veryone . . . joked around with each other as part of the creative process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The improvisational nature of the creative process for the movie is amply demonstrated in the widely varying dialogue that was used in the three outtakes and in the final version of the scene in which Daniel appears. In fact, Daniel\u2019s contention that Wayans\u2019s comments and conduct when the camera was rolling was completely divorced from his comments and conduct when the cameras were not rolling is flatly belied by those outtakes. For example, Daniel contends that during breaks when the cameras were not rolling Wayans made disparaging comments about Daniel\u2019s hair\u2014\u2018\u201cThroughout the day, at least ten times, Wayans called my hair an \u2018Afro\u2019 and would start laughing.\u201d However, in one of the outtakes, Wayans\u2019s character commented repeatedly on the hair of Daniel\u2019s character, promising to get Daniel\u2019s character a \u2018\u201cperm ... a nice moist [Jheri] curl\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> if he will help Wayans\u2019s character move the safe off his dog. In addition, the name given to Daniel\u2019s character, Cleveland was also born from the creative process that occurred when the cameras were not rolling\u2014Wayans\u2019s noticing and commenting on Daniel\u2019s resemblance to the cartoon character. In other words, the evidence shows a direct linkage between the allegedly injury-producing off-camera comments and the film\u2019s creative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Third, Daniel\u2019s argument is bereft of any supporting evidence. Daniel does not offer any testimony or documents rebutting the testimony by Wayans, Pressly, and Alvarez about the creative process for A Haunted House 2. There is, in other words, no evidence showing or even suggesting that the creative process for A Haunted House 2 ceased when the cameras stopped rolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In short, an act is in furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to advance that right or assists in the exercise of that right. (See <em>Lieberman v. KCOP Television, Inc. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 156, 166 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 536] <em>[\u201c\u201cFurtherance </em>means <em>helping </em>to advance, <em>assisting.\u201d].) </em>Here, the testimony and documentary evidence submitted by Wayans regarding the movie\u2019s creative process\u2014which was uncontradicted by Daniel\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>established that the on-set comments and conduct were done to assist Wayans in the exercise of his right to free speech\u2014that is, to make A Haunted House 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">b. <em>Issue of public interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The term \u201cissue of public interest\u201d is construed broadly in the anti-SLAPP context. <em>(Hecimovich v. Encinal School Parent Teacher Organization </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 450, 464 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 455].) An issue of public interest is \u201cany issue in which the public is interested.\u201d <em>(Nygard, Inc. </em>v. <em>Uusi-Kerttula </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1042 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210], italics omitted.) The issue does not need to be \u201c \u2018significant\u2019 \u201d to be covered by the anti-SLAPP statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>For example, in <em>Hecimovich, </em>a California appellate court determined that a dispute between a fourth grade basketball coach and members of a parent teacher organization regarding parental complaints about the plaintiffs abrasive coaching style constituted an issue of public interest because \u201cthe safety of children in sports\u201d is an issue of public interest, the \u201csuitability of [the plaintiffs] coaching style was a matter of public interest among the parents,\u201d and \u201cproblem coaches/problem parents in youth sports\u201d is an issue of public interest. (Hecimovich, at pp. 467-468.) With regard to entertainment, California courts have found that there is a public interest within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute \u201cin the writing, casting and broadcasting\u201d of an episode of a popular television program. <em>(Tamkin v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc., supra, </em>193 Cal.App.4th at p. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Here, Wayans submitted evidence that the making of A Haunted House 2 was an issue of public interest. Wayans is a popular and prolific entertainer\u2014 since 1988, Wayans has acted in 21 films; since 1991, he has acted in 13 different television shows, specials, or movies; since 1992, he has written or co-written 16 different films and/or television movies or shows; and since 1996, he has produced or served as an executive producer of 13 different films and/or television movies or shows. The longevity and breadth of Wayans\u2019s career demonstrate continuing public interest in his work. In addition, many of Wayans\u2019s projects \u201cinvolve making fun of pop culture, racial stereotypes, [and] current events,\u201d adding to the public\u2019s interest in his work. In light of Wayans\u2019s extensive body of work and the subject matter of that work, A Haunted House 2 falls easily within the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s definition of an \u201cissue of public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In sum, Wayans met his burden of making a prima facie showing that the on-set comments and conduct fell within the definition of protected activity set forth in section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The dissenting opinion describes a parade of horribles that the majority opinion would unleash. But these horribles are not before us. And in any case, we agree that the examples described by the dissent would not be in furtherance of the right of free speech. Here, we only hold that Wayans\u2019s conduct, including calling Daniel nigga during the creative process of molding a theatrical work, is protected by free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">2. <em>The Internet posting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The allegedly harassing and offensive Internet posting was a writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum and it was made in connection with an issue of public interest. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">a. <em>Statement made in a public forum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\u2018\u201c[0]ur Supreme Court has held that <em>public access, </em>not the right to public <em>comment, </em>is the hallmark of a public forum: \u2018Web sites accessible to the public ... are <em>\u201cpublic forums </em>\u201d for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nygard, Inc. </em>v. <em>Uusi-Kerttula, supra, </em>159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1039, some italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Here, both Daniel\u2019s and Wayans\u2019s declarations state that the juxtaposed pictures of Daniel and the Cleveland Brown cartoon figure and the accompanying caption were posted to Wayans\u2019s Twitter account, which had over a million followers. The Twitter account constitutes a publicly accessible social media forum. Indeed, according to Daniel\u2019s declaration, both he and his brother saw the Twitter post online. Accordingly, the Internet posting was a statement made in a public forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">b. <em>Issue of public in terest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Although \u201cnot every Web site post involves a public issue\u201d <em>(D.C. v. R.R. </em>(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1226 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 399]), the bar for an anti-SLAPP defendant to overcome is not a particularly demanding one. In <em>Kronemyer v. Internet Movie Database Inc. </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 941 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 48], the mere listing of producer credits for a movie on defendant\u2019s website was found to be \u201can act in furtherance of the right of free speech protected under the anti-SLAPP statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 947.)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Here, the posting at issue references a Twitter account that had more than one million followers (and, per Wayans\u2019s declaration, an Instagram account) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>for the movie A Haunted House 2, as well as Wayans\u2019s Whatthefunny website. As noted above, Wayans is a popular actor, writer, and producer with many films and television shows to his credit. Moreover, A Haunted House 2 was a sequel to A Haunted House (IM Global Octane 2013), which apparently was sufficiently popular and profitable to lead to financing and production of a sequel. According to Wayans\u2019s declaration, when A Haunted House 2 was released, it played in 2,310 theaters and grossed $8.8 million in its first week.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Accordingly, advance information from Wayans about the making of A Haunted House 2, including a photo of someone acting in the film, constitutes a topic of public interest, even though Daniel himself may not have been known to the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The post both referred to a topic of widespread public interest (the film) and contributed to the public \u201cdebate\u201d or discussion regarding the film by giving fans and those interested a glimpse of someone in the film. We therefore conclude that the Internet posting constituted protected activity as provided in section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">IV. <em>Step two: Daniel did not meet his burden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In the second step of an anti-SLAPP analysis, we determine whether plaintiff has produced evidence demonstrating a probability of prevailing on his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">To show a probability of prevailing on his claims, \u201c \u2018the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u201d [Citations.] . . . [T]hough the court does not <em>weigh </em>the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence, it should grant the motion if, as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Taus v. Loftus </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 713-714 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 151 P.3d 1185].) \u201c \u2018The plaintiff may not rely solely on its complaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Paiva </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1017 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 838].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Here, we conclude that Daniel did not meet his burden with respect to any of his claims against Wayans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">A. <em>Racial harassment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Daniel\u2019s racial harassment claim against Wayans (first cause of action) is brought pursuant to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov.

Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 121, 130-131 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 980 P.2d 846].) Harassment, which may be verbal, physical, or visual and \u201ccommunicates an offensive message to the harassed employee\u201d <em>(Roby v.

Whether the harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive environment \u201cmust be assessed from the \u2018perspective of a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>person belonging to the racial or ethnic group of the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nazir v.

In addition, determining whether an environment is hostile requires looking at the totality of the circumstances, including \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Forklift Systems, Inc. </em>(1993) 510 U.S. 17, 23 [126 L.Ed.2d 295, 114 S.Ct. 367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Daniel relies upon <em>Dee v.

Dee </em>cannot be read as Daniel urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Daniel argues on appeal that \u201c \u2018It is beyond question that the use of the word \u201cnigger\u201d is highly offensive and demeaning, evoking a history of racial violence, brutality, and subordination. This word is \u201cperhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English, ... a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry.\u201d \u2019 \u201d We agree with our Supreme Court that although \u201c \u2018nigger\u2019 may once have been in common usage,\u201d it is now considered to be \u201cparticularly abusive and insulting ... as it pertains to the American Negro.\u201d <em>(Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 498, fn. 4 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Nigger, however, is not the term at issue here. Rather, the term at issue is nigga. As Daniel makes clear in his declaration opposing the motion, he was not called nigger by Wayans, but nigga. Nigga is not an unambiguous racial epithet in today\u2019s world, especially when used intraracially, as it was here. In fact, one noted legal scholar, Harvard Eaw professor, Randall Kennedy has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>observed that \u201c \u2018[today,] when African Americans are speaking to each other, \u201cnigger,\u201d and especially its more genial cousin, \u201cnigga\u201d can be an affectionate greeting, a compliment, or a term of respect.\u2019 \u201d (Perdu and Parks, <em>The Nth Decree: Examining Intraracial Use of the N-word in Employment Discrimination Cases </em>(2014) 64 DePaul L.Rev. 65, 67; see Kennedy, Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word (2002) p. 5 [\u201cCurrently, some people insist upon distinguishing nigger\u2014which they see as exclusively an insult\u2014 from nigga, which they view as a term capable of signaling a friendly salutation.\u201d].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Wayans introduced evidence that nigga as used by him\u2014generally and on the set of A Haunted House 2\u2014and as received by others working on the movie was not a racial slur, but a term of endearment. In rebuttal, Daniel stated that, regardless of how others found Wayans\u2019s use of the term, he found the term personally offensive when directed at him. But Daniel limited his rebuttal to only his subjective perspective. In other words, Daniel did not introduce any evidence showing that an objectively reasonable Black actor in his situation would also find the term offensive such that its usage would unreasonably interfere with his work performance. Under the law that is not a sufficient showing. (See <em>Hope </em>v. <em>California Youth Authority </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 577, 588 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 154] [\u201charassment must satisfy an objective <em>and </em>a subjective standard\u201d (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Moreover, the evidence introduced below suggests the contrary to Daniel\u2019s claim\u2014that is, a reasonable Black actor who voluntarily agreed to participate in a movie addressing racial stereotypes that was written, produced and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>starred Wayans\u2014an artist known for his frequent use of both nigger and nigga in his work<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2014would be on notice that potentially racially charged language would be used in the film, and, given the improvisational nature of the production, that such language might be used among the actors and production staff when the cameras were not rolling to help develop storylines and dialogue. Consequently, under the facts of this case the use of the term nigga did not create a \u201c \u2018hostile or abusive work environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The doubts about Daniel\u2019s ability to prevail on his racial harassment claim are raised to a fatal level when he fails to mention, let alone discuss, how the use of the allegedly offensive language adversely affected him in his work for the movie and would have affected a reasonable Black actor\u2019s performance. Although Daniel states that Wayans\u2019s alleged harassment made him feel \u201cself-conscious, insecure,\u201d \u201chumiliated,\u201d and \u201cembarrassed\u201d while he was on the set, his declaration is completely and tellingly silent with regard to how Wayans\u2019s on-set comments and conduct adversely affected his work performance that day. None of the other declarants who were on the set that day\u2014Wayans, Pressly, and Alvarez\u2014observed Daniel having any trouble in performing his duties. None of the declarants, including Daniel himself, states, for example, that his scene had to be reshot and/or delayed in being shot because Daniel was plainly troubled by something that occurred when the cameras were not rolling and, as a result, he was unable to get into character and/or perform his role in an efficient and effective manner. The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from such silence is that the alleged racial harassment had no adverse effect on Daniel\u2019s work performance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In sum, looking, as we must, at the totality of the circumstances, the alleged acts of racial harassment here did not alter the conditions of Daniel\u2019s employment and create an abusive environment. Even when we credit Daniel\u2019s evidence, that evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a judgment favorable to him. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly struck Daniel\u2019s racial harassment claim against Wayans.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">B. <em>Misappropriation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Daniel\u2019s claims for statutory and common law misappropriation of name and likeness (fifth and sixth causes of action) are based solely on the Internet posting. Daniel failed to meet his burden of showing a probability of prevailing with respect to these claims for two reasons: first, Daniel failed to overcome evidence that he waived his claims when he signed the voucher, which contained a broad release consenting to the use of his image in connection with the movie; second, even if Daniel did not release his claims or the voucher was inadmissible, Wayans\u2019s transformative use of Daniel\u2019s photograph established a complete defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">1. <em>The voucher</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">An essential element for either a common law or statutory misappropriation claim is the unauthorized use of plaintiff\u2019s image. (See <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Sega of American, Inc. </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 47, 55 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 607] [common law misappropriation claim]; <em>Montana </em>v. <em>San Jose Mercury News, Inc. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 790, 793 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 639] [statutory misappropriation claim].) As discussed above, the voucher contains a broad release regarding the use of Daniel\u2019s image \u201cin <em>any </em>manner whatsoever and for <em>any </em>reason in connection with The Production.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">On appeal, Daniel makes two related arguments: (a) the trial court improperly overruled his objection to the voucher on authentication grounds; and (b) the voucher does not establish that the release runs in favor of Wayans. We do not find either argument to have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">a. <em>The trial court did not err by overruling Daniel's authentication objection to the voucher</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">\u201cEvidentiary challenges [on an anti-SLAPP motion] are reviewed only for abuse of discretion.

Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. </em>(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 643, 683 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u201c[W]hile all writings must be authenticated before they are received into evidence ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1401), the proponent\u2019s burden of producing evidence to show authenticity ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1400) is met \u2018when sufficient evidence has been produced to sustain a finding that the document is what it purports to be. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] The author\u2019s testimony is not required to authenticate a document ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1411); instead, its authenticity may be established by the contents of the writing ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1421) or by other means ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1410 [no restriction on \u2018the means by which a writing may be authenticated\u2019]). \u2018As long as the evidence would support a finding of authenticity, the writing is admissible. The fact conflicting inferences can be drawn regarding authenticity goes to the document\u2019s weight as evidence, not its admissibility. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201c[L]ike any other material fact, the authenticity of a [document] may be established by circumstantial evidence. . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1435 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Here, Wayans presented sufficient circumstantial evidence for the trial court to find that the document had been authenticated. As discussed above, the voucher was attached as an exhibit to Alvarez\u2019s declaration. The voucher indicates that the production or project name is \u201cDumb Ass Prod.,\u201d not A Haunted House 2. However, Alvarez stated in his declaration that the \u201cproduction company for A Haunted House 2 was Dumb Ass Productions, which is why that company is listed on the [voucher].\u201d (Italics omitted.) In addition, Alvarez indicated in his declaration that he was in a position to have personal knowledge of the corporate entities involved in the making of the movie, as well as the vouchers used with extras, such as Daniel, and Daniel\u2019s execution of the voucher. Alvarez states that as the coproducer of the movie he was responsible for \u201coversee[ing] the <em>entire </em>production.\u201d (Italics added.) In addition, Alvarez states he was \u201con the set the one day that Mr. Daniel was on the set and was present during the shooting of the scene in which Mr. Daniel appeared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">From the facts in Alvarez\u2019s declaration, it can be readily inferred that the voucher was a true and accurate copy of the document that Daniel signed allowing him to be present on the set of A Haunted House 2 and to work as an extra on that movie on September 4, 2013. (Daniel does not dispute that he signed the voucher or that the voucher contains his address, phone number and redacted social security number.) Accordingly, the trial court, considering all of the facts before it, did not exceed the bounds of reason by overruling Daniel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>b. <em>The voucher\u2019s release extends to Wayans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Daniel asserts that there is \u201cnothing in this record to demonstrate that Wayans was entitled to the benefit of the contract between Daniel and Dumb Ass Productions.\u201d Daniel\u2019s assertion is incorrect. As discussed above, Alvarez states in his declaration that Dumb Ass Productions is the production company responsible for making A Haunted House 2. Both Alvarez and Wayans identify Wayans as one of the movie\u2019s coproducers. Those two undisputed facts are sufficient for purposes of an anti-SLAPP motion to show that the voucher\u2019s broad release includes Wayans.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">2. <em>Wayans\u2019s use of Daniel\u2019s image was transformative</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment exists to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas and to further individual rights of self-expression. <em>(Winter v. DC Comics </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 881, 887 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 P.3d 473] (Winter).) The protections may extend to all forms of expression, including written and spoken words (fact or fiction), music, films, paintings, and entertainment, whether or not sold for a profit. <em>(Comedy III Productions, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 387, 406 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d 797] <em>(Comedy III).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In <em>Comedy III, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 387 and again in <em>Winter, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 881, our Supreme Court addressed the balance between an individual\u2019s right to control the commercial exploitation of his or her likeness or identity and the First Amendment right of free expression. (See <em>Comedy III, </em>at p. 400; <em>Winter, </em>at pp. 887-888.) In <em>Comedy III, </em>the court held a defendant may raise the First Amendment as an affirmative defense to an allegation of appropriation if the defendant\u2019s work \u201c \u2018adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Comedy III, </em>at p. 404.) In other words, the new work must contain significant \u201ctransformative elements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 406-407.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The transformative test is straightforward: The \u201cinquiry is whether the celebrity likeness is one of the \u2018raw materials\u2019 from which an original work is synthesized, or whether the depiction or imitation of the celebrity is the very sum and substance of the work in question.\u201d <em>(Comedy III, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 406.) If the \u201cproduct containing the celebrity\u2019s likeness is so transformed that it has become primarily the defendant\u2019s own expression\u201d of what he or she is trying to create or portray, rather than the celebrity\u2019s likeness, it is protected. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 406-407.) In developing the test, the <em>Comedy III </em>court made two important observations. First, the right to control one\u2019s image \u201ccannot, consistent with the First Amendment, be a right to control the . . . image by censoring disagreeable portrayals. . . . [T]he First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Amendment dictates that the right to comment on, parody, lampoon, and make other expressive uses of the celebrity image must be given broad scope.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 403.) Second, \u2018\u201cin determining whether the work is transformative, courts are not to be concerned with the quality of the artistic contribution\u2014vulgar forms of expression fully qualify for First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 407.) In short, all that is necessary is that the defendant\u2019s work add \u201c \u2018something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 404.) A work is transformative if it adds \u201c \u2018new expression.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>That expression alone is sufficient; it need not convey any \u201c \u2018meaning ... or message.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Applying this test in <em>Comedy III, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 387, which involved drawings depicting The Three Stooges, and T-shirts made from those drawings, the court concluded the drawings and T-shirts were not entitled to First Amendment protection. The artist who created them, while highly skilled, contributed nothing other than a trivial variation that transformed the drawings from literal likenesses of the three actors. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 408^-09.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The Supreme Court applied the transformative test again two years later in <em>Winter, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 881. In that case, the defendant published a series of confies featuring two half-worm, half-human characters based on singers Edgar and Johnny Winter. Both characters had long white hair and albino features similar to the Winter brothers, while one wore a hat similar to one often worn by Johnny Winter. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 886.) The Winter brothers sued for statutory appropriation and lost on summary judgment. The Court of Appeal affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The Supreme Court, however, granted review. Applying the transformative test, the court found for the defendants, holding that the comic depictions contained significant expressive content beyond the Winters\u2019 mere likenesses and were \u2018\u201centitled to First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 890, 892.) As the Supreme Court explained, the Winters were merely part of the raw material from which the confies\u2019 plot and characters were fashioned. In addition, the characters were distorted pictures of the Winters for the purpose of lampoon, parody or caricature. In short, and in stark contrast to the near literal depictions of the Three Stooges in <em>Comedy III, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 387, the comic book characters depicted were \u2018\u201cfanciful, creative characters, not pictures of the Winter brothers.\u201d <em>(Winter, </em>at p. 892.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Here, although Wayans used two unaltered images\u2014one of Daniel and one of the Cleveland Brown character\u2014his use of those images was nonetheless transformative. Wayans\u2019s use was transformative in the combination of the juxtaposed images <em>with </em>his commentary. That combination of images and arguably humorous commentary provided the Internet posting with an element of caricature, lampoon, or parody. It is this element that puts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Internet posting within the protection of the First Amendment. In other words, Wayans\u2019s juxtaposition of Daniel\u2019s image with the image of the Cleveland Brown character and his caption added \u201c \u2018something new\u2019 \u201d to Daniel\u2019s image, altering it with a \u201c \u2018new expression, meaning, or message.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Comedy III, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In sum, because the voucher was authenticated and because its release is not only broad but can reasonably be read to extend to Wayans, Daniel failed to show a probability of prevailing. Alternatively, even if the voucher had not been authenticated, or the evidence was insufficient to show that its release extended to Wayans, the Internet posting was a transformative use of Daniel\u2019s image and, as a result, Wayans has an affirmative defense to Daniel\u2019s misappropriation claims. In fight of the voucher\u2019s release and the Internet posting\u2019s transformative use, the trial court properly struck the misappropriation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">C. <em>False light</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201c \u2018One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false fight is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if (a) the false fight in which the other was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false fight in which the other would be placed.\u2019 \u201d (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Torts, \u00a7 673, p. 988.) A \u201cfalse light\u201d cause of action is a variety of defamation and is subject to the same requirements. <em>(Aisenson </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Co. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 146, 161 [269 Cal.Rptr. 379].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u201cIn determining whether a statement is libelous we look to what is explicitly stated as well as what insinuation and implication can be reasonably drawn from the communication.\u201d <em>(Forsher </em>v. <em>Bugliosi </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 792, 803 [163 Cal.Rptr. 628, 608 P.2d 716].) \u201c \u2018 \u201c[I]f the defendant juxtaposes [a] series of facts so as to imply a defamatory connection between them, or [otherwise] creates a defamatory implication ... he may be held responsible for the defamatory implication, . . . even though the particular facts are correct.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Weller v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 991, 1003, fn. 10 [283 Cal.Rptr. 644].) A court examines the totality of the circumstances, including the context in which the statement was made. <em>(Baker v. Los Angeles Herald Examiner </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 254, 260-261 [228 Cal.Rptr. 206, 721 P.2d 87].) Opinions are constitutionally protected and cannot form the basis of a defamation-type claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 260.) Whether a statement constitutes a statement of fact or opinion is a question of law. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIn making such a determination, the court must place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>itself in the position of the hearer or reader, and determine the sense or meaning of the statement according to its natural and popular construction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Based on the language used and the totality of the surrounding circumstances, the court determines whether the average reader or hearer \u2018\u201ccould have reasonably understood the alleged defamatory statement to be one of fact.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 261.) \u2018\u201cPhotographs are not actionable if they are fair and accurate depictions of the person and scene in question, even if they place the person in a less than flattering light, so long as the photographs do not surpass the limits of decency by being highly offensive to persons of ordinary sensibilities.\u201d <em>(Aisenson v. American Broadcasting Co., supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Here, the Internet posting referred only to Daniel\u2019s physical resemblance to the Cleveland Brown cartoon character. It twice expressly referred to how Daniel looked. It did not insinuate or imply that Daniel shared any personality characteristics or, as Daniel argues, \u201c'suggest] | that Daniel is a real-life incarnation of the cartoon figure.\u201d Moreover, it was a combination of an expression of an opinion by Wayans that Daniel looked like Cleveland Brown and an accurate photographic comparison. Accordingly, Daniel did not show a probability of prevailing on his false light claim, and the trial court properly struck it.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">D. <em>Quasi-contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Daniel\u2019s quasi-contract claim (eighth cause of action) is based solely on the Internet posting. According to the complaint, Wayans obtained an improper \u2018\u201cbenefit\u201d from using Daniel\u2019s likeness in the Internet posting. The Internet posting, according to the complaint, was improper because the photograph of Daniel used in that posting was taken \u2018\u201cwithout [his] consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u2018\u201c[I]t is well settled that an action based on an implied-in-fact or quasi-contract cannot lie where there exists between the parties a valid express contract covering the same subject matter.\u201d <em>(Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 203 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 622]; see <em>Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231 [166 Cal.Rptr.3d 864].)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Here, there was a valid express contract covering the use of Daniel\u2019s photograph in connection with A Haunted House 2: the voucher. By signing the voucher, Daniel not only gave Wayans the right to use his photograph \u2018\u201cin any manner whatsoever and for any reason\u201d in connection with the movie, but also acknowledged that the wages he received for his work on the movie were \u2018\u201cpayment in full\u201d\u2014that is, he is not entitled to any other payment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>including payment for the use of his photograph. Because Daniel did not show a probability of prevailing on his quasi-contract claim, the trial court properly struck it.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">E. <em>Unjust enrichment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Like his quasi-contract claim, Daniel\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment is based solely on the Internet posting. Technically, \u201c[ujnjust enrichment is not a cause of action, ... or even a remedy\u201d; it is instead a principle or state \u2018\u201cdescribing \u2018 \u201cthe result of a failure to make restitution.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(McBride </em>v. <em>Boughton </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 387 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 115].) However, because this appeal concerns an anti-SLAPP motion, we disregard how a plaintiff may have styled or labeled a particular cause of action and focus instead on the claim\u2019s merits. <em>(Hylton v. Frank. E. Rogozienski, Inc. </em>(2009) <em>111 </em>Cal.App.4th 1264, 1272 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 805].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Daniel\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment suffers from two related problems. First, a party to an express contract can assert a claim for restitution based on unjust enrichment by only \u201c \u2018alleging in that cause of action] that the express contract is void or was rescinded.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 231.) Here, Daniel does not allege in his complaint and has not demonstrated in his declaration opposing Wayans\u2019s motion that the voucher was void or rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Second, and more substantively, Daniel\u2019s unjust enrichment claim suffers from many of the same problems that bedevil his quasi-contract claim: Daniel (1) was hired as a nonspeaking extra in a one day role; (2) was paid in full for his services; (3) acknowledged in writing that he received \u201cpayment in full\u201d; and (4) released any right to any use of his image in connection with the promotion of A Haunted House 2. Consequently, Daniel failed to show a probability of prevailing on his quasi-contract claim, and the trial court properly struck it.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">F. <em>Intentional infliction of emotioned distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Daniel\u2019s claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress is based on both the on-set comments and conduct and the Internet posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant\u2019s outrageous conduct. <em>(Potter </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 1001 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 863 P.2d 795]; see <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Pair </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 209 P.3d 963].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cConduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Potter, at p. 1001.) However, \u201cliability \u2018does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities,\u2019 but only to conduct so extreme and outrageous \u2018as to go beyond all possible bonds of decency . . . \u201d <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 493, 499, fn. 5; see <em>Hughes, </em>at p. 1051.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, the allegedly outrageous conduct consisted of a number of boorish and/or juvenile comments about Daniel\u2019s physical appearance, the use of the term nigga, which in contemporary usage may or may not be a term of endearment among African-Americans depending on the circumstances, and an arguably contic juxtaposition of photographs on the Internet. Although Daniel may have found such conduct hurtful, under all the circumstances Wayans\u2019s conduct was not so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community. Rather, the alleged misconduct falls more in the category of insults, indignities, annoyances, and petty oppressions. Accordingly, the trial court properly struck this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">V. <em>Attorney fees award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The trial court, pursuant to section 425.16, subdivision (c), awarded Wayans his attorney fees as the prevailing party. Daniel does not challenge the amount of those fees. Instead, his challenge to those fees is a global one\u2014that is, Wayans was not entitled to those fees because his anti-SLAPP motion should not have been granted. Because we hold that the trial court properly granted Wayans\u2019s anti-SLAPP motion, we further hold that the award of attorney fees was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The judgment and order granting the anti-SLAPP motion and dismissing the complaint are affirmed. The order granting Marlon Wayans\u2019s attorney fees is also affirmed. Marlon Wayans is awarded his costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-10\">Rothschild, P.

Nonetheless, the majority opinion, as well as the concurring opinion of Justice Chin, provides a number of illuminating insights about the creative process for developing a somewhat raunchy comedy. <em>Lyle </em>involved a claim by a female employee of a television production company that the use of sexual language in the workplace by the male writers of the television show <em>Friends </em>gave rise to a hostile work environment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 271.) The Supreme Com! \u201cgranted review to address whether the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language in the workplace can constitute harassment based on sex within the meaning of the [California Fair' Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900)] <em>(Id. </em>at p. 272.) It concluded: \u201cBased on the totality of the undisputed circumstances, particularly the fact that the <em>Friends </em>production was a creative workplace focused on generating scripts for an adult-oriented comedy show featuring sexual themes, we find no reasonable trier of fact could conclude such language constituted harassment directed at plaintiff because of her sex within the meaning of the FEHA.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Lyle </em>majority went on to state: \u201cThat the writers commonly engaged in discussions of personal sexual experiences and preferences and used physical gesturing while brainstorming and generating script ideas for this particular show was neither surprising nor unreasonable from a creative standpoint.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Based on the testimony of Wayans, Pressly and Alvarez about the improvisational creative process used for the making of A Haunted House 2\u2014an adult-oriented, R-rated feature-length comedy featuring race-based humor\u2014it is not surprising or unreasonable that terms such as nigga, nigger and niggie, which were used dozens of times in the final version of the movie, were also used by the cast and writers as they brainstormed ideas for the script while on-set but in between the filming of scenes (i.e\u201e \u201cduring breaks, while no cameras were rolling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">In short, the creative process should not be confined, as Daniel argues, to a fixed place or point in time (i.e\u201e only when the cameras are rolling). To borrow from Ernest Hemingway, the creative process, depending on the circumstances, may well be a movable feast.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> \u201cA Jheri curl is created by a chemical process that gives black people\u2019s hair a glossy, loosely curled look. . . .

The highly ambiguous/context-specific nature of the term nigga is captured by Dictionary.com: \u201cNigga is used mainly among African Americans, but also among other minorities and ethnicities, in a neutral or familial' way and as a friendly term of address. It is also common in rap music. However, nigga is taken to be extremely offensive when used by outsiders.

In <em>Rodgers, </em>the plaintiffs supervisor, a White man, who also liked the plaintiff, a Black man, used profanity and personal insults to motivate the plaintiff and other subordinates. The insults included unambiguous racial remarks\u2014including the use of the word nigger\u2014as well as many race-neutral epithets over the course of 12 years. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 671.) In addition to verbal abuse, the plaintiffs supervisor on one occasion dumped out the contents of the plaintiffs desk. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result of the \u201charsh treatment and racist language,\u201d plaintiff suffered a number of physical problems for which he sought medical treatment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Despite the job-related stress resulting from the harsh treatment and racial insults, the plaintiff continued to work for the defendant. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the stress became so severe that the plaintiff repeatedly asked for a demotion and when the last of those requests were refused, he resigned. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.) Here, in contrast to the plaintiff in <em>Rodgers. </em>Daniel was exposed to a handful of arguably racist comments and some arguably offensive but race-neutral comments over the course of a single work day, comments which apparently did not interfere with his work performance at all or force him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>seek reduced responsibilities or any other on-the-job relief from the alleged misconduct.

Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling in part and permit Daniel\u2019s action to proceed on claims relating to both the alleged on-set conduct of respondent Marlon Wayans (Wayans) and to his Internet posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Because this is an appeal from an order granting an anti-SLAPP motion, we must accept the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s evidence as true.\u201d <em>(Baral v.

While on the set, when no filming was occurring, the producer, cowriter and star of the movie, Wayans, repeatedly called Daniel \u201c \u2018nigga\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018black fat ass,\u2019 \u201d mocked him for his \u201c \u2018Afro\u2019 \u201d hairstyle, approached Daniel while sneering, leering and rolling his eyes, compared Daniel to an unflattering character (Cleveland Brown) in the animated series <em>Family Guy, </em>and generally treated him in a demeaning and abusive manner. Daniel had no prior relationship with Wayans and did not participate in this insulting conduct that Wayans characterized as \u201cjoking.\u201d Indeed, he testified that he walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The insulting conduct was not limited to the set. Without Daniel\u2019s permission, Wayans took Daniel\u2019s picture on Wayans\u2019s cell phone. Wayans posted the picture on his personal Twitter account next to a picture of the Cleveland Brown animated character with a caption comparing \u201c \u2018this nigga\u2019 \u201d (Daniel) to \u201c \u2018THIS NIGGA\u2019 \u201d (Cleveland Brown). Many people saw the pictures, resulting in repeated embarrassing questions as to whether Daniel is the \u201c \u2018Cleveland Brown\u2019 \u201d character from Wayans\u2019s post.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">1. <em>Wayans\u2019s on-set conduct, as alleged, was not in furtherance of his constitutional right to free speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The majority concludes that Wayans\u2019s alleged on-set conduct was protected under the anti-SLAPP statute because it was part of the creative process of making the movie. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7425.16, subd. (e)(4).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority observes that Daniel did not rebut Wayans\u2019s evidence that creation of the movie involved a great deal of on-set improvisation both before and during filming, along with a \u201c \u2018light, funny atmosphere\u2019 \u201d in which \u201c \u2018[ejveryone . . . joked around with each other as part of the creative process.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The problem with this analysis is that Daniel did not willingly participate in this creative process. Under Daniel\u2019s version of events\u2014which we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>accept on this appeal\u2014he was not a collaborator in a crass but collegial brainstorming session. He did not know Wayans. He was not hired to be a writer or creative consultant. He was an extra hired for one day to be a \u201cnon-descriptive furniture mover who would be assisting in moving boxes in and out of a house.\u201d He was the target of, not a participant in, others\u2019 demeaning and offensive humor.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The humor was racially charged. We have no reason to question Wayans\u2019s claim that he commonly uses the term \u201c \u2018nigga\u2019 \u201d as a term of endearment with friends of all races. But it hardly stretches credibility when Daniel claims that the use of such an historically fraught term offended and insulted <em>him.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Most important, it is not our role to decide credibility. We accept Daniel\u2019s testimony that he was offended and evaluate the circumstances in which the offensive conduct occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Daniel\u2019s claim that the conduct at issue here was specifically directed <em>at him </em>creates a critical difference between the facts of this case and the facts in <em>Lyle </em>v. <em>Warner Brothers Television Productions </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 264 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 2, 132 P.3d 211] <em>(Lyle), </em>which the majority suggests provides \u201cinsights about the creative process for developing a somewhat raunchy comedy.\u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 384, fn. 2.) In <em>Lyle, </em>a former comedy assistant on the television show <em>Friends </em>brought a claim for sexual harassment based upon sexually explicit language that the male writers used. In affirming summary judgment, our Supreme Court was careful to note that the record showed that the sexual antics and discussions at issue \u201cdid not involve and were not aimed at plaintiff or any other female employee.\u201d <em>(Lyle, </em>at p. 287.) Here, the conduct at issue was allegedly aimed at Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In his concurring opinion in <em>Lyle, </em>Justice Chin explained that protection of the creative process is particularly important in lawsuits that are \u201cdirected at restricting the creative process in a workplace <em>whose very business is speech </em>related.\u201d <em>(Lyle, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 297 (cone. opn. of Chin, J.).) But he also concluded that, \u201c[j]ust as criminal threats are not protected, just as no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>one has the right to falsely shout \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theater, limits exist as to what may occur in the writers\u2019 room.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 299.) Even in that context, \u2018\u201cspeech that is <em>directed, </em>or \u2018aimed at a particular employee because of her race, sex, religion, or national origin,\u2019 is not protected.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting Volokh, <em>Freedom of Speech and Workplace Harassment </em>(1992) 39 UCLA L.Rev. 1791, 1846.) I would draw that same line here.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The record in this case supports such a limit. Wayans did not claim that offensive conduct <em>targeting </em>a particular person is part of his creative process. Rather, he testified that Daniel was \u2018\u201claughing and joking\u201d along with the rest of the cast and claimed that Daniel never objected or suggested that \u2018\u201che was uncomfortable in any way with the joke.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His costar, Jaime Pressly, went even further in explaining the nature of the creative process that Wayans employed on the set. She testified that \u2018\u201c[t]he practice on set is that if anyone is uncomfortable with anything that is said, we take it back and agree not to use it. As part of his practice, Mr. Wayans makes sure that the subject of the joke is okay with the joke.\u201d Thus, Wayans himself apparently does not believe that the creative process must extend to conduct that directly offends a cast member.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">There are no discernible limits to the conduct that would be protected under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the creative process. What if, for example, a producer/writer/actor claimed that he needed to inspire his creative muse by repeatedly using racial epithets toward and mocking the appearance of a caterer who happened to be near the set? Or what if he engaged in unwanted sexual conduct with a female extra during a lunch break as a way to try out a new joke? Or parodied a disabled production assistant? Under the majority\u2019s analysis, it seems that a writer or actor has free rein to insult and degrade others so long as he or she claims that it somehow helps him or her to make movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">True, victims of such conduct might get past an anti-SLAPP motion if they manage to convince a court that they will probably succeed on their claims. But requiring them to make such a showing before they have even had an opportunity for discovery is an unwarranted extension of the prelitigation screening authorized by the anti-SLAPP statute and stretches the definition of conduct that is \u2018\u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the constitutional right of free speech beyond any reasonable bound. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">I recognize, of course, that the anti-SLAPP statute is to be broadly construed and that to prevail on an anti-SLAPP motion a defendant need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>prove that the plaintiffs motive in bringing the lawsuit was actually to chill the exercise of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights or that the action has actually had a chilling effect on the exercise of such rights. (\u00a7425.16, subd. (a); <em>Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].) The scope of the anti-SLAPP statute therefore can extend beyond the \u201cquintessential\u201d SLAPP, which is \u201cfiled by an economic powerhouse to dissuade its opponent from exercising its constitutional right to free speech or to petition.\u201d <em>(Nam v. Regents of University of California </em>(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1176, 1193 [205 Cal.Rptr.3d 687] <em>(Nam).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">However, in considering how far to extend the definition of the creative process for purposes of anti-SLAPP protection, it is appropriate to consider the stated legislative purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute, which is to address \u201clawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.\u201d (\u00a7425.16, subd. (a); see <em>Nam, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1189, 1193.) The record of this case does not suggest that permitting a lawsuit by an extra for racially offensive conduct directed toward him on the set would have any effect on the content of movies or the creative process for making them. While improvisation and racially tinged bantering might be a part of Wayans\u2019s creative process, there is no reason to believe that this process must include conduct amounting to racial harassment of a subordinate employee. To the contrary: As discussed above, Wayans\u2019s evidence showed that his typical creative process was intended to be collaborative and to make sure that no one is made to feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">On the other hand, extending the definition of the creative process to encompass such conduct does threaten to chill meritorious lawsuits with the prospect of losing an anti-SLAPP motion. Individuals such as Daniel\u2014who is hardly an \u201ceconomic powerhouse\u201d in the hierarchy of Hollywood\u2014are far more likely to be intimidated by the possibility of a substantial attorney fee award than they are to file suit for the purpose of intimidation. (See <em>Nam, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1188-1189 [anti-SLAPP law \u201cwas designed to ferret out meritless lawsuits intended to quell the free exercise of First Amendment rights, not to burden victims of discrimination and retaliation with an earlier and heavier burden of proof than other civil litigants and dissuade the exercise of their right to petition for fear of an onerous attorney fee award\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In concluding that the conduct at issue here\u2014alleged racially offensive and degrading comments specifically aimed at Daniel\u2014should not be considered in furtherance of constitutionally protected free speech, I do not suggest that the trial court should have evaluated the merits of Daniel\u2019s racial harassment claim as part of the first step in the SLAPP analysis. The relevant distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>here is not between conduct that would or would not support a harassment claim. Rather, the important distinction for purposes of defining the contours of the creative process is between creative collaboration, even if it includes offensive topics, and demeaning conduct that is directed at a specific person. The latter is outside the bounds of constitutionally protected free speech. <em>(Lyle, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 299-300 (cone. opn. of Chin, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Therefore, I would hold that, with respect to Wayans\u2019s alleged on-set conduct, Wayans failed to prove the first step of his anti-SLAPP motion. The alleged conduct was not in furtherance of his constitutional right of free speech, and the trial court should have permitted Daniel\u2019s claim for racial harassment to proceed with respect to such conduct. For the same reason, the trial court should have permitted Daniel\u2019s 10th cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress to proceed with respect to Wayans\u2019s alleged on-set conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">2. <em>Wayans failed to provide evidence sufficient to show that the scope of Daniel's release extended to Wayans\u2019s Internet posting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">I agree with the majority that the \u201callegedly harassing and offensive Internet posting was a writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum and it was made in connection with an issue of public interest.\u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 387; see \u00a7425.16, subd. (e)(3).) The trial court therefore properly concluded that Wayans met his burden with respect to the first step of the SLAPP analysis with respect to the Internet posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the second step of the anti-SLAPP inquiry concerning the merits of Daniel\u2019s claims. The majority accepts Wayans\u2019s argument that Daniel executed a broad union voucher that precludes his claims for statutory and common law misappropriation of likeness (Daniel\u2019s fifth and sixth causes of action) and for implied contract and unjust enrichment (Daniel\u2019s eighth and ninth causes of action). In my view, Wayans did not meet his burden to show that the scope of the consent that Daniel provided in the voucher extended to Wayans\u2019s Internet posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Wayans\u2019s only evidence concerning the scope of the union voucher was the voucher itself and two sentences in a declaration submitted by a producer and cowriter of A Haunted House 2, Rick Alvarez. The Alvarez declaration purports to identify the voucher as a \u201cStandard Union Voucher\u201d that Daniel signed, and states that \u201cDumb Ass Productions\u201d was a production company for A Haunted House 2, \u201cwhich is why that company is listed on the Standard Union Voucher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The voucher, which bears the signature \u201cPierre Daniel,\u201d grants to the \u201cProduction Company of The Production, its successors, assignees, licensees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>or any other person or company who might gain title or rights to the production, the right to photograph me and record my voice to use, alter, dub, edit and or otherwise change such photographs and recordings, in any manner whatsoever and for any reason in connection with The Production, such right to be worldwide and in perpetuity.\u201d The only identification of \u2018\u201cThe Production\u201d appears in a field for \u201cPRODUCTION &amp; PROJECT NAME,\u201d which lists \u201cDumb Ass Prod.\u201d The voucher does not mention Wayans or A Haunted House 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">I do not believe that this evidence is sufficient as a matter of law to overcome Daniel\u2019s testimony that Wayans did not have his consent to take his picture and to post it on the Internet. <em>(Baral, supra, </em>1 Cal.5th at p. 385 [defendant\u2019s showing must \u201cdefeat[] the plaintiff\u2019s claim as a matter of law\u201d].) The record does not establish that the consent in the voucher (1) applied to Wayans or (2) applied to the use that Wayans made of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The majority concludes that Wayans was entitled to the benefit of the release because there was evidence that Dumb Ass Productions was a production company for A Haunted House 2 and Wayans was a coproducer of the movie. (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 395.) But there was no evidence of any connection between Wayans and Dumb Ass Productions, which is the only entity identified on the voucher. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to show that Wayans either was acting on behalf of Dumb Ass Productions in making the Internet post or was one of the \u201csuccessors, assignees, licensees\u201d of Dumb Ass Productions or a person with rights to the production.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">There was also insufficient evidence to establish that Wayans was acting \u201cin connection with The Production\u201d in making that post. Wayans made the post to his own Twitter account. The only connection to A Haunted House 2 was a link to the movie\u2019s Twitter and Instagram pages, which Wayans included along with a link to his own website. Wayans\u2019s declaration does not address <em>why </em>he made the post. According to Daniel, Wayans took Daniel\u2019s picture on Wayans\u2019s cell phone without Daniel\u2019s knowledge or permission during a break. There is a difference between photography done for the purpose of filming and photography allegedly done during a break on a personal device for the purpose of posting on a personal Twitter account. Without more evidence to show that Wayans\u2019s particular use of Daniel\u2019s picture was \u201cin connection with The Production\u201d as contemplated by the standard release in the union voucher, I would not preclude Daniel\u2019s claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">I am also not persuaded that Wayans\u2019s Internet post was a \u201ctransformative use\u201d of Daniel\u2019s likeness as a matter of law. The Internet post in issue in this case contained no significant transformative elements. Wayans used Daniel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>photo not as raw material for an original work, but as a literal depiction of Daniel\u2019s appearance and a literal depiction of the appearance of cartoon character Cleveland Brown. Wayans simply repackaged the two images together and added a caption remarking upon the resemblance of the two. This was not a transformation that was primarily Wayans\u2019s own expression. Thus, the facts here are closer to the use of the literal likeness of The Three Stooges in <em>Comedy III Production, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 387, 408 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 126, 21 P.3d 797], than to the comic book illustrations of \u201cfanciful, creative characters\u201d in <em>Winter v. DC Comics </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 881, 892 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 634, 69 R3d 473].</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">3. <em>Daniel demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would succeed on his claim for intentional infliction of emotioned distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Because I conclude that Wayans\u2019s Internet posting was protected free speech under the anti-SLAPP statute, it is necessary to consider whether Daniel showed that he had a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claim that the Internet post referring to him as \u201cnigga\u201d and comparing his picture to the picture of Cleveland Brown amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I conclude that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The majority finds that Wayans\u2019s alleged conduct, including the Internet post, \u201cwas not so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community,\u201d but was \u201cmore in the category of insults, indignities, annoyances, and petty oppressions.\u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 400.) For the reasons discussed earlier, I disagree that Wayans\u2019s use of the term \u201cnigga\u201d in his post to refer to Daniel was not extreme as a matter of law. Again, context is important. Daniel saw the post after a day in which he claims Wayans subjected him to in-person racial harassment and demeaning treatment. If, as he claims, he was the target of racial insults by Wayans previously, it was reasonable to expect that he would react to the term \u201cnigga\u201d in the Internet post as more of the same. It was also highly foreseeable that Wayans\u2019s comparison of Daniel to an unflattering African-American animated character on Wayans\u2019s personal Twitter account\u2014which he testified had over a million followers\u2014could cause extreme distress. Daniel testified that it did, claiming that he lost sleep and was apprehensive about going out in public. Wayans\u2019s post has been reposted and could easily be viewable for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">California courts have repeatedly held that the use of racial epithets can support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>(Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216] [African-American plaintiff stated a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress based upon allegations that his supervisor referred to him using the term \u201cniggers\u201d in a demeaning manner]; <em>Agarwal v. Johnson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 932 [160 Cal.Rptr. 141, 603 P.2d 58] [affirming jury verdict on the plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on conduct that included the use of racial epithets by the plaintiffs supervisor to humiliate him], disapproved on another point in <em>White </em>v. <em>Ultramar, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 574, fn. 4 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 981 P.2d 944]; <em>Robinson v. Hewlett-Packard Corp. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1108 [228 Cal.Rptr. 591] [supervisor insulted plaintiff and his race in an employment setting].) A jury could reasonably find that Wayans\u2019s alleged conduct was outrageous, and I would therefore permit Daniel\u2019s intentional infliction claim to proceed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment and the order granting the anti-SLAPP motion and dismissing the complaint and direct the trial court to enter a new order partially granting the anti-SLAPP motion and striking the false light and Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.) causes of action in their entirety and paragraph 9(h) of the racial harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted May 10, 2017, S240704.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\"> Subsequent undesignated statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> The majority engages in a scholarly discussion of the evolution of, and differences between, the terms \u201cnigger\u201d and \u201cnigga\u201d and the current offensive and inoffensive usages of the terms. But the key component of that analysis is that the meaning of the terms depends upon the circumstances. As the majority explains, the term \u201c \u2018nigga\u2019 \u201d \u201ccan have a number of different meanings when used by different people in different contexts.\u201d (Maj. opn. <em>ante, </em>at p. 391, fn. 7.) No one can seriously question that either term can be highly offensive when used in an offensive manner. Indeed, in recognition of the term\u2019s connotations, in 2007 the NAACP held a mock funeral for the \u201cN\u201d word, complete with a horse drawn carriage carrying \u201ca wooden coffin that adorned black roses and a ribbon with the word \u2018nigga\u2019 displayed.\u201d (&lt;http://www.naacp.org/latest/the-n-word-is-laid-to-rest-by-the-naacp&gt; [as of Feb. 9, 2017].) The context that Daniel describes in this case is use of the term \u201c \u2018nigga\u2019 \u201d by one person (Wayans) to refer to another person (Daniel) who found the term \u201cracially offensive and derogatory.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Parents might recognize a common defense to jokes that bring their child to tears: \u201cWe\u2019re not laughing <em>at </em>you, we\u2019re laughing <em>with </em>you.\u201d The child\u2019s typical response, \u201cBut I\u2019m not laughing,\u201d is equally appropriate here. According to Daniel, he was not laughing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> As mentioned, I believe that Wayans\u2019s alleged on-set conduct was not protected free speech activity, and it is therefore unnecessary to reach the question whether Daniel\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress on that aspect of his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> On the other hand, I do not believe that Daniel demonstrated a reasonable probability of succeeding on the portion of his <em>racial harassment </em>claim concerning the Internet post. Because Daniel did not even know about Wayans\u2019s Internet post until he got home and checked the Internet after his single day of employment on A Haunted House 2 had ended, the Internet post could not have created a hostile environment so severe as to interfere with his (already completed) work performance. <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>City of Monrovia </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 860, 876 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 377].) Therefore, paragraph 9(h) of the complaint, which alleges the Internet posting, should have been stricken from Daniel\u2019s racial harassment claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
