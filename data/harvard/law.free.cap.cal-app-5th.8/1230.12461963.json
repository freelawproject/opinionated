She also petitions for a writ of habeas corpus based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">On April 7, 2015, Aurora Prado, a 65-year-old woman, drove a Toyota Highlander belonging to her daughter\u2019s boyfriend to the El Super market in La Puente. She pulled part way into an accessible parking space,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but realized the space was blocked by two shopping carts. She exited the vehicle to move the carts, leaving the door open and the engine running.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>While Prado was moving the carts, appellant walked past her, climbed into the driver\u2019s seat of the Highlander, and closed the door. Prado went over to the driver\u2019s side and \u201cbang[ed] on the window,\u201d pleading with appellant not to take the vehicle. Prado grasped the door handle with her left hand and tried to open the door, but appellant held it shut. Appellant began backing the vehicle up as Prado held on to the door handle and continued to plead with appellant not to take the car. Prado said appellant \u2018\u201cdidn\u2019t reverse slow . . . . She go fast and makes noise with the tires . . . .\u201d Prado held on to the door handle until she lost her balance and had to let go, although she did not fall to the ground. Appellant sped off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">On April 9, 2015, authorities located appellant in the Highlander in the parking structure of a casino in Highland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department interviewed appellant several days later. Appellant admitted that she had taken a Highlander from an elderly Hispanic female in a supermarket parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">At trial, Prado identified appellant as the person who took the Highlander. The prosecution presented a surveillance video of the entire incident. Prado testified that appellant had pushed her before getting into the car, but acknowledged on cross-examination that she could not see a push on the surveillance video.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">Appellant was charged with carjacking (Pen. Code, \u00a7 215, subd. (a))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and found guilty by the jury. She was sentenced to state prison for the low term of three years, with various credits and fines. Appellant timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">1. <em>Insufficient Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">Appellant contends there was insufficient evidence that she took the Highlander \u201cby means of force.\u201d We hold there was sufficient evidence and reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">a. <em>Applicable law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-13\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>is, evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid value\u2014from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citations.] \u2018 \u2018\u201c[I]f the verdict is supported by substantial evidence, we must accord due deference to the trier of fact and not substitute our evaluation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the fact finder.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snow </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 43, 66 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 65 P.3d 749].) This standard applies whether direct or circumstantial evidence is involved. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">A person may be convicted of carjacking only upon proof of a \u2018\u201cfelonious taking of a motor vehicle . . . accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u00a7 215, subd. (a).) The carjacking statute does not define \u2018\u201cforce,\u201d nor have we found any case law that provides a definition. But courts interpreting the carjacking statute have analogized it to the robbery statute, section 211, as both share similar language and elements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1051, 1059 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 432, 79 P.3d 548] <em>(Lopez) </em>[holding that \u201c \u2018 \u2018\u201cfelonious taking\u201d \u2019 \u201d had the same meaning under both \u00a7 211 and \u00a7 215 because \u2018\u201cthe carjacking statute\u2019s language and legislative history . . . demonstrate that carjacking is a direct offshoot of robbery and that the Legislature modeled the carjacking statute on the robbery statute\u201d].) Given that both crimes are \u2018\u201caccomplished by means of force or fear\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 215, subd. (a)), we may presume that the Legislature intended that those terms have substantially the same meaning in both statutes, in the absence of any clear intent to the contrary.  (See <em>Lopez, supra, </em>at p. 1060 [\u2018\u201cWhen legislation has been judicially construed and a subsequent statute on a similar subject uses identical or substantially similar language, the usual presumption is that the Legislature intended the same construction, unless a contrary intent clearly appears.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">However, \u2018\u201c[t]he analogy between robbery and carjacking is imperfect.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 853, 860 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 254, 3 P.3d 898] <em>(Hill).) </em>For example, the penalty for carjacking is greater than for second degree robbery,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in part \u2018\u201cbecause ... the nature of the taking . . . raises a serious potential for harm to the victim, the perpetrator and the public at large.\u201d <em>(People v. Antoine </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 489, 495 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>530].) And the Supreme Court held that, unlike robbery, a defendant could be guilty of carjacking even if the victim (in that case, an infant) was unaware of the taking. <em>(Hill, supra, </em>at pp. 860-861.) The court based this holding in part on the increased risk of danger involved in carjacking: \u201cunlike a robbery, a carjacking subjects an unconscious possessor or occupant of a vehicle to a risk of harm greater than that involved in an ordinary theft from an unconscious individual.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Thus, we proceed with our analysis using the law of robbery as a guide, keeping in mind that the carjacking statute reflects a heightened concern for safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">\u201c \u2018The terms \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d as used in the definition of the crime of robbery have no technical meaning peculiar to the law and must be presumed to be within the understanding of jurors.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mungia </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1703, 1708 [286 Cal.Rptr. 394], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633, 640 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366].) In terms of the amount of force required to elevate a taking to a robbery, \u201csomething more is required than just that quantum of force which is necessary to accomplish the mere seizing of the property.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 134, 139 [122 Cal.Rptr. 157] <em>(Morales).) </em>But the force need not be great: \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a]ll the force that is required to make the offense a robbery is such force as is actually sufficient to overcome the victim\u2019s resistance <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burns </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1259 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 51] <em>(Burns), </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Clayton </em>(1928) 89 Cal.App. 405, 411 [264 P. 1105].) <em>Burns </em>in fact based its analysis not on the amount of force applied, but on the fact of the victim\u2019s resistance; thus, a purse snatching constituted robbery when the defendant stepped on the victim\u2019s toe and pulled the purse from her as she struggled to hold onto it. <em>(Burns, supra, </em>at p. 1255; see <em>id. </em>at p. 1257 [\u201cwhere a person wrests away personal property from another person, who resists the effort to do so, the crime is robbery, not merely theft\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">Appellant argues that the showing of force in this case was insufficient to support her conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She notes that she did not use a weapon, or touch or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>threaten the victim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She asserts that she applied no more force than was necessary to reverse the Highlander out of the parking space and drive off, and this was nothing more than \u201cthe quantum of force which [was] necessary to accomplish the mere seizing of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">We disagree. The prosecution offered evidence that appellant was driving faster than necessary simply to move the vehicle. Prado testified that appellant reversed quickly enough to \u201cmake[] noise with the tires\u201d and was \u201cgo[ing] fast,\u201d all of which would support a conclusion by the jury that appellant was driving at relatively high speed, and thus accomplishing the taking with more force than was necessary to take the property. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 989, 993, 995 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 408, 252 P.3d 968] [robbery defendant applied more force than necessary to move a stolen vehicle when he drove 25 to 30 miles per hour in a parking lot in an attempt to get through a closing electronic gate].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Even absent evidence of fast driving, however, the law does not support as strict an application of the <em>Morales </em>rule as appellant argues. For thefts of most personal property, there is an appreciable distinction between the quantum of force necessary to seize the property from an unresisting victim, and the additional force needed to seize the property if the victim fights back. It is thus possible to apply the rules from both <em>Morales </em>and <em>Burns: </em>if the thief is applying no more force than necessary to lift the property and carry it off, there is no robbery; if the victim resists, more force is needed and the theft becomes a robbery. But carjacking presents a circumstance in which the amounts of force may be identical in both situations. Given the power of even a slow-moving vehicle, a thief attempting to drive the car away need not apply additional force to shake off a victim trying to stop the car from moving. Under such a circumstance, <em>Morales </em>and <em>Burns </em>are in tension with one another, and either potentially is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Appellant urges us to apply the rule from <em>Morales, </em>but we think the more appropriate rule is that of <em>Burns. </em>Under <em>Burns, </em>a victim\u2019s physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>resistance will convert a theft into a robbery, regardless of the amount of force involved. (See <em>Burns, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1257.) It is sensible to treat a theft more severely under the law when it involves overcoming a victim\u2019s resistance, because the risk of harm to the victim is greater, and the crime is commensurately more serious. That risk of harm certainly exists when a victim resists the taking of a vehicle, even if the vehicle is moving just as it would were the victim not present. As discussed above, the law recognizes that the taking of a car from the immediate presence of its driver or passengers creates a fundamentally more hazardous situation than the taking of most other forms of property, and thus the Penal Code imposes a greater penalty for carjacking than for second degree robbery. Similarly, that potential for harm makes it appropriate to treat the taking of a vehicle more severely when the victim physically tries to stop the vehicle, even if the only force the perpetrator applies is the force necessary to move the vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore hold that a perpetrator accomplishes the taking of a motor vehicle by means of force, as defined under section 215, when the perpetrator drives the vehicle while a victim holds on or otherwise physically attempts to prevent the theft.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Under this analysis, there clearly was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction. Both the surveillance video and Prado\u2019s testimony established that Prado held onto the Highlander and tried to stop the vehicle as appellant backed out of the parking space. Appellant continued to back up until Prado had to let go. This was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that appellant had used force to take the vehicle from Prado.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">2.^1.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAXOc\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"48\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABccAAAAwAQAAAAD8vv+IAAAA80lEQVR4nO2YMU6EUBRFL8TCTnegO5GdjZ3L0oSFOK4AOidx5FgIzM/vNHINyT3tyXs5D6ho0D6h/e+CX5NyPyn3k3I/KfeTcj8p95NyPyn3k3I/+y5/lPQi6SjpJOksaZKECjHOchXL1FhNbbluLAVMd8AN8AS8ASNwOsD5oRD9LBexTvXV1Jbr+ouY2ursY3U29dk/e4p/vK58Kbv+zltJjfR91b2kW0nXkq5K0c1yEetUV01tua4rhIAD8Ay8Au/AB/AJTBRimOUqlqmhmtpy3XARU5O/c3ZS7iflflLuJ+V+Uu4n5X5S7iflflLuZ7/lX6Rlq7FFgZNuAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"1479\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
