The only evidence in the case was the auditor\u2019s report. The auditor found in substance that the plaintiff, who was blind, received in June, 1904, $500 from one Bassett in payment of the balance due oil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>a mortgage, and handed it to his daughter, the defendant\u2019s testatrix, directing her to deposit it for him in the Webster Five Cents Savings Bank and to bring him back the book; that she deposited the money as thus directed, but at the same time caused all deposits and dividends including the $500, standing to the plaintiff\u2019s credit and amounting to $612.50, to be transferred to herself under- an order which the plaintiff had drawn in the spring of 1903 on the treasurer of the bank directing him to pay to her all deposits and dividends due him, but which he never had delivered to her, and which had remained, as he supposed, in his custody. How it came into her possession except that it never was delivered by him to her does not appear. The auditor found that defendant\u2019s testatrix by such transfer converted to her own use the sum thus transferred, namely, the $612.50 aforesaid, and the court, on the evidence thus before it, found for the plaintiff, and assessed the damages in the sum thus converted and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The defendant contends that an action for money had and received will not lie because his testatrix never received any money and that all that she obtained by the transfer was a right to demand from the bank the amount transferred, in other words a chose in action. But the transfer of the deposit and dividends from the plaintiff to herself was the same in legal effect as if she actually had withdrawn the money and had redeposited it in her own name. In such a case it is plain that an action for money had and received would lie. See <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>11 Mass. 494; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Baylies, </em>19 Pick. 55 ; <em>Henchey </em>v. <em>Henchey, </em>167 Mass. 77; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>173 Mass. 361. No demand was necessary and interest was due from the time when the money was fraudulently misappropriated by the defendant\u2019s testatrix. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>9 Gray, 66. <em>Manufacturers\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>144 Mass. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
