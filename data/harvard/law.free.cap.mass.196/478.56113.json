Writs in the Superior Court for the county of Worcester dated May 26, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">At the trial, which was before <em>Wait, </em>J., it appeared that plaintiff's intestate, her husband and her sister were in a store purchasing street car tickets and waiting for the car. Immediately to the left as one looked outward from the store was a crosswalk. There were street railway rails piled next the curb in front of the store, and the evidence was conflicting as to whether they extended over the crosswalk and as to whether they were piled properly. The husband, seeing the car approaching, \u201c rushed out of \u201d the \u201c store, jumped across the rails,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and stopped the car directly in front of the store. The sister followed him, stepping over the rails in front of\" the store and to the left of the crosswalk, and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, following her closely, stepped between the rails and the curbing and fell. She died before the trial, but witnesses testified that she had stated \u201cI did not see the rails and did not know they were there.\u201d \u201cI made a misstep and fell over the rails.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-3\">The accident happened between half past one and half past two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was nearsighted and could not recognize a friend at a distance of more than ten or twelve feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">The following requests for rulings by the defendants were refused by the presiding judge subject to their exception:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">1. If the plaintiff\u2019s intestate by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence might have seen and appreciated the obvious danger of attempting to cross the rails, then she was not in the exercise of due care and cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">2. If the plaintiff\u2019s intestate voluntarily attempted to cross over from the sidewalk to the car track at a place which by the exercise of ordinary care a person in the exercise of ordinary prudence might have known to be somewhat dangerous, which she might easily have avoided, that is conclusive evidence of want of due care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">3. If the rails did not create .an obstruction across that portion of the street designed for use by travellers on foot, then the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in attempting to cross the street at any other point, assumed the risk of an injury resulting from so doing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">4. If the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had defective eyesight, she should take greater care in walking the street than one of good eyesight, and if she failed to use this greater degree of care, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">In the charge to the jury, the presiding judge stated: \u201c The plaintiff contends and has got to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Mrs. Keith was injured, and that she was injured while she was using ... a degree of care that a reasonably prudent and careful person, acting prudently and carefully at the time, would have exercised and should have exercised in your judgment under all the circumstances then surrounding Mrs. Keith. That means not only external circumstances, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>means not only the way in which the rails were placed, the location of the car, the necessity of action on her part, but it means also with reference to her personal peculiarities as they were shown to exist upon the stand. For instance, the conduct of a perfectly sound and healthy person may be properly regarded as one thing, when the same conduct on the part of a diseased or infirm person might be regarded as something very different.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-3\">\u201c What might be in your judgment perfectly reasonable and proper and careful \u00f3n the part of a sound person might be regarded fairly by you as improper and careless on the part of an infirm person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">\u201c So, in this case, while I cannot instruct you as a matter of law that Mrs. Keith, if you find her to be near-sighted, was bound to use a higher degree of care than a person not near-sighted, I have got to leave it to you as a matter of fact whether a nearsighted person would not, in order to be careful, have to exercise a higher degree of care than a person not near-sighted. In other words, I have got to leave it to you to determine whether or not a near-sighted person is using due care if he or she under the particular circumstances acts exactly as a person who was not nearsighted would have done. In other words, it is a matter of fact for you to determine whether Mrs. Keith was called on to do differently from a person in full possession of eyesight rather than as a matter of law for me to direct you in regard to it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">The jury found for the plaintiff in both cases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>E.

Although the accident occurred in daylight and the obstruction could have been seen, if the traveller had looked, such circumstances are not necessarily decisive. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Hyde Park, </em>162 Mass. 51. Her husband had run out of a store in the effort to stop an electric car, which both, together with a companion, desired to board and were hastening to reach. These occurrences may have diverted her attention from the surface of the street. The obstructions were temporary in character and not a part of the permanent constructions within the street, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>6 Cush. 524, and they were not such as one ordinarily encounters in travelling upon a public way. <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>121 Mass. 337. <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>173 Mass. 108. <em>Slee </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>162 Mass. 405. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>177 Mass. 82. If she was going from the sidewalk to the crosswalk, there was reason for her to expect an unobstructed pathway, while if she was about to step upon that part of the street wrought and used particularly for carriages, this fact does not preclude recovery, as she had a right to travel anywhere upon the street. Pedestrians are not confined in their rights to specially prepared crosswalks. Sometimes failure to see and avoid a danger in the street may occur under such circumstances as inevitably to indicate a failure to exercise reasonable prudence to protect one\u2019s self from peril, <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Deerfield, </em>15 Gray, 577, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>8 Allen, 137, <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>6 Cush. 524, but ordinarily there are present such diverting incidents as to make it a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">The defendant asked the court to rule that if the person injured <em>\u201c </em>had defective eyesight, she should take greater care in walking the street than one of good sight, and if she failed to use this greater degree of care the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d This request properly was refused, for the reason that it directed a verdict upon a single phase of the testimony, which was not necessarily decisive. In this respect the prayer differs vitally from the one which in <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>1 Allen, 177, this court held should have, been given. We see no reason for modifying the decision in <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>nor is it inconsistent with subsequent cases. The standard of care established by the law is what the ordinarily prudent and cautious person would do to protect himself under given conditions. There is no higher or different standard for one who is aged, feeble, blind, halt, deaf or otherwise impaired in capacity, than for one in perfect physical condition. It has frequently, in recent as well as earlier cases, been said, in referring to one under some impediment, that greater caution or increased circumspection may be required in view of these adverse conditions. See, for example, <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>1 Allen, 177; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>168 Mass. 461; <em>Hilborn </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>191 Mass. 14; <em>Vecchioni </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>River Railroad, </em>191 Mass. 9; <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>192 Mass. 324; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 324. These expressions mean nothing more than that a person so afflicted must put forth a greater degree of effort than one not acting under any disabilities, in order to attain that standard of care which the law has established for everybody. When looked at from one standpoint, it is incorrect to say that a blind person must exercise a higher degree of care than one whose sight is perfect, but in another aspect, a blind person may be obliged to take precautions, practise vigilance and sharpen other senses, unnecessary for one of clear vision, in order to attain that degree of care which the law requires. It may depend in some slight degree upon how the description of duty begins, where the emphasis may fall at a given moment, but when the whole proposition is stated, the rights of the parties are as fully protected in the one way as in the other. It is perhaps more logical to say that the plaintiff is bound to use ordinary care, and that in passing upon what ordinary care demands, due consideration should be given to blindness or other infirmities. This was the course pursued by the Superior Court. <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Wellesley, </em>148 Mass. 487. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wildes, </em>143 Mass. 556. But it is also correct to say that in the exercise of common prudence one of defective eyesight must usually as matter of general knowledge take more care and employ keener watchfulness in walking upon the streets and avoiding obstructions than the same person with good eyesight, in order to reach the standard established by the law for all persons alike, whether they be weak or strong, sound or deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Exceptions overruled in each </em>case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
