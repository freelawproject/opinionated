The evidence showed that on the date alleged the defendant was engaged in the express business in Brockton, where licenses of the first five classes were not granted; that on that day the defendant\u2019s agent, one Molloy, received at the freight depot in Brockton a box containing twenty quarts of whiskey in ten packages of two quarts each; that on the outside of the box was a card on which was written the names and addresses of ten persons and \u201c2 qts. whi\u00e1key \u201d after each name; that the box was consigned in care of Riley\u2019s express; that to each package was attached a tag with a similar label; that the express book required to be kept did not contain a correct transcript of these marks, in that it called for one four-quart package, six two-quart packages, and four one-quart packages. The defendant testified that Molloy was his agent in charge of the business, he (the defendant) working in a shoe factory in the daytime; that he had no knowledge of the receipt of the packages or of the entries on the book, and that he had not seen the book for a week. The defendant was asked by his counsel what instructions, if any, he gave Molloy in relation to conducting the business, and offered to show that he told Molloy to run the business right and to be sure to keep the book straight. The judge excluded the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tian subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. No question was made at the trial but that it was within the scope of Molloy\u2019s authority from the defendant to keep the express book.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-7\"><em>F. M. Bixby, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-8\"><em>T. E. Grover, </em>District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-9\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajn\">We assume for the purpose of this opinion that the crime created by R. L. c. 100, \u00a7 50, is one of those crimes where the defendant acts at his risk, and where it is no excuse that he made an honest mistake, like the crimes before the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>2 Allen, 160, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Uhrig, </em>138 Mass. 492, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>153 Mass. 421; <em>S. C. </em>155 Mass. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In such cases the defendant is liable in case he does the act although he did it under an honest mistake. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>2 Allen, 60. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>153 Mass. 421, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">And the servant is liable although he did the act under an honest mistake. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>163 Mass. 103. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>153 Mass. 421, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">The question here is under what circumstances the master is liable when the act is done by the servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">It is not enough that it was done in the course of the servant\u2019s employment in the master\u2019s business. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>153 Mass. 421; <em>S. C. </em>155 Mass. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">To convict a master for the act of the servant the government must show that the master participated in the act or countenanced it or otherwise approved of it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>153 Mass. 421; <em>S. C. </em>155 Mass. 291. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joslin, </em>158 Mass. 482, 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">It follows that the concession made \u201c that it was within the scope of Molloy\u2019s authority from the defendant to keep the express book\u201d was not decisive of the defendant\u2019s liability. It also follows that the judge was wrong in excluding evidence as to \u201c What instructions, if any, he [the defendant] gave Molloy in relation to conducting the business,\u201d and evidence to the effect that he, the defendant, \u201c told Molloy to run the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>right and to be sure to keep the book straight.\u201d Similar evidence was received at both trials of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens; </em>see 153 Mass. 421, and 155 Mass. 291; and under the doctrine of those cases cannot be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
