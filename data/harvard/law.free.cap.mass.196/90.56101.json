The defendant contended that the fact that the letter of the plaintiff to the defendant varied in its terms from that of the customer to the plaintiff made it unauthorized and not a valid acceptance of the defendant\u2019s offer. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the acceptance written by the plaintiff to the defendant being effective, because authorized orally as well as ratified by the customer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-8\">Contract by the firm of shipbrokers who procured for the defendant the agreement which was the basis of the case next preceding.

The defendant. requested the presiding judge to rule in substance (1) that on the whole evidence the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, (2) that they were not entitled to recover because, in the letter of acceptance which they wrote Mack, they exceeded the terms stated in the letter written them by the Metropolitan Coal Company on the same day, (3) that, even if the Metropolitan Coal Company ratified the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of September 28 to the defendant, the fact that such letter varied from the terms of the letter from the Metropolitan Coal Company to them of the same date prevents recovery by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tiffs. The presiding judge refused the requests, made a special finding, as stated in the report of the case next preceding, and found for the plaintiffs, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-5\"><em>A.

We are of opinion that the argument rests on a fallacy for the reasons stated in <em>Metropolitan Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Boutell Transportation &amp; Towing Co., ante, </em>72.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
