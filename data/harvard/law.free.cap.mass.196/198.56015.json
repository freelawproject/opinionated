It also appeared that, before the conveyance, a survey of the locus was made by the parties to the deed according to which the bound in question was a straight line and did not follow the meandering of the shore line. <em>Held, </em>that there was an ambiguity in the deed which rendered admissible evidence to show what in fact was intended by the parties, and that a finding in accordance with the preliminary survey was warranted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-11\">A deed of land on Squam River, an arm of the sea, contained the following bounds : \u201c Beginning at a point on the shore . . . thence running inland . . . southeast about 390 feet to a drill hole in the rock, then southwesterly on a line parallel with the shore 300 feet to a drill hole in the rock, thence west northwest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>a line parallel with the . . . northerly line about 410 feet to the shore, thence northwesterly along the shore 300 feet to the point of beginning.\u201d It appeared that the fourth bound was a straight line and not a line following the meanderings of the shore. At a hearing on a petition of the grantee for registration of his title, owners of land adjoining the locus contended that the second bound, \u201c southwesterly on a line parallel with the shore 300 feet to a drill hole in the rock,\u201d meant a line meandering as did the shore line, but it appeared that, if such construction were adopted, the line would not terminate at \u201c a drill hole in the rock.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the bound should be construed to mean \u201c on a line parallel with the shore line, which is 300 feet in length, 300 feet to a drill hole in a rock,\u201d a straight line.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">Petition for registration of title to land, filed in the Land Court October 28, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">There was a hearing before Davis, J., who found for the petitioner and reported the case for determination by this court.

Wolf Hill lies on its east shore and is stated in the report to be a \u201crounding promontory. \u201d The line of high water mark on the premises here in question forms a curve of which the convex side is towards the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">The land conveyed by the deed in question is described as \u201cbeginning at a point on the shore about three hundred feet southerly measured along the high water line from the southerly line of lot deeded by me to John Hodgkins, Junior, March 1st, 1877, extended to the shore, thence running inland up the bluff east southeast, about three hundred ninety feet, to a drill hole in the rock, thence southwesterly on a line parallel with the shore three hundred feet, to a drill hole in the rock, thence west northwest on a line parallel with the first or northerly line about four hundred ten feet, to the shore, thence northeasterly along the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>shore three hundred feet, to the point of beginning, and containing about . . . more or less, and bounded westerly by Squam River and on all other sides by other land of the grantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Orvis, the grantor in this deed, had previously conveyed to one Hodgkins a tract of land on Wolf Hill about three hundred feet north of the locus. That tract of land \u201c did not run to the shore, but stopped forty feet short of it, \u2018 forty feet of shore \u2019 being reserved for a road which Orvis, contemplated building along the shore around the base of Wolf Hill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In dealing with this question we have not taken into account the plans annexed to the petitioner\u2019s brief and referred to by him as Exhibits 7 and 8. They are not made part of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">1. There is nothing in the petitioner\u2019s claim that the judgment of nonsuit in the writ of entry brought by the respondents Herman W. and Edwin K. Friend against him is a bar to their defence to this petition. <em>Morgan </em>v. Bliss, 2 Mass. 111, 113. <em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>1 Pick. 371. <em>Ensign </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>1 Met. 274. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>114 Mass. 54, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">2. Th\u00e9 second question is that raised by the respondent Harry L. Friend, to whom the flats lying in front of the locus were subsequently conveyed if they were not conveyed to the petitioner\u2019s predecessors in title by the earlier deed to them. It is the petitioner\u2019s contention that these flats passed to the petitioner\u2019s predecessors and now belong to him. That contention was adopted by the Land Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The contention of this respondent is that the word \u201c shore \u201d means the space between high and low water mark and that the specific description of the locus given in the first part of the statement of the land conveyed by the deed cannot be enlarged by the subsequent words \u201c bounded westerly by Squam River.\u201d His contention is that by the earlier part of the description the premises conveyed are bounded by high water since the land is described as \u201c beginning at a point on the shore,\u201d thence by metes and bounds \u201c to the shore, thence northeasterly along the shore three hundred feet to the point of beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">It is settled that a boundary \u201c on the shore \u201d does not include the space between high and low water mark if the word \u201c shore \u201d is used in its technical sense. <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 Mass. 435. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The same is true in case of a boundary on the \u201c beach.\u201d , <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>13 Gray, 254. <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>141 Mass. 97. Also in case of a boundary on \u201cflats.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>1 Cush. 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">But each one of these words is a word of doubtful meaning arising from the fact that in one case the sea side and in another case the land side of the \u201c shore,\u201d \u201c beach \u201d or \u201c flats \u201d may have been intended to be the boundary line, as was pointed out by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Willcut, </em>5 Gray, 328, 335. The meaning to be attached to either one of these words in a deed must depend upon the instrument in which they occur taken as a whole (see <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>123 Mass. 359, where \u201cbeach\u201d was held to include the shore to low water mark) and upon surrounding circumstances (as, for example, the fact that a monument referred to in case of a deed bounding on the shore was in fact at low water mark. <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 Mass. 435). So it has been held that a boundary on the \u201c sea or flats \u201d goes to low water. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Long Wharf, </em>7 Cush. 195. The same is true of a boundary on the \u201c sea or beach.\u201d <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Willcut, </em>5 Gray, 328. See also in this connection <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>13 Gray, 254, 257, 258 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>1 Cush. 575, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">When land bounds on the shore we have a question somewhat like the question which we have when land bounds on a way or other monument broader than a line. In such cases and here the question arises whether the face, the centre line or the whole width is included.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The words \u201c bounded westerly by Squam River\u201d are equivalent to a bound upon the sea, and if that had been the sole description of the boundary of the locus on the west the flats would have passed to the grantees. Of that there is no question. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>105 Mass. 351, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">So if the two ends of the westerly boundary line had been described as points on the shore and in fact they had been on the line of high water mark and the westerly boundary had been stated to be Squam River in place of \u201calong the shore,\u201d the flats would have passed. <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>14 Mass. 149. <em>Cold Steam Works </em>v. <em>Tolland, </em>9 Cush. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The words \u201c along the shore \u201d in the earlier part of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>scription are ambiguous, and the later provision that the locus is \u201c bounded westerly by Squam River \u201d makes plain what was left doubtful by the earlier statement. It is like a clause in a deed of land bounded by a way stating that the fee in the way is included in the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The rule relied on by the respondent Harry L. Friend, that a specific description will not be controlled by general words, applies to cases where the specific description is unambiguous. See for example the statement of C. Allen, J. in <em>Birch </em>v. Hutchings, 144 Mass. 561, 563, cited by this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We are of opinion that the flats passed under the earlier deed in spite of the evidence as to the intention of Orvis to build a road along the shore around the base of Wolf Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">3. There are two other questions raised on this report. Both of them are raised by the respondents Herman W. and Edwin K. Friend, whose land bounds that of the petitioner on the east and south.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">It was found as a fact in the Land Court that there is no dispute as to the two corners of the lot which make the two ends of the northerly boundary line. And it appears from the report that both ends of the easterly boundary line are agreed upon. The only dispute with respect to the corners of the lot is in respect to the location of the westerly end of the southerly boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">These respondents\u2019 first contention is that the three hundred feet between the point of beginning and the southerly end of the westerly boundary line should be measured along the shore at high water mark, that is, following the curve of the shore and not in a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">It appears from the report that the difference between the two ways of measuring this three hundred feet is that if the measurement is along the line of high water this end of the westerly line is twenty-eight feet short of the end of it if the measurement is made in a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">It is stated in the description of the premises conveyed that the southerly boundary line is \u201cparallel with the first or northerly line.\u201d And it appears that the distance between the two ends of the northerly lines measured in a straight line is three hundred and twenty one hundredths feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>It follows that if the three hundred feet between the two ends of the westerly line are measured along the shore the north and south side lines cannot be parallel one with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">This constitutes an ambiguity which makes the fact that the bounds were in fact agreed upon and set upon the land admissible in evidence. <em>Chester Emery Co. </em>v. Lucas, 112 Mass. 424. <em>Miles </em>v. Barrow, 122 Mass. 579. <em>Barrett </em>v. Murphy, 140 Mass. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">It appears that the grantor\u2019s agent, having agreed to sell to the petitioner\u2019s predecessors in title a lot of land, \u201cshortly before the deed \u201d in question went on the land with one of the grantees and fixed the corners of the lot marking the two ends of the northerly boundary by drill holes, the northwest end being marked \u201c B \u201d in a boulder, and the northeast end being \u201c a drill hold in the ledge.\u201d The agreement was that the westerly boundary line of the lot should be \u201c three hundred feet along the shore to a point about twenty feet south of the rocky headland.\u201d The vendor\u2019s agent and the grantee in question \u201c then measured along the shore to a rock . . . situated about forty feet to the southwest of the rocky headland. In this rock a drill hole and the letter <em>\u2018 </em>B \u2019 were cut.\u201d The report then continues : \u201c From, this rock they then measured easterly up the hill about four hundred and ten feet, and drove a stake, and shortly after the deed was passed a stone was inserted by one Hodgkins in place of this stake. I find that said drill holes and said stake were located at the four corners of the upland claimed by the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">This drill hole is three hundred feet from the point of beginning in a straight line and is the location adopted by the Land Court. We are of opinion that in this matter also the Land Court was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The second contention of these respondents is that the easterly boundary line is a curved line parallel with the shore and not a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">We assume that these respondents would have been right in this contention had the description of this boundary line been \u201c thence southwesterly on a line parallel with the shore three hundred feet,\u201d (as to which see <em>Hicks </em>v. Coleman, 25 Cal. 122; <em>Fratt </em>v. Woodward, 32 Cal. 219; <em>Winthrop </em>v. Curtis, 3 Maine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>110,) or if the description had been \u201c thence southwesterly on a line parallel with the shore to a drill hole in the rock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\">The difficulty here arises from the fact that the description is \u201c thence southwesterly on a line parallel with the shore three hundred feet to a drill hole in the rock,\u201d and the further fact that if the line is measured parallel with the shore it is about three hundred and twenty-eight feet to the drill hole in the rock. We say about three hundred and twenty-eight feet because the westerly boundary line, if measured on the line of high water mark, is three hundred and twenty-eight feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">It is apparent that there is an inconsistency in this description, and we are of opinion that the words \u201c on a line parallel with the shore three hundred feet to a drill hole in the\" rock \u201d must be construed to mean \u201c on a line parallel with the shore line, which is three hundred feet in length, three hundred feet to a drill hole in the rock \u201d ; and that the Land Court was right in holding that the easterly boundary line was a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
