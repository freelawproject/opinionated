The breach alleged was that the car was \u201c defectively and imperfectly constructed in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>it contained a crank shaft which was not of proper shape, was not of proper materials and was not adapted for the use for which it was intended,\u201d and that, while being used under ordinary conditions, the crank shaft broke as also did two others furnished by the defendant to replace the first one, \u201c by reason of similar improper construction or lack of adaptation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-3\">Evidence introduced by the plaintiff tended to show that, desiring to purchase an automobile, he visited the sales room of one Read, who was selling cars owned by a predecessor-of the defendant, and there examined various cars, among them the one which he afterward purchased; that Read told the plaintiff that the car in question had been used through the summer as a demonstration car ; that it had not been run five hundred miles; that it \u201c was in good condition, first class condition \u201d; that he had kept it so; that no one else had run it except himself. He offered the automobile to the plaintiff for $1,000, saying that if it were new it would sell for $1,600 or $1,700. The plaintiff did not buy at once, but, after subsequent visits and trials of the car, offered Read $900 for it, and the sale was made on those terms, Read giving the plaintiff a bill receipted by him which read: \u201c1 2nd Yale Touring Car, $900.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the presiding judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\"><em>F.

All that Read said as to the value and nature of the machine was mere seller\u2019s talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">We are also of opinion that there was no implied warranty as to the length of time this crank shaft would stand the strain of use. The subject of sale was an automobile. Even if it be assumed that the plaintiff had the right to think the sale was made by the manufacturer, still the machine was not made especially for the plaintiff, but on the contrary was one which had been considerably used, and it was bought by him at what he knew was a sum below the usual price for a new machine of the same kind. If it be said that he had the right to suppose it was fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to run, the answer is that it was fit to run. Every part essential to the running of the machine was there at the time of the purchase, \u2014 in other words the machine was an automobile in running order, and, after the purchase, was actually used by the plaintiff nearly if not quite two months before the shaft broke. If the shaft had been stronger it might have lasted for a longer time. There is no claim of fraud. Under these circumstances we think that there was no implied warranty as to the length of time the shaft would last, but that as to that the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>is applicable. See <em>Wilson </em>v. Lawrence, 139 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It becomes unnecessary to consider the other grounds of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
