We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">Jeff raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by failing to extend the temporary custody order?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">2. Did the District Court err in addressing the merits of Jeff\u2019s motion to modify custody and support?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-20\">Jeff and Brenda Marie Huotari, now known as Brenda M. Copeland (Brenda), married in 1988. Their marriage was dissolved on June 17, 1991. The District Court adopted and incorporated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>parties\u2019 Property and Child Custody Agreement (Agreement) in its decree of dissolution and, pursuant thereto, awarded Jeff and Brenda joint custody of Jacob, their minor son. Brenda was designated Jacob\u2019s primary residential custodian, subject to reasonable visitation by Jeff. The Agreement also provided that the parties anticipated that Brenda might be moving from Montana in the future and, in the event such a move was contemplated, Jeff and Brenda would attempt to renegotiate a visitation schedule commensurate with the new living arrangements; absent agreement by the parties, the District Court was authorized to review and modify the child custody and visitation provision. In no event could Brenda move Jacob\u2019s residence out of Montana without a visitation schedule being established by either agreement or court modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">On July 17,1996, Jeff moved the District Court to modify the child custody provisions of the dissolution decree. His supporting affidavit stated that Brenda had joined the United States Army, leaving Jacob with him, and that Jacob had been integrated into his family with Brenda\u2019s full knowledge and consent. On the basis of the requested modification of custody, Jeff also sought modification of his child support obligations and of the income tax exemption provision of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Approximately one month later, Jeff moved for an <em>ex parte </em>temporary custody order \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 40-4-219 M.C.A. and \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(ii) [sic]\u201d and order to show cause. He asserted that Brenda\u2019s mother had taken Jacob from his custody nine weeks after Brenda left the child with him and that she refused to return the child to him. Jeff\u2019s supporting affidavit asserted that an immediate change of custody would serve to protect the child\u2019s physical or emotional health.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The District Court issued a temporary order and order to show cause which granted Jeff temporary custody of Jacob and scheduled a show cause hearing on the matter for September 6, 1996. On the day of the hearing, Brenda filed a motion to dismiss Jeff\u2019s July motions relating to modification of custody and support and his <em>ex parte </em>motion for temporary custody. At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court ordered that the temporary custody order would remain in effect until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The District Court\u2019s findings, conclusions and order were filed on October 30,1996. In pertinent part, the court determined that it was in Jacob\u2019s best interest that Jeff retain physical custody for the remainder of the 1996-1997 school year and that Jeff and Brenda each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>would have Jacob for one-half of the summer in 1997; thereafter, Brenda would resume physical custody of Jacob in accordance with the earlier Agreement and the decree. The District Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a change in circumstances that seriously endangered Jacob\u2019s well-being and that, notwithstanding the existence of \u00a7 40-4-219(l)(f), MCA, Jeff had not satisfied the requirements for modification of custody since Brenda\u2019s out-of-state move was contemplated by the parties\u2019 Agreement and the dissolution decree. Jeff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact relating to child custody and visitation matters to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Dreesbach </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 216, 220-21, 875 R2d 1018, 1021 (citation omitted). We will not overturn the district court\u2019s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. <em>Marriage ofDreesbach, </em>875 P.2d at 1021 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by failing to extend the temporary custody order?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">A party seeking an <em>ex parte </em>temporary custody order must satisfy statutory requirements. When seeking a temporary assignment of custody <em>ex parte </em>in a case in which a determination of custody previously has been made, the party must submit an affidavit showing that \u201cthe child\u2019s present environment endangers his physical or emotional health and an immediate change of custody would serve to protect the child\u2019s physical or emotional health.\u201d Section 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA. If the district court finds from the affidavit that the child\u2019s physical or emotional health is endangered and would be protected by a temporary assignment of custody, the district court must enter a temporary custody order; in such an event, the court must require all parties to appear and show cause within 20 days why \u201cthe court should not restore the child to the custodian from whom the child was removed by the temporary order.\u201d Section 40-4-220(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Here, Jeff submitted the required affidavit and the District Court entered the temporary custody order and scheduled the show cause hearing. Under \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(b), MCA, the burden was on Jeff to support a continuation of the temporary change in custody he had obtained <em>ex parte. </em>At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ordered that the temporary custody order would remain in effect. As a result, Jeff retained temporary custody of Jacob until the District Court entered its findings, conclusions and order on October 30,1996, and, indeed, retained custody pursuant to the October order through the end of Jacob\u2019s 1996-1997 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Jeff asserts that the District Court erred in failing to extend the temporary custody order until a hearing was held on his \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, motion to modify custody. He cites to no legal authority which supports the proposition that a temporary custody order obtained <em>ex parte </em>must be continued until a hearing is held on a separate motion to modify custody and, as a result, we do not address this portion of his argument. <em>See </em>Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Jeff also contends that Brenda\u2019s failure to comply with the 30-day notice requirement contained in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-217(4) and 40-4-217(5), MCA, was sufficient as a matter of law to require an extension of the temporary order. This contention is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Section 40-4-217(4), MCA, requires a custodial parent to give written notice to a noncustodial parent with visitation rights of his or her intent to change a minor child\u2019s residence to another state. The purpose of the notice requirement, which must be given at least 30 days before the intended change in residence, is \u201cto allow the noncustodial parent to seek a modification of the parent\u2019s visitation schedule.\u201d Section 40-4-217(5), MCA. Without regard to whether any nexus exists between this notice requirement and show cause hearings on temporary custody orders obtained <em>ex parte, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-4-217(4) and 40-4-217(5), MCA, are inapplicable here. Brenda had not changed Jacob\u2019s residence to another state at the time of the proceedings at issue and, according to the record before us, she did not intend to do so within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Nor is Jeff\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Marriage of Morazan </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 294, 772 P.2d 872, well placed. In that case, we affirmed a district court\u2019s issuance of a temporary restraining order to prevent a parent from removing children from the jurisdiction of the court pending modification of custody proceedings. <em>Marriage of Morazan, </em>772 P.2d at 874. The case did not involve either the notice requirement contained in \u00a7 40-2-217(4), MCA, or a show cause hearing on a temporary custody order obtained <em>ex parte. </em>Moreover, Jeff did not seek a temporary restraining order in this case. <em>Marriage of Morazan </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Finally, Jeff\u2019s contentions in this regard aside, we observe that the District Court effectively extended the temporary custody order Jeff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>had obtained <em>ex parte </em>until the summer of 1997 in an effort to avoid further disruption to Jacob. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion with regard to the temporary custody situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">2. Did the District Court err in addressing the merits of Jeff\u2019s motion to modify custody and support?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">It is clear that the District Court resolved the merits of Jeff\u2019s motion to modify custody and support in its order of October 30,1996, concluding that the \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, requirements for modification were not satisfied. Jeff contends that the District Court erred in addressing his motion to modify when the sole purpose of the September 6, 1996, hearing was to determine whether to continue the temporary custody order Jeff had obtained <em>ex parte. </em>We <em>agree.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As set forth above, Jeff filed two motions in this case. His first motion, filed pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, was a motion to modify child custody and support. His second motion, for an <em>ex parte </em>temporary custody order and order to show cause, necessarily was filed pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA. The District Court granted the latter motion and issued an order setting a show cause hearing on \u201cthe temporary order\u201d for September 6, 1996. At that point, it was clear that the show cause hearing was limited to determining whether the temporary custody order granted <em>ex parte </em>should remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Nor did the focus of the hearing change at the hearing. Jeff\u2019s counsel opened the hearing by stating that the hearing was set \u201con a temporary order and order to show cause.\u201d The District Court queried \u201c[s] o we are here on temporary custody?\u201d and Jeff\u2019s counsel responded \u201cyour Honor, that being done, we have a[n unrelated] procedural question\u201d relating to Brenda\u2019s motion to dismiss. The subject of the scope of the hearing arose again later, when the District Court recapped that Jeff had filed a \u201csecond motion\u201d and that was \u201cthe motion for temporary custody that is being heard here today, is that correct?\u201d Jeff\u2019s counsel responded in the affirmative. Still later, the District Court again inquired \u201cis this a hearing on temporary custody?\u201d Again, Jeff\u2019s counsel responded \u201c[t]hat is correct.\u201d Finally, the Minute Entry regarding the hearing indicated that \u201c[t]his was the time set for the Order to Show Cause hearing in the above-entitled cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">On this clear and unambiguous record regarding the scope of the September 6, 1996, hearing, we must conclude that the sole purpose of that hearing was to address whether the temporary custody order Jeff obtained <em>ex parte </em>was to remain in effect. Notwithstanding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>District Court\u2019s October 30,1996, findings, conclusions and order also denied Jeff\u2019s \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, motion to modify child custody and support on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Brenda attempts to support the District Court\u2019s action by arguing that Jeff\u2019s motion for temporary custody cited \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, as well as \u00a7 40-4-220, MCA, thereby giving \u201cthe District Court license to make a determination on the modification of the custody provisions contained in the decree of dissolution.\u201d It is true that Jeff\u2019s motion for temporary custody and memorandum in support thereof reference the \u201cendangerment\u201d provision in both statutes. It also is true, however, that the standard to be met in seeking temporary custody <em>ex parte </em>where a previous custody determination has been made is whether the child\u2019s present environment endangers his or her physical or emotional health and an immediate change of custody would protect that health. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-220(2)(a)(ii), MCA. Thus, while Jeff\u2019s motion for an <em>ex parte </em>temporary custody order and supporting affidavit were not as clear as they might have been, the record remains clear and unambiguous that the September 6,1996, hearing was held for the sole purpose of determining whether to continue the temporary custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Brenda also contends that the District Court merely \u201centered an order which effectively encompassed the entire custody issue by including a ruling on both motions.\u201d While this contention about what the District Court did is correct, it begs the question of whether the District Court acted properly. We conclude that it did not. In marital cases, as in other cases, the essential elements of due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See In re Marriage of Robbins </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 130, 138, 711 P.2d 1347, 1352. Here, Jeff received neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard on his motion to modify child custody and support. Thus, while it may be difficult, at best, for Jeff to make the showing required for modification of custody under \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, the point is not whether Jeff ultimately can make the requisite showing, but that he must be provided a fair opportunity to do so prior to the time a decision is rendered on his motion to modify child custody. The procedure utilized by the District Court here, however well intentioned, did not provide such an opportunity. By going beyond the matter before it, the District Court denied Jeff\u2019s right to procedural due process in violation of Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See Lurie v. Sheriff of Gallatin County </em>(1997), [284 Mont. 207], 944 P.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in addressing the merits of Jeff\u2019s motion to modify custody after a hearing held for the sole purpose of determining whether the temporary custody order he had obtained <em>ex parte </em>should be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">As a result of our conclusion on the second issue in this case, a remand is necessary for farther proceedings on Jeff\u2019s motion to modify. During the pendency of those proceedings, Jacob is to remain in Brenda\u2019s primary physical custody in order to prevent any unnecessary disruption in the stability of his living arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-6\">JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
