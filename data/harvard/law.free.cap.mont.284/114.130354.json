We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Harry Albert Bolinger, III, (Decedent), died March 23,1995. Decedent\u2019s estate was initially commenced as an intestacy proceeding with Deborah being nominated by Decedent\u2019s three adult children (the children) and subsequently being appointed as personal representative. On July 13, 1995, however, H. A. Bolinger (Hal), father of Decedent, filed a petition for formal probate of will and a request to be appointed personal representative. The November 15,1984 will so offered for probate devised all Decedent\u2019s estate to Hal, or, in the event that Hal predeceased Decedent, to Hal\u2019s wife (Decedent\u2019s stepmother), Marian. Specifically, the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of the will, the language of which is at issue here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">I intentionally give all of my property and estate to my said father, H. A. Bolinger, in the event that he shall survive me, and in the event he shall not survive me, I intentionally give all of my property and estate to my step-mother, Marian Bolinger, in the event she shall survive me, and in that event, I intentionally give nothing to my three children, namely: Harry Albert Bolinger, IV, Wyetta Bolinger and Travis Bolinger, or to any children of any child who shall not survive me. I make this provision for the reason that I feel confident that any property which either my father or my step-mother, Marian Bolinger, receive from my estate will be used in the best interests of my said children as my said beneficiaries may determine in their exclusive discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The will nominated Hal as personal representative with Marian as the alternate. Hal subsequently renounced his right to serve as personal representative and suggested the appointment of Marian, who petitioned to be appointed on November 6, 1995. Decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>children objected, contending, among other things, that the will was void as a matter of law because of undue influence or constructive fraud on the part of Hal, and, in the alternative, that the will created a trust on behalf of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The children moved for summary judgment. Marian filed certain deposition and discovery responses and the court took those into consideration. The court did not enter any findings or conclusions as to undue influence or constructive fraud. However, following the receipt of additional briefs as to the construction of the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of the will, and, after taking into consideration (over Marian\u2019s objection) an affidavit of John B. Folsom, Professor of English Emeritus, Montana State University, submitted by the children, the court ruled that the will, through the language in the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph created an express trust in favor of Decedent\u2019s children. Because Marian would be the trustee under the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of the will and because of the admitted hostility between her and the children, the court also ruled that the trust should be terminated and the trust corpus distributed to them with Deborah continuing to act as the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">On appeal from this decision, Marian raises three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">1. Whether the District Court erred in its legal conclusion that the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will created an express trust for the benefit of Decedent\u2019s three children;</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">2. Whether the District Court erred in considering the affidavit of John B. Folsom;</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">3. Whether the District Court erred in its Findings of Fact Nos. 20 and 21 regarding an alleged partnership between Hal and Decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">We will address Issues 1 and 2 together. We will not address Issue 3 or the court\u2019s findings and conclusions as to that issue as Marian states in her brief on appeal that Issue 3 is the subject of other proceedings and that she merely brings the matter to our attention here so as to avoid any later waiver argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same criteria under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P, as did the district court. <em>Missoula Rural Fire Dist. v. City of Missoula </em>(1997), [283 Mont. 113] 938 P.2d 1328, 1329. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous under the three-part test adopted in <em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 820 P.2d 1285, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law simply to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct, <em>Matter of Estate of Dern Family Trust </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 138, 144, 928 P.2d 123, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">As with the judicial interpretation and construction of any instrument, the question of whether any particular language in a will creates an express trust, given the circumstances under which the trust was executed, is a question of law for the court to decide. See <em>Klawitter v. Dettmann </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 275, 281, 886 P.2d 416, 420. Here, accepting the facts found by the court, we conclude, nevertheless, that the District Court erred as a matter of law in its interpretation and construction of the effect of the language of the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On the basis of the discovery responses and depositions provided as part of the summary judgment proceedings, the District Court found that both Hal and Marian believed that the language in the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will created a trust (although in a second deposition Marian contended that she was mistaken in her initial impression in this regard). The court also found that Marian believed that at the time Decedent\u2019s will was drafted and executed, the children were minors and that Decedent used the language in the will to prevent his ex-wife from obtaining control over his estate. The court also agreed with Professor Folsom that, when read in its entirety, the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of the will expressed Decedent\u2019s intention that all of his property must be used in the best interests of his children. The court found that the subject or res of the trust was all of Decedent\u2019s property and that the testator\u2019s purpose in creating the trust was to ensure that his assets would be used in his children\u2019s best interests. The court then concluded that Decedent having thus manifested his intention, and, on the basis of the criteria and authorities argued by the children, an express trust for the children\u2019s benefit was created under the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">On appeal from the District Court\u2019s decision, Marian argues that proof of an express trust requires clear and convincing evidence that the trustor intended to create a trust and that devises, bequests and gifts that do not contain any restrictions on use or disposition of the property involved do not create an express trust. She contends that the use of \u201cprecatory\u201d words by a testator, that is words which express only a wish or recommendation as to the disposition of property, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>not sufficient to establish an intention to create a trust. She cites, among other cases, our decision in <em>Stapleton v. DeVries </em>(1975), 167 Mont. 108, 535 P.2d 1267, in support of her position in this regard. Furthermore, she maintains that the trial court erred in considering the affidavit of Professor Folsom because the question of whether given language in a will creates an express trust is one of law, and, as such, is not a proper subject of expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In support of the District Court\u2019s decision, the children argue that where the testator manifests his intention to create a trust, no particular form of words or conduct is necessary, and that, providing that the trustor indicates with reasonable certainty the subject, purpose and beneficiary of the trust, an express trust is created. The children contend that, under the facts here and under these criteria, the language used by Decedent in the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of his will created an express trust in their favor. They maintain that a trust must be construed in a manner so as to implement the trustor\u2019s intent and that, here, Decedent clearly expressed his intention that his property be used for the benefit of his children. The children cite a 1894 New York case, <em>People v. Powers </em>(N.Y. Sup.Ct.1894), 29 N.Y.S. 950, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>41 N.E. 432 (N.Y. 1895), for the proposition that a testator\u2019s expression of \u201cconfidence\u201d that a bequest will be used to benefit another is sufficient to create a trust. Finally, as to the matter of the Folsom affidavit, Decedent\u2019s children maintain that the professor did not express an expert opinion on the ultimate legal question, but, rather, his opinion went simply to \u201cthe <em>factual </em>issue of the grammatical construction of [the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph] \u2014 not on whether the language creates an express trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">At the outset, we note that there are differences in the statutory law in effect at the time that Decedent executed his will in November 1984 and when he died in March 1995. While the parties do not take any definitive position as to which body of statutory law applies in this case as to this first issue, the District Judge cites to the law in effect at the time Decedent died and which is presently in effect, \u00a7 72-33-202, MCA. In this regard, we note that \u00a7 72-33-102, MCA, provides that after September 30, 1989, the present \u201cTrust Code\u201d (Title 72, Chapters 33 through 36) applies to all trusts regardless of when they were created and to all proceedings concerning trusts whenever they were commenced unless, in the opinion of the court, application of a particular provision of the Trust Code would substantially interfere with the rights of the parties and other interested persons or with the effective conduct of the proceedings. While no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>such opinion, one way or the other, explicitly appears in the trial court\u2019s decision, as mentioned, the court did cite to the present version of the code and thus, implicitly, determined that this statutory law applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We also note, however, that various cases cited in the briefs and in the trial court\u2019s decision predate the Legislature\u2019s 1989 adoption of the present Trust Code and that in certain instances those cases tend to track the statutory language in effect at the time the cases were decided instead of the present statutory law. See e.g., <em>Wild West Motors, Inc. v. Lingle </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 76, 728 P.2d 412, relied upon by the children and the court, which tracks the language of the pre-1989 statute, \u00a7 72-20-107, MCA, as to how a trust is created. Whether those prior decisions simply apply across the board to cases decided under the present Trust Code is not addressed in the briefs; it does appear, however, that the parties and the trial court assumed that to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We will not attempt to address these collateral matters in this opinion, leaving their analysis and resolution to some future case if specifically raised, argued and briefed. Rather, in the case at bar, we will address the first issue in the context of those legal principles which, we believe, have remained historically constant regardless of the changes in the statutory law over the time period in question. In this regard, we also note that under the present Trust Code, \u00a7 72-33-103, MCA, provides that \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that the common law rules governing trusts are modified by statute, the common law as to trusts is the law of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Taking this approach, it is clear that a trust is created only if the testator demonstrates that he or she intends that a trust be created. This rule, followed in <em>Wild West Motors, </em>was set forth prior to 1989 at \u00a7 72-20-107, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">a voluntary trust is created, as to the trustor and beneficiary, by any words or acts of the trustor indicating with reasonable certainty: (1) an intention on the part of the trustor to create a trust; and (2) the subject, purpose and beneficiary of the trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Since 1989, under the Trust Code the law is that \u201c[a] trust is created only if the trustor properly manifests an intention to create a trust.\u201d Section 72-33-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Moreover, in our case law, we continue to cite to the general rule that in the construction of trusts it is the trustor\u2019s intent that controls and that to determine that intent we look to the language of the trust agreement. <em>Houseman v. Koski </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 498, 501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>857 P.2d 715, 717 (citations omitted). In that regard, our rules of construction with respect to testamentary instruments are well settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aac\">The words of the instrument are to receive an interpretation which will give some effect to every expression, rather than an interpretation which will render any of the expressions inoperative. The will is to be construed according to the intentions of the testator, so far as is possible to ascertain them. Words used in the instrument are to be taken in their ordinary and grammatical sense unless a clear intention to use them in another sense can be ascertained. In cases of uncertainty arising upon the face of the will, the testator\u2019s intention is to be ascertained from the words of the instrument, taking into view the circumstances under which it was made, exclusive of his oral declarations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u2018The object, therefore, of a judicial interpretation of a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator, according to the meaning of the words he has used, deduced from a consideration of the whole instrument and a comparison of its various parts in the light of the situation and circumstances which surrounded the testator when the instrument was framed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>In re Strode\u2019s Estate </em>(1946), 118 Mont. 540, 545, 167 P.2d 579, 581-82 (quoting <em>Blacker v. Thatcher </em>(9th Cir. 1944), 145 F.2d 255, 259, 158 A.L.R. 1, <em>cert. denied </em>324 U.S. 848, 65 S.Ct. 686, 89 L.Ed. 1409). <em>Accord In re Hume\u2019s Estate </em>(1954), 128 Mont. 223, 226, 272 P.2d 999, 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Furthermore, \u201c[n]o particular form of words or conduct is necessary for the manifestation of intention to create a trust,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 24 (1959), and \u201cwords of trusteeship are not necessarily conclusive,\u201d George T. Bogert, <em>Trusts </em>\u00a7 11 at 24 (6th ed. 1987). Nonetheless, we have held that \u201cexpress trusts depend for their creation upon a clear and direct expression of intent by the trustor,\u201d <em>Eckart v. Hubbard </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 320, 325, 602 P.2d 988, 991, and that the burden of proof to establish the existence of a trust is upon the party who claims it and must be founded on evidence which is unmistakable, clear, satisfactory and convincing. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Sant </em>(1973), 161 Mont. 376, 386, 506 P.2d 835, 841 (citing <em>Bender v. Bender </em>(1965), 144 Mont. 470, 397 P.2d 957, and <em>Platts v. Platts </em>(1959), 134 Mont. 474, 334 P.2d 722). See also Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 11 at 26 ([i]t is frequently stated by courts that the evidence to establish the existence of a trust must be \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cconvincing,\u201d \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>plicit,\u201d and \u201cunequivocal\u201d), and <em>Eckart, </em>602 P.2d at 991 (evidence must be \u201cclear, convincing, and practically free from doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Again, for purposes of this opinion, the parties having cited to no authority that would support a conclusion that the law would be different under the Trust Code, we will apply these foregoing legal principles. Therefore, we now turn to the language of the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">I intentionally give all of my property and estate to my said father, H. A. Bolinger, in the event that he shall survive me, and in the event he shall not survive me, I intentionally give all of my property and estate to my step-mother, Marian Bolinger, in the event she shall survive me, and in that event, I intentionally give nothing to my three children, namely: Harry Albert Bolinger, IV, Wyetta Bolinger and Travis Bolinger, or to any children of any child who shall not survive me. I make this provision for the reason that I feel confident that any property which either my father or my step-mother, Marian Bolinger, receive from my estate will be used in the best interests of my said children as my said beneficiaries may determine in their exclusive discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">From this language it is clear that Decedent intended to accomplish several things under this paragraph of his will. First, he \u201cintentionally\u2019 devised outright all of his property and estate to his father, and in default of that bequest, then to his step-mother, Marian. Second, it is also clear that Decedent \u201cintentionally\u201d devised nothing to his three children. Third, Decedent desired to make some explanation as to why he disposed of his estate in the foregoing manner. To this end, he added to the otherwise unequivocal language of the first sentence of the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph, a second sentence with the explanation that he made this provision because he felt \u201cconfident\u201d that any property which either his father or his step-mother, Marian, received from his estate would [\u201cwill\u201d] be used in the best interests of his said children as Hal or Marian may determine in their exclusive discretion. It is the language in this second sentence which is at issue and which the District Court determined created an express trust in favor of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The use of this latter sort of qualifying language in a will or instrument is referred to as \u201cprecatory\u201d language. As stated in Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 19 at 41:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">Usually, if a transferor of property intends the transferee to be a trustee, he directs him to act in that capacity, but sometimes he merely expresses a wish or recommendation that the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>given be used in whole or in part for the benefit of another. Words of this latter type are called \u201cprecatory\u201d and are generally construed not to create a trust but instead to create at most an ethical obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">In weighing the effect of precatory expressions the courts consider the entire document and the circumstances of the donor, his family, and other interested parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The author of this treatise notes that the primary question in construing precatory language is whether the testator meant merely to advise or influence the discretion of the devisee, or himself control or direct the disposition intended. Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 19 at 42. Here, in Marian\u2019s favor, the author notes that \u201cthe settlor must have explicitly or impliedly expressed an intent to impose obligations on the trustee and not merely to give the donee of the property <em>an option to use if for the benefit of another.\u201d </em>Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 19 at 42 (emphasis added). Put another way, considering the language of the entire instrument and the situation of the alleged settlor, his family, and the supposed beneficiaries at the time the will was executed, \u201cwas it natural and probable that the donor intended the donee to be bound by an enforceable obligation <em>or was he to be free to use his judgment and discretion?\u201d </em>Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 19 at 42 (emphasis added). Moreover, \u201c[w]here a donor first makes an absolute gift of property, without restriction or limitation, and later inserts precatory language in a separate sentence or paragraph, the courts are apt to find that there was no intent to have a trust.\u201d Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 19 at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We have addressed the use of such language in a prior decision relied on by Marian. In <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1268, the decedent\u2019s will provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Amanda DeVries, all the balance, residue and remainder of my property of whatever nature, kind or character which I may own at the time of my death to have and to hold as her sole and separate property. I do this with the knowledge that she will be fair and equitable to all of my children, the issue of myself and my former wife as well as the issue of herself and myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">When Amanda died leaving all her property to her children and nothing to the decedent\u2019s children by his first marriage, the latter sued claiming that a constructive trust was created by decedent\u2019s will in their favor. <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1268. Reversing the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>summary judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019favor, we ruled that the language was clear on its face \u2014 Amanda was given decedent\u2019s property outright and the remaining precatory language did not create a trust for the benefit of the children by decedent\u2019s first marriage. <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Furthermore, in <em>Stapleton, </em>while rejecting as of \"little value\u201d cases cited by the parties and pointing out that precatory trust cases are fact driven, we relied on <em>Miller v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1965), 17 Utah 2d 88, 404 P.2d 675, as being factually similar. <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1268-69. In <em>Miller, </em>the precatory language at issue was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Nettie Knudsen Miller, all of my property, whether the same be real or personal or mixed, and I do this acknowledging all my children hereinafter named, and for the reason that I know that my beloved wife will care for my children from the remainder of my estate, if there be any, share alike ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We quoted with approval the Utah court\u2019s conclusion that this precatory language did not create a constructive trust, specifically emphasizing that part of the court\u2019s decision that \u201c[w]here there is a clear and unequivocal devise, the statement of the reasons for doing so does not limit or restrict the testamentary gift.\u201d <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1269. We noted, further, that there was nothing in the <em>Stapleton </em>record to support any conclusion that the decedent intended to create a trust through the precatory language used. <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Similarly, in the case at bar, the language used by Decedent clearly and unambiguously makes an outright gift to his father, and in default of that gift, to his step-mother and specifically excludes his children. Then, in a separate sentence, Decedent explains the reason for this distribution, expressing his \u201cconfidence\u201d that the devisees will use his estate for the children\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d in the devisees\u2019 \u201cexclusive discretion.\u201d This language does not impose any sort of clear directive or obligation (other than, perhaps, a moral or ethical one) on either Hal or Marian. The purported trustee is given no direction as to how the supposed settlor intends his estate to be used to further the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children and neither does Decedent provide any guidance as to what those best interests might include. Decedent imposes no restrictions on the purported trustee, but, rather, leaves in that person the \u201cexclusive discretion\u201d as to how the estate will be used for the children\u2019s best interests, expressing his \u201cconfidence\u201d that will be accomplished. Decedent\u2019s statement of reasons for devising his estate to Hal and Marian, neither limits nor restricts the gift to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>them any more than did the language at issue in <em>Stapleton </em>and in <em>Miller </em>limit or restrict the bequests made in those cases. <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1269. The bottom line is that, under the precatory language used by Decedent, his devisees had complete discretion as to how to use the property given them outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Furthermore, as in <em>Stapleton, </em>the facts found by the court and relied on by the children in the case at bar do not support the conclusion that Decedent intended that his expression of confidence in his father and step-mother would create a legally enforceable express trust. First, the trial court and the children focus on deposition testimony of Marian that she (initially at least) and Hal believed that the will created a trust. How Marian and Hal may have construed the language is not the issue, however. The real issue is what Decedent intended when he used the language which he did. Unfortunately, neither Marian\u2019s nor Hal\u2019s conclusory interpretation of the meaning of the language in the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of the will assists in divining Decedent\u2019s intent one way or the other. Second, while Marian believed that Decedent may have been concerned that his first wife would obtain control over his estate while the children were minors, <em>her </em>personal belief of what motivated Decedent is not evidence of what Decedent actually intended. Even Marian\u2019s testimony on this point was equivocal and speculative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">Bud [Decedent] was flying around a good deal in those days because of his being an officer in the Pinsgauer [sic] Association, and <em>I think </em>he got worried about his kids. And by that time, his father had given him the 240 acres up south, and so <em>he probably </em>did not want Fae to have anything to do with it, is <em>what my own personal feeling is. </em>And he certainly made it clear. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Third, as to Professor Folsom\u2019s affidavit, he first recites the entire <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will. He then analyzes various words and phrases in the paragraph as parts of speech and in the context of grammar and sentence structure. Professor Folsom then reaches the conclusion that \u201c[w]hen read in its entirety, the paragraph expresses the intention that the property must be used in the best interest of the children.\u201d Regardless of whether Professor Folsom\u2019s affidavit was admissible or not on the issue of Decedent\u2019s intent, we conclude simply that, either on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with Marian\u2019s deposition testimony, this affidavit does not provide substantial evidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, of Decedent\u2019s intent. Without belaboring the point, nothing here sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>gests that Decedent chose his nouns, verbs and adverb prepositional phrases with the surgical precision that Professor Folsom concludes adds up to an expression of intention that the property \u201cmust\u201d (Professor Folsom\u2019s word, not Decedent\u2019s) be used in the best interest of the children. Arguably, had Decedent given the sort of considered thought to his choice of words that is suggested by the affidavit and had he clearly intended to create an express legal trust, it is more likely that he would not have used the sort of precatory language that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Furthermore, we note that the <em>Third </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will makes an unconditional, outright devise of all of Decedent\u2019s estate to Hal and that the <em>Fourth </em>paragraph of the will makes an unconditional, outright devise of the same property to Marian, should Hal die before Decedent. Also, we note that the <em>Sixth </em>paragraph of the will appoints Hal as the personal representative with Marian as the alternate, both without bond, and gives both unrestricted power to sell any or all of the estate property without court order at public or private sale, with or without notice. Again, Decedent\u2019s unequivocal, outright and unrestricted gifts to Hal and alternatively to Marian, and his appointment of them as the personal representative and alternate without bond and without restriction on their powers, supports the conclusion that the one precatory sentence in the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph was advisory only and was not intended to create a legal, express trust obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">While the children and the trial court rely upon <em>Wild West Motors </em>and <em>In Re Marriage of Malquist </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 419, 763 P.2d 1116, as generally describing the creation of a voluntary trust, neither case is particularly helpful in resolving the specific question of Decedent\u2019s intent and the construction of the language in his will at issue here. In the former case the existence of a trust was admitted, <em>Wild West Motors, </em>728 P.2d at 415, and in the latter case the issue was whether certain real property was included in an already existing trust, <em>Malquist, </em>763 P.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Furthermore, the children\u2019s and the court\u2019s citation to <em>Powers, </em>an 1894 New York case, is not persuasive. The case is cited for the proposition that the testator\u2019s expression of \u201cconfidence\u201d that a bequest will be used to benefit another is sufficient to create a trust. We conclude that, while such an expression may be considered as part of the evidence of a testator\u2019s intention, in and of itself, the use of that word is not dispositive of this issue. Whether a trust will be found from the use of any precatory word or phrase, whether that be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201cdesire,\u201d \u201cwish,\u201d \u201chope,\u201d \u201crecommend,\u201d \u201cin confidence\u201d or \u201crely,\u201d cannot be concluded merely from the particular word or phrase used. Bogert, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 19 at 41-42. Importantly, and while other courts may interpret precatory language more liberally, our case law precedent is clear and we decline to depart from it on the facts here. <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">In short, we conclude that, reviewing Decedent\u2019s will as a whole, taking the words and phrases used by Decedent in their ordinary and grammatical sense and considering the facts found by the District Court, there was not the sort of \u201cunmistakable,\u201d \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cconvincing,\u201d \u201cexplicit,\u201d \u201cunequivocal\u201d and \u201cpractically free from doubt\u201d evidence that would support a legal conclusion that Decedent clearly and directly expressed his intention to create an express trust in favor of the children through his use of precatory language in the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of his will. <em>Eckart, </em>602 P.2d at 991; <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>506 P.2d at 841; <em>Platts, </em>334 P.2d at 727; <em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Finally, as an aside, we note that both <em>Stapleton </em>and <em>Miller </em>addressed whether the precatory language at issue created a constructive trust, as opposed to the claim in the case at bar that the trust created was an express trust. Express trusts depend upon intention and implied trusts, i.e., constructive or resulting trusts, arise by operation of the law. <em>Platts, </em>334 P.2d at 727. See also \u00a7\u00a7 72-33-201, -219 and -220, MCA. With regard to the latter trusts, intent may be presumed or implied or intent may not even be an issue. <em>Eckart, </em>602 P.2d at 991. Nevertheless, for purposes of this opinion, we do not believe that this distinction as to the type of trust created is of particular importance, where the central issue \u2014 whether the testator\u2019s intent is manifest from the language used and the facts found \u2014 is the same and is governed by the same principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We hold that the District Court erred in its legal conclusion that the <em>Fifth </em>paragraph of Decedent\u2019s will created an express trust for the benefit of Decedent\u2019s three children. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b155-9\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"A4O\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">The majority, relying principally upon our decision in <em>Stapleton v. DeVries </em>(1975), 167 Mont. 108, 535 P.2d 1267, holds that the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>used in the Bolinger will is only precatory. In <em>Stapleton, </em>the will provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Amanda DeVries, all the balance, residue and remainder of my property of whatever nature, kind or character which I may own at the time of my death to have and to hold as her sole and separate property. I do this with the knowledge that she will be fair and equitable to all my children, the issue of myself and my former wife as well as the issue of herself and myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><em>Stapleton, </em>535 P.2d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In the present case, the Bolinger will provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">I intentionally give all of my property and estate to my said father, H.A. Bolinger, in the event that he shall survive me, and in the event he shall not survive me, I intentionally give all of my property and estate to my step-mother, Marian Bolinger, in the event she shall survive me, and in that event, I intentionally give nothing to my three children, namely: Harry Albert Bolinger, IV, Wyetta Bolinger and Travis Bolinger, or to any children of any child who shall survive me. I make this provision for the reason that I feel confident that any property which either my father or my step-mother, Marian Bolinger, receive from my estate will be used in the best interests of my said children as my said beneficiaries may determine in their exclusive discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The language used in the Bolinger will is distinguishable from and more conclusive than that used in <em>Stapleton. </em>In <em>Stapleton, </em>the decedent\u2019s will devised the property to the beneficiary \u201cto hold as her sole and separate property.\u201d Such a \u201csole and separate property\u201d provision is absent in the Bolinger will. Secondly, in <em>Stapleton, </em>the testator made the devise knowing that the beneficiary would be fair and equitable to all his children (i.e. children from both marriages). The beneficiary was thus under no obligation to segregate the devised property or to treat it any differently than her sole property. In contrast, Bolinger provided that \u201cany property\u201d received from his estate was specifically tagged for use \u201cin the best interests of [his] children.\u201d In other words, his father or step-mother were not to commingle the property with their own property, nor were they to treat it as their sole and separate property with some vague understanding that they would then be fair and equitable to all concerned. Rather, Bolinger was confident that this <em>specific property \u201cwill be used </em>in the best interests of my children.\u201d The language in the Bolinger will is more than precatory, it is peremptory.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>As the court recognizes, no particular form of words is necessary for the manifestation of an intent to create a trust, RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TRUSTS \u00a7 24, and express trusts depend upon a clear and direct expression of intent by the trustor. <em>Eckart v. Hubbard </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 320, 325, 602 P.2d 988, 991. Bolinger clearly intended that the property passing maintain its separate identity and that his father or step-mother, as trustees, use the property solely for the benefit of his children, who were, at the time of the will, minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">I would affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-5\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing dissent of Justice W.
