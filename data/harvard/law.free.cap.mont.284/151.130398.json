We reverse the decision of the District Court and remand for determination of appropriate compensation consistent with \u201cheavy\u2019 and \u201chighway\u2019 rates under the Little Davis-Bacon Act, \u00a7\u00a7 18-2-401 <em>et seq., </em>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-19\">Are the Edsall and Barnard tunnels \u201cheavy\u201d construction projects</p>\n<p id=\"b180-20\">under Montana\u2019s Little Davis-Bacon Act, \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">Montana law divides prevailing wage classifications for laborers into three categories: heavy construction, highway construction and other types of construction (i.e., building). Wages for heavy and highway workers are set at one rate in Montana and wages for \u201cother\u201d (building) workers are set at a second rate. Sections 18-2-401(5) and (7), MCA, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">(5) \u201cHeavy and highway construction wage rates\u201d means wage rates, including fringe benefits for health and welfare and pension contributions, that meet the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and other bona fide programs approved by the United States department of labor and travel allowance that are determined and established statewide for heavy and highway construction projects, such as alteration or repair of roads, streets, highways, alleys, runways, trails, parking areas, or utility rights-of-way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">(7) (a) \u201cStandard prevailing rate of wages\u201d or \u201cstandard prevailing wage\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">(i) the heavy and highway construction wage rates applicable to heavy and highway construction projects; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">(ii) those wages, other than heavy and highway construction wages, including fringe benefits for health and welfare and pension contributions, that meet the requirements of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 and other bona fide programs approved by the United States department of labor and travel allowance that are paid in the district by other contractors for work of a similar character performed in that district by each craft, classification, or type of worker needed to complete a contract under this part. In each district, the standard prevailing rate of wages is a weighted average wage rate based on all of the hours worked on work of a similar character performed in the district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The instant case involves the appropriate prevailing wage for laborers working on two separate construction projects at MSU. Specifically, this case involves a dispute as to whether construction workers should receive the \u201cheavy\u201d construction wage which is generally $3.00 to $4.00 per hour greater than the building construction wage rate. The first of these projects was formally known as \u201cUnderground Utility Phase II, Montana State University.\u201d For purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>brevity, this project will be referred to as the \u201cBarnard Tunnel\u201d as it was eventually constructed by Barnard Construction. The second project was officially known as the \u201cEngineering/Physical Sciences Building, Utility Tunnel.\u201d This project will be referred to as the \u201cEdsall Tunnel\u201d as Edsall Construction Company contracted to build this second tunnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">At MSU, many of the buildings are heated with steam from a central heating plant. Steam is carried in underground pipelines to buildings connected to the plant. Both the Edsall and Barnard Tunnels were constructed to house steam and condensate pipes in order to protect them from degradation and make them more accessible for maintenance and repair. The Edsall and Barnard Tunnels are of similar design and are entirely underground. Inside both tunnels are metal frames used to support the steam and condensate pipelines and electrical overhead lights. Neither tunnel has a heating or cooling system, windows, flooring or internal finished walls or any plumbing, plumbing system or bathrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">While the Edsall and Barnard Tunnels were being constructed, the Labor Standards Bureau of the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (Department) received an inquiry from Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, Montana District Council of Laborers (Laborers) concerning the appropriate wage rate for construction on the tunnels. In addition, the Department received a number of complaints from individual construction workers employed on these two projects. Following an investigation, the Department determined that these projects were not conventional buildings and, therefore, should have been classified as \u201cheavy\u201d construction projects for purposes of determining the appropriate prevailing wage. The Department made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">[A] review of the project\u2019s nature distinguishes it from a building. Few, if any, buildings in Montana are entirely underground, and in the case of the Barnard portion extend over approximately 600 yards through a major portion of the university campus. Few, if any buildings, lack windows, any type of conventional roofing, living or storage space, internal wood or steel framing (other than the utility support structures), doors, plumbing, and heating or cooling systems. Few, if any buildings, have an internal drainage system (gutters) in case of flooding through excess ground water or sump pump failure. Few, if any buildings, are constructed entirely of concrete and reinforcing steel. Indeed, few, if any buildings, are built entirely within the confines of a continuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>trench running approximately 600 yards in length, an estimated 60 feet in width at ground level .... This is not a building in any conventional sense of the word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-3\">After coming to the above conclusion, the Department found the contracting agency, the Architecture and Engineering Division of the Montana Department of Administration (AEDMDA), was responsible for back pay and future pay resulting from the wage differences. AEDMDA filed an appeal of the Department\u2019s determination and a contested case hearing was held before a Department hearing officer Joseph V. Maronick (Maronick). Maronick entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order which affirmed the Department\u2019s determination and directed AEDMDA to compensate construction workers at the \u201cheavy construction\u201d wage rate. AEDMDA appealed this decision to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">After each party briefed and orally argued this matter, the District Court issued an order reversing the Department\u2019s determination. The District Court held that the Department had misapplied Montana\u2019s Little Davis-Bacon Act, \u00a7 18-2-401(7), MCA, and that its decision to award \u201cheavy construction\u201d wages was erroneous. Ekanger, in her position as Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industry, appeals from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Are the Edsall and Barnard tunnels \u201cheavy\u201d construction projects under Montana\u2019s Little Davis-Bacon Act, \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We are called upon to review the District Court\u2019s application of the Little Davis-Bacon Act to the undisputed facts of this case. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686; <em>see also Kreger v. Francis </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 444; 898 P.2d 672; <em>Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Montana\u2019s Little Davis-Bacon Act defines three categories of wage rates: heavy construction, highway construction and \u201cother\u201d types of construction. Sections 18-2-401(5) and (7), MCA. The District Court held that this statute was unambiguous and explained that the Barnard and Edsall tunnel projects did not qualify as \u201cheavy or highway\u201d construction under \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, which defines \u201cheavy and highway construction wage rates\u201d as applying to: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>projects, such as alteration or repair of roads, streets, highways, alleys, runways, trails, parking areas, or utility rights-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">In interpreting the above statute, the court reasoned that, with the exception of \u201cutility rights-of-way,\u201d the examples given all relate to roads and highways. The projects in question were obviously not in the nature of a road or highway. The appellant, however, argues that the projects are \u201cutility rights-of-way.\u201d In response to this argument, the court noted that, although the term \u201cutility rights-of-way\u201d is not defined in Title 18, it is defined in Title 60 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cRight of wa/\u2019 is a general term denoting land, property, or any interest in land or property, usually in a strip, acquired for or devoted to highway purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Section 60-1-103(23), MCA. The court also relied on the definition of \u201cright of way\u2019 in BLACKS LAW DICTIONARY 1326 (6th ed. 1990) as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap6\">a right belonging to a party to pass over land of another, but it is also used to describe that strip of land upon which railroad companies construct their road bed, and, when so used, the term refers to the land itself, not the right of passage over it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Based upon these definitions of \u201cright of way,\u201d the court concluded: \u201cSimply stated, a \u2018right of way\u2019 is only an interest in the land or the use of the land, and does not include utilities or other projects located on it.\u201d Since the tunnel projects were not road related and were not \u201cutility rights-of-way\u201d (i.e. interests in land), the court concluded that the tunnels \u201cdo not fit within any of the enumerated examples\u201d of heavy or highway construction. We determine that the District Court\u2019s use of this definition of \u201cutility rights-of-way\u201d in the context of the Little Davis-Bacon Act is erroneous. It makes no sense to define \u201cutility rights-of-way,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, as \u201conly an interest in land.\u201d The relevant portion of \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, includes \u201cutility rights-of-way\u2019 in its examples of \u201cheavy and highway constructionpro/ecis.\u201d (Emphasis added.) An \u201cinterest in land\u201d cannot be considered as an example of a \u201cproject\u201d in any sense of the word. An interest in land exists by virtue of law; it is not \u201cconstructed\u201d through wage labor. As used in \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA\u2019s list of projects, \u201cutility rights-of-way\u2019 clearly denotes something that is built or constructed through labor. Furthermore, a utility right-of-way is something other than a road or a highway. The District Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, has application only to matters related to roads or highways. It applies as well to projects in which \u201cutility rights-of-way\u2019 are <em>constructed </em>through labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>In construing any statute, the goal is to ascertain and implement the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Burritt v. City of Butte </em>(1973), 161 Mont. 530, 508 P.2d 563. Where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, there is nothing left for a court to construe. <em>Keller v. Smith </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 399, 553 P.2d 1002; <em>Dunphy v. Anaconda Co. </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 76, 438 P.2d 660. Section 18-2-401(5), MCA, requires heavy and highway construction rates for projects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-3\">such as alteration or repair of roads, streets, highways, alleys, runways, trails, parking areas, or utility rights-of-way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The use of the phrase \u201csuch as\u201d in listing projects requiring heavy construction wage rates reflects an intent that the list be inclusive rather than exclusive. Section 18-2-401(5), MCA, is unambiguous in its inclusion of \u201cutility rights-of-way\u2019 in the heavy and highway project classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Edsall and Barnard Tunnels are \u201cutility rights-of-way\u201d projects in which tunnels were constructed to house steam and condensate pipes in a protected underground corridor to provide heat to buildings on the MSU campus. As such, these projects are among the enumerated projects considered as \u201cheavy construction\u201d under \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In summary, we hold that the Little Davis-Bacon Act heavy and highway construction wage rate clearly is not restricted to projects which are road or highway related. Rather, this wage rate has application to \u201cheavy\u201d projects involving utility rights-of-way such as the Edsall and Barnard Tunnels. The decision of the District Court is reversed and the matter is remanded for determination of appropriate back pay.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b185-9\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AZP\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">I concur in the result reached by the Court, namely, that the construction workers on the Edsall and Barnard Tunnel projects are entitled to be paid at heavy and highway construction wage rates. I do not agree with all that is said by the Court in reaching that result or with the Court\u2019s approach to the statutory definition of \u201cheavy and highway construction wage rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">I do agree with the Court that the \u201csuch as\u201d language in the \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, listing of projects requiring heavy and highway construction wage rates reflects a legislative intent that the list be inclusive rather than exclusive. Stated differently, the \u201csuch as\u201d list is merely illustrative of the <em>types </em>of projects properly designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u201cheavy and highway construction\u201d projects. That being the case, it is unnecessary for the Court to \u201cforce feed\u201d the Edsall and Barnard Tunnel projects into one of the actual categories listed in \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, and that approach results in a somewhat strained interpretation that these projects are \u201cutility rights of way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Given the inclusive rather than exclusive listing contained in \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, all that is necessary to conclude that the workers in this case are entitled to heavy and highway construction wage rates is to establish that the projects are of the same type or nature as those listed in the statute. Here, that is a relatively easy task.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The projects involved the demolition of existing, and construction of new, sidewalks and roads. Thus, in the language of the statute, they can be likened to heavy and highway construction projects involving \u201calteration or repair of roads, streets ... [or] trails....\u201d More importantly, they involved underground tunnel work much more similar to utility pipeline and power line proj ects than to conventional building construction projects for which heavy and highway construction wage rates are not required. In addition, of course, the formal names of the Edsall and Barnard Tunnel projects \u2014 \u201cEngineering/Physical Sciences Building, Utility Tunnel\u201d and \u201cUnderground Utility Phase II, Montana State University,\u201d respectively \u2014 reflect that the projects were utility-type projects. That the projects were not located <em>on </em>utility rights of way does not change the nature of the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">I would conclude that the Edsall and Barnard Tunnel projects are of the same type and nature as the projects listed in \u00a7 18-2-401(5), MCA, for which heavy and highway construction wage rates are required. For that reason, I join the Court in reversing the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
