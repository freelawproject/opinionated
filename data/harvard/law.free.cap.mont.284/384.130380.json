McKee Anderson and Judy Y. Anderson (Andersons) appeal from the Judgment of the Fifth Judicial District Court, Beaverhead County, holding that the Respondents, Richard E. and Linda Reichle (Reichles), are the owners of a thirty foot right-of-way easement through Andersons\u2019 property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">1) Whether the District Court erred when it determined that language in the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed was sufficient to create an easement?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">2) Whether the District Court erred when it refused to allow Andersons to inspect or review a file that a witness used on the witness stand to refresh his memory?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>In June of 1980, Andersons entered into a buy-sell agreement with Richard J. and Donna R. Rankin (Rankins) to purchase a piece of property in Beaverhead County. The buy-sell agreement specifically stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">Sellers are keeping an easement 30\u2019 Wide across the South side of this tract of land for access to property that lies on the west side of the tract being sold to the Andersons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The buy-sell agreement called for a survey to be performed to establish the boundary of the property to be sold to the Andersons. A certificate of survey was prepared and recorded but does not contain any reference to, or description of, an easement reserved by the Rankins.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The Andersons entered into a contract for deed with the Rankins in November of 1980 (Rankin-Anderson contract for deed). The Rankin-Anderson contract for deed was ten pages long with an attached Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d which described the real property being transferred. Exhibit \u201cA\u201d stated that the property was purchased \u201c[sjubject however, to reservation of an easement of right of way with ingress and egress by Richard J. Rankin and Donna R. Rankin, which easement is more particularly described as follows ....\u201d The Rankin-Anderson contract for deed also stated that the parties shall be bound by the terms and conditions contained in the buy-sell agreement and that the agreement was to be incorporated by reference and made a part of the contract for deed in all particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">A notice of purchaser\u2019s interest signed by both Rankins and Andersons and recorded in the Beaverhead County Clerk\u2019s Office also contains the same Exhibit \u201cA,\u201d describing the real property and including the same \u201c[s]ubject however, to reservation of an easement\u201d language. In 1986, a warranty deed from Rankins to Andersons was filed after Andersons prepaid pursuant to the terms of the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed. This deed states that the Rankins reserved an easement of right-of-way for ingress and egress through the Andersons\u2019 newly acquired property. At the same time, the Andersons recorded a homestead exemption for their property that again specifically reserved a thirty foot right-of-way easement for the Rankins.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In October of 1992, Reichles entered into a buy-sell agreement with the Rankins to purchase a ten acre piece of land located on the west side of a canal running between the ten acre piece of land and property already owned by the Reichles on the east side of the canal. The Reichles buy-sell agreement states: \u201cBuyer to receive a 30\u2019 easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>from public railroad crossing to tract A retained by Seller across McKee Anderson south property line.\u201d The buy-sell agreement also has language typed in under the \u201cspecial provisions\u201d section which states: \u201cBuyer shall be able to use bridge and road on Seller\u2019s ground to reach tract Auntil Buyer is able to build own bridge.\u201d This language was included because the Reichles needed use of the Rankins\u2019 bridge to access the ten acre piece until they constructed a bridge from the easement access to the ten acre piece. The ten acre piece of property was conveyed to Reichles by warranty deed on March 24, 1993. The warranty deed specifically describes a private road easement through Andersons\u2019 property by metes and bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Reichles used Rankins\u2019 existing road and bridge from the time of their purchase until December 1993, when they informed the Andersons that they, Reichles, intended to fence off the purported easement and graze llamas on the property. Thereafter, Rankins notified Reichles\u2019 attorney that Reichles would not be allowed any further use of the easement. Reichles then filed a declaratory judgment action against Andersons and Rankins. Reichles\u2019 complaint requested judicial enforcement of a right-of-way easement for ingress and egress that they claimed was expressly granted to them by the terms of their warranty deed. The complaint was answered by both defendants, and cross-claims were filed by both defendants against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">A bench trial was held and judgment was entered on August 10, 1995, in which the District Court ordered that the Reichles were entitled to a thirty foot right-of-way easement for ingress and egress through the southern boundary of Andersons\u2019 property as expressly recited in their warranty deed and as originally reserved by the Rankins when they sold the property to the Andersons in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Andersons filed a motion for reconsideration in August of 1996, requesting that the court reconsider it\u2019s judgment based upon this Court\u2019s decision in Ruana <em>v. Grigonis </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 441, 913 P.2d 1247. The District Court denied the motion, and Andersons thereafter filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">1) Whether the District Court erred when it determined that language in the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed was sufficient to create an easement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The District Court\u2019s determination that the language in the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed created an easement is a conclusion of law. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686. In this case, the District Court held that the language in the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed, stating that the conveyed property was \u201c[s]ubject however, to reservation of an easement,\u201d clearly established the reservation of an easement over Andersons\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Andersons rely on our decisions in <em>Wild River Adventures, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of School Dist. No. 8 </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 397, 812 P.2d 344 and <em>Ruana, </em>913 P.2d at 1253, for their proposition that \u201csubject to\u201d language in a deed is not enough to create an easement where the certificate of survey does not also contain a description of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">However, in both <em>Wild River </em>and <em>Ruana, </em>the actual intent of the grantors was not clear from the deed language itself. In <em>Wild River, </em>812 P.2d at 346, the appellants claimed the following language in a deed created the alleged easement: \u201csubject to and together with a 40 foot private road easement.\u201d In determining whether this language could create an easement, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">The words \u201csubject to\u201d used in their ordinary sense, mean subordinate to, subservient to or limited by. There is nothing in the use of the words \u201csubject to\u201d, in their ordinary use, which would even hint at the creation of affirmative rights or connote a reservation or retention of property rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\"><em>Wild River, </em>812 P.2d at 346-47. Because the language in the deed purporting to create an easement contained no affirmative reservation or retention of rights and because the grantors could not have reserved an easement at that time, we held that no easement had been reserved. <em>Wild River, </em>812 P.2d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">We relied on <em>Wild River </em>in Ruana in determining that language in a deed conveying land \u201csubject to an access easement\u201d did not create an easement. We went on to note that \u201can easement by reservation <em>can be </em>established when, in conjunction with a division of land, the subject easement is shown on the certificate of survey and the certificate of survey is referred to and incorporated in the deed of conveyance.\u201d <em>Ruana, </em>913 P.2d at 1253 (emphasis added). We held that an easement had not been granted or reserved when the original grantors subdivided the land because <em>neither </em>the language of the deed <em>nor </em>the certificate of survey established the easement. <em>Ruana, </em>913 P.2d at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In the instant case, although there is no mention of the easement in the certificate of survey, the language in Exhibit \u201cA\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed clearly reserves an easement and states: \u201cSubject however, to reservation of an easement of right of way.\u201d As we held in <em>Wild River, </em>\u201c \u2018[a] conveyor who, <em>in terms, </em>\u201cexcepts\u201d or \u201creserves\u201d an easement, is permitted to have the rights thereby intended to be enjoyed by him. ...\u2019\u201d <em>Wild River, </em>812 P.2d at 346 (quoting 3 Powell on Real Property, \u00a7 407, pp. 34-39 to 34-42) (emphasis added). Rankins, in terms, reserved an easement through the language \u201c[s]ubject however, to reservation of an easement right of way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In neither <em>Wild River </em>nor <em>Ruana </em>did the deeds in question contain the word \u201creservation;\u201d they simply stated that the conveyed property was \u201csubject to\u201d the purported easement. In these cases, because the deeds themselves did not clearly reserve an easement, we looked for other indications that an easement had been created. In <em>Wild River, </em>we looked to the grantors\u2019 intent; in <em>Ruana, </em>we looked to a certificate of survey. In the instant case, we need look no further than the deed itself. Rankins clearly reserved an easement when they conveyed the property to Andersons. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Rankins reserved an easement in the deed to Andersons and could thereby convey the easement to Reichles.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">2) Whether the District Court erred when it refused to allow Andersons to inspect or review a file that a witness used on the witness stand to refresh his memory?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The standard of review of discretionary trial court rulings is abuse of discretion. <em>May v. First Nat\u2019l Pawn Brokers, Ltd. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 132, 134, 890 P.2d 386, 388. At trial, Andersons introduced a copy of the contract for deed between themselves and Rankins. This copy was allegedly made by McKee Anderson at the closing before Judy Anderson had signed the contract. The material provisions of the contract for deed \u201ccopy\u201d were the same as found in the original, except for the absence of Judy Anderson\u2019s signature and the absence of any reference to a reservation of an easement by the Rankins in Exhibit \u201cA.\u201d Andersons claimed that the original contract for deed had been in the sole possession of Rankins from 1980 until 1983 and that Exhibit \u201cA\u201d could have been altered during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">During trial, the attorney for Rankins who prepared the contract for deed testified and was asked to compare the language in the original contract for deed with the language in the Anderson copy. Rankins\u2019 attorney referred to a copy of the contract for deed in his possession to refresh his memory. Counsel for Andersons asked to review the witness\u2019 entire \u201cfile\u201d for purposes of cross-examination. The District Court denied the request. Andersons argue on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>that the District Court abused its discretion under Rule 612, M.R.Evid., in refusing their request to review the file and in failing to preserve the file for appellate review. Rule 612 governs writings used to refresh memory and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">If a witness uses a writing to refresh memory for the purpose of testifying, either</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">(1) while testifying, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">(2) before testifying, if the court in its discretion determines it is necessary in the interests of justice, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce into evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness. If it is claimed that the writing contains matters not related to the subject matter of the testimony the court shall examine the writing in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party entitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objection shall be preserved and made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal. If a writing is not produced or delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice requires, except that in criminal cases when the prosecution elects not to comply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if the court in its discretion determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Rule 612, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Andersons claim the District Court\u2019s decision not to allow them to review the file foreclosed their opportunity to effectively cross-examine the witness as to the contents of the file. Additionally, they claim the court\u2019s failure to preserve the file for appeal has forever denied them access to the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Questions concerning the admissibility of evidence must be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, subject to review only in situations that indicate a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Cech v. State </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 522, 604 R2d 97. No such manifest abuse of discretion exists here. The Rankin-Anderson buy-sell agreement, the notice of purchaser\u2019s interest, and the warranty deed each contain a reference to the easement in question. The \u201ccopy\u201d of the Rankin-Anderson contract for deed appeared only days before trial despite the fact that the notice of purchaser\u2019s interest, which included the easement language, was recorded fourteen years earlier and the warranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>deed, also including the easement language, was recorded nine years earlier. Additionally, at the time the warranty deed was recorded, Andersons recorded a homestead exemption for their property which included an Exhibit <em>\u201cA\u201d </em>(with the easement language) identical to the Exhibit \u201cA\u201d that Andersons were challenging at trial. Therefore, the District Court could easily have concluded that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d did not require inspection of the witness\u2019 copies of these documents. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing Andersons\u2019 request to review the witness\u2019 file.
