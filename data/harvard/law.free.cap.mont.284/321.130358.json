Lynch (the Lynches) appeal from the judgment and underlying jury verdict of the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County, in favor of respondents Dean and Barbara Reed (the Reeds). The Lynches also appeal rulings of the District Court denying them the opportunity to present certain evidence to the jury regarding construction safety standards. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">We address the following issues on appeal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">1. Does this Court have jurisdiction to hear the appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">2. Did the District Court commit reversible error by excluding employment safety regulations including OSHA and ANSI from the trial of the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">3. Did the District Court err in denying the Lynches\u2019 motion for a new trial on the basis that they were denied an opportunity to fully cross-examine the Reeds\u2019 expert witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">4. Did the District Court err in denying the Lynches\u2019 motion for a new trial on the basis that their expert witness was not permitted to testify as to the basis of his expert opinions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">5. Are the Lynches entitled to a new trial because of defense counsel\u2019s remarks regarding Neil Lynch\u2019s prior motorcycle accident?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">In 1991 the Reeds began construction of a retirement cabin on property they had purchased at Georgetown Lake. The Reeds contracted with Dale Fredlund, a Butte log home builder to excavate the foundation and install the log home package. Dean Reed (Reed) had been working part time for Fredlund erecting log home packages at Fredlund\u2019s property. In exchange for Reed\u2019s help in erecting the Reed log home package, Fredlund reduced the overall price of the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">After the excavation was completed, Reed contracted with two masonry companies for the construction of the foundation. Once the foundation was completed, Reed contracted with two carpenters for the installation of the floor joists and floor decking. When the floor decking was completed, two openings were left in the decking. One was for the installation of the stairway from the basement and the other was for the installation of a fireplace. After the carpenters had completed their work, Fredlund returned to the site to begin the installation of the log home package in accordance with his contract with the Reeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Reed and Neil Lynch (Lynch) were acquaintances and would periodically discuss the progress of the cabin. Lynch agreed to come to the construction site and help with the erection of the log home package. At this point in the construction, the log walls were approximately eleven courses high. When this type of log home is erected, the doorways and windows are cut into the walls after the walls have been erected. Consequently, a person must go through the basement to access the interior of the cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">On September 25,1991, Lynch arrived at the Reeds\u2019 property and gained access to the main floor of the cabin by entering the basement and climbing up an extension ladder. The extension ladder passed through the opening in the floor which had been left for the future installation of the stairs. The stairway opening in the floor decking was approximately four feet wide by eight feet in length. Two sheets of plywood covered approximately one-half of the stairway opening. The fireplace floor hole opening was covered with plywood, logs and saw horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">After Lynch was on the main floor of the cabin, Reed instructed him to wait while Reed and Fredlund retrieved another log from outside the cabin. While Lynch was waiting, he decided to move the plywood that was next to him on the floor and set it up against the wall, out of the way. Lynch approached the piece of plywood, picked it up with both hands, raised it to his chest and stepped forward in an effort to push it toward the wall he was facing. Once he stepped forward, he fell into the hole that the loose piece of plywood had covered. Lynch fell approximately eight feet to the basement\u2019s dirt floor; he was paralyzed as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The Lynches filed suit to recover damages for the personal injuries suffered by them as a result of Neil Lynch\u2019s accident. Before trial, the District Court granted the Reeds\u2019 motion in limine restricting the Lynches from presenting evidence on construction site safety standards. The court further denied the Lynches\u2019 attempts to introduce the standards during trial and limited Lynches\u2019 cross-examination of Reeds\u2019 expert. Following a three-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Reeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">After entry of judgment for the Reeds, the Lynches moved for a new trial. The motion was received by the court but, due to a clerical error, was not filed with the clerk of court. Thereafter, the Lynches filed a brief in support of their motion for new trial. Two days later the Lynches filed a notice of appeal. In an order dated July 31,1996, the District Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Lynches\u2019 motion for new trial by virtue of the notice of appeal. The Lynches appeal from the judgment entered on the jury verdict and other orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">1. Does this Court have jurisdiction to hear the appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The Reeds contend that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the Lynches filed their notice of appeal while their motion for new trial was still pending in the District Court. According to Rule 5(a)(4), M.R.App.R, a notice of appeal filed before disposition of a Rule 59 motion for new trial has no effect. On July 31,1996, the District Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the Lynches\u2019 \u201cmotion\u201d because of the subsequent filing of the notice of appeal. The Reeds argue that because the District Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the motion, the Lynches\u2019 motion for a new trial was deemed denied on August 11,1996, and, pursuant to Rule 5(a)(4), M.R.App.R, the Lynches were required to re-file a notice of appeal no later than thirty days after their motion for a new trial was deemed denied. The Reeds contend that because the Lynches did not re-file a notice of appeal, this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In its order ruling that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the \u201cmotion\u201d for new trial, the District Court stated: \u201cPlaintiffs filed a Brief in Support of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a New Trial; however, Plaintiffs never filed a Motion for a New Trial.\u201d The Lynches argue that this order led them to believe that the clerical error in failing to file the motion for a new trial with the District Court was fatal to that motion and that, therefore, their notice of appeal was timely filed. We agree. Because the motion for new trial was never filed it was a nullity and the Lynches\u2019 subsequent notice of appeal was timely filed. This Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">2. Did the District Court commit reversible error by excluding employment safety regulations including OSHA and ANSI from the trial of the case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The standard of review of a district court\u2019s discretionary ruling is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Durbin v. Ross </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 463, 477, 916 P.2d 758, 767; <em>State v. Santos </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 125, 137, 902 P.2d 510, 517. The abuse of discretion standard applies to trial administration issues, post-trial motions and similar rulings. <em>Montana Rail Link v. Byard </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 331. 337. 860 P.2d 121, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The Reeds submitted a motion in limine requesting that the Lynches be restricted from mentioning any construction site safety standards. The District Court granted the Reeds\u2019 motion in limine in several respects. The District Court ruled that Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations (OSHA), American National Standard Safety Requirements (ANSI), and Montana\u2019s Construction Site Health and Safety Act were inadmissible on the issue of the Reeds\u2019 negligence because the \u201csafety standards in question do not have the force of law. ...\u201d The District Court had the opportunity to analyze this issue at various junctures since the Lynches persistently raised the issue throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The Lynches\u2019 argument on appeal focuses on the District Court\u2019s exclusion of OSHA and ANSI regulations, and we will therefore discuss only those regulations. The Lynches argued to the District Court, and argue here, that the Reeds\u2019 failure to comply with OSHA regulations and ANSI standards is evidence of their negligence and, thus, admissible. The Reeds, on the other hand, contend that OSHA and ANSI are not applicable to an individual who is constructing his own private residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Lynches argue that in granting the Reeds\u2019 motion in limine regarding safety standards, the court incorrectly relied on <em>Hackley v. Waldorf-Hoerner Paper Products Co. </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 286, 294-95, 425 P.2d 712, 716, for the proposition that \u201cevidence of safety standards that do not have the force of law are inadmissible on the issue of negligence.\u201d In <em>Hackley, </em>this Court considered two rulings by the district court in which the district court had refused the use of evidence on safety standards for <em>any </em>purpose. The first issue considered by this Court was whether the district court had erred in refusing to permit any testimony on the \u201cminimum Safety Standards for the Construction Industry, section 41-1702, R.C.M. 1947. ...\u201d <em>Hackley, </em>425 P.2d at 716. The Court began its analysis by examining the language of the statute at issue. The statute in <em>Hackley, </em>as the OSHA regulations here, spoke in terms of an \u201cemployer\u2019s duty.\u201d The Court\u2019s decision that evidence of the statutory safety standard was properly excluded was based on its conclusion that the statute imposed \u201cno duty\u201d on the defendant because it was not an employer of the injured person. <em>Hackley, </em>425 P.2d at 716. The second issue this Court analyzed involved the district court\u2019s refusal to admit industry safety standards. This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s exclusion of the standards on the basis that advisory material \u201cnot having the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>force of law, is not admissible on the issue of negligence.\u201d Hackley, 425 P.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The Lynches argue that <em>Hackley </em>is no longer good law in Montana and is not applicable to this case for two reasons: it was ruled on prior to the adoption of the standards and codes in question, and it was based on an annotation which has since been superseded. The Lynches point out that in <em>Hackley, </em>this Court, following the majority rule set forth in 75 A.L.R. 2d 778, affirmed the district court\u2019s refusal to admit standards promulgated by the American Standards Association. However, that annotation has been superseded by 58 A.L.R. 3d 148 which states that \u201cthe modem trend toward greater admissibility of these codes and standards has apparently been great enough to make it unwise to attempt to identify any majority or minority rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIc\">The Lynches argue that this Court recognized <em>Hackley\u2019s </em>shortcomings in <em>Runkle v. Burlington Northern </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 286, 613 P.2d 982. The <em>Runkle </em>decision acknowledged that post <em>-Hackley </em>decisions \u201cseem to be moving toward acceptance in evidence of such advisory material with certain qualifications. Such treatises may be admitted upon the foundation that they (1) show what is feasible to the jury, or (2) show what the defendant knew or should have known about safety precautions.\u201d <em>Runkle, </em>613 P.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">However, the Court in <em>Runkle </em>also established the following rule for admissibility of industry standards and codes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\"><em>Unless </em>the codes or standards are adopted by a governmental agency so as to have the force of law, they are not to be admitted as conclusively determining the standard of care imposed upon the defendant, nor as substantive evidence of negligence, <em>unless </em>coupled with a showing of general acceptance in the industry concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"><em>Runkle, </em>613 P.2d at 993 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We interpret this rule as providing two separate tests for the admissibility of codes or standards: 1) a code or standard sought to be admitted for the purpose of \u201cconclusively determining the standard of care imposed upon the defendant\u201d must have been adopted by a governmental agency so as to have the force of law; 2) where a code or standard does not have the force of law, it may nevertheless be admitted as substantive evidence of negligence if it is coupled with a showing of general acceptance in the industry concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In interpreting the rule from <em>Runkle </em>in this manner we must necessarily overrule <em>Hackley, </em>insofar as it holds that evidence of codes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>or standards of safety issued by governmental bodies as advisory material but without the force of law, are <em>never </em>admissible on the issue of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Under the rule in <em>Runkle </em>we must first determine whether OSHA or ANSI have \u201cthe force of law\u201d as applied to the Reeds. The regulations interpreting OSHAprovide in part that \u201c[a]ny employer employing one or more employees would be an \u2018employer engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees\u2019 and, therefore, he is covered by the Act as such.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7 1975.4. The Lynches argue that the Reeds are covered by OSHA under this definition of employer because the Reeds \u201cemployed a crane operator-laborer, cement and brick mason, and carpenters\u201d and because the construction of the Reeds\u2019 cabin falls under the broad category of businesses that are in a class of activity that as a whole \u201caffects\u201d commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The Lynches argue that OSHA was developed to protect any person rightfully on the job site, not just employees, and therefore Lynch was a person covered under the Act. Cases cited by the Lynches in support of their theory that OSHA protections encompass non-employees discuss the \u201cmulti-employer doctrine,\u201d which has developed as a means of apportioning liability at multi-employer work sites where one employer has created a hazard and some employees, but not necessarily its own, are exposed to the hazard. <em>See Arrington v. Arrington Bros. Const., Inc. </em>(Idaho 1989), 781 P.2d 224 (holding that an employer\u2019s OSHA duties may run not only to his own employees, but to any other employees or persons in general on a multi-employer worksite); <em>Teal v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1984), 728 F.2d 799 (recognizing employers\u2019 and commercial general contractors\u2019 duties under OSHA to protect all employees on a multi-employer worksite); <em>see also Anthony Crane Rental, Inc. v. Reich </em>(D.C. Cir. 1995), 70 F.3d 1298. We find these cases inapplicable to the instant case because the Reeds\u2019 log cabin construction project is not a \u201cmulti-employer worksite.\u201d Furthermore, all of the cases cited by the Lynches require that, before employers are obligated to protect all persons rightfully on the worksite, it must first be established that the employer is deemed responsible for complying with OSHA regulations at all. <em>Teal, 728 </em>F.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Accordingly, the first question to be answered is whether the Reeds are employers under the Act. OSHA defines employer as \u201ca person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(5). In the instant case, the uncontroverted facts are that Lynch was not an employee of the Reeds at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>accident and that the other workers on the site were independent contractors. It has been held that OSHA does not apply to an owner where the worker on the owner\u2019s property is an independent contractor and not an employee of the owner. <em>Cochran v. International Harvester Co. </em>(W.D. Ky. 1975), 408 F.Supp. 598; <em>see also Ellis v. Chase Communications, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1995), 63 F.3d 473, 478 (holding the \u201cmulti-employer doctrine\u201d of <em>Teal </em>inapplicable to a non-employer defendant whose status was \u201cno different than a property owner hiring a contractor to perform work on its property\u201d). <em>But see Williams v. Kopco </em>(D. Kan. 1995), 162 F.R.D. 670 (relying on <em>Teal </em>in holding that independent contractors are in the class of persons OSHA regulations were designed to protect). Given that <em>none </em>of the persons assisting Reed in the construction of the cabin was Reed\u2019s employee, Reed is not an \u201cemployer\u201d under OSHA. We therefore hold that OSHA was not applicable to the Reeds and thus did not have the force of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Likewise, ANSI requirements do not apply. Section 1.1 of the standards provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">This standard is intended to provide protection to persons in all places where there is danger of persons or materials falling through floor or wall openings, or <em>from </em>stairways, platforms, or runways. This standard applies to temporary or emergency conditions as well as to permanent conditions. It does not apply to construction work covered by American National Standard Safety Requirements for construction A10 Series, or to private residences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\">Thus, by its own terms, the ANSI standards do not apply to the construction at the Reeds\u2019 private residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Under the second test in <em>Runkle, </em>if standards do not have the force of law, they may still be admissible to show negligence if coupled with a showing that they are generally acceptable in the industry concerned. The Lynches argue that OSHA standards are generally acceptable in the construction industry and thus should have been admitted. We hold, however, that construction of an individual\u2019s private cabin undertaken by a non-commercial owner-builder is not part of the \u201cconstruction industry\u201d as a whole and therefore the District Court properly excluded evidence of ANSI and OSHA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The Lynches have failed to show that the District Court abused its discretion in precluding evidence of OSHA regulations and ANSI standards. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the Reeds\u2019 <em>motion in </em>limine nor in its other rulings excluding admission of these safety standards except as discussed in the next issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>3. Did the District Court err in denying the Lynches\u2019 motion for a new trial on the basis that they were denied an opportunity to fully cross-examine the Reeds\u2019 expert witness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial is the same as our standard for reviewing discretionary trial court rulings; that is, whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Hando v. PPG Industries, Inc. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 146, 149, 900 P.2d 281, 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">During direct examination, the Reeds\u2019 expert witness testified that the Reeds had met minimum safety standards. The court refused to allow the Lynches an opportunity to fully cross-examine the expert regarding that testimony. The Lynches claim that their cross-examination was unduly restricted in that they should have been allowed to cross-examine the expert regarding matters raised on direct examination and that they should have been allowed to examine the witness regarding the basis of his expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In relevant part, the direct examination of the Reeds\u2019 expert was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Q. Do you think that, and in your opinion, what the Reeds did would meet the minimum safety standards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">A. Yes, in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">Q. And what they did, is it customary in the industry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The Lynches contend that they should have been allowed to cross-examine the expert with regard to the opinion expressed during his direct examination. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a witness may be cross-examined on any subject raised or fact stated on direct examination.\u201d <em>Hando, </em>900 P.2d at 283; Rule 611(b)(1), M.R.Evid. Accordingly, the Lynches argue that they should have had the opportunity to fully cross-examine the Reeds\u2019 expert regarding his knowledge of \u201cminimum safety standards,\u201d including OSHA and ANSI, as they provide the minimum safety standards for the construction industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The Reeds claim that the Lynches were afforded an opportunity to fully cross-examine the Reeds\u2019 expert in regard to his statement regarding minimum safety standards. They point to the following questions and answers during the cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">Q. Mr. Walton asked you about minimum safety standards and whether those had been met in this case. What minimum safety standards are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>A. Well, I don\u2019t know if they would be actual minimum safety standards. It\u2019s kind of a common sense, case-by-case scenario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">Q. Well, when you answered Mr. Walton\u2019s questions, you apparently had an understanding of what minimum safety standards there were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">A. Well, I would consider any, any protection would be a, a safety standard. If you\u2019ve got one protection, it would be a minimum safety standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Q. Do you know that you erect a railing as a minimum safety standard on a floor hole opening like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The Reeds objected to this question and, outside the presence of the jury, the Lynches claimed that the door had been opened for them to inquire of the witness concerning \u201cminimum safety standards\u201d and that they could impeach the witness on his knowledge of OSHA standards. In response to the Lynches\u2019 argument, the court stated: \u2018You have the right to cross-examine him. You can ask him what he understands. You\u2019ve asked him that.... I made a ruling in regards to this OSHA thing, and I\u2019m going to stand by that decision ....\u201d After the bench conference, the Lynches\u2019 counsel continued with cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">Q. Clay, I think when we broke, we were talking about minimum safety requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">Q. And would you tell me, please what you mean when you say minimum safety requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">A. By minimum, would be just something to make something safer would be a minimum requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">Q. Okay. But your knowledge as to what are minimum safety requirements is based on your experience, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">The Reeds argue that the Lynches fully cross-examined their expert on what he meant by a minimum safety standard. They argue that the expert\u2019s definition of a minimum safety standard was entirely consistent with his opinion that the Reeds had met such a standard. We disagree. The witness was testifying as an expert on construction site safety standards. By stating that the Reeds had met <em>the </em>minimum safety standards, he opened the door to cross-examination on his knowledge of minimum safety standards in the industry, not simply on any one person\u2019s common sense perception of safety standards. \u201cMinimum safety standards\u201d implies something more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>than mere subjective determinations on a case-by-case basis. When the Reeds\u2019 expert testified as to \u201cstandards,\u201d he left the jury with the impression that the Reeds had complied with an objective, rather than a subjective, gauge. In the construction industry, the objective standards are embodied in the OSHA and ANSI regulations. The Lynches were prejudiced when the court denied them the latitude to cross-examine the expert about his knowledge of the safety standards in the industry. Due to the prejudice arising from this error, the Lynches are entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In order to avoid confusion as to our rulings on Issues two and three, we summarize the two holdings as follows: In Issue number two we held that OSHA and ANSI standards are not admissible to prove negligence in a case of an individual owner constructing his own home. However if, despite the inadmissibility of such evidence, the owner offers expert testimony that he did comply with \u201cthe minimum safety standards,\u201d then he has chosen to inject that issue into the case. Opposing counsel then must be afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the expert as to his understanding of those \u201cstandards.\u201d Thus, although evidence of the standards is not admissible against an owner-builder as substantive evidence of negligence, such evidence may be legitimate fodder for cross-examination depending upon the scope of the defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony. Due to the court\u2019s restricting of the cross-examination of the Reeds\u2019 expert, the jury was left with the impression that the Reeds had complied with \u201cthe minimum safety standards.\u201d This prejudiced the Lynches\u2019 case, and they are entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">4. Did the District Court err in denying the Lynches\u2019 motion for a new trial on the basis that their expert witness was not permitted to testify as to the basis of his expert opinions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The Lynches claim that they are entitled to a new trial because their expert was not permitted to testify regarding the basis of his expert opinions. While the Lynches\u2019 expert was permitted to base his opinion on OSHA, ANSI, and other applicable safety standards, he was not permitted to testify that those standards formed the basis of his opinion. The Lynches claim that Rules 703 and 705, M.R.Evid., provide that an expert may base his or her opinion on inadmissible evidence and may testify as to the basis of that opinion. While we agree that the Rules of Evidence allow an expert to base his or her opinion on inadmissible evidence, we do not agree that the rules mandate that an expert <em>testify </em>as to the basis of that opinion. Rule 703 provides that inadmissible evidence may be relied on by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>experts in forming their opinions and Rule 705 provides that experts <em>may </em>be required to disclose the facts or data underlying their opinions. As mentioned before, the admissibility of evidence must, in every case, be left largely to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Cech v. State </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 522, 531-32, 604 P.2d 97, 102; <em>Moen v. Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons\u2019 Co. </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 425, 655 P.2d 482. The trial court\u2019s discretion includes wide latitude in determining the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>Durbin, </em>916 P.2d at 767; <em>Cash v. Otis Elevator Co. </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 319, 332, 684 P.2d 1041, 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The Lynches\u2019 expert was allowed to testify as to the substance of OSHA and ANSI standards; he was merely prohibited from identifying the source of the standards. The Lynches\u2019 expert testified more than once that, in his opinion, safety practices that could have been undertaken by the Reeds included installing a guardrail around the opening, securing the plywood in place, or building a temporary floor. It was only when the expert identified those practices as \u201cstandard practices\u201d that the Reeds\u2019 counsel objected, and the court foreclosed the expert from identifying the specific standards. The Lynches\u2019 expert was not, as claimed by the Lynches, prevented from lending his special expertise to the issues before the jury. The jury was permitted to weigh the opposing opinions of the two experts and, therefore, the Lynches were not denied a fair trial on the basis of this alleged error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">5. Are the Lynches entitled to a new trial because of defense counsel\u2019s remarks regarding Neil Lynch\u2019s prior motorcycle accident?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The final pretrial order listed five legal issues the parties sought to have decided before the commencement of trial. The first issue was: \u201cWhether the fact of and settlement of litigation arising out of Neil Lynch\u2019s 1984 motorcycle accident should be excluded at trial.\u201d On the morning of trial the Lynches moved that no mention be made of \u201cthe facts and settlement of litigation arising out of Neil Lynch\u2019s 1984 automobile accident.\u201d When the Reeds\u2019 counsel inquired as to the scope of the motion and whether it included Lynch\u2019s receipt of disability benefits, the Lynches\u2019 counsel replied: \u201cIt\u2019s everything.\u201d The court excluded evidence of the settlement but left open the question of whether evidence of Lynch\u2019s resulting injuries might be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In cross-examining Lynch about his mental distress claim, the Reeds\u2019 counsel asked Lynch the following question, which was objected to by the Lynches\u2019 counsel: \u201cAnd you associated that mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>distress, however, not with this accident, but your motorcycle accident, correct?\u201d It is clear that this was a legitimate line of cross-examination relating to the nature of Lynch\u2019s motorcycle injuries, an issue which the court earlier had ruled would be handled as it came up. Therefore the Reeds\u2019 counsel did not violate the court\u2019s exclusionary rule as to the settlement of the motorcycle accident suit. We affirm the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">In summary, we hold that the District Court did not err in excluding evidence of OSHA and ANSI standards as substantive evidence of the Reeds\u2019 negligence in its order granting the Reeds\u2019 motion in limine. However, since the Reeds opened the door to the minimum safety standards during direct examination of their expert, the District Court abused its discretion in preventing the Lynches from fully cross-examining the Reeds\u2019 expert on these standards, and the Lynches are therefore entitled to a new trial. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
