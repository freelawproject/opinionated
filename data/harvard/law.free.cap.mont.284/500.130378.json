On June 26,1996, the District Court entered an opinion and order denying Defendant Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss both Count I, a charge of felony DUI, fourth offense, and Count II, a charge of driving while license suspended or revoked, a misdemeanor. From this opinion and order, Defendant Cooney appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">We restate the following issues raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Defendant Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I, a charge of felony DUI, fourth offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Defendant Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II, a misdemeanor charge of driving while license suspended or revoked?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">On December 16, 1995, Defendant Cooney (Cooney) was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Cooney\u2019s driving record indicated that he had previously been convicted of DUI in October 1984, September 1986 and July 1989. Additionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Cooney\u2019s driving record revealed that his Montana driver\u2019s license had been revoked on July 31, 1989, and had not been reinstated at the time he was arrested on December 16, 1995. On February 15, 1996, an Information was filed charging Cooney with felony DUI, fourth offense, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -714, MCA (1995), (Count I) and driving while license suspended or revoked, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (1995), (Count II). On February 23, 1996, Cooney entered pleas of not guilty to both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">On April 5, 1996, Cooney filed a motion to dismiss the charge of felony DUI, fourth offense (Count I), challenging the application of the felony DUI statute on <em>ex post facto </em>grounds and contending that his prior DUI convictions should have been expunged pursuant to the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA. The State filed a brief in opposition and Cooney filed a reply brief. While no transcript was filed on appeal, a minute entry indicates that on May 22, 1996, Cooney moved to change his pleas and entered a plea of guilty to Count I of the Information, reserving the right to appeal from an adverse ruling on his motion to dismiss. Additionally, Cooney made an oral motion to dismiss Count II of the Information asserting that the charge violated the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>legislation, which the District Court denied. Thereafter, Cooney also entered a plea of guilty to Count II, reserving the right to appeal the court\u2019s adverse ruling. On May 23, 1996, Cooney entered a written plea of guilty and waiver of rights. On June 26, 1996, the District Court entered an opinion and order denying both Cooney\u2019s motions to dismiss Count I and Count II. Subsequently, the District Court sentenced Cooney upon Count I to the Department of Corrections for a period of five years, suspending four years of the commitment upon certain conditions. As to Count II, the court imposed a concurrent sentence of six months. From the District Court\u2019s June 26, 1996 opinion and order, Cooney appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">A district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. State v. Brander </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 148, 150, 930 P.2d 31, 33 (citation omitted). Because the parties have raised no factual dispute concerning either Issue 1 or 2, we must only determine whether the District Court correctly interpreted the law when it denied Cooney\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I, a charge of felony DUI, fourth offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Section 61-8-714(5), MCA (1981), provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of this section if less than 5 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction. If there has been no additional conviction for an offense under this section for a period of 5 years after a prior conviction hereunder, then such prior offense <em>shall be expunged from, the defendant\u2019s record. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In 1989 the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, to provide that if, after five years, a defendant had no additional DUI convictions, the defendant\u2019s record would no longer be expunged, but rather the records and data relating to the prior DUI conviction would become confidential criminal justice information. <em>Brander, </em>930 P.2d at 33-34 (citing \u00a7 2, Ch. 476, L. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In 1995, the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 61-8-714, MCA, to include a felony sanction for repetitive DUI offenders, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">(4) <em>On the fourth or subsequent conviction, the person is guilty of a felony offense </em>and shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of not less than 1 year or more than 10 years and by a fine of not less than $1,000 or more than $10,000. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">In conjunction with this new subsection, the Legislature amended \u00a7 61-8-714(6), MCA, (formerly subsection (5)), to provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">(6) An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of sentencing if less than 5 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction, <em>unless the offense is the offender\u2019s fourth or subsequent offense, in which case all previous convictions must be used for sentencing purposes. </em>If there has not been an additional conviction for an offense under this section for a period of 5 years after a prior conviction under this section, then all records and data relating to the prior conviction <em>are confidential criminal justice information, </em>as defined in 44-5-103, and public access to the information may only be obtained by district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>order upon good cause shown. [First emphasis indicates newly added language; second emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In its June 26, 1996 opinion and order, the District Court denied Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of felony DUI, fourth offense, rejecting both Cooney\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>and expungement arguments. Relying on <em>State v. Maldonado </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 322, 578 P.2d 296, the District Court concluded that the application of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), did not violate the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation because Cooney was not being punished again for his past conduct, but rather he was being punished for an offense he committed two months after the effective date of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), and, therefore, was only subjected to increased punishment for his present conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The District Court also concluded that Cooney was not entitled to expungement of any of his three prior DUI convictions from his record. The District Court explained that Cooney\u2019s first two DUI convictions did not satisfy the expungement provision requirements of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, because after each of his first two DUI convictions he was convicted of another DUI offense before five years had elapsed. Additionally, relying on <em>State v. Lorash </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 345, 777 P.2d 884, the District Court explained.that Cooney was not entitled to have his July 31, 1989 DUI conviction expunged from his record because the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, had been repealed on October 1, 1989, and, therefore, was no longer available. Furthermore, citing <em>State v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 187, 606 P.2d 1343, and <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 299, 605 P.2d 1000, the District Court determined that the 1989 changes made in \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA (1989), were procedural or remedial in nature, and, therefore, the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation did not apply. Based on the foregoing, the District Court held that Cooney was properly charged with felony DUI, fourth offense, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Cooney argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge of felony DUI, fourth offense. While Cooney concurs with the State that, in light of <em>Brander, </em>this case should be remanded to the District Court, he still argues that the application of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), violated the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation and that all three of his prior DUI convictions should have been expunged pursuant to the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Cooney asserts that application of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), violates his right to be free from the application <em>of ex post facto </em>legislation, as guaranteed by Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 31 of the Montana Constitution. Specifically, Cooney contends that the application of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), violates the two part test used to determine whether a law is <em>ex post facto, </em>which we adopted in <em>State v. Leistiko </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 32,844 P.2d 97. First, Cooney asserts that \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), are retrospective because they alter the legal consequences of the DUI offenses he committed before the statute\u2019s effective date. Second, Cooney asserts that \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), are more onerous than prior law because they now allow consideration of prior DUI convictions which should have been expunged pursuant to the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In this regard, Cooney argues that the District Court also erred in concluding that Cooney was not entitled to have his three prior DUI convictions expunged from his record. Rather, Cooney contends that because the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, was the law in effect at the time he received each of his three DUI convictions, and because he had satisfied the expungement provision requirements, all three DUI convictions should have been automatically expunged. Cooney asserts that the purpose of the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, was to reward a defendant for not receiving a DUI conviction for a five-year period by expunging from the defendant\u2019s record <em>all </em>prior DUI convictions, not just the most recent. Cooney distinguishes <em>Infanger v. State </em>(Mont. 1997), 934 P.2d 1040, explaining that at no time did more than five years ever elapse between each of Infanger\u2019s DUI convictions and that three of his five DUI convictions were entered after the expungement provision had been repealed in 1989. In contrast, Cooney points out that, in the case at bar, all of his DUI convictions were entered at the time the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, was in effect and he did not receive another DUI conviction during the five-year period following his 1989 DUI conviction. Consequently, Cooney argues that both his 1984 and 1986 DUI convictions should have been expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Cooney also asserts that his July 31,1989 DUI conviction should have been expunged pursuant to the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA (1987), because more than five years elapsed before he received his present DUI conviction. Cooney argues that the District Court incorrectly relied on <em>Lorash </em>to conclude that Cooney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>was not entitled to have his 1989 DUI conviction expunged from his record because the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, had been repealed on October 1, 1989, and, therefore, was no longer available. Cooney contends that <em>Lorash </em>is not dispositive here because the expungement provision of \u00a7 46-18-204, MCA, the statute at issue in <em>Lorash, </em>required that a defendant make a motion to have his prior conviction expunged, whereas, the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, was self-executing.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Furthermore, Cooney disagrees with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that, based on <em>Coleman, </em>the repeal of the expungement provision in 1989 was only procedural in nature, and, therefore, not subject to the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation. Cooney claims that the District Court misinterpreted our decision in <em>Coleman. </em>Cooney instead contends that in <em>Coleman </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>arguments, not simply because the statutory changes were procedural, but also because the changes were ameliorative and did not deprive the defendant of any substantial right or immunity. Cooney also cites to <em>Weaver v. Graham </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17, arguing that even if a statute alters provisions accorded only by the grace of the legislature, it still violates the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation if the statute is retrospective and more onerous than prior law. Cooney asserts that here, unlike in <em>Coleman, </em>the 1989 changes to \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, applied retroactively to keep Cooney\u2019s three prior DUI convictions on his record as confidential criminal justice information, convictions that should have been expunged under the prior law, and, therefore, these changes were not ameliorative, but, rather, were more onerous than prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The State responds that our decision in <em>Brander </em>is dispositive, and, therefore, we should remand this case to the District Court for reconsideration of its decision in light of <em>Brander. </em>The State asserts that, in <em>Brander, </em>we rejected similar <em>ex post facto </em>arguments, holding that \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995), did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the federal or Montana constitutions. Therefore, the State argues that the District Court properly rejected Cooney\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claim. However, the State argues that, in <em>Brander, </em>we still held that the defendant was not properly sentenced under \u00a7 61-8-714, MCA (1995), because the defendant\u2019s 1986 DUI conviction should have been expunged in 1991 pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA (1985), and, therefore, the district court should not have considered this conviction when it sentenced the defendant for his 1995 DUI conviction. Consequently, the State essentially concedes that, based on our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>rationale in <em>Brander, </em>Cooney\u2019s July 31, 1989 DUI conviction should be expunged from his record. Yet, relying on <em>Infanger v. State </em>(Mont. 1997), 934 P.2d 1040, the State maintains that Cooney\u2019s 1984 and 1986 DUI convictions should not be expunged from his record because less than five years elapsed after each DUI conviction before Cooney received another, and, therefore, his first two DUI convictions were not eligible for expungement.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The State also asserts that in <em>Brander </em>we did not consider the effect of our decision in <em>Lorash </em>and did not expressly consider whether the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, created a substantive right or a procedural remedy. Therefore, the State suggests that we reconsider our decision in <em>Brander. </em>In the case at bar, the State argues that expungement is a procedural remedy, derived wholly from the statute authorizing it and may be extinguished by repeal of the statute. Furthermore, the State contends that our decision in <em>Lorash </em>implicitly recognizes the procedural or remedial nature of expungement. However, we note that the State retracted this argument in <em>State v. Bowles </em>(1997) [284 Mont. 490], 947 P.2d 52, and argued instead that in <em>Brander </em>we implicitly concluded that the expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA (1981), created a vested substantive right that may only be applied prospectively to \u201cprior\u201d DUI convictions occurring after October 1, 1981, the effective date of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">As to Cooney\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>arguments concerning \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA(1995), the State is correct that we rejected these same arguments in <em>Brander. </em>See <em>Brander, </em>930 P.2d at 33-35. Nonetheless, under our analysis in <em>Brander, </em>because more than five years elapsed after Cooney\u2019s July 31, 1989 DUI conviction before he received a subsequent DUI conviction, his 1989 DUI conviction should have been expunged from his record in 1994, pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA (1987). <em>See Brander, </em>930 P.2d at 35-37. However, as the State argues, Cooney\u2019s first two DUI convictions were never eligible for expungement pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, because at no time did more than five years elapse before Cooney received an additional DUI conviction. See <em>Brander, </em>930 P.2d at 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Furthermore, in <em>State v. Bowles </em>(1997), [284 Mont. 490], 947 P.2d 52, we distinguished <em>Lorash </em>based on the differences in the expungement provision requirements of \u00a7 46-18-204, MCA, the statute at issue in <em>Lorash, </em>and of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA(1981). Also, <em>in State v. Reams </em>(1997), [284 Mont. 448], 945 P.2d 52, we addressed the nature and scope of the repealed expungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>714(5), MCA (1981), explaining that we made no distinction in <em>Brander </em>as to whether this provision created a substantive or procedural right, but rather considered our decision in <em>Brander </em>better explained by the rationale referred to in <em>State v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 187, 606 P.2d 1343, and discussed in more detail in <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 34, 926 P.2d 712. Employing this same rationale in <em>Reams, </em>we concluded that any DUI conviction entered before October 1, 1989, the date the expungement provision was repealed, was automatically eligible for expungement if the elements of the ex-pungement provision of \u00a7 61-8-714(5), MCA, were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Consequently, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that Cooney was not subject to an <em>ex post facto </em>application of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-714(4) and (6), MCA (1995). However, again based on our decision in <em>Brander </em>as well as our decisions in <em>Bowles </em>and <em>Reams, </em>we hold that the District Court incorrectly concluded that Cooney\u2019s 1989 DUI conviction could be counted to support the present charge of felony DUI, fourth offense, and, therefore, the District Comb erred in denying Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we remand this issue for entry of an order dismissing the charge of felony DUI, fourth offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II, a misdemeanor charge of driving while license suspended or revoked?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">Section 61-2-107(1), MCA (1987), provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law of the state, a driver\u2019s license that has been suspended or revoked under 61-5-205 or 61-8-402 <em>may not be restored </em>until the driver has paid to the department a fee of $50 in addition to any other fines, forfeitures, and penalties assessed as a result of conviction for a violation of the traffic laws of the state. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In 1989, the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law of the state, a driver\u2019s license that has been suspended or revoked under 61-5-205 or 61-8-402 <em>must remain suspended or revoked </em>until the driver has paid to the department a fee of $50 in addition to any other fines, forfeitures, and penalties assessed as a result of conviction for a violation of the traffic laws of the state. [Emphasis indicates newly added language.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">In its June 26, 1996 opinion and order, the District Court denied Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II, a misdemeanor charge of driving while license suspended or revoked, in violation of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>(1995). The District Court rejected Cooney\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claim explaining that as indicated by the legislative history of the 1989 amendment to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, including the title of the 1989 Act that amended \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, as well as hearing testimony, the 1989 amendment to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, merely clarified that a license suspension or revocation remained in effect until the license reinstatement fee was paid, and, therefore, did not amount to a substantive change in the statute. Alternatively, the court determined that, even if the 1989 amendment changed the law, such a change related exclusively to a remedy or mode of procedure, and, therefore, Cooney still had no substantive right to rely on a one-year period of revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Cooney explains that his Montana driver\u2019s license was revoked for one year effective July 31,1989, the date of his third DUI conviction. Cooney asserts that under \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1989), his license remains revoked, whereas, under \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1987), the law in effect at the time of Cooney\u2019s conviction, the \u201crevoked\u201d status of his license would have been removed no later than when his license would have expired by its own terms, whether he paid the fee or not. Therefore, Cooney argues that the application of \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1989), violates the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation because \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1989), is clearly more onerous than prior law. Consequently, Cooney contends that, despite his failure to pay the required fee pursuant to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1987), his license would have simply expired by 1993, and, therefore, he should not have been charged with driving while license suspended or revoked, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The State responds that, under our rationale in <em>Brander, </em>the District Court properly rejected Cooney\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>argument because if, in fact, the 1989 amendments to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1987), did change the law, it did not change the consequences of Cooney\u2019s prior conduct, but rather put Cooney on notice of the consequences of any future violation of the law. Also, the State argues that the District Court properly concluded that the amendment was intended to clarify the law rather than change it substantively, and, therefore, did not violate the ban on <em>ex post facto </em>legislation. Consequently, the State asserts that under both versions of \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, Cooney was not permitted to avoid payment of the reinstatement fee after his license was revoked, regardless of how long he waited.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Based on our decision in <em>Brander, </em>we agree with the State that the District Court properly concluded that application of \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA(1989), did not violate the ban on ex <em>post facto </em>legislation because this statute does not change the legal consequences of Cooney\u2019s prior conduct. Furthermore, looking to the plain language of both the 1987 and 1989 versions of \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA, we conclude that the 1989 amendments to \u00a7 61-2-107(1), MCA (1987), merely clarified that a period of suspension or revocation continues until a defendant pays the required fee. Here, because Cooney had not paid this fee prior to December 16, 1995, the date of his arrest, the revocation of his license was still in effect, and, therefore, he was properly charged with violating \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (1995). Accordingly, we affirm that part of the District Court\u2019s June 26,1996 opinion and order denying Cooney\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II of the Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, HUNT, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
