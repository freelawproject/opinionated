On such appeal the following opinion was delivered bv TOWYSEYD, District Judge:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-9\">Ordinary unsized paper, produced from rags, and treated with sulphuric acid, after being- subjected to- two separate processes presents the appearance of parchment, is in fact parchment, paper, and is commercially known cither as \u201cparchment paper,\u201d \u201cparchment No. 3,\u201d or \u201cvegetable parchment.\u201d Paper made from wood pulp, subjected to only the single process of immersion in an alkaline solution, is commercially known either as \u201cimitation parchment paper,\u201d \u201cparchment No. 2,\u201d or \u201cgrease-proof wrapping paper.\u201d and is sometimes included, in commercial language, in the general class of parchment papers.\u2019 The article in question belongs to this second class. It was classified for duty under paragraph 308, Schedule 31, of the act of 1894, at 30 per cent., as parch-\u2019 ment paper. The importers protested, claiming that it was dutiable under, paragraph 3:13 or under paragraph 310 of sala act, as paper, or manufactures', of paper not specifically provided for. It is agreed that the single question, in the case is whether this imitation paper has acquired the commercial designation of \u201cparchment paper.\u201d The utmost that can bo claimed from the testimony is that it may be so included in a general class of parchment paper, but even this claim is doubtful. The great preponderance of the most trustworthy evidence shows that the commercial designation of said imitation parchment is not \u201cparchment paper.\u201d The decision of the board of general appraisers is therefore reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b727-10\">Hurry P.
