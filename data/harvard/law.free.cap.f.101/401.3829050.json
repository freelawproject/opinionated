In the presence of danger like that in question, the law requires reasonable conduct and reasonable action under the existing circumstances of the particular case. Whether the conduct and action 'were reasonable and in accordance with duty, or unreasonable and culpable, under the particular circumstances of a case like this, are ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tions of fact. The questions of fact relating to the situation, which involved, of course, the conduct of the child, the conduct of the station agent, and the conduct of the servants of the corporation in charge of the train, were submitted to the jury under prop\u00e9r instructions. Judgment of circuit court affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
