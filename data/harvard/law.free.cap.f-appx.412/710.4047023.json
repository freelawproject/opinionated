The Government declined to respond to Doyle\u2019s brief. The district court granted Doyle\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, reduced his offense level by two levels pursuant to Amendment 706, and modified his sentence to 360 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Doyle argues that the district court misapplied the guidelines range. He contends that his amended guidelines range should have been 292-365 months. Doyle also argues that he is entitled to resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). \u201cA district court \u2018abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 486-87 (5th Cir.2005). We review de novo the district court\u2019s \u201clegal determinations regarding the application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-19\">The district court reduced Doyle\u2019s offense level to 36, which, when combined with Doyle\u2019s Category V criminal history score, resulted in a guidelines range of 292-365 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A. However, the district court erroneously determined that Doyle\u2019s amended guidelines range was 324-405 months. Therefore, the court abused its discretion in the modification of Doyle\u2019s sentence. See <em>Smith, </em>417 F.3d at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-20\">In imposing the 360-month sentence, the district court indicated that it intended to impose a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range. Though the sentence imposed falls within the correctly calculated guidelines range, it is not in the middle of that range, so we cannot conclude that the error of law was harmless. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>390 F.3d 840, 846 (5th Cir.2004)(\u201cIn sentencing cases, the burden is on the government to show that absent the error, the sentence would have been the same.\u201d). The judgment is vacated and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Mueller, </em>168 F.3d at 189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-21\">Doyle\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a full resentencing is without merit. Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full re-sentencings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Moreover, the principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than the reduction allowed under \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Id.; United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b735-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
