Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Prior to <em>Booker, </em>we applied a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005). However, we need not decide the correct standard today because Ramos\u2019s revocation sentence is appropriate under either standard. <em>See id. </em>at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cThe district court has the discretion to order that a sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release run concurrently with or consecutively to other sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision to run the revocation sentence consecutive to the sentences on the underlying charges was authorized by statute and is preferred under the sentencing guidelines policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.3(f) &amp; comment, (n. 4). Additionally, the sentencing transcript reflects that the district court at least implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing Ramos\u2019s revocation sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
