On appeal, Cruz contends that the district court erred in the guidelines calculations. He asserts that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) based on two firearms that were found in the vehicle at the time of Cruz\u2019s arrest. Cruz maintains that he should not be held responsible because he had no knowledge that the weapons were present. The district court discredited the testimony presented by Cruz\u2019s supporting witness and concluded that Cruz either knew or should have known that the firearms were present in a vehicle used for a drug transaction. Contrary to Cruz\u2019s assertions, the presentence report included evidence showing that it was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the weapon was connected with the drug offense. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>31 F.3d 271, 277 (5th Cir.1994). The district court did not clearly err in imposing the firearms enhancement. <em>See United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-20\">The district court also denied Cruz a three-level reduction for acceptance of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>sponsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, after determining that Cruz had frivolously denied his involvement with the firearms enhancement. Cruz challenges this determination, asserting that he did not deny or minimize his involvement in the underlying offense and that the court should not penalize him for filing objections or for unspecified and unknown factors. The district court was entitled to consider the credibility of Cruz\u2019s witness and to reject his testimony about Cruz\u2019s knowledge of the firearm. <em>See United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996). In light of the court\u2019s determination that Cruz had falsely denied relevant conduct, the denial of the reduction was not without foundation. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(A)); <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tire limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
