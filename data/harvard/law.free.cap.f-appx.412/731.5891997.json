The IJ denied Izzatov\u2019s application after finding that he was not credible. The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision ordering Izzatov\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Izzatov maintains that, contrary to the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s findings, he presented credible testimony in support of his claims for relief from removal. The REAL ID Act (the Act) amended the standards for assessing credibility determinations in cases involving applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and other relief from removal filed after the Act\u2019s May 11, 2005, effective date. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(3), (c), (h)(2), Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302. As Izzatov filed his application for immigration relief after the Act\u2019s effective date, the new credibility standards apply in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Under the Act, an applicant\u2019s testimony, alone, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proving eligibility for asylum, \u201cbut only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that his testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). \u201c[A]n IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). On review, we defer \u201cto an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The IJ delineated four areas with which it based its adverse credibility determination. First, the IJ found Izzatov\u2019s allegation that all Uzbekistan citizens who became LPRs in another country are subject to imprisonment for treason upon their return to Uzbekistan inherently implausible. Second, the IJ determined that Izza-tov\u2019s written and oral statements concerning the stolen motorcycle incident were inconsistent. Third, the IJ determined that Izzatov\u2019s accounts of \u201cthe torture he suffered at the hands of the police were not sufficiently detailed to provide a coherent and plausible account of the basis of his fear.\u201d Lastly, the IJ found that Izza-tov \u201cwas unresponsive, vague or evasive in his response to several questions from the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Izzatov offers only bare assertions that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on incorrect and mistaken assumptions and speculation. This is insufficient to establish that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. After reviewing the record, and from the totality of the circumstances, it is not obvious that no reasonable factfinder could make such an adverse credibility ruling. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we will not disturb the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. <em>Id. </em>Without credible evidence, there was no basis on which to grant asylum, withholding or removal, or protection under the CAT. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907-08 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Izzatov\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
