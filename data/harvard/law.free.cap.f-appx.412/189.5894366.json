Martinez also challenges his 60-month consecutive sentence for using a firearm during a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Martinez argues that comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments constituted prosecutorial misconduct. We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cTo establish prosecutorial misconduct, (1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018When the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Martinez asserts that the government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when the prosecutor said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question based on the evidence you\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reasonable doubt whatsoever.... I think based on [the] evidence, as long as you keep your eye on the ball and don\u2019t let the defense lawyer distract you, which is his job.\u201d Martinez argues that this statement improperly injected the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion into the case and attacked defense counsel\u2019s character. We do not agree that this remark rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor\u2019s comment could also be characterized as an attempt to argue the weight of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Tisdale, </em>817 F.2d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1987) (concluding that prosecutor\u2019s remark\u2014\u201cI believe the government has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\u2014went to the weight of the evidence and was not improper). In any event, any problem regarding this comment was cured by the district court\u2019s instruction to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s statement. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>122 F.3d 1383, 1388-89 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Martinez also asserts that it was improper for the prosecutor to say: \u201c[I]f it wasn\u2019t a law enforcement investigation, who knows what might have happened. Thank God it was a law enforcement investigation this time and that there wasn\u2019t an actual victim.\u201d He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement improperly inflamed the jury. We reject this argument as well. \u201cThe prosecutor, as an advocate, is entitled to make a fair response to the arguments of defense counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Hiett, </em>581 F.2d 1199, 1204 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During his closing argument, defense counsel encouraged the jury to acquit Martinez because the robbery was a \u201cfictional situation.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s comment fairly responded to that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Martinez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on outrageous government conduct. A motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of outrageous government conduct involves a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1191 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Savage, </em>701 F.2d 867, 868 n. 1 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cOutrageous government conduct occurs when law enforcement obtains a conviction for conduct beyond the defendant\u2019s predisposition by employing methods that fail to comport with due process guarantees.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cUnder this standard, the conduct must be so outrageous that it is fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Haimowitz, </em>725 F.2d 1561, 1577 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cWhether outrageous government conduct exists turns upon the totality of the circumstances with no single factor controlling and the defense can only be invoked in the rarest and most outrageous circumstances.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The government\u2019s conduct in this case was within constitutionally permitted limits. The evidence in the record shows that Martinez was a willing and active participant in a scheme to rob a home believed to contain narcotics. The government\u2019s conduct in encouraging Martinez\u2019s co-conspirators to keep him involved in the scheme does not \u201cviolate[] fundamental fairness and shock[ ] the universal cause of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Costales, </em>5 F.3d 480, 487 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation marks omitted). The district court did not err in denying Martinez\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment based on outrageous government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Martinez also contends that the district court erred in refusing to give a jury instruction on entrapment. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1222 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Entrapment is an affirmative defense with two elements: \u201c(1) government inducement of the crime and (2) the defendant\u2019s lack of predisposition to commit the crime before the inducement.\u201d <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1178 (11th Cir.2007). Before an entrapment instruction may be presented to the jury, the defendant must show \u201csome evidence, more than a scintilla, that government agents induced him to commit the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d 1089, 1102 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Mers, </em>701 F.2d 1321, 1340 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cA defendant cannot avail himself of an entrapment defense unless the initiator of <em>his </em>criminal activity is acting as an agent of the government.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The record shows that Martinez was approached about the robbery by Duhart, a co-conspirator, and not a government agent. Although government agents encouraged Martinez\u2019s co-conspirators to keep him involved in the robbery scheme, there is no evidence in the record that he expressed reluctance to participate and that the scheme had to be \u201cpushed\u201d on him. <em>See Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d at 1178. Because no evidence exists to support a claim of entrapment, the district court properly denied Martinez\u2019s request to give an entrapment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Martinez also argues that the district court erred in imposing a consecutive 60-month sentence for his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), because the plain language of \u00a7 924(c) prohibits the imposition of consecutive sentences when the defendant is subject to a greater mandatory-minimum sentence for another offense. Because Martinez raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo establish plain error, [the defendant] must show that there was (1) error, (2) that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>plain, and (3) that affects his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Belfast, </em>611 F.3d 783, 815 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cIf all three requirements are met, we may reverse only if the error also seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Martinez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010), holding that \u201ca defendant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23; <em>see also United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that the plain language of \u00a7 924(e) requires consecutive sentences for a defendant convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) offense and an underlying drug crime). No error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">. In <em>Bonner v.
