Mota-Rivera was sentenced to a term of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the end of that term \u2014 September 23, 2014, according to Mota-Rivera \u2014 he is to be removed to his native Mexico. Mota-Rivera, however, does not want to wait until then; he filed this mandamus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 in the United States District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on April 26, 2010, demanding that he be immediately removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The District Court dismissed the mandamus petition. It rejected Mota-Rivera\u2019s reliance on <em>Soler v. Scott, </em>942 F.2d 597 (9th Cir.1991), and explained that <em>Soler\u2019s </em>holding was superseded by the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-416, 108 Stat. 4305. <em>See Campos v. INS, </em>62 F.3d 311, 313-14 (9th Cir.1995). The District Court also based its decision on <em>Perez v. INS, </em>979 F.2d 299 (3d Cir.1992), in which we held that \u201ca prisoner cannot by mandamus or any other medium compel INS to deport her prior to the completion of her custodial sentence.\u2019 \u201d 979 F.2d at 301 (quoting <em>Medina v. United States, </em>785 F.Supp. 512, 514 (E.D.Pa.1992)). Mota-Rivera appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The District Court\u2019s denial of mandamus relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Arnold v. Blast Intermediate Unit 17, </em>843 F.2d 122, 125 (3d Cir.1988). We may summarily affirm a judgment of the District Court if the appeal does not present a substantial question. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We conclude that this is such an appeal, as Mota-Rivera\u2019s request for relief under \u00a7 1361 is clearly foreclosed by our holding in <em>Perez. </em>Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
