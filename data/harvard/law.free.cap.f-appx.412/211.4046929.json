United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing, namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the ... Guidelines [sentence] range, we ordinarily ... expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence must establish that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and alteration omitted). We reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc) </em>(quotation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Our review of a sentence for \u201csubstantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). <em>Id. </em>at 1324. \u201cA district court\u2019s sentence need not be the most appropriate one, it need only be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">Appellant fails to demonstrate that his sentences are substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The sentences are at the lower end of the Guidelines sentence range of 87 to 108 months. Moreover, they fall well below the statutory maximum penalty of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment for each count. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (concluding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum). The sentences also meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). In particular, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>trict court expressed concern regarding the \u201csubstantial\u201d quantity of cocaine involved \u2014 four kilograms at one point \u2014 and appellant\u2019s previous conviction for drug trafficking. In sum, because the sentences at issue are reasonable and supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, they are</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
