For the reasons that follow, we will vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>On March 1, 2010, Propst filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He alleges that, on July 18, 2008, while incarcerated at the State Correctional Institute at Graterford, he slipped in the shower and injured his ankle and back. He claims to have alerted prison officials of the danger posed by the shower\u2019s tile floor, but the problem was not remedied. At some later date, he was transferred to Fayette. He alleges that medical staff at Fayette did not give him proper medical attention for the injuries sustained at Graterford. He named as defendants several prison officials, including those in charge of safety and maintenance at Graterford, as well as members of the medical staff at Fayette. The District Court sua sponte dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. It did not give Propst an opportunity to amend, nor did it find that amendment would be futile. Propst appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">A district court shall dismiss a complaint by a plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis if the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). However, before proceeding with such a dismissal, the district court must grant the litigant leave to amend the complaint unless any amendment would be inequitable or futile. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 106 (3d Cir.2002). Here, at least with regard to the denial-of-medical-treatment claim, granting leave to amend would not have been inequitable or futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">An inmate making an Eighth Amendment claim on the basis of the denial of medical treatment must show \u201c(1) that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to [his or her] medical needs and (2) that those needs were serious.\u201d <em>Rouse v. Plantier, </em>182 F.3d 192, 197 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). Propst alleged that his fall caused arthritis, sharp pains, and stiffness in his ankle, and aggravated a preexisting back problem, causing sharp pains in his lower back and leg, and that the defendants refused to provide adequate medical treatment for these injuries. \u201cIf \u2018unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 results as a consequence of denial or delay in the provision of adequate medical care, the medical need is of the serious nature contemplated by the eighth amendment.\u201d <em>Monmouth Cnty. Corr. Institutional Inmates v. Lanzaro, </em>834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 103, 97 S.Ct. 285). The District Court concluded that Propst\u2019s alleged injuries did not meet the constitutional standard. To the extent that the District Court meant that Propst has not alleged serious medical needs, we disagree. <em>See Woloszyn v. Cnty. Of Lawrence, </em>396 F.3d 314, 320 (3d Cir.2005). But even if we did agree, it is not clear from Propst\u2019s allegations that amendment would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The District Court may, however, have simply meant that Propst has not sufficiently alleged deliberate indifference, i.e., that the defendant \u201cknew of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health and safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The allegations in Propst\u2019s complaint may not satisfy that standard, but they do not suggest that allowing him to amend would be futile. Propst should have been given the opportunity to amend his complaint to show whether he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>establish that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Accordingly, we will vacate the decision of the District Court and remand for further proceedings. Propst\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim is plenary. <em>Umland v. PLANCO Fin. Serv., Inc., </em>542 F.3d 59, 63-64 (3d Cir.2008). Summary action is warranted if an appeal presents no substantial question. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
