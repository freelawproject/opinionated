Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). Prior to service on the defendant, the district court dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition concluding that Stewart did not meet the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s findings of facts are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-26\">In this case, the district court limited the application of <em>Santos </em>to cases of illegal gambling. The district court did not have the benefit of this court\u2019s contrary reasoning in <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391, 402-04 (5th Cir.2010), when it reached this conclusion. Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal of Stewart\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED to determine whether, consistent with <em>Garland, </em>his claim falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-27\">Stewart\u2019s motion for release pending appeal is DENIED. <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-29\">. Accordingly, the recent amendment to this statute defining \"proceeds\u201d to include \"gross receipts of such activity\u201d is not in contention. 18 U.S.C. 1956(c)(9)(2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
