This court declines to consider these claims. <em>See Jennings v. Owens, </em>602 F.3d 652, 657 n. 7 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Johnson does not challenge the district court\u2019s holding that, to the extent that he attempts to prove an alibi for the time during which he was convicted of selling cocaine, it is barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, he has waived any challenge to that holding. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">With regard to the dismissal of his substantive claim that no search warrant had been issued, we affirm on the alternative ground that this claim, too, is barred by <em>Heck </em>because, by Johnson\u2019s own admissions, it necessarily challenges the validity of the convictions for which he is currently incarcerated. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>United States v. McSween, </em>53 F.3d 684, 687 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995). Johnson\u2019s motion for appointment is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
