He first challenges the district court\u2019s determination that because the offense involved between 6 and 24 aliens, a three-level increase in offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(A) was warranted. We review the district court\u2019s finding for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 362 (5th Cir.2010). When, as here, the factual finding is based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>district court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of a witness, this court will find clear error only if it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>See United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 356 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The district court\u2019s determination that Mendoza transported 10 aliens in his pickup truck was based on a credibility finding in favor of the material witness over that of Mendoza. Because Mendoza has not shown that a mistake was committed, no clear error has been shown. <em>See Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Mendoza also challenges the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), which states that: \u201cIf the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person, increase by 2 levels, but if the resulting offense level is less than level 18, increase to level 18.\u201d The court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) is reviewed de novo and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Solis-Garcia, </em>420 F.3d 511, 514 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In <em>United States v. Cuyler, </em>298 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir.2002), this court determined that a defendant who transported four aliens in the bed of a pickup truck created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. The court reasoned that unsecured aliens riding in the bed of a pickup could easily be injured in the event of \u201can accident or other driving maneuver of the sort that is unavoidable in highway driving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mendoza has not shown his case to be distinguishable from <em>Cuyler. </em>Although Mendoza traveled only a short distance with the unsecured aliens, the potential for an accident still existed. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Mendoza\u2019s conduct created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. <em>See Cuyler, </em>298 F.3d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
