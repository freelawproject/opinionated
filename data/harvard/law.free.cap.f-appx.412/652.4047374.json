He avers that he will be persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group, i.e., his family unit. Ramos alleges that members of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS) gang pursued him to obtain information about the location of his cousin, a former member of the gang. He contends that he was beaten and threatened by MS members on several occasions after he failed to disclose information about his cousin and that MS members continue to be interested in his location for purposes of locating his cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal for substantial evidence and will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). To qualify for withholding of removal, the alien \u201cmust demonstrate a \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). At a minimum, there must be some particularized connection between the feared persecution and the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). To establish that he is a member of a particular social group, Ramos must show that he shares a common immutable characteristic that he cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to his individual identity or conscience. <em>See Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Ramos was targeted because of MS\u2019s general interest in locating his cousin rather than due to his membership in his family unit is supported by substantial evidence. Put differently, the record does not compel the conclusion that Ramos was targeted by the MS due to his membership in a particular social group. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
