For the reasons stated below, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Singh filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that her sister and David C. Harrison, an attorney, stole $18 million from her. The District Court granted Singh\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>and dismissed her complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-19\">Our review of the record reveals no error in the District Court\u2019s analysis. The District Court construed Singh\u2019s complaint as seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and properly dismissed the claim. A review of Singh\u2019s Complaint and her filings before this Court reveals no allegation giving rise to a plausible inference that Defendant David C. Harrison, a private attorney, acted under color of state law or conspired with state actors to deny Singh her constitutional rights. Accordingly, Singh cannot recover under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Great Western Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159, 175-76 (3d Cir.2010) (holding that \u201c[t]o prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant acted under color of state law, in other words, that there was state action.\u201d); <em>see also Reichley v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>427 F.3d 236, 245 (3d Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are satisfied that any amendment to Singh\u2019s Complaint would have been futile, and thus the District Court properly dismissed without leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-20\">As the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment below. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-16\">. In her complaint, Singh did not specify that her cause of action was brought under \u00a7 1983. To the extent that her complaint was not filed pursuant to that statute, the District Court lacked jurisdiction over her claim as there is no diversity of citizenship among the parties. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
