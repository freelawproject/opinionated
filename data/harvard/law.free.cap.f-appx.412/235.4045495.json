He brought this lawsuit against the Attorney General under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>alleging that his superiors at FCI discriminated against him in his employment on account of his race, white, and that they retaliated against him after he complained about the discrimination. The claims grew out of an incident that occurred on October 9, 2005, when a black Lieutenant, Abdul Rushdan, prevented Rainey from handcuffing a black inmate by grabbing Rainey\u2019s arm and telling him to turn the inmate loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">The Attorney General denied liability, and the case was tried to a jury. At the close of Rainey\u2019s case, the district court granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law on both of Rainey\u2019s claims. Rainey now appeals the final judgment entered pursuant to the court\u2019s rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo, </em>drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1356 (11th Cir.2004). Where no \u201clegally sufficient evidentiary basis\u201d allows a \u201creasonable jury to find\u201d for the nonmoving party on an issue, a district court may properly grant judgment as a matter of law as to that issue. <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotations omitted); Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">Title VII makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race [or] col- or....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a); <em>Bass v. Bd. Of County Com\u2019rs, Orange County, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1103 (11th Cir.2001). A federal employee may bring a cause of action alleging racial discrimination under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16. Where direct evidence of discrimination is not available, a Title VII plaintiff may present circumstantial evidence of discrimination sufficient to create a jury question. <em>EEOC v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">In reviewing Title VII claims supported by circumstantial evidence, we use the three-step burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). First, a plaintiff must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, </em>296 F.3d at 1273. To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, the plaintiff can show that: (1) he is a member of a protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ed class; (2) he was subject to an adverse employment action; (3) his employer treated similarly situated employees outside of his protected class more favorably than it treated him; and (4) he was qualified to do the job. <em>Id. </em>As to the element of adverse employment action, the plaintiff must show a \u201cserious and material change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2001). We use an objective standard when assessing whether the employment action was \u201cserious and material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">When a plaintiffs poor performance evaluation and compensation are \u201cinextricably intertwined,\u201d a lower performance evaluation can constitute an adverse employment action in the racial discrimination context. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 971-72 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). However, when a lower performance evaluation does not result in a \u201closs of pay or benefits or further discipline,\u201d it does not constitute an adverse employment action. <em>Davis, </em>245 F.3d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Rainey did not proffer evidence sufficient at trial sufficient to show that he suffered an adverse employment action. The handcuffing incident involving Lt. Rushdan, an email directive from a superior, Captain Serrano, following that incident, and a voluntary referral of the matter to the agency\u2019s Employee Assistance Program all had no material effect on the terms, conditions, or privileges of Rainey\u2019s employment. Rainey\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case therefore fails; the jury lacked a \u201clegally sufficient evidentiary basis\u201d to find for him on his racial discrimination claim, and the district court was therefore obliged to terminate the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">To successfully establish a claim of retaliation, a Title VII plaintiff must make out a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>See Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 970 (discussing elements of <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation). The plaintiff may show: (1) he engaged in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) he suffered adverse action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Adverse action is broader in the retaliation context than in the racial discrimination context. <em>Id. </em>at 973-74 (citing <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006)). As to retaliation, adverse action is action that \u201cmight have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 970 (citing <em>White, </em>548 U.S. at 68, 126 S.Ct. at 2415).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">While the jury traditionally should decide whether a defendant\u2019s actions are sufficiently adverse, \u201cpetty and trivial\u201d actions by the defendant are not sufficiently adverse. <em>Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 974 n. 13 (citation omitted). An unfavorable performance review that affected a plaintiffs eligibility for a merit pay increase constitutes sufficiently adverse action in the retaliation context. <em>Id. </em>at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Rainey failed to show adverse action. It is unlikely that, taking into account all of the alleged incidents individually or collectively, a reasonable employee, standing in Rainey\u2019s shoes, would have felt dissuaded from filing a complaint of discrimination. As such, Rainey\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case fails, and the district court properly granted judgment as a matter of law on Rainey\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
