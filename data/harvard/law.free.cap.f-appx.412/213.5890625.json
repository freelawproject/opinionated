Lopez argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by the record, and argues that he suffered persecution from gangs in Guatemala on account of his religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Because the BIA\u2019s opinion in this case did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review only the BIA\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We review administrative fact findings under the substantial evidence standard, and must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if, viewing the evidence and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the decision, it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84; <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We will reverse a finding of fact by the BIA only where the record compels reversal, not where it merely supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Under the REAL ID Act, a trier of fact may, \u201c[e]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility determination on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\u201cthe demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (codifying the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101, 119 Stat. 302). Inconsistent statements and contradictory evidence are cogent reasons that can support an adverse-credibility finding. <em>Matter of S-M-J, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722, 729 (BIA 1997). An adverse credibility determination does not excuse the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). However, as long as all the evidence submitted by an applicant is considered, the IJ does not need to specifically address every piece of evidence presented. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). But, the weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Under the INA, the Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country where it is more likely than not that the alien\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In the case of an application for withholding of removal, a showing of past persecution on a protected ground generally raises a rebuttable presumption that the alien \u201chad a \u2018well-founded fear of future persecution,\u2019 \u201d and shifts the burden to the government to show that conditions in the country have changed, or that the alien could avoid a future threat through relocation. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien must demonstrate that his fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>jectively reasonable. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c[T]he objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">To qualify for protection under the CAT, Lopez must establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon repatriation. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is \u201cany act by which pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In this case, substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that Lopez\u2019s testimony was not credible. Lopez\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal did not mention any persecution on account of his religion, and he testified at trial that he feared harm from the gangs because he was not a member. Lopez also presented no evidence that the Guatemalan government consented or acquiesced to the harm he allegedly suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
