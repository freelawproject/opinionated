We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">Weeks argues that he should be released from the Master Settlement Agreement because his attorney at the time coerced him into enrolling in the agreement. He contends that Merck interfered with his attorney\u2019s professional judgment by imposing an obligation on all counsel representing plaintiffs that were parties to the Master Settlement Agreement to (1) recommend settlement to all clients, and (2) withdraw from representing clients who refused participation in the Master Settlement Agreement. He therefore concludes that the district court erred when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>reviewed his consent to enter into the Master Settlement Agreement based on contract law, rather than examining Weeks\u2019s right to conflict-free counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">\u201cA settlement agreement is a contract,\u201d which is interpreted by reference to state law. <em>Dore Energy Corp. v. Prospective Inv. &amp; Trading Co. Ltd., </em>570 F.3d 219, 225 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cPublic policy favors compromise agreements and the finality of settlements.\u201d <em>Red River Waterway Comm\u2019n v. Fry, </em>36 So.3d 401, 407 (La.Ct.App.2010); <em>see also Jackson v. N. Bank Towing Corp., </em>213 F.3d 885, 889 (5th Cir.2000). Under Louisiana law, \u201c[c]onsent may be vitiated by error, fraud, or duress.\u201d La. Civ.Code art.1948. Weeks alleges no facts suggesting that he argues either error <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or duress,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> leaving only fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\u201cFraud is a misrepresentation or a suppression of the truth ... [and] may also result from silence or inaction.\u201d La. Civ. Code art.1953. \u201cFraud does not vitiate consent when the party ... could have ascertained the truth without difficulty ... [unless] a relation of confidence has reasonably induced a party to rely on the other\u2019s assertions or representations.\u201d La. Civ.Code art.1954. Weeks cannot demonstrate fraud because his attorney did not conceal or misrepresent her relationship\u2014 such as it was \u2014 with Merck. The Master Settlement Agreement contained the provisions about which Weeks complains, and he received a full copy of the agreement to review before he signed the consent. <em>See Martin v. JKD Invs., LLC, </em>961 So.2d 575, 578 (La.Ct.App.2007) (no fraud where plaintiff did not read the document). And, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Weeks\u2019s other allegations of fraud on the part of his attorney are true \u2014 which the district court did not find \u2014 they would be insufficient under Louisiana law to vitiate an agreement between Weeks and Merck. <em>Smith v. Frey, </em>703 So.2d 751, 753 (La.Ct.App.1997) (fraud perpetrated by an attorney not sufficient to rescind agreement where remaining parties to compromise agreement not aware of the fraud). Weeks\u2019s consent was voluntary and thus valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">. The Louisiana Code chapter covering vices of consent does not define error, but states that \"[e]rror vitiates consent only when it concerns a cause without which the obligation would not have been incurred and that cause was known or should have been known to the other party.\u201d La. Civ.Code art.1949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-20\">. \u201cConsent is vitiated when it has been obtained by duress of such a nature as to cause a reasonable fear of unjust and considerable injury to a party's person, property, or reputation.\u201d La. Civ.Code art. 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
