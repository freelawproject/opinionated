Plaintiff asserted that the decision not to hire him was in retaliation for previous EEOC complaints he filed against previous employers. The defendant produced evidence that the reason plaintiff was not hired was because he had been terminated by another police department due to misconduct brought to light by an internal affairs investigation and the previous employer had listed him as \u201cno rehire\u201d. The defendant also produced evidence that it had a firm policy in effect that any applicant who had been terminated and listed as \u201cno rehire\u201d would be automatically disqualified for employment with DISD.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The summary judgment evidence fully supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that this automatic disqualification from employment was the cause in fact of the defendant\u2019s \u201cno hire\u201d decision and retaliation was not a cause of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">For the above reasons, together with the reasons advanced in the district court\u2019s careful opinion of February 2, 2010, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
