He argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), that application of the career offender enhancement overstated the seriousness of his offense, and that his background, age, medical conditions, and family responsibilities warranted a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We review Arias\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for abuse of discretion because he preserved this issue before the district court. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Because the district court imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable, and this court \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Arias\u2019s assertions are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, he has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence at the bottom of the advisory sentencing guidelines range. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
