The district court determined that McCaskiirs excessive force and failure to protect claims were barred pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and that his remaining claims were frivolous. McCaskiirs motion to proceed IFP is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). We ask only whether the appeal involves legal points that are not frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-21\">McCaskill fails to offer any challenge to the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. Instead, he argues that the denial of IFP was erroneous because the district court cited its prior decisions in this case in support of its determination that the appeal does not present a nonfriv-olous issue. It is permissible for a \u201cdistrict court to incorporate by reference its decision[s] dismissing the prisoner\u2019s complaint on the merits ... to fully apprise [this court] of the reasons for its certification,\u201d as the district court did in this case. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 21. Although we liberally construe pro se briefs, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). McCaskill\u2019s failure to address the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal does not involve a nonfrivolous issue has the same effect as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>McCaskill has failed to show that his proposed appeal raises a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). McCaskill is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b707-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
