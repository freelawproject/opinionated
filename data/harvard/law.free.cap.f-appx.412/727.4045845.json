Bahena contends his within-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In that regard, Bahena asserts: the unlawful-reentry guideline is not empirically based and effectively double counts his prior conviction; he is prejudiced by a disparity between sentencing districts that employ \u201cfast track programs\u201d (providing decreased sentences to defendants who agree to quick guilty pleas) and the one in which he was sentenced that does not have that program; and his sentence fails to account for his history, circumstances, and motives for returning to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The substantive reasonableness of the within-Guidelines sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">As Bahena concedes, his assertion that the Guideline on which his sentence was based, \u00a7 2L1.2, is unsupported by empirical data and effectively double counts his prior conviction is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009) (rejecting defendant\u2019s contention that because his unlawful-reentry offense effectively double counted his previous crime and was unsupported by empirical data, the presumption of reasonableness did not apply); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009) (sentence enhancement pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, following conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 for unlawful reentry, is afforded presumption of reasonableness despite such not being empirically based). He raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">Similarly, Bahena concedes as foreclosed his assertion about the district in which he was sentenced lacking a \u201cfast track\u201d program. <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-63 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A]ny sentencing disparity resulting from fast track disposition programs is not unwarranted [within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(6)] as the disparity was also intended by Congress\u201d.). He raises this issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">Bahena\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not suffice to show error. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. The district court considered, and rejected, Bahena\u2019s bases for a sentence below the advisory Guidelines sentencing range. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3558(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Even if our court would have considered imposing a different sentence, that would be \u201cinsufficient to justify reversal of the district court\u201d. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
