In the body of his complaint, he alleged that on June 8, 2010, bank employees closed his recently opened student checking account. Attached to the complaint is a June 2, 2010 letter from the bank informing Bridgeforth that his account would be closed if the bank did not receive a signed signature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>form and opening deposit by June 14, 2010. Bridgeforth stated that, on June 4, 2010, he submitted a deposit (reflected on an attached bank statement) and the \u201cimportant information documented on the new account form\u201d (apparently including his signature, which appears on the attached document). For the \u201cbreached agreement\u201d and \u201cintentional infliction of emotional distress\u201d that Bridgeforth purported to have suffered, he requested thirty million dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The District Court dismissed Bridge-forth\u2019s complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), and held that amendment would be futile. Bridgeforth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We have jurisdiction over Bridgeforth\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the dismissal of his claims. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). We review the denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lum v. Bank of Am., </em>361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On review, we will dismiss Bridgeforth\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) because it does not have an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). As the District Court concluded, Bridgeforth could not sue the defendants under \u00a7 1983 because they are not state actors. <em>See West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). Furthermore, Bridgeforth stated no plausible federal claim for relief. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>-U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Because Bridge-forth presented no actionable federal claim, the District Court did not err in declining to consider any state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c); <em>De Asencio v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 301, 311 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In short, the District Court did not err in dismissing Bridgeforth\u2019s complaint as frivolous. The District Court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Bridgeforth leave to amend on the basis of futility. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 112-13 (3d Cir.2002). We will dismiss this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
