The district court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Williams\u2019s claims. On appeal, Williams argues that the district court erred in dismissing her case prior to trial. The court \u201cshall\u201d dismiss an in forma pau-peris case \u201cat any time\u201d after determining that it is frivolous. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Williams also appears to argue that the district court should have appointed her an attorney. She has failed to show exceptional circumstances warranting such an appointment. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">Before this court, Williams\u2019s claims about the lack of a trial and the conduct of the defendants show no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the appeal is frivolous and is DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Additionally, Williams\u2019s motion for extraordinary relief is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
