On appeal, the Ras-mussens advance' five theories as to why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the district court\u2019s holdings must be reversed. After careful review of the record, we reject these arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The Rasmussens first argue that the district court\u2019s entry of a default judgment was too harsh a sanction for their failure to comply with three district court Orders. We review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Samaniego, </em>345 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2003). Rule 16(f) sanctions are \u201cdesigned to punish lawyers and parties for conduct which unreasonably delays or otherwise interferes with the expeditious management of trial preparation.\u201d <em>Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985). Rule 16(f) provides for sanctions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">(1) In General. On motion or on its own, the court may issue any just orders, including those authorized by Rule 37(b) (2) (A) (ii) \u2014 (vii), if a party or its attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">(A) fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial conference;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">(B) is substantially unprepared to participate \u2014 or does not participate in good faith \u2014 in the conference; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">(C) fails to obey a scheduling or other pretrial order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">(2) Imposing Fees and Costs. Instead of or in addition to any other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses \u2014 including attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f). Under Rule 37, the district court may, among other sanctions, render a default judgment against the disobedient party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(A)(vi). However, in order to impose the severe sanction of a default judgment, the district court must make a finding of willful or bad faith failure to comply. <em>Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., </em>987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th Cir.1993). The district court must also find that lesser sanctions are not sufficient. <em>Cohen v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., </em>782 F.2d 923, 925 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Here, the record plainly supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Rasmus-sens\u2019 violations of three court orders amounted to willful and sanctionable conduct. Specifically, the Rasmussens failed to provide an adequate accounting, failed to participate in the drafting of a joint final pretrial stipulation, and failed to attend the final pretrial conference. The Rasmussens now claim that these errors do not constitute sanctionable conduct because they were merely negligent and because they were caused by Rasmussens\u2019 counsel, not the Rasmussens themselves. But these arguments are belied by the record, which reveals that the Rasmus-sens are experienced litigants who closely monitor and direct their attorneys\u2019 performance. Moreover, the Rasmussens personally provided and annotated the inadequate records they supplied during the failed accounting. In the face of such direct participation, the district court was entitled to conclude that the Rasmussens\u2019 conduct necessitated sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">The district court also concluded that a default judgment was the only possible sanction that would further the interests of justice. These twin findings \u2014 willful bad faith conduct that cannot be deterred by lesser sanctions \u2014 are sufficient under our precedent to support entry of a default judgment. <em>See Malautea, </em>987 F.2d at 1542. Accordingly, the district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>not commit an abuse of discretion in sanctioning the Rasmussens with entry of a default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The Rasmussens also contend that the district court erred in refusing to impose sanctions against CFC\u2019s counsel for statements, made in e-mails between the parties\u2019 counsel \u2014 in which she observed that the Rasmussens may have engaged in criminal misconduct. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s ruling on a request for sanctions under its inherent authority. <em>See Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cCourts have the inherent authority to control the proceedings before them, which includes the authority to impose reasonable and appropriate sanctions.\u201d <em>Martin v. Automobili Lamborghini Exclusive, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 1332, 1335 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). In order to exercise its inherent power to award sanctions, the court must find that a party acted in bad faith. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion, because the Rasmussens have not shown any bad faith associated with the e-mails sent from CFC\u2019s attorney. Nor, have the Rasmussens substantiated their argument that CFC threatened imminent criminal prosecution if the Rasmus-sens refused to settle. Rather, the emails contain generic statements as to the severity of the underlying dispute. The district court\u2019s decision not to sanction these generic statements was thus sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">We turn next to the Rasmussens\u2019 contention that the district court was not permitted to award monetary damages to CFC for Count 1 of their counterclaim, because in that count, CFC requested only an accounting, rather than an accounting and applicable monetary damages. As support, the Rasmussens point to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(c), which states that \u201c[a] default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings.\u201d This argument fails, however, because an action for an accounting is an equitable remedy for which monetary relief is appropriate. <em>See Phillips v. Kaplus, </em>764 F.2d 807, 813 (11th Cir.1985). Indeed, an accounting is expressly defined as \u201c[a] legal action to compel a defendant to account for <em>and pay over </em>money owed to the plaintiff but held by the defendant.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 21 (9th ed.2009) (emphasis added). Therefore, Rule 54(c) did not prohibit the district court from awarding monetary damages to CFC because its request for an accounting and a judgment included such an award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The Rasmussens also contend that CFC lacked standing on Count 2 of its counterclaim, which sought to compel the Rasmus-sens to return converted property to the CFC. The Rasmussens aver that the CFC is an improper recipient of this property, because of testimony implying that the property in question was owned by a third party. Alternatively, they argue that the district court erred by <em>sua sponte </em>awarding custody of the property to CFC when CFC never requested such relief. They contend that, under the doctrine of election of remedies, CFC elected to seek monetary damages for the conversion of the property at the evidentiary hearing, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>therefore was estopped from seeking the return of the property itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Although issues of standing are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>we must accept as true the facts contained in CFC\u2019s complaint. <em>Eagle Hosp. Physicians, LLC v. SRG Consulting, Inc., </em>561 F.3d 1298, 1307 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cA defendant, by his default, admits the plaintiffs well-pleaded allegations of fact, is concluded on those facts by the judgment, and is barred from contesting on appeal the facts thus established.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>see also Dermer v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>599 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Under this standard, the district court properly concluded that CFC had standing to recover the property it alleged had been converted. CFC alleged it was properly assigned any rights not already possessed in the disputed property, and accepting this allegation as true, it was plainly entitled to litigate for its recovery. <em>See Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co., L.P. v. APCC Servs., Inc., </em>554 U.S. 269, 285, 128 S.Ct. 2531, 171 L.Ed.2d 424, 437-38 (2008) (\u201cLawsuits by assignees, including assignees for collection only, are \u2018cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Nor can the Rasmussens find any help in the doctrine of election of remedies. To the extent that doctrine even applies, its role is to limit double recovery. <em>See Barbe v. Villeneuve, </em>505 So.2d 1331, 1332 (Fla.1987) (\u201cThe election of remedies doctrine is an application of the doctrine of estoppel and operates on the theory that a party electing one course of action should not later be allowed to avail himself of an incompatible course ... The purpose of the doctrine is to prevent a double recovery for the same wrong.\u201d (citation omitted)). But CFC did not recover any monetary damages as a remedy for the converted property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The face of CFC\u2019s counterclaim makes clear that it expressly requested return of the allegedly converted property, and after finding that CFC possessed the rights to that property, the district court properly ordered its return. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Lastly, the Rasmussens argue that the district court erroneously admitted into evidence a notebook containing notes from committee meetings in which Scout financing matters were discussed. Specifically, the Rasmussens claim that this notebook is barred under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a), because CFC did not disclose its existence during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Millennium Partners, L.P. v. Colmar Storage, LLC, </em>494 F.3d 1293, 1301 (11th Cir.2007). Under Rule 26(a), a party must disclose, without awaiting a discovery request, any tangible item \u201cthat the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1)(A)(ii). Failing to disclose any item required by Rule 26(a) results in that party not being allowed to use that item during the proceedings, \u201cunless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">The district court did not err in admitting the notebook\u2019s contents into evidence. As an initial matter, the Rasmus-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>sens do not argue that the notebook itself constituted inadmissible evidence, or was unreliable. Therefore, they have abandoned this issue. <em>Marek, </em>62 F.3d at 1298 n. 2. The sole issue, then, is whether CFC was required to disclose the notebook under Rule 26(a)(l)(A)(ii). Here, no such disclosure was required because, after Palma Rasmussen testified that the Scouting committee voted in favor of reimbursing her, CFC offered the notebook into evidence for purposes of impeaching that testimony. Because the notebook was used solely for impeachment, previous disclosure was not required. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\">. Because the Rasmussens do not contest the amount of damages awarded, they have foreclosed our review of this issue. <em>See Marek v. Singletary, </em>62 F.3d 1295, 1298 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995) (\"Issues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. The district court did however award monetary damages as compensation for CFC\u2019s separate and distinct claim for an accounting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
