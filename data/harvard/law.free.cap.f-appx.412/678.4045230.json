Sori-ano-Torres argues that the guidelines sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because his sentencing guidelines range was determined by \u201cdouble counting\u201d his prior conviction which was used to calculate his offense level and his criminal history, resulting in an improper application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Soriano-Torres did not object or argue in the district court that U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2L1.2 resulted in impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d or that his sentence was unreasonable. Therefore, these arguments are reviewable only for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-29, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">We have previously rejected the argument that because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 allows consideration of prior convictions to determine offense level and criminal history, it results in unjust double counting rendering the sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 6). Sori-ano-Torres makes no other argument as to why his sentence is unreasonable. He has shown no error, plain or otherwise. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
