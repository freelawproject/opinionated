Alexander appeals from the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of her application for Social Security disability benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Alexander brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security that she was not disabled, and hence was not entitled to benefits, under the Social Security Act. In her application for benefits, Alexander alleged that she was disabled due to hypertension and neck and back pain. Her application was denied by an administrative law judge (ALJ) on March 20, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Council denied her request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s determination the final decision of the Commissioner. Alexander then brought this action under \u00a7 405(g) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, overruled Alexander\u2019s objections to it, and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Alexander timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Alexander was not disabled, we consider only whether the ALJ applied the proper legal standards and whether the decision to deny benefits was supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Audler v. Astrue, </em>501 F.3d 446, 447 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). \u201cWe may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We \u201cmay only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">The Commissioner conducts a five-step sequential analysis in evaluating disability claims. In this analysis, the Commissioner determines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkbM\">whether (1) the claimant is presently working; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) the impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in appendix 1 of the social security regulations; (4) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other substantial gainful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-15\"><em>Audler, </em>501 F.3d at 447-48. At the first four steps, the claimant has the burden of showing that she is disabled; at the fifth step, the Commissioner has the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>showing \u201cthat there is other substantial work in the national economy that the claimant can perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448. \u201cA finding that a claimant is disabled or is not disabled at any point in the five-step review is conclusive and terminates the analysis.\u201d <em>Lovelace v. Bowen, </em>813 F.2d 55, 58 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Alexander\u2019s arguments on appeal pertain to the ALJ\u2019s findings at the fourth and fifth steps of the analysis. At the fourth step, the ALJ found that Alexander was \u201cable to perform sedentary work,\u201d albeit with certain \u201climitations.\u201d Among these limitations were that she could \u201cnever stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl.\u201d These findings were based on medical records including a \u201cPhysical Residual Functional Capacity Assessment [which] was completed by a State Agency medical consultant on October 10, 2006.\u201d The ALJ also took into account Alexander\u2019s testimony, but found that her \u201cstatements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of [her] symptoms [were] not credible to the extent they [were] inconsistent with the residual functional capacity assessment.\u201d The ALJ found that Alexander had \u201cpast relevant work as a retail teller/cashier, production technician, sewing machine operator, work order technician, bench jewelry technician, and accounting clerk.\u201d The ALJ explained that a \u201cvocational expert classified [Alexander\u2019s] past work as light and sedentary, and semiskilled/skilled in nature. Accordingly, [Alexander] is unable to perform some of her past relevant work.\u201d However, at this point in his opinion, having concluded that Alexander was unable to perform <em>some </em>of her past relevant work, the ALJ did not specifically state which past jobs she could or could not perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">A finding, at the fourth step, that Alexander\u2019s impairments did <em>not </em>prevent her from performing some of her past relevant work ought to have resulted in the conclusion that Alexander was not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(c)(1) (\u201cIf we find that your residual functional capacity is not enough to enable you to do <em>any </em>of your past relevant work, we will ... decide if you can adjust to any other work.\u201d); <em>Smith v. Astrue, </em>278 Fed.Appx. 395, 398 (2008) (unpublished) (\u201cThe negative result at step four required a finding of \u2018not disabled.\u2019 \u201d). Such a conclusion should have brought the ALJ\u2019s sequential analysis to an end. <em>Lovelace, </em>813 F.2d at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">However, the ALJ instead continued to the fifth step of the analysis. At this step, he found that \u201c[considering [Alexander\u2019s] age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that [she] can perform.\u201d The ALJ noted that Alexander did not have \u201cthe residual functional capacity to perform the full range of sedentary work\u201d because she had additional physical limitations. Therefore, \u201c[t]o determine the extent to which these limitations erode the unskilled sedentary occupational base, the [ALJ] asked the vocational expert whether jobs exist in the national economy for an individual with [Alexander\u2019s] age, education, work experience, and additional functional capacity.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The vocational expert responded that such an individual \u201cwould be able to perform the requirements of representative occupations such as work order technician (sedentary-semiskilled); bench jewelry technician (sedentary-semiskilled); and accounting clerk (sedentary-skilled).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">All three of those occupations \u2014 work order technician, bench jewelry technician, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>and accounting clerk \u2014 were among those included in Alexander\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d in the ALJ\u2019s findings at step four. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s findings at step five supplemented and clarified the findings at step four, in which the ALJ determined that Alexander was unable to perform <em>some </em>of her past relevant work but did not specify which past relevant work she was still able to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The ALJ made a procedural error by combining the fourth and fifth steps of the sequential analysis. However, when an ALJ makes a procedural error in denying disability benefits, \u201cwe must still determine whether [the] error was harmless.\u201d <em>Audler, </em>501 F.3d at 448 (citing <em>Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 334 (5th Cir.1988)). \u201c\u2018Procedural perfection in administrative proceedings is not required\u2019 as long as \u2018the substantial rights of a party have not been affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir.1988)). \u201c[P]rocedural improprieties ... will therefore constitute a basis for remand only if such improprieties would cast into doubt the existence of substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>864 F.2d at 335; <em>see also January v. Astrue, </em>400 Fed.Appx. 929, 932-33 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (\u201c[T]here is \u2018no realistic possibility that, absent the error,\u2019 the ALJ would have reached a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d (brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Enriquez-Gutierrez v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 400, 407 (5th Cir.2010))).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Here, the ALJ\u2019s failure to clearly distinguish between the fourth and fifth steps of the sequential analysis was a harmless error that did not affect Alexander\u2019s substantial rights. The ALJ found that although Alexander\u2019s impairments prevented her from performing some of her past relevant work, she still had the residual functional capacity to perform some of that work \u2014 namely, the occupations of work order technician, bench jewelry technician, and accounting clerk. These findings were sufficient for the ALJ to conclude, at the fourth step of the analysis, that Alexander was not disabled, and end the analysis there. Alternatively, the same findings also supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion at the fifth step that Alexander was capable of performing \u201cjobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy\u201d and was therefore not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Alexander argues that the ALJ\u2019s finding that she had the residual functional capacity to work as a work order technician, bench jewelry technician, or accounting clerk was predicated on an inaccurate hypothetical question which the ALJ posed to the vocational expert during the hearing. The ALJ asked the vocational expert whether jobs existed in the national economy for a person of Alexander\u2019s age, with her education, work experience, and physical limitations; however, the ALJ neglected to mention one of her physical limitations, namely her inability to stoop. Nonetheless, this inaccuracy does not mean that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The vocational expert testified that a person with the characteristics given in the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question could work as a work order technician, bench jewelry technician, or accounting clerk as those jobs are defined in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles {\u201cDOT\u201d), </em>a publication of the United States Department of Labor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>DOT </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>states that none of those three jobs require stooping. Thus, if the ALJ had posed a hypothetical question that included the inability to stoop, the vocational expert\u2019s response would have been the same. This minor omission by the ALJ does not warrant reversal because it does not \u201ccast into doubt the existence of substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>864 F.2d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Alexander\u2019s briefs seem to suggest that the ALJ should have been bound to find that she was disabled at the fourth step of the analysis because of a sentence in a letter titled \u201cNotice of Disapproved Claims,\u201d issued by a regional commissioner of the Social Security Administration. This letter denied Alexander\u2019s claim at the initial stage of review, prior to the ALJ\u2019s adjudication of the claim. The sentence reads, \u201cWe realize that your condition prevents you from doing <em>any </em>of your past work, but it does not prevent you from doing work which requires less physical effort.\u201d (emphasis added). However, Alexander cites no authority establishing that the ALJ should have been bound by this letter. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.905 (\u201cAn initial determination is binding <em>unless you request a reconsideration </em>within the stated time period, or we revise the initial determination.\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Alexander also relies on a ruling of the Social Security Administration which states that \u201c[a] <em>complete </em>inability to stoop would significantly erode the unskilled sedentary occupational base and a finding that the individual is disabled would usually apply.\u201d SSR 96-9p, 1996 WL 374185 (July 2, 1996). However, SSR 96-9p says only that a finding of disability \u201cwould <em>usually </em>apply\u201d; it does not say that whenever a claimant has a complete inability to stoop, such a finding is automatically required at the fourth step. In this case, the ALJ found that Alexander was capable of performing some of her past relevant work notwithstanding her inability to stoop. The ALJ\u2019s decision was not contrary to SSR 96-9p, and it was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Finally, Alexander contends that the ALJ\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]ransferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability\u201d amounted to a finding that she was \u201cunskilled.\u201d She argues that such a finding would be inconsistent with the finding that she could perform the \u201csemiskilled\u201d and \u201cskilled\u201d occupations of work order technician, bench jewelry technician, and accounting clerk. However, this argument misstates that ALJ\u2019s findings. The ALJ merely concluded that under the regulations, it did not matter whether Alexander\u2019s job skills were transferable to new occupations. He did not make a finding that Alexander was unskilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">In summary, although the ALJ made an error by failing to clearly distinguish between the fourth and fifth steps of the sequential analysis, that error does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>warrant reversal. Alexander has not shown that the error affected her substantial rights. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Alexander still had the functional capacity to perform some of her past work, and that she was therefore not disabled for purposes of the Social Security Act, was supported by substantial evidence in the record. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\">. Alexander\u2019s opening brief indicates that she is currently receiving disability benefits, as of March 21, 2008, as a result of a subsequently filed application which was successful. At issue in this appeal is the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny her benefits prior to that date, pursuant to her initial application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-5\">. As the district court put it: \"The ALJ appears to have simultaneously asked the vocational expert whether [Alexander] could have performed any of her past work (step four) and whether she could perform any work that exists in the national economy (step five).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\">. An ALJ's determination of whether a claimant can perform his or her past relevant work \"may rest on descriptions of past work as actually performed or as generally performed in the national economy.... ALJs may take notice of job data in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(\u2018DOT\u2019), which reflects the exer-tional requirements of a job as performed in the national economy.\u201d <em>Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1022 (5th Cir.1990) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(d)(1)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">. As the district court noted, \"the statement upon which [Alexander] relies was not made by a State agency, medical or psychological consultant, or any other program physician or psychologist.\u201d Alexander\u2019s brief describes the letter as coming from a \"State Agency.\u201d However, the letter itself indicates that it comes from the Social Security Administration, a federal agency, but that it is based on a decision made by \"trained staff\u201d who \"work for the state.\u201d Alexander\u2019s brief seemingly contends that Dr. Charles Lee, who performed a residual functional capacity assessment on her, made the determination that she could not perform any of her past work. But she does not point to anything in Dr. Lee\u2019s report that supports this. At any rate, even if a state agency did find that Alexander was unable to perform any of her past work, \u201d[t]he findings of a state agency are not binding on the ALJ.\u201d <em>Reyes v. Sullivan, </em>915 F.2d 151, 154 (5th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Richardson v. Bowen, </em>807 F.2d 444, 448 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
