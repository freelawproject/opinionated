Following a formal hearing, an Administrative Law Judge issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law that were affirmed by the Benefits Review Board in a careful opinion. Petitioners argue that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were not supported by substantial evidence and that the ALJ used the wrong statutory provision to calculate the employee\u2019s average weekly wage. Finding no error, we AFFIRM essentially for the reasons given by the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
