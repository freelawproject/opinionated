Smith first filed his complaint on March 5, 2010. To the extent this complaint articulated any grievance, it appeared to claim that Smith\u2019s incarceration has been orchestrated via a far-reaching conspiracy \u2014 all in an effort to obtain \u201ckickbacks\u201d for various governmental officials by deliberately misspelling his name on court filings. Smith offered nothing in support of this bizarre claim. Smith failed to provide addresses for the seventy-one named defendants and, in an order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) dated March 31, 2010, Smith was directed to file an amended complaint that complied with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">On April 16, 2010, Smith filed a motion to amend his complaint as well as an amended complaint. In his motion to amend, Smith omitted all of the previously named defendants, and instead proceeded pursuant to the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA) against the United States alone. The amended complaint consisted of a list of various statutes, as well as <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), pursuant to which Smith sought relief, along with records of various administrative grievances and appeals. Neither his motion to amend nor the amended complaint \u2014 nor any of Smith\u2019s numerous other filings \u2014 provided clear factual allegations regarding any claim. The District Court dismissed Smith\u2019s claims in September, 2010, holding that he failed to assert a claim upon which relief could be granted and that further amendment would be futile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See Mitchell v. Horn, </em>318 F.3d 523, 530 (3d Cir.2003). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Our review of the record reveals no error in the District Court\u2019s analysis. Dismissal is proper if a party fails to allege sufficient factual matter, which if accepted as true, could \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Under even the most generous reading, Smith\u2019s filings do not do so. The District Court was therefore correct to dismiss the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">We are satisfied that any further amendment to Smith\u2019s Complaint would have been futile, and thus the District Court properly dismissed without leave to amend. <em>See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">As the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment below. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-18\">. Smith filed an earlier, related appeal from the March 31, 2010 order, <em>see </em>C.A. No. 10-2025, which was dismissed for failure to timely prosecute as Smith failed to pay the requisite filing fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-22\">. In an order dated May 12, 2010, the Magistrate Judge to whom this matter was assigned denied Smith's motion for appointment of counsel. This was not error. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, 6 </em>F.3d 147, 158 (3d Cir.1993). For the same reason, Smith\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
