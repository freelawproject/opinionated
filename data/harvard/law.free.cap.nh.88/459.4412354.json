It follows that our consideration is limited to the deed dated January 27, 1930, purporting to be from Zanase <em>alias </em>Athenase Belisle to the defendant Horace E. Belisle.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">With respect to this deed the plaintiffs make two separate allegations. In the first place they contend that it cannot operate as a conveyance of the property at all because it was executed by a complete stranger to the title, and, in the second place, they contend that if it was a conveyance of the property then they are entitled to have it set aside because it was executed for the purpose of deceiving and \u2022defrauding the grantor\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The demurrer of the defendant \u201cis regarded as an admission ... of the truth of all material statements of fact contained in the bill which \u2022are well pleaded, but not of the inferences or conclusions of law which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the plaintiff has seen fit to incorporate therein.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Mathewson, </em>73 N. H. 242. It does not admit allegations which are not well pleaded <em>(Pearson </em>v. <em>Tower, </em>55 N. H. 36, 38) and the allegation that the conveyance of January 27, 1930, was \u201cmade for the purpose of deceiving and defrauding creditors,\u201d being an allegation of fraud couched in general terms, is bad on demurrer. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Company, </em>68 N. H. 340; <em>Berlin &amp;c. </em>Ass\u2019n v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of Berlin, </em>87 N. H. 80, 81, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">This defect, however, might be cured by amendment under leave of the court. P. L., c. 334, s. 9; <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Tower, supra; Stockwell </em>v. <em>Stockwell, </em>72 N. H. 69. But, even if such an amendment should be offered and allowed, the plaintiff\u2019s position would not be improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Conveyances made for the purpose of defrauding creditors are not void; they are only voidable <em>(Stockwell </em>v. <em>Stockwell, supra; Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>70 N. H. 47, and cases cited) but they can be avoided only by creditors injured thereby (P. L., c. 361, s. 4), or, under certain circumstances, by the grantor\u2019s administrator acting in their behalf. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>72 N. H. 569, 570, 571, and cases cited. The parties to the fraudulent transaction, being <em>in pari delicto, </em>are left by the law in the position in which they have placed themselves <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>13 N. H. 53; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>47 N. H. 532; <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>83 N. H. 124, 134, and cases cited), and since \u201cAn heir takes through \u2014 not from \u2014 his ancestor,\u201d <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Lee, supra, </em>571) his position is not more favorable than that of his ancestor. <em>White </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>23 N. H. 128; <em>Upton </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>55 N. H. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 bill does not properly aver that the deed of January 27, 1930, was not that of the record owner of the premises even though it was not executed by him but by one \u201cwho had no title to the said property whatsoever.\u201d Cyrille A. Belisle, the one who is alleged to have signed the record owner\u2019s name to that instrument, may have been acting as an authorized agent for that purpose (P. L., c. 213, s. 1) or he may have affixed the grantor\u2019s name in his presence and at his request. 18 C. J. 190. In either of these situations the deed would be that of the record owner and would be a valid conveyance of the property. Upon this ground the heirs may have the relief which they seek only by showing that the deed was a forgery and this has not been alleged. It follows that, as the bill stands, the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\n<em>Demurrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
