Ahern, <em>Adm\u2019x v. </em>Eldrebge Brewing Company, Inc.</parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Hughes &amp; Burns {Mr. Burns </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-6\"><em>Arthur E.

H. 392, and also that it occurred in the course of his employment. The vital issue in this case is whether it \u201carose out of\u201d his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The court in the above quoted finding rejected the medical testimony of the plaintiff to the effect that Mr. Ahern\u2019s death was caused by asphyxiation by carbon dioxide gas, and adopted the conclusion of the medical referee that it resulted from coronary thrombosis. This term denotes the plugging of the coronary artery by a blood clot which, in itself, is a sufficient and common cause of death. The court\u2019s finding postulates a preexisting condition of this kind, although the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended strongly to disprove it, which was aggravated by excitement and strain. The conclusion that a master should be charged with liability to pay compensation upon the ground that the conduct of his servant aggravated an existing pathological condition which was, in itself, an adequate cause for the servant\u2019s subsequent death, is one which does not readily command acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The plaintiff does not attempt to defend the finding of the court upon the theory of aggravation, but rather upon the theory of causation. It is argued that \u201cthe evidence is conclusive that the coronary thrombosis from which it is claimed the deceased did die, was accidental in that it resulted from a strain on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>deceased in attempting to escape or extricate himself from the presence and effect of carbon dioxide gas.\u201d The theory upon which this argument rests was set forth in the questions propounded by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the medical experts, of which the following are typical:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">From the testimony of Dr. Luce: \u201cQ. Now assume, Doctor, that Mr. Ahern had coronary trouble or heart trouble and he didn\u2019t know it and never showed any symptoms of it and went into this tun under the conditions as I have described to you and was overcome or affected by this gas and attempted to go out of that tun by means of the ladder and this ladder slipped out of place, what effect would that have and whether or not that would produce a strain which would cause coronary thrombosis and death? A. It would.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">From the testimony of Dr. Gray: \u201cQ. Assume Mr. Ahern was suffering from coronary thrombosis or heart trouble and he went down into the tun and came in contact with the gas and in his struggle to get out he attempted to climb that ladder and the ladder slipped away from the wall as it did with Mr. Primmerman and precipitated him down into the tank again, would that have produced a strain on his heart which would cause coronary thrombosis? A. It might cause it. Q. And it probably would? A. Not necessarily. Q. Well it could? A. It could, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">More fully stated, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that Mr. Ahern reached the bottom of the vat in safety; that he then stooped over to unscrew the brass plug and thus brought his face in contact with the carbon dioxide gas which was collected in the lower part of the tun; that upon discovering the presence of the gas, he became excited and hurriedly attempted to get out of the tun by climbing the ladder; that in so doing, he pulled the ladder away from the wall and was precipitated to the bottom of the vat again, and finally that the resulting strain produced the thrombosis from which he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The trouble with this argument is that the case is bare of evidence of what Mr. Ahern's movements were after he started to enter the tank. The theory of the defendant that he died on his way down the ladder as \u00e1 result of the thrombosis finds quite as much support in the evidence as the plaintiff\u2019s theory that he fell while on his way up the ladder and suffered a strain which caused the thrombosis. The absence of all physical evidence of a struggle and the composed manner in which his body lay on the floor of the tank, lends color to the defendant's theory. The plaintiff\u2019s argument is obviously suggested by the testimony of Mr. Primmerman, and is in substance that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>deceased may be found to have reacted in precisely the way that Primmerman did, to the presence of gas in the tun. This is pure speculation if for no other reason than that it assumes as a fact that the deceased reached the floor of the tun in safety, a point upon which the evidence is silent. Under these circumstances the conclusion of the trial court that \u201csaid death . .. arose out of. . .the deceased\u2019s employment\u201d cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">This case is governed by the rule that a trier of fact cannot be permitted to determine by guess or conjecture between two equally probable causes of an injury, for only one of which the defendant is responsible. <em>Deschenes </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>69 N. H. 285. The issue here differs materially from that in <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Larochelle, </em>74 N. H. 433, where death resulted from chloroform and there was evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence in the method of administration. It was there held that the question of causal negligence was properly submitted to the jury, although there was evidence that \u201cthe mere administration of chloroform to persons in a certain rare and obscure pathologic condition is sufficient to cause death.\u201d We do not question the soundness of the conclusion reached in that case to the effect that \u201cwhere the injury is a natural and probable result of the negligence charged, a wrongdoer 'cannot set up as an answer to the action the bare possibility of a loss if his wrongful act had never been done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ib. </em>435; <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Company, ante, </em>273. We think, however, that the present case is governed by the more general rule, to which reference is also made in the same opinion, that where the evidence discloses no connection between the injury and the alleged cause except a bare possibility that the former resulted from the latter, there is nothing for the jury where it is also possible that the injury may be due to other causes. <em>Deschenes </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra; Dame </em>v. <em>Company, </em>71 N. H. 407; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Company, </em>73 N. H. 126; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>76 N. H. 446, 447; <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>79 N. H. 502; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 246, 249. Some evidence tending to establish not only the possibility but also the probability that excitement and strain resulting from an encounter with suffocating gas aggravated a preexisting physical condition and thereby caused Mr. Ahern\u2019s death, was, under the theory of the trial court, a necessary element of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and in the absence of such evidence, the finding in his favor cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-7\">Page, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
