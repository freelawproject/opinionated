The plaintiff had issued to this corporation a liability insurance policy in which was incorporated by indorsement the provisions of Laws 1927, c. 54. The policy contained the following provision: \u201cThis policy does not cover ... any liability of the Renter or Driver in respect of injuries . . . sustained by any person while riding in or alighting from, or getting into or upon any of the automobiles insured hereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Although the \u201cMotor Vehicle Liability Policy\u201d prescribed by chapter 54 is defined in section 1, paragraph ii, as a policy which must provide indemnity to the insured and to any person operating the car with the insured\u2019s express or implied consent \u201cagainst loss by reason of liability to pay damages to others\u201d for injuries accidentally sustained \u201cby any person\u201d other than employees of the insured who are entitled to benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, this definition is to be read in connection with section 6, which provides that the Insurance Commissioner \u201cshall approve a form of policy which contains,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe limits of liability.\u201d This section has been interpreted to mean that the commissioner may approve the issuance of a policy as conforming to the requirements of chapter 54 in which \u201cspecial uses calling for special rates\u201d are excluded from coverage. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Company, </em>86 N. H. 93, 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">From this it should not be inferred, however, that a certificate attesting the issuance of such a policy may, as the plaintiff seems to contend, be accepted by the court \u201cas sufficient security,\u201d within the meaning of section 4, for a liability arising out of any such special use. For although \u201cThe legislation did not contemplate full protection\u201d <em>(Raymond </em>v. <em>Company, supra), </em>its purpose was to induce motor-vehicle operators to provide security to persons injured by their negligence <em>(American Mut. &amp;c. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>87 N. H. 374, 376; <em>American Motorists &amp;c. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rush, ante, </em>383), and the only form of policy which will, in all cases, secure to an assured immunity from what the plaintiff terms \u201cthe drastic provisions\u201d of section 3 (the furnishing of security on penalty of suspension of license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and registration) is a policy which embraces the broad coverage of the motor vehicle liability policy described in section 1, paragraph n.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The exclusion in the present case does not deprive the general public of the protection afforded by the extension of indemnity to one who is responsible for the operation of an automobile with the owner\u2019s express or implied consent, but merely excepts from coverage the liability of the renter or driver of the car for injuries occasioned a special class of persons; namely, his passenger-guests. This limit of liability, if approved by the commissioner, is valid, but since there is nothing in the record to indicate whether such approval has or has not been obtained, no judgment can be rendered herein until this fact has first been determined by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">If the commissioner has not approved the exclusion as a proper limit of liability under the authority conferred on him by section 6, such exclusion is contrary to the provisions of chapter 54 and is therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
