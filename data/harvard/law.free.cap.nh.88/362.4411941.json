P. L., c. 336, s. 27; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>72 N. H. 448, 449 and cases cited. This fact was found by the trial court and his finding is not reviewable here. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Davis, supra. </em>There was, therefore, no error in his ruling that the testimony of Mrs. Chagnon as to \u201cmatters Mr. Menancon could contradict if living,\u201d should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">This ruling destroyed whatever basis there may have been for the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the statute of limitations did not bar any por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>tion of his claim because \u201cthe evidence discloses a mutual account.\u201d There is no other evidence upon which the existence of such an account could be found, and it must, therefore, be held that the statute bars all items in the specification which accrued more than six years before the death of the testator, which occurred in February, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The ruling which excluded the testimony of Mrs. Chagnon as to \u201cmatters Mr. Menancon could contradict if living\u201d did not affect the admissibility of the entries in the account books which she identified. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lucy, </em>83 N. H. 160, 162 and authorities cited. A large number of these entries, commencing in July, 1924 and continuing down to 1930, furnished evidence upon which a verdict for the plaintiff might properly be found. Furthermore, one item in the specification amounting to $300 for a second-hand truck sold by the plaintiff to the decedent, was fully supported by the testimony of Roger Chagnon, a son of the plaintiff, whose competency as a witness was unquestioned. The plaintiff\u2019s exception to the order of nonsuit must, therefore, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The motion of the plaintiff that he be allowed to testify was apparently bas\u00e9d upon the theory that, since his wife was a party in interest, it followed that he was not. This is a complete <em>non sequitur. </em>His interest is equally plain, and the ruling excluding his testimony was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-8\">Page J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
