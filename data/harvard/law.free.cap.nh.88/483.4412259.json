L., <em>c. </em>334, s. 9), and although they have retroactive effect. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brockway, </em>87 N. H. 342, 343. There, as here, \u201cThe action was brought within the prescribed time, and when brought it became amendable at any time during its pendency.\u201d <em>Ib., </em>343.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The case is unlike that of <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>81 N. H. 24, which holds that new parties to a suit become such only from the time they are served with process. What has been done as to other parties cannot affect new ones. But as to a party, he is one from the time suit against him is commenced, and he is then sued for such matters as the declaration, or amendments thereof granted to prevent injustice, may show.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">The inquiry whether an amendment is necessary to prevent injustice \u201cis a discretionary question of fact for the trial court not reviewable here except in cases\u201d where abuse of discretion is claimed. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Thompson, 87 </em>N. H. 270, 271. Here the evidence on which the finding rested is not transferred, and the question of abuse of discretion is therefore not presented by the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
