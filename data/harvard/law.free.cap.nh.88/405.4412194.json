Opposite a group of houses on the south side of the road, in the vicinity of the Gordon mills, a bank seven feet high and nineteen feet in length drops down sharply to within six feet of the north lane of concrete. Before the construction of this cement thoroughfare in 1931, children had been accustomed in winter to slide down this bank, crossing the old road and coming to a stop in the yard of one of the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">They were sliding there at noon on the-day of the accident. \"Quite a crowd\u201d of them, perhaps ten in all, were standing on the south side of the highway watching for automobiles. The plaintiff, who was only six years old, started to slide, when he heard the warning shouts of the other children. He tried to stop the sled by dragging his feet but was unable to bring it to a stop until it reached the northerly edge of the cement. He was there struck by the defendant\u2019s car, which was proceeding eastward toward Sunapee.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The defendant testified that, as he approached the point in question, he could hear the children \u201chollering and playing, sort of flocking around there,\u201d but that the windows of his car were \u201cprobably nearly closed\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear any words distinctly\u201d; that from what he could see or hear there was nothing to indicate to him that a child was \u201ccoming down the other side\u201d; that he veered to the left because of the children and then \u201csaw this boy coming at a tremendous speed down the hill,\u201d and that he immediately put on both brakes and brought his car \u201cto a standstill\u201d just as the plaintiff \u201cslid the sled\u201d into his left front wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">There was testimony to the effect that a person lying on the bank near the spot where the plaintiff began to coast could see a distance of 150 feet west along the highway, and that a person in an automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>bile traveling east could see a boy lying on the bank, though probably not \u201cas quickly\u201d as the boy could see the car. From this evidence plaintiff\u2019s counsel argue that the defendant should have seen the plaintiff in time to have avoided the accident. The defendant testified that the road was covered with two inches of soft snow, which had fallen during the forenoon, and that it was \u201cspitting\u201d snow as he drove along. One of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that \u201cit had hailed that night\u201d and \u201cit was kind of icy.\u201d Another stated that \u201cit was a little slippery.\u201d In this situation the defendant was fully justified in confining his attention very closely to the traveled portion of the highway, and could not be found negligent merely because he failed to see the plaintiff sooner than he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Furthermore he would have been remiss in his duty if he had ignored the presence of the children on the right-hand side of the road. These children did not call out to the plaintiff until he was halfway down the bank. By that time the defendant was so near that even if he ought at once to have interpreted their shouts as a warning to some one on his left, any finding that he then had time to take preventive action would be highly conjectural.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The defendant was asked if the windshield wiper was in use that day. He replied: \u201cI can\u2019t remember whether it was being used that minute or not. It is hard to remember.\u201d To the inquiry, \u201cCan\u2019t you see your mudguards through the windshield?\u201d he answered, \u201cOh, yes.\u201d He also testified: \u201cTony was standing leaning on the fender, looking at me, when I got out the door. ... I had to get out of the car before I could see him .... I don\u2019t know [why I didn\u2019t see him before], but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">It is suggested that the jury might well find on this testimony that the windshield wiper was not working and that the defendant\u2019s vision through the windshield was at least partially obscured. The evidence is wholly insufficient to warrant any such inference. There is no evidence that it was snowing enough to require the use of a wiper, nor does it appear that the plaintiff was standing at the fender before the defendant opened the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The fact that the defendant may have been driving on the left lane of concrete when the collision took place is unimportant. The law of the road (P. L., <em>c. </em>90, <em>s </em>1) goes no further than to regulate the acts of those meeting and passing each other on the highway with vehicles \u201cand leaves their rights and liabilities, in all other particulars, unaltered, and to be regulated and determined by the principles of the common law.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>14 N. H. 307, 311. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cmakes no reference to conduct when the route of one lies across that of the other. It contemplates a situation where, if the statute is obeyed, there cannot be a collision because their paths never meet.\u201d <em>L\u2019Esperance </em>v. <em>Sherburne, </em>85 N. H. 103, 105. The defendant had no reason to anticipate the presence of the plaintiff and, having rightfully turned to the left, he was not liable merely because' he helped to create a dangerous situation. <em>Schwotzer </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>87 N. H. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">It is also suggested that \u201cthe jury might have felt that the defendant in not veering to the right instead of stopping on a straight course was negligent.\u201d The answer to this suggestion is that the time was too short for anything but instinctive action. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>86 N. H. 193, 196, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The defendant testified that he had never seen boys sliding on that particular hill and did not know that they were accustomed to slide there. For some years previous to the accident he had passed over the highway \u201cperhaps twice in three weeks.\u201d \u201cSome weeks\u201d he did not go over it at all. The hour at which he passed over it on any of these occasions is not shown. The coasting would not be frequent during school hours. With reference to the day of the accident one of the children testified: \u201cWe had to go to school in the morning, but they were sliding at dinner time when they had a little spare time.\u201d The road had been entirely reconstructed the year before and cement lanes installed. The plows in clearing these lanes would necessarily leave an \u201caccumulation of snow around the edges of the road.\u201d The extent to which, in view of these facts, sliding across the cement was possible does not appear. At any rate, the evidence is insufficient to charge the defendant with notice of the alleged custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">All the evidence indicates that the defendant\u2019s speed was not excessive and that he made a quick stop. The plaintiff stated that he was dragged only \u201ca little bit.\u201d He did not appear to be seriously injured, at least at the time. The defendant took him at once to the hospital where he was examined and pronounced able to attend school. The defendant then took him to school where he remained until his mother called for him that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Since there is no evidence from which it could fairly be found that the defendant was negligent, it is unnecessary to consider the applicability of the coasting statute (P. L., c. 378, s. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\n<em>Judgments for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-10\">Page, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
