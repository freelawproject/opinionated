Woodard. On February 23, 1928, the Woodards deeded the insured dwelling house to her. Mrs. Woodard died in 1931, and on March 22, 1932, the plaintiff conveyed a life estate in the property to Mr. Woodard. At the time of the fire they were occupying the insured premises and the plaintiff was taking care of Mr. Woodard, who was nearly blind.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">So far as appears, the only policy of insurance which the plaintiff ever procured was that on which suit has been brought. This policy, which insured the house and its contents, was issued on January 14, 1931, and was not to expire for five years. Presumably the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>which preceded it was in force for a like period. If so, it was issued in 1926 and must have insured the interest of Mr. and Mrs. Woodard, who then owned the property. Whether the policy was later assigned to the plaintiff does not definitely appear. The policy itself was not introduced as an exhibit and the agent who issued it did not testify. Indeed, the evidence relating to the entire subject of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged fraud is exceedingly meager. The plaintiff herself was the only witness called to the stand,</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">She testified that while she was living with Mr. and Mrs. Woodard she purchased various articles of furniture including a kitchen range, a sideboard, a day bed, a radio stand, a desk, and several chairs. Although the earlier policy doubtless contained the usual provision extending coverage to personalty owned by any member of the insured\u2019s household, there is no evidence that the plaintiff was familiar with the terms of insurance policies or knew that this particular policy while standing in her parents\u2019 name afforded her any protection. The policy insured the contents of the house for only $500, whereas the total value of the household effects including the property owned by the plaintiff (according to an agreement entered into by the parties after the fire) amounted to $1,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The plaintiff testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t mind about getting more insurance until the policy ran out\u201d and that she then told the insurance agent that she had \u201cbought some\u201d furniture, whereupon he suggested that the insurance on the household and personal property be increased from $500 to $1,600. Defendant\u2019s counsel then interrogated her as follows: \u201cQ. Mrs. Lamb, when you went to Mr. Spalding to get this very policy, you told him you had bought some new furniture? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you had not bought any for eight years? A. No. ... Q. And he advised you to put on more insurance, because you told him you had bought some more furniture, that is right? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The defendant argues that inasmuch as the insurance was actually increased in accordance with the agent\u2019s suggestion the above-quoted testimony conclusively establishes the plaintiff\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">It will be noted that the words \u201cnew furniture\u201d and \u201cmore furniture\u201d are the words of the defendant\u2019s counsel. See <em>Lamarche </em>v. <em>Lamarche, </em>87 N. H. 454. The plaintiff herself in explaining the situation declared: \u201cI bought it [the furniture], I had it when I got the insurance.\u201d This is entirely consistent with the view that she understood that her furniture was being insured for the first time and considered it \u201cmore\u201d furniture and \u201cnew\u201d furniture only in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the furniture owned by her parents, which had been in the house for twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The fact that the insurance she obtained exceeded the property value later agreed upon is not a controlling factor. The valued-policy statute applies only to buildings. P. L., <em>c. </em>276, s. 8. As to personalty, it is for the insured after the fire to establish his loss. <em>Moreau </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>84 N. H. 422, 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The present case differs radically from the <em>Moreau </em>case, on which the defendant relies. In the latter case the plaintiff\u2019s claim was so contrary to experience and to nature as to be utterly beyond credence. No such situation is here disclosed. As already indicated, fraud (which must be clearly established by proof) was not the only conclusion which could fairly be drawn from the evidence. <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., 87 </em>N. H. 180, 184. The trial court did not err in denying the motion for a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Nevertheless the verdict must be set aside. On the day of the fire the plaintiff purchased five gallons of kerosene. After filling an oil stove she placed the oil can, which then contained about three gallons of kerosene, in the cellarway. At seven o\u2019clock that evening she took Mr. Woodard in her automobile and drove to town for the ostensible purpose of shopping. The stores, however, were closed. She then drove about Nashua for several hours in a vain attempt to reach the residence of a person on whom Mr. Woodard desired to call. When she finally returned home she discovered that her house was on fire, and the fire department was already there. The day after the fire pools of kerosene were found on the bedroom floors and the oil can was empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The family income at the time consisted of $12.50 a month, which Mr. Woodard received as a pension for blindness, and an indefinite sum obtained by the plaintiff from the occasional sale of wreathes and patchwork quilts, supplemented by relief contributions from the city of Nashua. Before the fire the plaintiff was engaged to marry the man whom she later married. Mr. Woodard objected to her marrying and she concealed from him the fact that she was \u201ckeeping company with Mr. Lamb.\u201d At the time of the fire Lamb was out of work. Obviously the evidence relating to the plaintiff\u2019s pecuniary condition and that of the man she desired to marry was relevant to show a motive for burning the insured property. Naturally, too, the plaintiff would be much more inclined to resort to such an act if she were not on good terms with Mr. Woodard and had no scruples about breaking up his home.</p>\n<p id=\"A97O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>For the purpose of showing the attitude of the plaintiff and Mr. Woodard toward each other defendant\u2019s counsel cross-examined the plaintiff as follows: \u201cQ. And after Mrs. Woodard died in 1931, Mr. Woodard wanted you to reconvey that property to him, didn\u2019t he? A. Yes, sir. Q. And you would not? A. I did. ... I gave him a life lease. Q. After you gave him the life lease, did he then attempt 'to get you to deed the property to him? A. No; not particularly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">From this evidence (the jury were entitled to consider the plaintiff\u2019s failure to answer the last question unequivocally) it could be inferred that Mr. Woodard was not altogether content with his limited interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Desiring to further show the relations which existed between the plaintiff and Mr. Woodard at the time of the fire defendant\u2019s counsel continued: \u201cQ. When did you and Mr. Woodard break up, and you go to live one place and he another? A. I don\u2019t know; it was sometime afterwards. Q. You and your husband left there and started to furnish a place? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel interrupted to ask: \u201cHow is that material?\u201d Thereupon the presiding justice ruled: \u201cI don\u2019t see how that is material. The evidence of what happened after the fire is stricken from the record.\u201d And later, after a conference with counsel: \u201cThe Court has already excluded any evidence that related to a time after the fire. If you want to inquire about before the fire, I will let you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The mere fact that the proposed inquiry related to events which occurred subsequent to the plaintiff\u2019s alleged wrongful act was not a valid reason for its exclusion. <em>State </em>v. Foster, 80 N. H. 1, 4. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>83 N. H. 532, 533; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>81 N. H. 323; <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>75 N. H. 308, 311, 312; <em>State </em>v. <em>Call, </em>48 N. H. 126, 132. Certainly the plaintiff\u2019s attitude toward her father after the fire, viewed in the light of his opposition to her marriage and his apparent dissatisfaction with the property \u25a0 arrangement, had some tendency to show the plaintiff\u2019s previous hostility toward him. <em>Captan </em>v. <em>Captan, </em>83 N. H. 318, 324. See also <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>43 N. H. 356, 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The question of the trial court\u2019s discretionary right to limit or stop a cross-examination conducted more in the hope of eliciting helpful testimony than towards a definite fine of inquiry is not passed upon. The presiding justice did not exclude the evidence because its admission would unduly protract the trial or because defendant\u2019s counsel failed to \u201cstate his hope.\u201d <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Company, </em>275 Mass. 398, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Here, as in <em>Masterson </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>83 N. H. 190, 195, the ruling was unqualified as well as premature. Subject to the defendant\u2019s ex- . ception, the court struck from the record indiscriminately all evidence of what happened after the fire and limited the scope of cross-examination to events which happened before. In this situation the defendant\u2019s exception must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b53-6\">Branch and Page, JJ., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
