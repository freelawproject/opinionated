The only witnesses to the accident were the parties and Lawrence H. Cyr, a witness called by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">\u00bfThe question whether the plaintiff exercised due care was a vital issue in the case. During the course of his argument to the jury, defendant\u2019s counsel made the following statement: \u201cSo far as Mr. Mailman saw him, he was walking right straight along. So far as Mr. Cyr was concerned, he was walking right straight along.\u201d To this argument the plaintiff objected \u201cas a misstatement of the evidence.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel then expressed his desire to have the argument stand and the plaintiff was allowed an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">Subsequently defendant\u2019s counsel argued as follows: \u201cSo if Mr. Crowley was at all careless in stepping into that line of traffic without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>looking, and that is the testimony in this case except from Mr. Crowley himself, that is a careless thing to do.\u201d Plaintiff objected to the statement, \u201cthat is the testimony in this case except from Mr. Crowley himself.\u201d The argument was allowed to stand and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Both of the above statements to which exceptions were taken are fully sustained by the testimony of Mr. Cyr. Upon direct examination he testified as follows: \u201cQ. What I want you to tell us is where his course would have taken him if he had continued on across the street. ... A. When I last saw Mr. Crowley he was traveling directly across the street, headed toward this corner of the sidewalk.\u201d Upon cross-examination he testified as follows: \u201cQ. Did you see Mr. Crowley look to the right or left as the car approached him? A. No, I did not.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are, therefore, without merit and it is unnecessary to consider the question whether the charge of the court was sufficient to cure any possible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Further in the course of his argument, defendant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cIf Mr. Mailman was not at fault, he [the plaintiff] is not entitled to recover damages. It isn\u2019t my money or your money, it is Mr. Mailman\u2019s money.\u201d To this argument the plaintiff objected and was allowed an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">One argument advanced in support of this exception is as follows. By the statement \u201c 'it is Mr. Mailman\u2019s money\u2019 the impression was intentionally conveyed to the jury that the defendant was not insured.\u201d The plaintiff thus seeks to invoke the rule laid down in <em>Piechuck </em>v. <em>Magusiak, </em>82 N. H. 429, that evidence is inadmissable to prove that a defendant is uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">There is nothing in the language of defendant\u2019s counsel above quoted which justifies the asserted conclusion as to the intention of the speaker or the conclusion that the asserted \u201cimpression\u201d was, in fact, conveyed to the jury. Fairly construed the argument made no reference to or suggestion of a lack of insurance. The most that can be said in favor of the plaintiff is that the jury may possibly have deduced from the colorless language of counsel a conclusion that the defendant was not insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The decision in <em>Piechuck </em>v. <em>Magusiak, supra, </em>was based upon the theory that \u201cthe evidence may have been used\u201d for an improper purpose although it was \u201cwholly immaterial\u201d to any issue in the case. We are now asked to extend this rule one step further and hold that a verdict should be set aside because the language used may have conveyed a certain \u201cimpression\u201d which impression may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>been used for an improper purpose. We are not disposed to give such an extension to the rule of the <em>Piechuck </em>case by speculating as to the possible effect of a possible inference. The possibility that language, used in the heat of argument, may have given an \u201cimpression\u201d of the existence of an unasserted fact and that this impression may, in turn, have been used for an improper purpose, is too problematical to furnish an acceptable basis for judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Another argument in support of this exception is as follows: \u201cIt was apparent [from the evidence] that he was not a man of means and the argument of defendant\u2019s counsel was intended to emphasize the consequences to him of a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d In other words, it is claimed that this was an appeal to the jury for sympathy upon the ground of defendant\u2019s poverty. We do not find anything in the record which justifies this interpretation of the language used by defendant\u2019s counsel. It was obviously proper to remind the jury that a verdict should not be found against the defendant unless he was at fault, and it was not improper to remind them that in finding a verdict for the plaintiff they would be spending the money of someone else and that their verdict should, therefore, be controlled strictly by the rules of law governing the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We find no error in the allowance of the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-8\">Page, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
