Pools of kerosene and kerosene-soaked newspapers were found in those portions of the house which did not burn. Although the duty of adducing some proof that the plaintiff was responsible for the fire devolved upon the defendant, no logical reason appears for holding inapplicable the usual rule which places \u201cupon a plaintiff the general risk of non-persuasion.\u201d \u201cShe [the plaintiff] was uninsured for a fire set by her own procuring,\u201d and \u201cHer right of recovery depended upon proof that her loss was insured.\u201d <em>Trepanier </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., ante, </em>118.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">At the time of the fire the plaintiff and her foster father, Henry 0. Woodard, occupied the insured premises. When the plaintiff procured her policy she informed the agent who issued it that she had bought new furniture. Thereupon the agent increased the insurance on the household property from $500 to $1,600. On cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that at the time she made this statement the only \u201cnew\u201d furniture she owned had been bought at least eight years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The plaintiff had title to the realty subject to a life estate which, at her father\u2019s request, she had conveyed to him a month before the fire. Mr. Woodard was practically blind and was dependent on the plaintiff for care. The family income was so meager as to necessitate relief contributions from the city of Nashua. The plaintiff was engaged to marry Walter L. Lamb, who became her husband a year later, but she concealed her engagement from Mr. Woodard because of his opposition to her marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">At the first trial the plaintiff testified that Lamb was out of work at the time of the fire. At the second trial she declared that she had been mistaken in this respect and that Lamb told her he \u201chad been working for ten years.\u201d Lamb, though present in court, did not testify, and there is no evidence as to his whereabouts on the afternoon and evening of April 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Late in the afternoon of that day the plaintiff, by her own admission, purchased five gallons of kerosene. After filling her oil stove and attending to a few household duties she made a brief call on a neighbor. On her return she found Mr. Woodard at the telephone. He told her he had just received a message from a man he did not know to the effect that a friend in West Townsend, Massachusetts, was sick and wished to see him that evening. He objected to the drive, saying to the plaintiff: \u201cI hate to go up there awfully tonight; I am blind, and I hate to ride in the night.\u201d As a consequence of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>objection the plaintiff telephoned the friend in West Townsend and learned that he was not ill. Then, at about seven o\u2019clock, she took Mr. Woodard in her automobile and drove \u201cdown town\u201d to buy him \u201csome underwear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">They found the stores closed, however; whereupon Mr. Woodard suggested that they call on a clergyman who lived on Pine Hill Road about two miles beyond the center of the city. Although the plaintiff had lived in Nashua all her life and although Mr. Woodard \u201cvery seldom went out anywhere at night\u201d and \u201chated\u201d to ride at that time, they spent the next two hours in a vain attempt to discover this clergyman\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The fire alarm was sounded at 9:28 o\u2019clock. When the plaintiff reached home the fire department was already there. There was no indication that anyone except the firemen had broken into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Mr. Woodard had placed some money in a glass jar inclosed in a tin tobacco can and had buried the can and its contents in the cellar. A police inspector searched for this can at Mr. Woodard\u2019s request and found it by digging \u201cdown about a foot and a half in the ground.\u201d The plaintiff knew that the money was hidden there but, in the opinion of the inspector who found it, there was never any danger of its burning.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The plaintiff testified vaguely as to one or two \u201cthreats\u201d against Mr. Woodard made by \u201chis own people\u201d some years before, but she admitted that at the time of the fire he had not \u201can enemy in the world.\u201d Neither she nor Mr. Woodard could suggest anyone who might possibly have a motive for injuring them. The plaintiff did not inform the police of the alleged telephone call requesting Mr. Woodard\u2019s presence in West Townsend, nor did she mention this call when her deposition was taken. Mr. Woodard testified that he thought he told the police about it, but the inspector asserted definitely that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">We therefore conclude that the evidence is altogether insufficient to justify a finding that the plaintiff neither set nor procured to be set the fire which destroyed her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-11\">Branch, J., did not sit: Page, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
