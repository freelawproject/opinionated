In accordance with the judgment of defendant\u2019s counsel, the court adopted the method which was believed to be best calculated to minimize the harmful effect of the plaintiff\u2019s statement, <em>i.e. </em>by ignoring it. The case must, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>be considered as though all available methods for curing the alleged error had been adopted. Hence the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial presents only the question whether, as a matter of law, the prejudicial effect of the above mentioned testimony was so great that it could not be cured. Rules of law which are well settled in this jurisdiction require that this question be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">It is a cardinal principle of our practice that errors which occur in the course of a trial are not necessarily incurable and that the effect of evidence which comes improperly before a jury may be cured by an order that it be stricken from the record and an instruction to the jury to disregard it. \u201cThis rule is based on the belief that jurymen can with proper effort, ignore certain facts within their knowledge, and form their judgment by a consideration of other facts. \u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Knox, </em>66 N. H. 545, 546; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lucy, </em>83 N. H. 160, 166. Such has been the practice in this state for more than a century. <em>Hamblett </em>v. <em>Hamblett, </em>6 N. H. 333; <em>Deerfield </em>v. <em>Norihwood, </em>10 N. H. 269; <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>44 N. H. 593; <em>Zollar </em>v. <em>Janvrin, </em>47 N. H. 324; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>58 N. H. 588; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>61 N. H. 112; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Knox, supra; Lee </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>73 N. H. 101; <em>Conn. River Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>75 N. H. 353, 356; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Stillings, </em>76 N. H. 122, 129; <em>Vigneault </em>v. <em>Company, </em>76 N. H. 196, 199; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>79 N. H. 52; <em>Doe v. Lucy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">No reason is perceived for holding, as a matter of law, that any feeling of compassion for the plaintiffs which may have been aroused by the fact that they had two blind children could not have been kept within legitimate limits by appropriate instructions from the presiding judge. This is not a case like <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lucy, supra, </em>in which a finding of fact was demonstrably based upon inadmissible testimony, or like <em>James Stewart &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Newby, </em>266 Fed. 287, where the effect of prejudicial testimony is \u201callowed to remain during the whole course of a trial and by persistent, unrebuked references is allowed to influence the jurors\u2019 consideration of all the other evidence during the trial. \u201d We have here only a single statement of a fact of doubtfully relevant but obviously prejudicial character. To hold that this testimony created in the minds of the jury an ineluctable sympathy for the plaintiffs which would operate to the prejudice of the defendant, despite instructions to disregard it and despite presumed efforts of the jurors to comply with such instructions, would be an unwarranted reflection upon the intelligence and integrity of jurymen. \u201cThe presumption should not be indulged that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>were too ignorant to comprehend, or were too unmindful of their duty to respect, instructions as to matters peculiarly within the province of the court to determine.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>102 U. S. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">It is difficult to understand upon what theory it could be held that the temptation to find against this defendant because the plaintiffs have two blind children would be greater than the temptation to give a verdict against a defendant because he carries liability insurance and hence will not have to pay it. It has always been assumed in this jurisdiction, however, that the effect of such evidence may be obviated by proper proceedings in the trial court. <em>Demars </em>v. <em>Company, </em>67 N. H. 404, 407; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Hillsborough Mills, </em>78 N. H. 57, 59. The great weight of authority elsewhere is in accord with this view. Noto, \u201cInforming Jury of Liability Insurance\u201d, 56 A. L. R. 1418, 1509, 1510.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It is equally well settled that \u201cit was a question of fact for the , determination of the trial court whether justice required that the trial should be stopped. \u201d <em>Herschensohn </em>v. <em>Weisman, </em>80 N. H. 557, 559; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Stillings, </em>76 N. H. 122, 129; <em>Morrill </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>66 N. H. 572; <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>60 N. H. 158. \u201cIn his knowledge of the trial, the presiding justice has better means of deciding the question of fact than others can have who were not at the trial.\u201d <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>58 N. H. 568. In the present case the court twice denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial. This was equivalent to a finding that both the plaintiff Ednah and her counsel acted in good faith and that the testimony in question did not deprive the defendant of an opportunity for a fair trial. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>73 N. H. 101; <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>80 N. H. 559, 561. There appears to be no reason for disturbing this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Judgments on the verdicts.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-8\">Page, J. did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
