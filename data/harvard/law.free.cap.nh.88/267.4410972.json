His-mother died on July 10, 1934. After her death the defendant and his father continued to reside in the old home. For some time persons in the vicinity had been disturbed by noises which indicated that the respondent was illtreating his father. Early in the afternoon on the first day of August, two women heard John Harmon uttering such cries as \u201cHelp! Murder!\u201d \u201cYou are killing me.\u201d One of these women consulted her next-door neighbor, stating that the defendant was \u201cat him again,\u201d and this neighbor decided to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">When the officers arrived they found John Harmon sitting in a chair, his face bruised and bloody. He was in a \u201cbeaten up condition\u201d and was \u201cnearly spent.\u201d The defendant was standing in the middle of the floor \u201cperspiring freely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">One of the officers described the situation as follows: \u201cI found Mr. Harmon sitting in a chair in the corner of the kitchen . .. and James Harmon was standing . . . right near the center of the kitchen. James Harmon was excited and exhausted and so was John Harmon. I tried to talk to Mr. John Harmon but it was kind of hard to understand him. He had an abrasion on the bridge of his nose that was bleeding. There was cuts on both arms and the side of his left cheek, \u25a0and he had a pool of blood in his mouth and it dripped down from his lip. I tried to have Mr.'Harmon tell me what the trouble was, and he put his hand, his left hand to his right arm, and pointing over to James Harmon, said that he punched him, and he puts his hand up to his head and said that he punched him there. I went over and asked James what was the trouble. He said the old man was crazy, and there was blood on the left sleeve of his shirt and along the pocket -of his shirt. I asked him how the blood spots got there and he eouldn\u2019t answer me. He didn\u2019t know, so he said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The city marshal was present and talked with John Harmon. At the police station the marshal informed the respondent that his father had told him that \u201cJames went in a rage and beat him up\u201d because he was unwilling to sign certain papers. The defendant\u2019s only comment was that \u201cthe old man was crazy.\u201d When he came to testify, however, he admitted that his father attempted that after<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>noon to sign a \u201cpaper\u201d relating to the appointment of the defendant as administrator of his mother\u2019s estate, that his father spoiled the paper, and that he (the defendant) \u201cwas provoked\u201d at what his father had done and involuntarily placed his hand on his father\u2019s shoulder, \u201cshook him and told him to look and see what he was doing\u201d; that his father then \u201cstarted hollering 'Murder,\u2019 \u201d and that he (the defendant) put his hand over his father\u2019s mouth \u201cso as to stop his hollering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Shortly after the alleged assault John Harmon was taken to the hospital where he died three days later. After the funeral the city marshal found the respondent\u2019s shirt soaking in a tub of water in the cellar of the Harmon house. The chemist for the state board of health testified that the stains on the shirt were made by blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">An autopsy performed by the State on the body of John Harmon disclosed a fracture of the outer table of the skull, in the occipital bone, and a blood clot in both the back and frontal region of the brain. The inner table of the skull was not fractured. There was testimony to the effect that if a blow \u201cis extensive, it usually injures both tables.\u201d The examination showed Paget\u2019s disease, and the skull was \u201cvery soft.\u201d The pathologist for the state board of health testified that it \u201cwould take very little force to fracture\u201d the outer table of \u201cthat particular skull.\u201d The medical referee testified that a blow on the front of the head could cause a fracture and concussion in the back part of the skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Nothing beyond the bare recital of these facts is needed to refute the respondent\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding \u201cthat death resulted from the act of the defendant and was not caused by accidental or natural causes.\u201d The motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The respondent, on cross-examination, was asked the following question: \u201cNow previous to your taking out administration on your mother\u2019s estate, didn\u2019t you have some dealings with your father relative to his shifting his life insurance over to you as beneficiary?\u201d He answered without objection: \u201cFather had life insurance and mother was the beneficiary. Mother had passed away, and then it was changed to me.\u201d He then answered numerous questions concerning his correspondence with the insurance company, to none of which was any objection made. The solicitor then asked if this insurance was \u201cshifted over\u201d to his name before the \u201cadministration paper\u201d was procured. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected and excepted to the question on the ground that motive is \u201cno part of a charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>manslaughter.\u201d It is now argued that this \u201cwas an attempt by the solicitor to introduce evidence of malice\u201d and that the element of malice is not involved in a charge of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It is unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s contention. The particular question objected to was not answered but when put in slightly different form, the respondent replied: \"Why, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t any idea.\u201d The answer was harmless. <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Company, </em>82 N. H. 225, 230. The respondent then stated again that he became beneficiary of the policy after his mother\u2019s death. Since this was merely the restatement of a fact already in evidence without objection, no prejudice could have resulted from its admission. 64 C. J. 171, and cases cited. Moreover no specific objection to the question which elicited this repetition appears to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
