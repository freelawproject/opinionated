Hecht, hereinafter referred to as defendant, as he was in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The plaintiff company, through its agent H. G. Blaising, about September, 1921, sold defendant fifty shares of its capital stock, par value $100.00 per share, at $200.00 per share. To consummate the deal, plaintiff, after considerable negotiations with defendant, agreed to lend the defendant ten thousand dollars with which to purchase the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">There are two written agreements in connection with the transaction, one designated in the record as the \u201cSubscription Agreement,\u201d and the other as the \u201cCol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>lateral Note Agreement.\u201d They appear in marginal notes <footnotemark>I</footnotemark> and <footnotemark>II</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The controversy in the case grew out of the manner in which the collateral note referred to in the agreement was signed by the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tention being that the note was never signed as contemplated by the agreement, the defendant\u2019s being that it was. The question involves a construction of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Blaising, the company\u2019s stock salesman, carried the collateral note, which had theretofore been signed by Blainey for the company, to the defendant for his signature, secured his signature and returned to the office of plaintiff with the note, and then delivered the stock certificate to the defendant. Immediately upon discovery by Blainey, vice president of the company, that the note had not been signed by the defendant, as the former claimed, in the proper place, he called on defendant and requested that he sign it at the bottom so as to include the obligation, on the part of the maker (defendant) to furnish additional collateral security, when required by the plaintiff, company, which was a part of the form of note used by the company. (To make this statement clear a copy of the form of the note used by the company, showing the signatures of the parties thereto, appears in the margin. Note <footnotemark>III</footnotemark>.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>A controversy then arose between the parties which terminated, in the refusal of defendant to sign the note ns requested and this action ultimately followed, plaintiff contending that the note was not signed according to the terms of the agreement, and the defendant contending that it was. Plaintiff urges that the plain terms of its agreement with defendant entitle it to protect its loan to the. defendant as the form of collateral note, used by it, provides, by calling for additional security. Defendant had not been called upon to provide additional collateral, but he contended that he never could be under his contract. This action was instituted to recover the $10,000.00 loaned by plaintiff to the defendant under this alleged misapprehension. The result of the trial in the lower court was the verdict and judgment set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The trial court determined, and properly we think, that the whole transaction between the parties was in writing, and that, so far as the writing dealt with the matter in controversy, there was no ambiguity in the writing. It therefore proceeded to construe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>contract in an instruction to the jury, the practical-effect of which was to direct a verdict for the plaintiff-That instruction, which was the only instruction given in the case except one as to the burden of proof, correctly interprets the contract in our opinion. It appears in the margin Note <footnotemark>IV</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The defendant offered numerous instructions based upon his theory of the case. Objections to the instruction given and exceptions to the action of the court in refusing the instructions asked for by the defendant, exceptions to the action of the court in excluding evidence, and to the action of the court in refusing to set aside the verdict, form the basis of ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>assignments of error, but as the court has correctly construed the contract in the instruction given, and as there could have been no other verdict properly returned than the one reached (unless there was a waiver of the right to demand the note signed as contemplated by the agreement, by accepting the note of November 15, 1921, and this question having been submitted to the jury by the instruction, upon a conflict of the evidence, the jury\u2019s verdict is binding in this court) it is unnecessary to consider any of these assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"> It is perfectly clear that the trial court rightly held that as the collateral note agreement provided that the loan should be \u201cevidenced by a note made by the defendant on a form of collateral note regularly used by the company,\u201d and as the form of that note was made certain by attaching it to the collateral agreement, and as that form contained an option in the plaintiff that the defendant should give additional collateral security when called upon by the plaintiff, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>meant exactly what it said, and the signature of the defendant at any place on the note which did not include all of its provisions, was not giving a note in compliance with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The final sentence of the agreement, \u201cthe subscriber proposes to offer 4,000 shares of the preferred stock of American Southern Motors Corporation, said shares having a present market value of $18,000.00,\u201d is not in conflict with this provision in the contract, as the defendant contends, but refers to the immediate arrangement as to collateral, and must be interpreted in the light of the other provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"I\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\">.

The court instructs the jury that i? they believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant signed the subscription agreement introduced in the evidence, printed on subscription agreement blank No. 586, and that the Hampton Roads Fire and M irine Insurance Company accepted said subscription; that not exceeding five per centum of the gross selling price of each share was used to cover the organization of the plaintiff company, and that the plaintiff company delivered to the defendant a certificate showing the issue to him of fifty shares of the capital stock of the Hampton Roads Fire and Marine Insurance Company, fully paid and non-assessable, and the said defendant accepted said stock certificate, the said 'defendant then and there became liable to the plaintiff company for the sum of $10,000.00, with interest thereon from the date of the delivery of said stock. Said liability of the defendant to the plaintiff could be discharged by the payment of said sum in cash out of his individual assets or assets obtained from outside sources, or in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement dated September 30, 1921, between the Hampton Roads Fire and Marine Insurance Company and Joseph B. Hecht, which said agreement is written on the back of the stock subscription agreement hereinabove referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Under said agreement the defendant had the privilege of borrowing from the plaintiff the sum of $10,000.00, to pay for the subscription to which he had subscribed, said amount to be borrowed for a term of ten years, renewable for a like period. Said loan was to be evidenced by a collateral note made by the defendant on a form of collateral note regularly used by the plaintiff company, said note to bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum, but the interest as it accrued was to become a part of the principal of said note and each item thereof to bear interest from date of its accrual. To said note as collateral security therefor there was to be attached certain certificates for 4,000 shares of perferred stock of the American Southern Motors Company. In order to take advantage of this privilege and as a condition precedent thereto the defendant had to make a note for the $10,000.00 on the terms hereinabove set out, on the regular form of collateral note used by the plaintiff company, attach thereto the collateral hereinabove referred to, and deliver such note properly made, together with said collateral, to the plaintiff company. The proper making of such note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>involved the signing thereof by the defendant at the bottom thereof, after all the printed and typewritten matter appearing on said form, and the assumption by the defendant of all the promises, terms and conditions therein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Therefore, if you believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the said Joseph B. Hecht signed the subscription agreement hereinabove referred to; that not exceeding five per centum of the gross selling price of each share was used to cover the cost of organization of the Hampton Roads Fire and Marine Insurance Company; that said company accepted the subscription and issued to Joseph B. Hecht a certificate for fifty shares of the capital stock of the Hampton Roads Fire and Marine Insurance Company of the par value of $100.00 each, said certificate showing that the shares were fully paid and non-assessable, and the said Joseph B. Hecht accepted said certificate of stock, and has not paid therefor in cash and has not made and delivered to the plaintiff company a collateral note signed as herein-above set out, together with the collateral provided for in said agreement, they should find for the plaintiff in the sum of $10;000,00, with interest thereon from the 15th day of November, 1921, until paid, unless they further believe from the evidence that the Hampton Roads Fire and Marine Insurance Company has waived its right to demand said note and has accepted the note dated November 15, 1921, introduced in the evidence as a discharge of the obligation of the defendant. The burden is on the defendant, if he relies on such a waiver or acceptance, to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
