In Strange Reports *<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 23it is ruled that bail may be witness against defendant, but not for him, and the reason is, because it is against his interest. The principle of the Act is to prevent negro evidence in favor of Negroes and against white persons, but in this case the evidence is to be merely in favor of a white person and is therefore not excluded by the Act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-13\">\n<em>Ridgely.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9u\">In <em>Hall and </em>Collins,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was not held necessary that the Negro should have been manumitted, or his ancestors, his color ascertained him here to have descended of slaves. In the <em>State v. </em>Farsons<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>State v. Bender </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this point seems to have been already determined on the spirit of the Act. Negroes are prohibited many other privileges besides that of not being witnesses, except for redress of injuries done them etc.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-14\">\n<em>Bayard.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aok\">The spirit of the law beyond the plain meaning of the words is something vague and uncertain. The question is wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>er this mulatto can be a witness in favor of a white person. The Act of Assembly is only to prevent such evidence against a white person. In <em>Collins v. Hall </em>it was a contest between white persons,, and the Negro\u2019s evidence for one must be against the other. <em>State v. Farsons </em>was founded on the <em>State v. Bender, </em>which I always thought exceptionable, and it was a case determined <em>ex necessitate rel. </em>Negroes have always the advantage of white testimony and black; the whites upon this construction have only the advantage of white, but on my construction they have also the evidence of blacks in their favor.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-16\"> This case is also reported in <em>Rodney\u2019s Notes, </em>April 27, 1799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-17\"> Footnote by Wilson, \u201c1 Term 164, bail cannot be witnesses for their principal.
