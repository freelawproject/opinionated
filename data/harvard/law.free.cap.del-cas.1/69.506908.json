But <em>Ridgely </em>objected to it, and the court, although I insisted that the witnesses had been sworn to tell the whole truth, that I could not divine that this objection would be made, and that I had often known witnesses called a second time, that it was done in <em>Lingo and Rigua </em>on the second day. But Bassett, C. J., said it was improper and it could not be done; that he was of counsel in that case and remembered no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>thing, but said he would not determine the case now, and advised to save the point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-13\"><em>James P.

The cleared land belonging to the said premises is in Worcester county in Maryland, but the cleared land does not quite reach to the state line. Part of the woodland lies in Maryland and part thereof in Sussex.
