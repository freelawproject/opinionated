That one hundred bushels of corn were put on board the vessel defendant navigated, for plaintiff\u2019s use. The vessel was H. Neill\u2019s, who had corn on board, the quantity uncertain. That this com was put on board by Neill\u2019s orders. Defendant stored the cargo in Philadelphia, uncertain when it was sold. That defendant was upon a bargain for the vessel, which was not completed. That defendant received the freight one trip.

The only question is as to the interest claimed, and you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>may clearly allow it in damages. As to the time when the corn was sold, as it is in the power of defendant, and he does not show it, it is therefore to be presumed against him. You are to give it all in one sum as damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Verdict for plaintiff for his demand, and interest from six weeks after storing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
