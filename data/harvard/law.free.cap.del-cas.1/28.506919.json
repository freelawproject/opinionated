Twenty years possession is a title. Here was evidence of possession which related to an early period. I wished to know if there was any objection to plaintiff\u2019s claim of the possession. We think there is a claim of the possession that neither party can claim, but the question is if the former possession can be tacked to the latter. I think not. And that therefore plaintiff has given no evidence of a twenty years\u2019 possession. There is nothing upon the paroi evidence \u2022 that the jury can find. Supposing the fact to be admitted, there remains nothing for the jury to exercise their special knowledge upon. Therefore I think notwithstanding the paroi evidence the defendant may properly demur, for there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u25a0no such doubt upon the paroi evidence as to prevent the defendant to demur.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Conditional verdict taken, and jury discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
