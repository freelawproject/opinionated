J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARx\">The counsel do not materially differ in their statements of the law. Although the justification plea must of itself confess the fact, yet it is often put in with <em>non culpa </em>and does not confess the fact under that issue. Violent presumption amounts to full proof; [the] probable is to be regarded. Wherever the presumptive evidence satisfies the mind that the fact was the one way or the other, that is sufficient. There are a variety of cases of that kind that excludes full proof, and in such cases what is sufficient to satisfy you of the fact, that is sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Verdict, twenty dollars.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
