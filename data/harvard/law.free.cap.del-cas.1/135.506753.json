The assignment was proved, and deed from Solomon Jones to Peery. Death of obligee proved thirty years back but no account of possession. Plaintiff swore he received it with the title papers.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-7\">\n<em>Wilson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agz\">There is no evidence that the bond is older than what the assignment shows. The writing appears to be Lynn\u2019s, the obligor and both witnesses were marksmen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and easily personated. There is no possession proved to have accompanied the paper. The appearance of an old survey will not establish it, Str. 95, Morg.Ess. 164.

P. 255, Morg.Ess. 161. The assignment proves it to be forty years old. The case of a survey is different, for that is the act of one party. We have given an account <em>of the deed </em>by the oath of the plaintiff, which is admissible in such case, upon sound principles of the common law, that no other person can have access to his papers, without endangering the peace of society.

Bassett, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">It has beep proved that the lands were surveyed by Peery. It was woodland. The paper may be read, and it is upon a presumption that Solomon was the heir of Lewis Jones, and that the possession, so far as proved, will allow them as evidence upon account of their antiquity, but the Court will say more about it when they hear the whole of the evidence.</p>\n<author id=\"b205-6\">Bassett, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A35\">(Charge.) In this action of ejectment, you have heard the plaintiff\u2019s title and the objections to that title, <em>viz, </em>that plaintiff has not shown a good and subsisting title in himself, nor has he shown himself in possession within twenty years. As to the first, the patent is allowed on all hands to show a title out of the Proprietary; but as to second paper, the bond, it is necessary that possession should accompany such paper, or other satisfactory account ought to be given of it. In this case it depends on the credit of Doctor Jackson\u2019s evidence, who has heard from three persons that Solomon was the son of Lewis Jones, contrasted with that of Armwell Jones, who says that Solomon Jones\u2019 father\u2019s name was Edmund, and Solomon was that witness\u2019 father. As to the second point, that plaintiff must show he was possessed within twenty years before suit brought, it has been proved that a survey was made many years ago by Charles Peery, which I am of opinion is a sufficient possession, and unless an adverse possession is proved it is sufficient for the plaintiff to recover. It has been proved: that Charles Peery died, leaving issue, Margaret, Winifred, and Catherine; Margaret had several children, that she is dead, and her children have been gone ten or twelve years and not heard of; that Catherine died leaving one child. If the father survived her, he would be entitled to her share, but if not, Winifred, the daughter of Winifred, and wife of Harris, would be entitled to the whole of the land; but if the father survived, he would be entitled to a part of Margaret\u2019s as well as Catherine\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
