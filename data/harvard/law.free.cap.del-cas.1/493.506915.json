He insisted that the Statute of Limitations was a positive law of which the Court were bound to take notice and which operated upon the evidence of the plaintiff so as effectually to bar a recovery without anything shown by the defendant. In support of his motion he relied on a case determined by the Supreme Court in New Castle in which that court had exercised the same power.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-5\"><em>Ridgely, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfGj\">observed that the issues were fairly before the jury and the court would intrench upon their province if they intermeddled.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-15\"> This case is also reported in <em>Bayard\u2019s Notebook, 142.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b562-6\">Bassett, C.
