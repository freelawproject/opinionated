If they make a lease, their lessees are tenants in common, 3 Com.Dig. 610, 3 Bac.Abr. 188,192, and this verdict is still wrong being for the whole. It is laid down in 3 Bac.Abr. 216 that joint tenants must join in ejectment. And this because their title and their freehold being the same, they ought to have but one action, and not because they cannot make several leases. If any one of the joint tenants should refuse to join in ejectment, he may be summoned, and severed. 4 Bac.Abr. 663, 664, pi. 6 and 9.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-13\">\n<em>Ridgely.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARPV\">The demise is good for a moiety.

J. The Court declared to the jury in precise terms that the law was with defendant, and gave them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>full information, but they found for the plaintiff. Leonard is a book of good authority, and there a joint tenant recovered in ejectment. Burr. 936 shows the discretion of the court, and the justice of the case is with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Vide </em>2 Str. 1181.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
