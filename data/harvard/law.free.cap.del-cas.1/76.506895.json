But at any rate, that question only can arise when a legacy is sued for. Here the plaintiff, by passing a final account and acknowledging a balance in defendant\u2019s favor and therein craving a credit for defendant\u2019s share in this Negro, when he had become our guardian, he really held this property as guardian, and then assent is not necessary. But it was plaintiff\u2019s duty to have rendered an account of his guardianship and delivered up the property, for by the terms even of the bond the guardianship has expired. It is sufficient for defendant to show property in less, 2 Morg.V.M. 84.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b145-9\">Bassett, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aih\"><em>Non cepit </em>does not confine the taking to the place in the declaration unless defendant shows a taking elsewhere, 2 Esp.N.P. 12. Legatee may bring trover or replevin against a stranger for a legacy given, 5 Bac.Abr.; but a legatee ought in this case to prove a demand of a legacy. Only account will lie by a joint owner of personal property.' I am of opinion that the property did not vest in the guardian from the date of the guardian bonds, because the Negro could not be divided, for the possession was not delivered to all the three minors, for he could not come at him unless he could be cut up!!!!<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\"> Wilson\u2019s punctuation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
