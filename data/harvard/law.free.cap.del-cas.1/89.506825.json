In England the plaintiff cannot prove his account, but only his clerk; here the plaintiff\u2019s oath is received, and the clerk\u2019s is not required; by the Act it is immaterial who made the entries.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-13\"> This case is also reported in <em>Bayard\u2019s Notebook, 227, </em>where it is dated 1798 and follows in order the dates of the cases in his notebook, but the account of the case in Wilson appears among the cases dated 1796.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b158-7\">Bassett, C.
