He has brought himself into this difficulty that he must prove the breaches laid in the declaration, but they being in the negative it is impossible to prove them, unless a witness could be produced who had guarded the defendant ever since the contract. It is true if we took no advantage of plaintiff in this, it would be good after verdict; but that he ought not to have without proof.

I very much doubt Mr. Morgan\u2019s law unless we had his authorities. (Here I offered to show the same law in Comyn\u2019s Digest, and opened the place.) But it is a rule that he who commits the first fault in pleading, judgment shall be against that man. Suppose a good pida and bad declaration judgment shall be against the plaintiff, but if the narratio is good, plea bad, and replication good, judgment shall be against the defendant and so on!! (Here the Chief Justice cited authorities from his notebooks on this subject.) In this case the narratio is good, the plea acknowledged bad, then your verdict will be accordingly, and after verdict the record will be cured.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See 1 Str. 303 confirmatory of this.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Verdict for plaintiff. <em>\u00a3 </em>[-] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> damages. <em>N.
