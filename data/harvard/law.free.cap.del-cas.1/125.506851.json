First, because lessor \u2022of plaintiff had no title when the demise was made, <em>viz. </em>January \u20223,1794. By the will his estate could not commence till the money was paid, <em>viz, </em>\u201con their paying\u201d etc.; the payment was not made until March 12, 1794, 2 Esp.N.P. 152. \u2022 Secondly, there is no possession proved either actual or constructive, 2 Esp.N.P. 134, 135, 148, 2 Bac.Abr. 172.

Read, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFT\">In plaintiff\u2019s title it is true no deed is shown from Hugh to John Stevenson yet the possession cures this defect. Jacob Shelpman devises a joint tenancy to Cornelius .and William Shelpman and the operation of this estate is different from others as there is a survivorship. He charges this estate with a legacy of \u00a38 to his daughter Margaret, and, if not paid when she was twenty-one, then she was to have fifteen acres. The Court will say on this subject they think the estate vested in devisee before payment to the legatee. Then comes the principal and important legal question of the joint-tenancy, that the two devisees should join in the demise, whereas William did not release till March 12. The question is whether on the third of. January, 1794, the lessor of plaintiff had a title. A man must sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>in the way the law requires, and we do conceive and are sorry we must say so, that this action is not rightly brought, for William Shelpman should have joined with him in the lease, and therefore this action cannot be supported. Having observed then on this subject, we proceed to observe that the cases (Pow.Con. 432, 294, 428, 299, Dali. 426) as to the admission of paroi evidence to prove the mistake in the lines do not apply, because there is no proof of mistake made by the witnesses to the original agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Verdict for plaintiff and motion for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
