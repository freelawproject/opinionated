There is no error or mistake in form, but the defendant has chosen a bad defense and wishes now to substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>a different one. There is certainly nothing to amend. The record could not be rendered more unexceptionable, the defect is in the evidence of the party who cannot support the fact on which he relied. If the defendant had pleaded <em>non est factum, </em>and, after the jury was sworn, discovered he had mistaken his ground, it \\yould be as regular to move for leave to plead a different plea. And if this indulgence were granted to a defendant in his defense, the plaintiff might claim it as to his action. And if amendments were carried to such an extent, they would embarrass much more than advance the administration of justice.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b464-6\"><em>Bidgely </em>and <em>Bayard </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Defendant took nothing by his motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
