This proffered testimony, therefore, contradicts the record, which imports absolute verity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b706-6\">Per [Curiam].

This cause turns on the point whether a tenant for a determinate period is compellable to give notice to the landlord of his\u201d intention to quit and give up the premises at the end of the term. We all hold not. He has fulfilled his contract and need not go beyond it by giving notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
