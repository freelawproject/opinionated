The execution was witnessed by one Samuel Carpenter, who was proved to reside in Philadelphia. James Wiley was present when the instrument was executed but did not witness it. The defendants proposed proving the <em>execution </em>of the release by Wiley and cited 1 Esp.N.P. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-6\">The counsel for the plaintiff insisted that the instrument could be proved only by the person, whom the parties had called upon to attest it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-18\"> This case is also reported in <em>Wilson\u2019s Red Book, 105.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Amy\">We take the rule to be that where there is a wit-</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">ness to an instrument, if he or his testimony by reasonable diligence can be obtained, the Court cannot dispense with the proof. An. instrumentary witness is called on solemnly to attest an instrument; he must certainly be a better witness than a person casually present. It is not shown that any steps have been taken to obtain Carpenter\u2019s evidence. We therefore cannot allow the instrument to be proved by anybody else.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">- The release was not read.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The plaintiff obtained a verdict for \u00a3400. The value of the property destroyed did not exceed probably \u00a3150.
