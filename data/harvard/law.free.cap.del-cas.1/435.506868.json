He therefore conceived the copy was not evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">Upon argument the objection was overruled and the copy read to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-9\">The plaintiff afterwards offered in evidence the alienation bond of Lewis Jones to Aaron Lyn dated October 23,1732.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-10\">\n<em>Wilson</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdlD\">objected to its admission because that it was not proved, and, as he alleged, it had not gone with the possession.
