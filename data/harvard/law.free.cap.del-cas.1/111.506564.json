It was asserted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that a trespass anywhere on plaintiff\u2019s land by defendant will entitle plaintiff to recover. But we must say, where the land is named the trespass must be proved on the tract named. If the trees were not cut upon \u201cFriend\u2019s Denial,\u201d but upon some other tract of plaintiff\u2019s, defendants are not guilty, for no man shall be twice found guilty for the same offense. If these trees were cut upon Dalserfe, defendants are not guilty, for a recovery in this action would be no bar to an action brought for trespass upon Dalserfe.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Verdict, not guilty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-13\"> At this point the word \u201cupon\u201d appears in the manuscript.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
