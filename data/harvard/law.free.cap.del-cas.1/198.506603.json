But at all events, the court will not suffer defendant before appearance to object to their proceedings. If the defendant is not in court, he cannot be heard by counsel, and the court will not <em>ex officio </em>inspect the affidavit, for thereby also plaintiff may lose his debt.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b267-14\">Bassett, C.

The attachment ought not to have issued upon this affidavit and therefore it must be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
