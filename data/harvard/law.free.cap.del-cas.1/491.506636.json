The case in Comberbach (who is not much to be relied on) must have been by consent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-14\"><em>Bayard </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atv\">Defendant has attempted to get rid of this cause on a collateral point, one which has no relation to the merits and is entitled to no favor. Had there been a probability of defendant\u2019s supporting his plea, we might, with about the same propriety as attends his present motion, have moved to amend our writ and <em>narratio </em>so as to operate against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>fendant as administrator. What is now prayed is not an amendment but an essential alteration of the question in dispute. The Constitution authorizes amendments to try the merits. The court will amend the form of a plea until it brings the very question before them which the pleader intended, and this is called an amendment to get at the merits. But they will not change its nature, for that would be inconsistent with the pleader\u2019s intention. Thus if on a plea of payment there appears a slip which would vacate it on error, the court will amend it to get at the merits, but they will not strike it out and put in another. In 1 Dali. 458, the court were strongly inclined to think a juror could not be withdrawn unless by consent. The case in Comb. 419 is a criminal case, and that at once impeaches its authority, for there it is clear the court cannot withdraw a juror, because the Statute of Jeofails does not extend to criminal cases.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-16\"> This case is also reported in <em>Bayard\u2019s Notebook, 137.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Bassett, C.
