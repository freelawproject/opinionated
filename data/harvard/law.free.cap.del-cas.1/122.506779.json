This is the only way the plaintiff could bring his action, and by a statute [4 &amp; 5 Anne, c. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13 (1705) ] only so much shall be given by the jury as was the value of the injury, not exceeding the whole sum of the penalty. Your verdict is to be for the penalty, to be released on payment of the damages ascertained. The defendant\u2019s counsel say they could not plead no land purchased, and properly, for the bond says there was land purchased (reads the bond \u201chas or may buy\u201d). The word \u201chas\u201d implies there was land purchased before the signing the bond, but what can the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>court or jury do (upon a supposition it was a mistake in the writing), if people will be thus incorrect. The words do carry that signification that land had been purchased. There is nothing shown to the contrary; but there is evidence to meet the doubt,\u2014 the conveyance for \u201cBound Savannah\u201d in November 1789 shows it. The evidence is that when defendant was pulling corn on this land Mr. Moore said one-third of one-half was for Mrs. Horsey and that the house and orchard would not go together. You are to say whether those lands were the lands intended in the bond or not. If it is said this bond was given without consideration, it is our duty to say it imports a consideration in itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
