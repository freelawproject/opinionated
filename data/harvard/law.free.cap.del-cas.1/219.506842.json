Suppose, in an action against executor or administrator, a will is produced with its witnesses, but never proved before the Register, it would not be evidence. It was guardian\u2019s duty to have passed his accounts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-9\"><em>Bidgely </em>and <em>Peery.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac8\">The objection is an unfair one, being to foreclose our fair deductions. Admiralty courts, having jurisdiction over the original matter, have also jurisdiction over everything necessarily incidental, Doug. 601. When this court calls a guardian before them to give an account upon attachment as garnishee of his minor\u2019s estate, they ought to decide upon his. charges, which are incidental. The plaintiff might have cited as before the Register, if he required this investigation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-10\">\n<em>Bayard.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1Is\">Doug. 594, courts of common law will not entertain trespass where a question of prize must be incidentally determined.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AEP\">It is the opinion of the Court that the book is: evidence with garnishee\u2019s oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Garnishee proved his book, which was written by himself, except one item which one John Lank had written, which was objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel and given up by defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
