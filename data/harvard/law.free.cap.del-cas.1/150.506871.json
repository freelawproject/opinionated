And articles of agreement, June 29,1780, binding Margaret Kollock to convey to Mrs. Field the said lands upon her payment in wrought plate her debt due Margaret Kollock. This debt was not ascertained nor proved to have been paid. Also a deed, May 5, 1785, Margaret Kollock to defendant for the said lot for \u00a340 to her in hand paid, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">Plaintiff called Phillips Kollock to prove the contract stated in the <em>narratio, </em>objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel, and the court required the objection to be written.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated their evidence in these words in writing: \u201cIt is intended by plaintiff to prove by Phillips Kollock the agreement between Nehemiah Field and Isaac Turner as laid in the declaration; and that, in part execution of the said contract, the defendant paid half the consideration money and was put in possession of the lot upon which he built his dwelling house and has occupied it ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-9\">Defendant\u2019s counsel stated their objection thus: \u201cDefendant objects to paroi evidence to prove the agreement stated in the <em>narratio. </em>He does not object to the testimony of the witness to prove the possession of the lot by defendant and the improvements made by defendant on the lot, though he objects to paroi proof to connect these facts with an agreement for the purchase of the lot without the contract as to the purchase being first established by competent evidence.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-10\">\n<em>Wilson.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUX\">To charge any person for the consideration upon a sale of lands, that evidence must be in writing, 1 Body Laws 347. If the plaintiff had a title in equity, the Act embraces his case as well as if he had had the legal title, the words being \u201cany interest in or concerning them.\u201d The Supreme Court in the case of <em>Horsey\u2019s Executors v. Moore </em>said that a party\u2019s book with his oath would neither be evidence to charge nor discharge a consideration for lands. Defendant is bound to pay the consideration for this very lot to Margaret Kollock\u2019s estate if he cannot show himself discharged, and he might thus be twice charged. The specification in the <em>'narratio </em>can have no effect towards the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>mission of this evidence, for then every part of that Act of Assembly might be easily eluded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>Bidgely.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akm\">An acknowledgment of the contract or payment of money is an exception to the rule concerning paroi evidence. When part of the agreement is in evidence, paroi evidence is admissible to explain it, 1 Pow.Con. 291. Possession is such evidence of an agreement that it will take it out of the Statute, <em>idem </em>299, 301. An agreement partly performed is not within the Statute as to paroi evidence, <em>idem </em>308.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>Miller.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGqa\">Though an agreement be by paroi for lands, if part of the money be paid, equity will compel a conveyance of the lands \u2014 so if the contract be proved by letters signed by the party. Plaintiff can prove defendant in possession and is therefore entitled to prove the contract by paroi evidence, [1] Esp.N.P. 103, 104. Parol proof of the payment of the money as in part execution of a paroi agreement allowed, though not on the principle of a confession in an answer. 3 Atk. 1, 3, 4, (what is and what is not a compliance, <em>vide </em>1 Atk. 13). The construction of the Statute of Frauds is the same in courts of law and equity, 1 Atk. 15.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>Bayard.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKa\">The plaintiff has shown a deed that evidences a contract by us for the lands with a third person. There is nothing that shows that plaintiff by payment of his debt to Margaret Kollock obtained even an equitable title to the lands. This paroi evidence would contradict the written evidence produced in this cause. The possession, when proved, is under M. Kollock\u2019s deed and is not to be presumed under a paroi contract. All the cases cited for plaintiff have been in chancery and most of them founded upon a confession of the fact in an answer. In those cases the proof of possession implied the consent or contract of the former owner, but in this case the proof of defendant\u2019s possession is proof of defendant\u2019s title in reference to his deed. Where the defendant disputes the possession of the land or payment of the money and alleges or proves it to have been on another contrae^ it lays the burden of the proof of the agreement on the plaintiff, which he must do by written evidence, 1 Bac.Abr. 74.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-24\"> This case is also reported in <em>Bayard\u2019s Notebook, 190.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-8\">Bassett, C.

As the difference arises on my part I shall give my opinion. I think the Act of Assembly does not prohibit the giving any evidence relative to lands that is to be performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>in one year. This contract was to have been performed immediately and so within the year. I ground my opinion upon the case in 3 Burr. 1281. (!!! <em>vide </em>the words of the Act and the Statute and 1 Pow.Con. 276, 1 Vern. 159.) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> My brethren are not of my opinion and therefore the evidence cannot be given. No matter what the subject of the Act of Assembly is I think it relates to a performance within a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Bill of exceptions was taken by plaintiffs.

Also a certain instrument in writing under the hand and seal of Margaret Kollock de- ' daring certain uses concerning the said several lots, dated 29 of June, 1780. Also a certain indenture between Margaret Kollock of the one and Isaac Turner of the other part, bearing date 6th of May, 1785, <em>prout </em>the said written instrument and indenture, and thereupon the said plaintiff by his said counsel offered to prove by Phillips Kollock, Esq., the agreement between Nehemiah Field and Isaac Turner as stated in the <em>narratio </em>and that in part execution of the said <em>agreement, </em>the defendant paid half the consideration money to the said Nehemiah Field and was put immediately in possession of the lot or parcel of ground in the <em>narratio </em>mentioned, upon which the defendant built a dwelling house which he has occupied ever since. Whereupon it was objected by the counsel for the defendant that the said evidence was incompetent to prove the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant relative to the sale of the lot or parcel of ground in the <em>narratio </em>mentioned, and therefore that the testimony of the said Phillips Kollock ought not to be admitted for that purpose, and it was then insisted by the counsel for the said plaintiff that the said objection was not sufficient in the law to exclude the said witness in man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ner as contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and thereupon the opinion of the Court in the premises was prayed, and the said Court did upon advice order and adjudge in and upon the said premises, that the testimony of the said Phillips Kollock should not be admitted to which opinion of the court the plaintiff by his counsel doth except, and prays, the benefit of this exception, according to the provision of the Statute in such case made and provided, and that the said Justices would to this his exception affix their hands, and seals etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">(Seal)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Kensey Johns (Seal)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Daniel Rodney (Seal)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\"> Wilson\u2019s punctuation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
