Common Bench sends the roll and enters a <em>mittimus, </em>5 Com.Dig. 711, 2 Str. 837. King\u2019s Bench sends a transcript to the Exchequer Chamber, Doug. 352, and the Chief Justice leaves one in Parliament, yet by statute, 27 Eliz. c. 8, the record must be remanded for execution. Cro.Jac. 206. So a <em>mittimus </em>must be entered when a record is sent from King\u2019s Bench to Ireland, Cowp. 843. After allowance of writ of error and notice, except where bail is necessary, execution cannot issue, 2 Cromp. 331, 333. If record is not transcribed, defendant in error must <em>non prosequitur </em>the writ or obtain a <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>executione judicii </em>before he can proceed. If record is returned, he can obtain a <em>non prosequitur </em>or award of execution on two <em>scire facias quare executionem </em>non, but in all these cases [the] superior court directs the inferior to proceed. 2 Cromp. 337, 338, 335, 3 Salk. 146, 1 Str. 417, 5 Com.Dig. 715. But if execution could issue it ought to have been with the leave of the court, and the want of this leave is such an irregularity that it must be set aside, Barnes 201,194 Salk. 264.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>Miller.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-I\">The rules of the Court of Appeals are to be regarded by the Court, being supported by the Constitution, Art.

Barnes 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>Wilson. </em>The reason a certificate is not necessary in that case is that each of the statutes require bail to be put in, in the court below; here the information comes from the superior court.</p>\n<author id=\"b227-10\">Read, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyA\">This Court is bound by the rule of the Court of Appeals. Our rules ought not in many instances to be like those over the water. The writ of error is no <em>supersedeas </em>unless the proceedings were properly had. No notice from the superior court as such was necessary. The <em>praecipe </em>of the attorney would not have been sufficient to us for the awarding execution, but the party has issued it at his peril, and our officer at a risk; but as it appears to be right, we think the execution ought not to be set aside. Barnes 212 is somewhat similar, for although bail is put in below, yet it is not by the same officer who issues execution. There ought perhaps to have been a certificate. Plaintiff in error ought to have applied for relief to the court above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
