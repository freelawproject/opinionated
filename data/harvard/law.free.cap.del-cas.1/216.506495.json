Defendant proceeded against him under 2 Del.Laws 1051, s. 23, by one warrant for the whole, got judgment before Nathanael Young for the whole. This assigned for error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-12\">Defendant\u2019s counsel insisted that under the Act requiring security by recognizance of plaintiff and one or more sureties to be given the clerk etc. issuing the <em>certiorari </em>(2 Del.Laws p. [1013]), this <em>certiorari </em>must be quashed, because plaintiff did not join in the recognizance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-13\">Both points were argued much at length. Under <em>curia advisare vult </em>three days.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-14\">Johns, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al7\">There are only two points: First, whether the <em>certiorari </em>ought to be quashed for want of bail. We think this <em>certiorari </em>was no <em>supersedeas, </em>and I think it ought not to have been allowed; but the <em>certiorari </em>remaining so long, the record being returned, we think it ought not to be quashed. Second, whether the Act of Assembly has been pursued, and in what manner it ought to have been. We think that by the twenty-third section a separate warrant ought to have issued for each and every default, and that a contrary practice would be contrary to the design of the Act, which only extends to \u00a312. Let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the record and proceedings below returned be quashed, but without costs, for that is the practice.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b285-15\"> Incomplete docket entries follow this case in <em>Wilson\u2019s Red Book, 230, </em>and are omitted here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
