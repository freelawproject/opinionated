Parker </em>in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\"><em>Wilson. </em>The objection was not so much to the paper as evidence before, as to the propriety of pleading that in bar which plaintiff did not come prepared to consider in that point of view. Awards on any kind of facts are open equally to the objection that the original proof is better evidence, and the same objection would lie to verdicts \"which, as well as awards, are good evidence always between the same parties on the same question as is the case in this instance.</p>\n<author id=\"b246-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ASR\">These papers are admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The question for the jury was only on boundary, and the usual charge that when such are called for in a survey or patent and proved, they terminate independently of courses or distances expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
