They cited <em>Wallen and Wife v. Evans and Wife </em>in Sussex, on a motion to nonsuit plaintiffs because the probate was made after the commencement of the action. The Court overruled it. They cited as analogous (query) Doug. 93, Peake 99.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Bassett, C.

The probate should have been produced, because we have no other evidence of a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Rodney, J., concurred.
