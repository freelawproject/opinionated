Words of a statute restrictive of the offence must be laid. Salk. 609. The name of a statute need not be set forth, but if it is and wrong in a word, it is fatal. A verdict will not mend the matter, where the gist of the action is not laid in the declaration. <em>Vide </em>4 Bac.Abr. 653, pi. 42, 43, 47. If this declaration is good, a defendant might be convicted, and yet having the very permit directed by the Act, <em>to </em>wit, from the county where the master resided.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-13\"><em>Bayard </em>and <em>Miller.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AstV\">No plaintiff or defendant is bound to show more of an Act of Parliament, or covenant, than is material for himself, 5 Com.Dig. 373. Surplusage will not vitiate, Salk. 42. After verdict court will presume everything to have been proved, that was necessary to support the action, 5 Com.Dig. 378. If an exception making part of a covenant is not set out, though bad on demurrer, is good after verdict, Esp.N.P. 300. It was not necessary for plaintiff to show it was done without permit. And a plaintiff need never lay more than he must prove.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-16\"> This case is also reported in <em>Rodney\u2019s Notes, </em>May, 1797.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-14\">Bassett, C.
