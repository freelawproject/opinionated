Defendant\u2019s attorney asks the witness a question which goes to the validity of a former bond upon the giving up of which this was taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-16\">Objected by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that no paroi averment can be made varying the condition of a bond \u2014 no inquiry can be made into the consideration of the bond, 1 Esp.N.P. 247, and defendant cannot go beyond the condition of the bond.

Wms. 128, 294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-17\">Argued by defendant\u2019s counsel that such evidence was proper under the plea of fraud, that fraud would vacate every contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>1 Burr. 396, and is always inquirable into by courts of common law in any stage of proceeding, and read 1 Term 296, <em>Walton v. Shelley, </em>to show that the consideration of the first bond was inquirable into, etc.; also 4 Bl.Comm. 441, [1] Dall. 17, 1 Esp.N.P. 249, and that common law and chancery have concurrent jurisdiction \u2014 which was denied by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who said the case of <em>Walton v. Shelley </em>was an action of debt on bond on the Statute of Usury, and upon that the consideration of the notes for which the bond was given being usurious was a good defense under the Statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">Chief Justice asked the question whether if <em>A </em>gives bond to <em>B, </em>1790; in 1791 A gives a new bond to <em>B, </em>for the same debt, the second destroys the first? It was answered by the counsel on both sides, it would not destroy the first.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b90-18\"> This case is reported incompletely in <em>Miller\u2019s Notebook, 62.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b91-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AAz\">You cannot ask the question proposed. Pow. Con. 333 is a book not cited, but is decisive of the point; the ceremony is in law such a consent as is conclusive to the party, the consideration is not to be inquired into, and this is to show that a defective bond previous to this was the consideration of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
