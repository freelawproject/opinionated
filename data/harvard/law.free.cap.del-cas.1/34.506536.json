The money was paid to the court not to Phillips Kollock; the receipt is the court\u2019s signed by their clerk. Money paid to or credit given an officer, as such, is not to be recovered of him in his private capacity, 1 Term 172, <em>Macbeath v. Haldimand, </em>and <em>idem </em>678. That an assumpsit is not implied where the presumption is taken away, 1 Esp.N.P. 86, which is clearly the case where government through an officer, a master through a servant, or a court through their clerk is entrusted or credited. If the money was paid by a void authority, and if the court received it, it is to be collected from them; and if that be impossible, it was only the fault of the administratrix and her voluntary act. That the Statute of Limitations runs against an infant who has a guardian, P.

Verdict for plaintiff for principal and interest, deducting for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Motion on Saturday, the last day of the term, by <em>Wilson </em>for a rule to show cause for new trial. The Court refused the rule then, but gave him leave to move at the next term. Defendant paid the money and so it ended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
