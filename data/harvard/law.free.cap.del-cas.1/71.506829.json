That comparison of hands is no evidence (1 Morg.Ess. 127, 128) read 2 Body Laws 143, to show a better authentication was required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-14\">Defendant\u2019s counsel were prevented from enforcing the comparison of hands by Chief Justice Read, who said Mr. Morgan\u2019s opinion without citing authorities bore little weight with him and the reason of the thing is more with the practice. Read Gilb.Evid. 17; office copies evidence without probate.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\"> This case is also reported in <em>Bayard\u2019s Notebook, 109.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-15\">Read, C.
