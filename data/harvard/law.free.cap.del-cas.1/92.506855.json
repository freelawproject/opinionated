The rule is that the hand of a witness may be proved, if the witness is proved to be dead or beyond sea, or is not to be found after strict inquiry. The case in Espinasse extends to deeds or bonds but does not extend to every other case. We think ourselves bound to say the instrument offered is not evidence, it not being under the hand and seal of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">An exception would have been taken but the plaintiff agreed it might be given in evidence, and it was read.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Verdict for plaintiff against Thompson and Ware, damages \u00a3400.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\"><em>Peery </em>urged new trials matter of sound discretion etc., [1] Dali. 234, 1 Burr. 293, 1 Bl.R. 464, 1 Bl.Comm. 390.
