He then offered in evidence a certificate of survey and plot by Samuel Hearn and Rhoads Shankland for Abraham Betts as part of the lands surveyed under the said warrant to Southy King, certifying the 30th March, 1776, as the time of surveying and 10th November, 1793, as the time of making the plot, with the Commissioners\u2019 certificate in favor of Abraham Betts dated 1st October, 1794, and State Treasurer\u2019s receipt of the 1st November, 1794, for caution money, and Recorder\u2019s seal and certificate indorsed. And proved the actual mensuration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to have been made by Rankin, a Deputy Surveyor, in 1776 of the lands in dispute and others adjoining for Southy King under the above mentioned warrant. Also that the whole survey had never been plotted, and returned. And that it is usual to make separate returns of parts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the competency of the paper. There does not appear a conveyance from King to Betts, and a survey made for the latter is not admissible under a warrant to the former. This is also but a partial execution of the warrant, which is an entire thing, and the execution of it ought to appear together; the survey is an entire act, and cannot be divided. The Commissioners were not authorized to certify except to a legal claimant, and therefore unless a conveyance is shown from King to Betts, or some descent or transfer of title, he cannot hold lands under it, 2 Del.Laws 1176. The act of the Commissioners is not binding, for they are not a court, nor organized under Section 1, Article 6, of the Constitution. In <em>McCall v. Lockerman </em>the court doubted whether the Commissioners could say that certain land is vacant. And in [-] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>v. Catts </em>the Court of Appeals would not take upon themselves to decide facts, much less then can the Commissioners assume such powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel. The objections offered to this paper would be proper before the jury, as to the legal effect of it, but they have no propriety when lodged against its competency. If a deed was shown from King to Betts, it would do away the principal objection, and shall it be said that the defect of one link in a chain of title shall destroy the competency of all subsequent productions? This would be to shut the door against the admission of circumstantial evidence and to repeal the law on the subject of presumptions, and it would be for the court to assume the whole business of deciding titles. Where a power is executed, or a. special authority exercised, the authority must be shown. But these are the official acts of the Surveyor, Commissioners, State Treasurer, and Recorder duly authenticated, and therefore are competent to be read. This is no doubt a part of the whole measured survey, and if the residue had been protracted, certificated, or returned, the production of it would be proper, but none such exists or can be produced until taken from the marked lines. The Commissioners are directed by law to certify how much each holder may have a patent for under this species of survey, and this certificate and plot is according to the Act and the practice under it. It was of little importance to insist that the Commissioners appointed under the Land Office laws are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>a court and have not power to decide whether lands be vacant or not, for whatsoever they do as Commissioners according to those Acts takes its validity from the laws under which they act. Their proceedings, being directed by statute, have the effect of legislative rather than judicial proceedings and ought to be read in evidence even with greater latitude than those of a court, because there only parties and privies could be bound. That the Commissioners have no judicial powers, and their acts therefore not conclusive, may be an argument as to the operation of the production, but not against its admission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">Booth, C.

Plaintiff\u2019s title commencing under a warrant granted him to survey five thousand acres for the use [of] the Proprietary of Pennsylvania in the year 1766, he ought to have shown himself possessed within twenty, with the usual deduction. There is no alternative; either his title did not commence with his warrant, or he is barred by the Act of Limitations. If the former is the case, then the warrant to Southy King having been obtained, as the witnesses say, for this land, and having been acted under by measuring the ground, is an appropriation of the land in 1776, which was anterior to plaintiff\u2019s survey, which was made in 1783. And Southy King having been in possession until six or seven years ago, there is a good outstanding title in his heir at law, who has been proved now living, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>plaintiff cannot recover. By the Act of 1794, c. LVII, s. 5 [2 Del. Laws 1177], plaintiff\u2019s warrant being a proprietary warrant is declared to be no grant, nor is the survey made under it in a better situation, otherwise the Act will be in most cases defeated. The plaintiff can therefore have no title, his warrant and survey being no appropriation until he has paid the caution money and obtained a confirmation of it by patent; but, even in that event, his claim is posterior to King\u2019s, for the same section expressly provides that \u201cno survey made in pursuance of such warrant shall be permitted to invalidate or in any wise call in question any person\u2019s title to any patent or other warrant\u201d etc. Southy King\u2019s warrant, being indisputably within the location of plaintiff\u2019s warrant, is therefore protected and preferred by the Act of Assembly. By the same section it is enacted [that] this species of survey shall not take from another his improvement, and such appears to have been made by King, for the person who laid plaintiff\u2019s warrant in 1783 confesses he embraced part of the ground for which defense is taken in this action, at that time cleared and grubbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel. If we can show defendant\u2019s warrant to have been invalid when plaintiff\u2019s survey was made, our survey could not invalidate it, and it is only in the case of a valid warrant that the second section can have an operation to protect it. A patent is an absolute grant, as a deed is, and passes the title; it is not so with every warrant. Although a located warrant is effectual to give a title in the first instance, a general warrant is not; it must be perfected by laying it and making a return. Of the latter kind is Southy King\u2019s warrant. A deed is ineffectual if fraudulent, though regularly sealed and delivered. A paper, though well executed, if illegal in any respect, conveys no title. In 1783 when plaintiff\u2019s survey was made, defendant\u2019s warrant being general, he had no title. It had the form but not the effect of a title pap\u00e9r, and therefore the Act cited could not protect its validity. Mr. Cannon claims but eighty-five and a half acres under a warrant which might have been laid on five thousand acres, it could not therefore have been one of those pernicious proprietary warrants, which the Act was designed to meet. We contend there has been no title under Southy King\u2019s warrant, and therefore defendant has shown no outstanding title. Nor are we affected by limitation, for our title commenced with our survey.</p>\n<author id=\"b368-6\">Booth, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD0\">(Charge.) Gentlemen of the jury, the present action which you are now to decide is brought for the recovery of eighty-five acres. It is stated plaintiff must recover by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>strength of his own title, and it must appear he has such title to the property. The defendant says first: there is a title in a third person, and has shown a warrant granted in 1776 to Southy King, and insists the title is in his descendants \u2014 if you think so, plaintiff cannot recover. Second: that plaintiff has not been in possession within twenty years \u2014 if you think he has not had such possession, he cannot recover. Third: that the proprietary warrant under which plaintiff claims is not valid. Certainly a proprietary warrant cannot vacate another warrant, and you are to decide whether Southy King\u2019s warrant was such an one as was provided for by the Act of Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Verdict not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
