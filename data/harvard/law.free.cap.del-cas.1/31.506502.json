The Court seemed willing to grant that order upon defendant\u2019s giving security etc., but <em>Bayard </em>insisted upon the impropriety of the court\u2019s granting them that order, as defendant may without such order take the Negro; but said if the Negro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>should be decreed to be free, he was entitled to recover of defendant in an action for his false imprisonment, which perhaps an order for taking the Negro would excuse; that the master\u2019s right to hold the slave ought to be contingent till trial, and at his own peril.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHA\">You need not urge such arguments; the court are sensible of the difficulties a petitioning slave is subject to, as to the defendant\u2019s being without the service of his Negro, that is not our fault, he has a right to his service until trial.</p>\n<author id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">We never take a slave out of his master\u2019s possession before trial, but where we have reason to apprehend that the master will use uncommon severities to the slave before the trial can be had, or will prevent his coming to court, or will send him out of the state, we have obliged the master to enter into a recognizance to be forthcoming for the slave, and in the meantime to use him well, and have made orders for his taking him until trial. But it is now too late in the evening to go into the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\n<em>Adjournatur.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
