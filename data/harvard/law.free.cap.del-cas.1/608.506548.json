After argument the testimony was admitted. (Hearsay good by way of illustration. MacnalEv. 360, Bull.N.P. 294.) William Kollock, another member of the grand jury, was then offered by the counsel for the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-15\">The counsel for defendant objected that a grand juryman could not be called to disclose evidence given before the grand jury; that such a course would be to stifle criminal prosecutions, as many would not give evidence to the grand jury if they were to be publicly exposed, etc. That the criminal would often escape if the evidence were exposed. The grand jury are all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>bound by their oaths not to reveal the secrets of their fellows or the counsel of the State. They cited Macnal.Ev. 253; Clayt. (anonymous case) 84, pi. 14 [0]; 12 Vin.Abr. 20, title \u201cEvidence\u201d l.-H. p. 1; <em>(et vide </em>Parker\u2019s <em>Conductor Generalis </em>525, 3 CoJnst. 107, Fin. 29, Lamb.Eiren. 402.) They cited also 4 Bl.Comm. 126. <em>(Sic vide </em>Tri. per Pais 226, my Gilb.Ev. 62, s. 79 and 80.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-5\">State in reply. This testimony would not tend to stifle but to purify the course of justice. Criminals could never escape, because it is not contended that a juror should disclose a presentment before the criminal is arrested. Here the bill has long since been returned <em>ignoramus, </em>and jury have been discharged. The oaths of the jurors do not bind them to keep such secrets forever, but only while public justice shall require it, for then only is it \u201cthe counsel of the State.\u201d The secret nature of the crime is such that evidence of it could not be obtained in any other way. The whole register in this indictment is laid before the grand jury, and you might as well permit them to demur to our indictment as to reject the evidence. If a man perjure himself before the grand jury, shall he not be punished for it? He cannot be unless the jurymen are witnesses; so here too jurymen must often be witnesses \u2014 suppose a murder by one of another, conspiracy against government, etc. The cases in Macnally\u2019s Evidence, Viner\u2019s Abridgement, and Clayton\u2019s Reports and Pleas of Assizes at York are all the same \u2014 all taken from Clayton, and he queries in the margin, stating the strong case of perjury. The counsel then have stated but one authority in point, and that is doubted. 4 Bl.Comm. 126 has nothing to do with the case; it is there said the juror shall not disclose to the person indicted etc., which is not denied.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To every oath like this there is an implied exception that the party taking it will give evidence to promote public justice.
