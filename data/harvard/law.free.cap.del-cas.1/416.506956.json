The Act of Assembly gives the same redress to Negroes as to whites. This is not attainable but by allowing them on criminal prosecutions to be witnesses. <em>Collins and Hall </em>has no application to this case, because it was between two whites. The <em>State v. Bender, ante, </em>afterwards decided in the Sessions is in point. The only difference is that that was an indictment for an assault and battery.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b484-19\"> This case is also reported in <em>Clayton\u2019s Notebook, 4; Rodney\u2019s Notes, </em>Dec. 6, 1796.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The Court (consisting of Johns and Rodney, Justices) were divided, upon which the witness was sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Sarah, being sworn, stated that there were several white persons present at the transaction she was called to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The objection was then renewed, and the Court agreed the witness was incompetent, upon which she was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">There being no other evidence against the defendants, they were acquitted by consent of Attorney General.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
