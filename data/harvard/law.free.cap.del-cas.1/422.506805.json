A general rule to take depositions before any judge or justice of the peace is confined to the state. If the party designs under his rule to take depositions out of the state, he must have it so expressed in the rule. The depositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>in the present case are not warranted by the rule under which they were taken and cannot therefore be read.</p>\n<author id=\"b491-3\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A6qs\">Depositions rejected.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
