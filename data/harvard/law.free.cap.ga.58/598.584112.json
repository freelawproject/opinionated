These documents reached the clerk\u2019s office of the supreme court on January 5th, 1877, after the return day to the present term, which was on the 26th day of December, 1876. Affidavits were submitted showing that the clerk of the superior court was unable to attend to official business from the 1st of December, 1876, until the return day was passed, on account of indisposition.</p><p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>It was replied that the papers ought to have reached the clerk\u2019s office of this court long before this indisposition commenced; that diligence on the part of counsel for plaintiffs in error, would have required them to have applied for the writ of <em>mcmclamus </em>when the clerk failed to forward said papers within ten days from the date of the filing of the bill of exceptions in the clerk\u2019s office.</p><p id=\"b599-5\">The court overruled the motion, enunciating the principles embraced in the above head-notes, and intimated very strongly, that the writ of error would be dismissed when the case should be called in its order at the next term.-</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
