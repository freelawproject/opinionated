The court overruled the demurrer, and the defendants excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The sole question made by the bill of exceptions is, did the court err in overruling the defendants\u2019 demurrer ? The object and scope of the complainant\u2019s bill, as we understand it, is to compel the administratrix of William Collins to force the sheriff of Mitchell county to collect the proceeds of the sale of the land in that county, sold under her <em>fi. fa. </em>as administratrix of Collins, against Patillo, and to compel the imrcliaser of said land to pay the amount of his bid therefor that the same may be applied to the payment of his <em>fi. fa. </em>against the intestate, William Collins. What legal or equitable right the complainant has to interfere in the manner proposed in his bill with the conduct of the administratrix of Collins in collecting the assets of her intestate\u2019s estate in the county of Mitchell, for the purpose of having his <em>fi. fa. </em>paid out of said assets, even if it had been shown that his claim against the estate was of the highest dignity, is not at all apparent to us. If the administratrix fails to perform her duty in collecting the assets of her intestate\u2019s estate, or wastes the same, to the injury of the creditors thereof, she and her securities on her administration bond are responsible for such injury. To file a bill on the equity side of the court to compel an administratrix, the sheriff, and the purchaser of property at a sheriff\u2019s sale, sold under an execution controlled by the administratrix, to bring into court the proceeds of the sale of that property so as to enable a particular judgment creditor to have the same applied to the payment of his <em>fi.fa., </em>which he had placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands to claim the money, would be a novel and extraordinary proceeding in view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the rights, duties and responsibilities of administrators of ' intestates\u2019 estates \u2014 so novel, and so' extraordinary, that we reverse the judgment of the court below in overruling the defendants\u2019 demurrer to the complainant\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
