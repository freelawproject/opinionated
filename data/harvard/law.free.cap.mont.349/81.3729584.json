Following a stipulation between Violette and the State, the District Court found Violette not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and committed him to the Department of Public Health and Human Services (\u201cDPHHS\u201d) for a period of ten years. Violette appeals, claiming the District Court erred by denying his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u00b62 We recharacterize the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u00b63 Whether Violette has a right of appeal when he was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">\u00b64 The charges in this case stemmed from an incident that occurred at the Montana State Prison on May 11, 2006. According to reports in the record, Violette drove his vehicle to the Montana State Prison and told a checkpoint officer that he was an attorney. However, instead of proceeding towards the administration building, Violette drove to the rear guard station near the prison industries building and attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>to access a secure area. During an attempt to leave the prison in his vehicle, Violette hit a patrol vehicle head-on and ultimately pinned the officer who attempted to stop Violette between the two vehicles after the officer exited his vehicle and ordered Violette to stop. The officer was able to remove his service revolver after Violette backed up his vehicle. As Violette drove past the officer, the officer fired at shot at Violette, striking him in the left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b65 Sheriffs deputies from Powell County were notified of the incident and were able to intercept Violette\u2019s vehicle by the cemetery in Deer Lodge, but Violette continued to lead officers on a circuitous route though the town\u2019s alleys and back streets. Eventually Violette drove onto Interstate 90 and proceeded towards Anaconda. Officers from Anaconda-Deer Lodge County ultimately took over the pursuit and followed Violette from Interstate 90 onto Highway 1 towards Opportunity. After a high-speed chase in which officers unsuccessfully attempted to force Violette\u2019s vehicle off the road, Violette pulled into a residential driveway in Opportunity where he was surrounded by officers and removed from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b66 Violette was charged on May 25,2006, with the offenses described above. On the same day, following a motion by defense counsel, the District Court ordered a psychological evaluation of Violette to determine whether he suffered from a mental disease or defect or serious developmental disability. Violette was evaluated and, pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, determined to be unfit to proceed by reason of mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b67 On or about October 23, 2006, the District Court received a letter from the Montana State Hospital stating that Violette was competent to proceed. The State filed a motion to proceed on February 14, 2007. On March 1, 2007, Violette pled not guilty to the charges and waived a jury trial. However, on April 6, 2007, the parties filed a stipulation in which Violette agreed to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. The stipulation provided that \u201c[s]ince the parties have in this agreement stipulated that the outcome of a trial would likely be a finding of [n]ot [gjuilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the State and the Defendant agree that this case can proceed as if a verdict of not guilty by mental disease or defect was returned after a jury or at a bench trial as articulated in Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-14-301.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b68 The District Court accepted the plea at the change of plea hearing on May 10, 2007, and found Violette not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During the hearing but immediately prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>court\u2019s formal acceptance of the plea, defense counsel made an oral motion to dismiss the case on speedy trial grounds, alleging that 203 days had passed between the time Violette was determined competent to proceed and the change of plea hearing. However, defense counsel agreed to have the plea accepted so long as the record reflected that counsel \u201craised the issue for speedy trial before the Court accepted the stipulation.\u201d The court ordered the parties to brief the speedy trial issue but did not rule on the issue or render an adverse determination prior to accepting the plea. In his briefing to the District Court, Violette argued that a speedy trial analysis was triggered by the passage of203 days from the date of the competency report on October 20,2006, to the date the court accepted his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect on May 10, 2007. Violette argued that the delay could be longer if the court considered the additional time requested by the State to file its reply brief on the speedy trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">\u00b69 The District Court denied Violette\u2019s motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds on July 27, 2007. In denying the motion, the District Court considered the time between the competency determination and the acceptance of the plea, finding a passage of 202 days. According to the court, however, the majority of the delay was \u201clargely attributable to the changing of the guard in both the Powell County Attorney\u2019s office and the office of the District Court judge.\u201d Despite finding a passage of202 days, which presumably triggers a speedy trial analysis in Montana, the District Court stated that Violette waived his right to a speedy trial by filing the stipulation with the court on April 6, 2007. The District Court nonetheless addressed Violette\u2019s argument with respect to whether he suffered prejudice as a result of the delay and determined that it was \u201csufficiently clear that there has not been the type of prejudice such as would warrant dismissal wherever the burden of proof would properly lie.\u201d On September 25, 2007, the District Court committed Violette to DPHHS for ten years with 504 days of credit for the time between his arrest and commitment. Violette appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b610 In a criminal case, the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>State v. Howard, </em>2008 MT 173, \u00b6 8, 343 Mont. 378, 184 P.3d 344. Further, \u201c[o]ur standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Ashmore, </em>2008 MT 14, \u00b6 7, 341 Mont. 131, 176 P.3d 1022).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b611 Violette\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the District Court erred by denying his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. According to Violette, \u201c[a]ll of the factors recently set forth by this Court in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, favor dismissal of this case on speedy trial grounds.\u201d However, in its response to a supplemental briefing request by this Court on the question of whether Violette was denied his right to a speedy trial under <em>Ariegwe, </em>the State contends that Violette\u2019s appeal must be dismissed on the basis that an appeal cannot be taken from a judgment of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b612 Under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, of Montana\u2019s criminal procedure statutes, \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken by the defendant only from a final judgment of conviction and orders after judgment which affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d We have previously analyzed this statute in the context of a not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect finding. In <em>State v. Kaplan, </em>275 Mont. 108, 910 P.2d 240 (1996), the defendant was charged with seven counts of stalking. Thereafter, the defendant moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that Montana\u2019s stalking statue was unconstitutional. The court denied the motion and, following a stipulation between the parties, found the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. The defendant was then committed to the Montana State Hospital. As in Violette\u2019s case, the defendant in <em>Kaplan </em>appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss. On appeal, we cited \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, and noted that the defendant was precluded from appealing because there was \u201cno judgment of conviction from which to appeal.\u201d We also noted that \u201c[t]he denial of her motion to dismiss, absent a judgment of conviction, is not itself an appealable order.\u201d Ultimately, we concluded that the defendant in <em>Kaplan </em>could not appeal from a judgment that she was not guilty by reason of a mental disease or defect and subsequently dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AVk\">\u00b613 Pursuant to our decision in <em>Kaplan, </em>Violette is precluded from appealing in this case on the same grounds. As <em>in Kaplan, </em>Violette was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, which, as previously noted, is not a judgment of conviction from which Violette can appeal under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA. Violette himself acknowledges that he was not convicted in this case. In the absence of a conviction, Violette cannot request relief from this Court in the form of an appeal when, under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, a final judgment of conviction is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>prerequisite for appellate review in criminal cases. Further, as in <em>Kaplan, </em>the denial of Violette\u2019s motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, absent a final judgment of conviction, is likewise not an appealable order. Consequently, we hold that Violette cannot appeal from the order denying his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. \u00b614 Despite this determination, defendants found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect are not deprived of other remedies or avenues of appeal. As we noted in <em>Kaplan, </em>defendants can challenge a not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect finding through the statutory framework set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-301 through -303, MCA. <em>Kaplan, </em>275 Mont. at 108, 910 P.2d at 240. Further, although a denial of a motion to dismiss absent a final judgment of conviction is not an appealable order, a defendant could seek relief from the denial of a motion to dismiss by petitioning this Court for an appropriate writ. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 14. However, even if this Court were to treat Violette\u2019s appeal as a petition for a writ, Violette\u2019s speedy trial arguments were not properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b615 As noted in the background section, Violette originally pled not guilty to the charges in this case. Thereafter, he entered into a stipulation with the State to plead not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. The stipulation was filed with the District Court a few days after being signed by the prosecution, defense counsel, and Violette. Over a month later, on May 10, 2007, the District Court held a change of plea hearing and accepted Violette\u2019s not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect plea. At the hearing, defense counsel made an oral motion to dismiss the case on speedy trial grounds, but agreed to have the plea accepted by the District Court instead of first receiving a determination on the motion from the court. Following briefing from the parties on the speedy trial issue, the District Court denied Violette\u2019s motion over two months after the Court accepted Violette\u2019s plea. Although the District Court allowed Violette to enter a plea and then brief and argue the denial of speedy trial, the parties and the courts cannot devise procedures not contemplated by the rules of criminal and appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"AbE\">\u00b616 It is well-settled that a defendant waives the right to appeal</p>\n<p id=\"AZh\">all nonjurisdictional defects upon voluntarily and knowingly entering a guilty plea, including claims of constitutional violations which may have occurred prior to the plea. <em>Hagan v. State, </em>265 Mont. 31, 35, 873 P.2d 1385, 1387 (1994). After the plea, the defendant \u201cmay only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of his plea.\u201d Hagan, 265 Mont. at 35, 873 P.2d at 1387 (citing <em>State v. Hilton, </em>183 Mont. 13, 18, 597 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>P.2d 1171, 1174 (1979) (overruled on other grounds). However, \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, allows a defendant to reserve an issue for appeal upon entering a plea agreement. Section 46-12-204(3), MCA, provides the following:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">With the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecutor, a defendant may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving the right, on appeal from the judgment, to review the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. If the defendant prevails on appeal, the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Although the above statute allows a defendant to enter a plea and reserve the right to appeal certain pre-trial rulings, it requires that the plea be a guilty or nolo contendere plea and that there be an adverse ruling on the motion prior to the plea. Here, as pointed out above, Violette did not enter a guilty plea. Furthermore, rather than seeking a continuance so the court could rule on the motion, he entered his plea without first obtaining an adverse ruling. We conclude that Violette\u2019s attempt to enter a plea and preserve the speedy trial issue, whether treated as an appeal or a petition for a writ, falls outside the letter and spirit of the rules of criminal and appellate procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b617 Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
