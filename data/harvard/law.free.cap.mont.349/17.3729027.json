(Pinnacle). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by allowing Pinnacle to present testimony in support of its motion for preliminary injunction after presenting its case-in-chief, and by issuing an injunction in reliance upon that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by granting Pinnacle\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction despite Pinnacle\u2019s failure to fully give the statutory notice of entry upon Diamond Cross\u2019 property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">\u00b65 Pinnacle holds an oil and gas lease to a portion of the mineral interests in land owned by Diamond Cross. In conjunction with the lease agreement, a Surface and Damage Agreement (SDA) between the parties gives Pinnacle the right to enter the land in order to exercise its right to drill for oil and gas. The primary term of the lease was written to expire on January 11,2008, but the term could be extended by the commencement of drilling operations on the land by Pinnacle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b66 On November 15, 2007, Pinnacle\u2019s senior landman, Larry Sare, spoke with Lonnie Wright on the telephone concerning Pinnacle\u2019s intention to commence drilling on the Diamond Cross property, and scheduled a meeting of the parties on the land to discuss the location of drilling. Lonnie Wright is a part owner of Diamond Cross, the principal shareholder\u2019s son-in law, and apparent manager of the ranchland at issue. That same day, Sare mailed a letter concerning the drilling to \u201cDiamond Cross Ranch, Attn: Lonnie Wright\u201d at Wright\u2019s address. Sare intended the letter to satisfy the notice requirements for drilling contained in \u00a7 82-10-503, MCA (\u201cPer Title 82, Chapter 10, Part 5, MCA, please be notified that Pinnacle Gas Resources (\u201cPGR\u201d) plans to begin drilling operations . . . .\u201d). However, instead of sending the letter to the address for Diamond Cross listed on county records, as required by the statute, Sare sent it to Wright\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b67 On November 27, 2007, Sare, Wright, and others met at the property to discuss access for and location of the drilling. On December 7, 2007, Sare sent another letter to Wright at Wright\u2019s address. This letter reviewed what the parties had discussed during their meeting on the property and included a check for the drilling fee of $300, as required by the SDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b68 On December 14,2007, counsel for Diamond Cross sent a letter to Sare which stated that Pinnacle had not satisfied the notice requirements under the statute and that, until Pinnacle did, Diamond Cross would consider Pinnacle a trespasser, not permit entry, and \u201cpursue all legal remedies should Pinnacle breach the peace and attempt entry onto the Diamond Cross Ranch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b69 On December 17, 2007, Sare responded by mailing a letter to Diamond Cross\u2019 counsel at counsel\u2019s law office address. Sare\u2019s letter addressed the alleged notice shortcomings mentioned in counsel\u2019s letter of December 14, and stated that drilling would begin on January 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b610 On December 31, 2007, Pinnacle filed a Verified Complaint and moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Diamond Cross from preventing Pinnacle from entering and drilling on the property. Diamond Cross filed a brief in opposition, arguing that Pinnacle failed to satisfy the statute because it had sent notice to Wright\u2019s address and to Diamond Cross\u2019 counsel\u2019s address, but not to the address for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Diamond Cross listed on county records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b611 On January 8, 2008, the District Court conducted a hearing on Pinnacle\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. Relying upon the allegations of its Verified Complaint, Pinnacle offered no evidence, but provided only argument to the court. Diamond Cross then argued that the motion should be denied because Pinnacle\u2019s Verified Complaint was insufficient under the statute to constitute evidence, noting it had warned Pinnacle of this potential insufficiency in chambers prior to the hearing. Diamond Cross further argued that Pinnacle\u2019s failure to comply with the statute left it without a right of entry. Pinnacle then requested leave to call a witness to verify the facts in the Complaint, which the District Court granted over Diamond Cross\u2019 objection. After hearing the testimony, the District Court granted Pinnacle\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction, concluding that Pinnacle would be irreparably harmed without relief and that Diamond Cross could not prevent Pinnacle from entering to drill on the land. Diamond Cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b612 \u201cThe grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is so largely within the discretion of the district court that we will not disturb its decision, barring a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Yockey v. Kearns Props., LLC, </em>2005 MT 27, \u00b6 12, 326 Mont. 28, \u00b6 12, 106 P.3d 1185, \u00b6 12 (citing <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 132, \u00b6 11, 82 P.3d 912, \u00b6 11). \u201cA manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable.\u201d <em>Yockey, </em>\u00b6 12 (citation omitted). \u201c[A] preliminary injunction does not determine the merits of the case\u201d and our analysis \u201cis not intended to express and does not express any opinion about the ultimate merits\u201d of the case. <em>Benefis Healthcare v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2006 MT 254, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 86, \u00b619, 146 P.3d 714, \u00b6 19 (internal citation and quotation omitted). \u201cIn addition, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation is correct.\u201d <em>Yockey, </em>\u00b6 12 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court err by allowing Pinnacle to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>present testimony in support of its motion for preliminary injunction after presenting its case-in-chief, and by issuing an injunction in reliance upon that testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b614 At the preliminary injunction hearing, Pinnacle initially presented no evidence, stating it would rely upon its Verified Complaint as an affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-303(2), MCA, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">(2) Upon the hearing each party may present affidavits or oral testimony. An injunction order may not be granted on affidavits unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">(a) they are duly verified; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">(b) the material allegations of the affidavits setting forth the grounds for the order are made positively <em>and not upon information and belief.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\u00b615 Noting that the allegations of Pinnacle\u2019s Complaint were verified by the President and CEO of Pinnacle \u201cto the best of my knowledge, belief and understanding,\u201d Diamond Cross objected to use of the Complaint as evidence in support of the injunction request, arguing it was insufficient under the statute. In response, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">[Counsel for Pinnacle]: [Diamond Cross] has raised a question about the sufficiency of the verification of the Complaint, so if the Court doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to call Larry Sare to the stand for Pinnacle Resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">THE COURT: All right. If you will be sworn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">[Counsel for Diamond Cross]: I guess I\u2019m going to object, Your Honor, because procedurally, you know, you don\u2019t-I didn\u2019t put anything on. So now this is rebuttal testimony to what? There\u2019s-I mean, there\u2019s nothing to rebut.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">THE COURT: [to Counsel for Diamond Cross] I\u2019m going to allow it and if you care to have some testimony, I\u2019ll allow you the same privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">[Counsel for Diamond Cross]: I appreciate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-15\">THE COURT: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-16\">[Counsel for Pinnacle]: Yes, Your Honor. I\u2019m calling Mr. Sare primarily because [Counsel for Diamond Cross] questioned the sufficiency of this verification. So I\u2019m going to have him verify it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">THE COURT: I understand. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">\u00b616 Diamond Cross argues that Pinnacle failed to present any proper evidence during its case-in-chief, and that the District Court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>permitting Pinnacle to call a witness in what was essentially Pinnacle\u2019s rebuttal, except that Diamond Cross had submitted no evidence to rebut. Diamond Cross asserts that \u201c[b]y permitting Pinnacle to call a witness at this stage of the proceeding, the district court granted Pinnacle an unwarranted second opportunity to present evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b617 A district court has general discretion to conduct the proceeding in an appropriate manner. \u201cThe order in which proof is admitted at trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Stockman Bank of Mont. v. Potts, </em>2006 MT 64, \u00b6 18, 331 Mont. 381, \u00b6 18,132 P.3d 546, \u00b6 18. \u201cA determination of whether proposed testimony is admissible as rebuttal testimony in any given case is within the sound discretion of the District Court, and we will not reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling unless it abused this discretion.\u201d <em>Massman v. City of Helena, </em>237 Mont. 234, 243, 773 P.2d 1206, 1211 (1989). Similarly, \u201c[t]he reopening of a case for the introduction of further evidence after it has been closed is within the discretion of the trial court. Its ruling upon the request to reopen will not be disturbed by the appellate court, unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Stavenjord v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2003 MT 67, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 466, \u00b6 19, 67 P.3d 229, \u00b6 19 (citation and quotation omitted). After initial production of their respective evidence, \u201c[t]he parties will then be confined to rebutting evidence unless the court, for good reasons in furtherance of justice, permits them to offer evidence in their original case.\u201d Section 25-7-301(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b618 In <em>Maxwell v. Anderson, </em>181 Mont. 215, 593 P.2d 29 (1979), the trial court allowed the plaintiff to introduce evidence of attorney\u2019s fees after its case in chief. We held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">[Appellants contend] that they were injured by the court\u2019s action by the mere fact that Maxwell was permitted to put on evidence and received an award. This has nothing to do with the injury that might result from a disorderly presentation of evidence. No showing is made that appellants were injured by the <em>manner </em>in which the evidence was presented. While reopening a case-in-chief may not be desirable, a more substantial showing of harm should be made before this is declared reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\"><em>Maxwell, </em>181 Mont. at 222-23, 593 P.2d at 33 (emphasis in original). Diamond Cross does not argue that it was disadvantaged or that unreliable evidence was admitted. We have also held that testimony presented at a hearing can overcome shortcomings in a verified complaint. <em>DeLaurentis v. Vaino, </em>169 Mont. 520, 524, 549 P.2d 461, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>464 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b619 Thus, the question is whether the District Court abused its discretion by allowing the testimony after Pinnacle closed its case-in-chief. Pinnacle rested its case upon the assumption that the Verified Complaint constituted admissible evidence. Diamond Cross challenged Pinnacle\u2019s injunction request, not upon evidence of its own, but by arguing that Pinnacle\u2019s evidence was not admissible. Pinnacle then requested the opportunity to call a witness, not with the purpose of offering new or additional facts, but to verify the information in the Verified Complaint which Diamond Cross had objected to as technically insufficient under \u00a7 27-19-303(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"APY\">\u00b620 Our review of the proceeding and the authorities lead us to conclude that the District Court\u2019s granting of Pinnacle\u2019s request was not an abuse of its discretion to conduct the proceeding before it. As such, it was permissible for the District Court to rely upon the evidence it had admitted to determine whether to issue the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b621 2. Did the District Court err by granting Pinnacle\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction despite Pinnacle\u2019s failure to fully give the statutory notice of entry upon Diamond Cross\u2019 property?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b622 Diamond Cross argues that the District Court erred by granting a preliminary injunction because Pinnacle failed to provide notice to Diamond Cross as required by \u00a7 82-10-503(1), MCA. Pinnacle responds that a preliminary injunction was proper because Diamond Cross had no right to prevent Pinnacle from entering the land under the lease, even if Pinnacle failed to give proper notice. Further, Pinnacle asserts that Diamond Cross received actual notice and that the spirit of the notice requirement was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b623 Section 27-19-201, MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that a preliminary injunction may be issued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">(3) when it appears during the litigation that the adverse party is doing or threatens or is about to do or is procuring or suffering to be done some act in violation of the applicant\u2019s rights, respecting</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The subsections of the statute are disjunctive, and a party seeking an injunction must establish a basis for relief under only one subsection. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b624 The parties contest the application of the three subsections quoted above. Under subsection (1), Diamond Cross argues that Pinnacle has no right of entry unless statutory notice is given and thus Pinnacle is not entitled to \u201cthe relief demanded,\u201d that, under subsection (2), Pinnacle will not suffer any injury, and, under subsection (3), Pinnacle has no rights which are being violated. Pinnacle responds that Diamond Cross has no right to keep it from exercising its rights under the lease and that it would suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction by being unable to extend the term of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b625 Without expressing an opinion as to the ultimate merits of the case, we review the District Court\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction to determine if it manifestly abused its discretion in concluding that Pinnacle demonstrated it was entitled to injunctive relief under at least one subsection of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA. The District Court reasoned that Pinnacle had a legal right to enter upon the subject lands as a lessee, and that it would be irreparably harmed if Diamond Cross was not enjoined from interfering with that right \u201cbecause the primary term of the subject lease is due to expire unless drilling operations are commenced ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b626 Whether Pinnacle has a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that Diamond Cross has improperly interfered with its rights under the lease requires a review of \u00a7 82-10-503(1), MCA, which provides:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">In addition to the requirements for geophysical exploration activities governed by Title 82, chapter 1, part 1, the oil and gas developer or operator shall give the surface owner and any purchaser under contract for deed written notice of the drilling operations that the oil and gas developer or operator plans to undertake. The notice must be given to the record surface owner and any purchaser under contract for deed at their addresses as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>shown by the records of the county clerk and recorder at the time the notice is given. The notice must include a copy of this part and, if available, a current publication produced by the environmental quality council entitled \u201cA Guide to Split Estates in Oil and Gas Development.\u201d The notice must sufficiently disclose the plan of work and operations to enable the surface owner to evaluate the effect of drilling operations on the surface owner\u2019s use of the property. The notice must be given no more than 180 days and no fewer than 20 days before any activity that disturbs the land surface. The surface owner may waive the notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b627 It is undisputed that Pinnacle satisfied all of the statute\u2019s requirements, except for sending the notice to the surface owner\u2019s address \u201cas shown by the records of the county clerk and recorder ....\u201d Section 82-10-503(1), MCA. Diamond Cross does not dispute that it received actual notice, but asserts that \u201c[u]ntil Pinnacle gives statutory notice, it simply does not have the right of entry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b628 Pinnacle responds that \u201cthere is nothing in [the Act], other statutes, common law, or the agreement between the parties, that allows Diamond Cross to stop Pinnacle from going onto the subject lands and commencing drilling operations.\u201d It notes that the remedy provided by statute for violating the notice requirement is the possible imposition of a penalty by the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation upon report of the violation. Section 82-10-510, MCA, states that \u201c[flailure to comply with the notice requirements of 82-10-503 subjects the oil and gas developer or operator to the provisions of82-11-122 and 82-11-147 through 82-11-149.\u201d In turn, the referenced sections give authority to the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation to impose penalties for violations of the statute. Further, \u00a7 82-10-511, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he remedies provided by this part do not preclude any person from seeking other remedies allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b629 The common law has long recognized that mineral interest holders have a right of entry and reasonable use of the surface property as necessary to exercise their mineral rights. <em>See Western Energy Co. v. Genie Land Co., </em>195 Mont. 202, 208, 635 P.2d 1297, 1301 (1981) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that the owner of the oil and mineral estate has a right to enter upon the surface of the property and make such use thereof as is reasonably required for the enjoyment of his estate therein.\u201d); <em>see also Hurley v. Northern P. Ry. Co., </em>153 Mont. 199, 202, 455 P.2d 321, 323 (1969). In addition to the common law, the lease agreement at issue here explicitly permits Pinnacle to enter the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>to exercise its mineral rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b630 Diamond Cross\u2019 apparent argument or assumption is that the common law rule has been altered by the passage of \u00a7 82-10-501, MCA, et seq. However, nothing in the plain language of the statute prohibits a mineral holder from entering the land if the statutory notice has not been given. Neither does the plain language grant the surface owner any power or right to prohibit the mineral holder from entering the property. Instead, the statute provides that, upon report of a violation, the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation may impose a penalty and, secondly, makes clear that a surface owner is free to pursue any other remedy available under the law. Thus, from an initial review, it does not appear that the statute was intended to abrogate the common law right of entry, and Diamond Cross has not pointed to any other authority which would arguably bar Pinnacle from entering the land for failure to provide the statutory notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b631 Instead, Diamond Cross argues that the statute\u2019s preservation of \u201cother remedies\u201d means that lease forfeiture has been preserved as a remedy. Diamond Cross reasons that, unlike other areas of contract law, forfeiture of oil and gas leases has long been favored, and that this Court has held that a leaseholder\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of the lease agreement requires forfeiture. <em>Solberg v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>76 Mont. 254, 246 P. 168 (1926) (developer did not begin drilling within the time specified). Diamond Cross notes we have held, because time is of the essence, that a breach consisting of a slightly late lease payment is a breach sufficient to warrant forfeiture, <em>Sandtana, Inc. v. Wallin Ranch Co., </em>2003 MT 329, 318 Mont. 369, 80 P.3d 1224 (payment to extend the term was made two days after date specified in lease), and that breach of implied covenants of the lease can warrant forfeiture. <em>Berthelote v. Loy Oil Co., </em>95 Mont. 434, 446, 28 P.2d 187, 190 (1933) (\u201cthe plain and substantial breach\u201d of implied covenants terminates the lease). Therefore, Diamond Cross asks that we declare Pinnacle\u2019s lease forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b632 While we would not be inclined to order a forfeiture in a preliminary injunction case, it is enough to point out that, although forfeiture was ordered under the cases cited by Diamond Cross for breach of a mineral lease, Diamond Cross has not alleged any breach of the lease agreement by Pinnacle. Neither has Diamond Cross cited to any case which permitted forfeiture for anything other than a breach of the lease or its implied covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b633 Upon this absence of authority from either the common law or the statute, Pinnacle has established a likelihood of success on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>claim that Diamond Cross has no right to prohibit Pinnacle from entering and drilling upon the property because of its failure to provide the statutory notice. Without reaching the ultimate merits of the dispute, we conclude that Diamond Cross has failed to establish that the District Court rendered an incorrect conclusion of law at this juncture, or that it manifestly abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction after considering the likelihood of Pinnacle\u2019s success on the merits of its claim and the likelihood of irreparable harm if relief is not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> Diamond Cross\u2019 initial objection, as expressed in its counsel\u2019s letter to Sare of December 14, 2007, was that Pinnacle had failed to \u201csufficiently disclose the plan of work and operation\u201d as required by the statute. However, Diamond Cross\u2019 objection since the commencement of litigation has been Pinnacle\u2019s failure to use the correct address for delivery of the statutory notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\"> The District Court discussed this statute during the hearing, but did not reference it in the order granting the preliminar injunction. Implicit in the District Court\u2019s order is the conclusion that this statute did not prevent Pinnacle from entering the property to pursue drilling under the lease. We review that conclusion of law for correctness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b47-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AJB\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b635 I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion on the narrow facts of this case. I do not agree with all that is said, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b636 As to Issue 1, there is no question that Pinnacle\u2019s complaint was not properly verified. It has been well settled for decades that verification \u201con information and belief\u2019 is defective because the affiant is not swearing to and signing the document on personal knowledge of the facts attested to. <em>Saunders Cash-Way, etc. v. Herrick, </em>179 Mont. 233, 587 P.2d 947 (1978); see <em>also </em>\u00a7 1-5-602(5), MCA. Here, the trial court was generous in allowing Pinnacle to cure its defectively verified complaint by giving what was effectively rebuttal testimony. Nonetheless, at least for purposes of the injunction hearing, I cannot conclude that the trial judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b637 As to Issue 2, \u00a7 82-10-503(1), MCA, permits \u201c[t]he surface owner [to] waive the notice requirement.\u201d I conclude that Diamond Cross waived statutory notice under \u00a7 82-10-503, MCA, to the extent that Pinnacle did not give notice, as required, at the address shown \u201cby the records of the county clerk and recorder at the time the notice is given.\u201d Diamond Cross, through one of its principals, Lonnie Wright, participated in oral discussions with Pinnacle\u2019s representative at the ranch, and in conjunction with those discussions accepted written correspondence and the statutory notice at Wright\u2019s address. Clearly, Diamond Cross had actual notice of Pinnacle\u2019s intentions. Therefore, under these facts, given that Wright accepted the statutory notice at his address used in other correspondence with Pinnacle, I conclude that Diamond Cross effectively waived the requirement for notice at the address in the county clerk and recorder\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b638 That said, however, I am not prepared to agree with the Court\u2019s statement in \u00b6 30, that \u201cit does not appear that [\u00a7 82-10-503, MCA] was intended to abrogate the common law right of entry ....\u201d Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>82-10-501 to 511, MCA, constitute a comprehensive statutory scheme to protect surface owners from damage and disruption of their agricultural operations. Section 82-10-501, MCA. As a result, there are severe criminal and civil penalties for violating the notice statute, \u00a7 82-10-503, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 82-10-510, MCA, and \u00a7\u00a7 82-11-147 to 149, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Aek\">\u00b639 With that in mind, \u00a7 1-2-103, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">Statutes in derogation of the common law - liberal construction. The rule of the common law that statutes in derogation thereof are to be strictly construed has no application to the statutes of the state of Montana. The statutes establish the law of this state respecting the subjects to. which they relate, and their provisions and all proceedings under them are to be <em>liberally construed with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Contrary to this statute which requires the Court to <em>liberally </em>construe \u00a7 82-10-503, MCA, the Court narrowly construes the statute by concluding that the leaseholder may enter upon the surface of the land even if the statutory notice has not been given, and that the surface owner is powerless to prohibit such entry. Opinion, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b640 It is true, as the Court observes at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, there is a harsh penalty for a leaseholder\u2019s failure to timely comply with the drilling requirements of an oil and gas lease-the lease is forfeited. However, the operator\u2019s decision to conduct its drilling operations in the eleventh hour of the lease\u2019s primary term should not, under a liberal construction of \u00a7 82-10-503, MCA, constitute a sort of self-created emergency that requires the surface owner to stand idly by, powerless to prevent the leaseholder from entering upon the surface owner\u2019s land, damaging his property, and disrupting his agricultural operations, without first complying with the statutory notice requirements. The surface owner should not have to rely on the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation or on the local county attorney to-maybe-enforce or punish the operator\u2019s lack of diligence after the fact and after the damage is done. Surface owners worked too hard to get the Legislature to enact \u00a7\u00a7 82-10-501 to 511, MCA, and to secure the protections afforded by this statutory scheme. In my view, the Legislature did intend to abrogate the common law right of entry and reasonable use, and I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s statements to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b641 Accordingly, while on the narrow facts of this case I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion, I cannot agree with its statements in \u00b6 30.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
