We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b62 G.M. is a developmentally disabled man in his mid-thirties who has been committed and recommitted to MDC for about half of his life. Cases concerning these commitments have been before this Court in the past. <em>In the Matter of </em>G.M., 261 Mont. 499, 862 P.2d 415 (1993); <em>In the Matter of </em>G.M., 2008 MT 200, 344 Mont. 87, 186 P.3d 229. In both instances we reversed the District Court\u2019s decision to recommit G.M. to MDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b63 Involuntary commitment of a seriously developmentally disabled person to a residential facility in Montana is governed by Title 53, Chapter 20, MCA. When a petition seeking commitment is filed, the district court must refer the petition to the Residential Facility Screening Team (RFST) of the Developmental Disabilities Division of the Department of Health and Human Services. Sections 53-20-125 and -133, MCA. The RFST makes a report to the court on its determination as to whether the individual is seriously developmentally disabled as defined in \u00a7 53-20-102(18), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">(18) \u201cSeriously developmentally disabled\u201d means a person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">(a) has a developmental disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">(b) is impaired in cognitive functioning; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">(c) cannot be safely and effectively habilitated through voluntary use of community-based services because of behaviors that pose an imminent risk of serious harm to self or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">The court may not consider commitment to a residential facility unless the RFST determines that the person is seriously developmentally disabled. Sections 53-20-125 and -133, MCA. <em>See In the Matter of T.W., </em>2005 MT 340, \u00b6 5, 330 Mont. 84, 126 P.3d 491. The maximum period of commitment is one year. Section 53-20-126, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">\u00b64 This appeal arises from the State\u2019s August, 2007, petition to recommit G.M. to MDC. The District Court continued his then current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>commitment and referred the matter to the RFST as provided by law. Section 53-20-133, MCA. The RFST reported on August 17, 2007 that G.M. continued to be seriously developmentally disabled and recommended that he be recommitted to MDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b65 G.M., through counsel, requested that he be evaluated at public expense by a professional of his choice. The District Court, after receiving briefs and a cost estimate of over $8,000 for the evaluation by G.M.\u2019s chosen professional, granted the request for an evaluation, but limited the cost to be paid by the county to $1,160. That figure was based upon eight hours of evaluation at the expert\u2019s $145 hourly rate. G.M. represents in this appeal that he found funds from other sources to make up the difference between the expert\u2019s estimate and the amount allowed by the District Court, and that the evaluation was completed. The complete evaluation was placed into the record below and was referred to in the District Court\u2019s order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b66 G.M. also filed pre-hearing motions asking the court to construe the term \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d as used in \u00a7 53-20-102(18), MCA, and requesting that the State be required to prove \u201cphysical facts or evidence\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt and all other matters by clear and convincing evidence. The State filed a pre-hearing motion requesting that G.M. be barred from offering evidence of licensing infractions at MDC or evidence that MDC \u201cdoes not properly evaluate or treat individuals.\u201d The District Court denied G.M.\u2019s motions and granted the State\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b67 Thereafter, the hearing in the case was vacated at the request of the parties. No facts were presented to the District Court concerning G.M.\u2019s recommitment except that the report of the RFST and the report of G.M.\u2019s chosen professional<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were placed into the record. G.M. and the State entered a stipulation that G.M. would be recommitted to MDC from August 2007 until August 2008. The parties also stipulated that if G.M. displayed no \u201caggressive or other harmful behaviors\u201d for the next six weeks, he would be referred for placement in community-based services. The stipulation also recited that G.M. did not admit that he is \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d or that he \u201cotherwise meets the criteria for recommitment,\u201d but that given the District Court\u2019s prior orders on the cost of the expert evaluation and on the respective prehearing motions, \u201cthe District Court will have sufficient evidence upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>which to recommit the Respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b68 The District Court then entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order committing G.M. to MDC for one year. The present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b69 G.M. raises the following issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">1. Whether the District Court erred in applying the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in commitment proceedings for persons with developmental disabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">2. Whether the District Court erred in limiting evidence concerning conditions and practices at MDC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">3. Whether the District Court erred interpreting the term \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d with regard to the availability of community-based services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">4. Whether yearly recommitment requires this Court to fashion a remedy to produce some other outcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">5. Whether the District Court erred in limiting the amount of public funds for payment of the evaluation professional chosen by G.M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">\u00b610 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions, including interpretations of statutes, to determine whether they are correct. <em>In the Matter of E.P.B., </em>2007 MT 224, \u00b6 5, 339 Mont. 107, 168 P.3d 662. The standard of review of a district court's grant or denial of fees and costs is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Denton v. First Interstate Bank, </em>2006 MT 193, \u00b6 19, 333 Mont. 169, 142 P.3d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">\u00b611 We review discretionary trial court rulings, including trial administration issues and evidentiary rulings, for abuse of discretion. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Pumphrey v. Empire Lath and Plaster, </em>2006 MT 255, \u00b6 9, 334 Mont. 102, 144 P.3d 813. In determining whether a trial court abused its discretion, the question is not whether the reviewing court agrees with the trial court, but rather whether the trial court acted arbitrarily. <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, 134 P.3d 45. The burden to demonstrate an abuse of discretion is on the party seeking reversal of an unfavorable ruling. <em>State v. Sheehan, </em>2005 MT 305, \u00b618, 329 Mont. 417, 124 P.3d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b612 Issue 1. The first issue is whether the District Court erred in its prehearing order that the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof would apply to the case. Since there was no hearing and G.M. ultimately stipulated to recommitment, the standard was not actually applied to any evidence in this case. By stipulating to recommitment, G.M. necessarily conceded that there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence to recommit him.</p>\n<p id=\"A-a\">\u00b613 The established rule in Montana is that in commitment or recommitment proceedings involving persons with developmental disabilities, the State bears the burden of proving the grounds for commitment by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In the Matter of WM., </em>252 Mont. 225, 229, 828 P.2d 378, 381 (1992). Adoption of this heightened standard of proof is required by the United States Constitution and is based upon the express recognition that civil commitment is a significant deprivation of liberty that requires significant due process protection. <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 425, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 1809 (1979). A standard of proof higher than clear and convincing evidence is not appropriate for commitment proceedings involving persons with developmental disabilities. <em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320-28, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 2643-47 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b614 The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Addington <em>v. Texas, </em>relied upon by this Court in <em>Matter of W.M. </em>in setting the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof, analyzed the function of a standard of proof as it relates to due process and the reasons why different standards of proof are appropriate in differing settings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">[A] civil commitment proceeding can in no sense be equated to a criminal prosecution. In addition, the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard historically has been reserved for criminal cases. This unique standard of proof, not prescribed or defined in the Constitution, is regarded as a critical part of the \u201cmoral force of the criminal law,\u201d and we should hesitate to apply it too broadly or casually in noncriminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\"><em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 428 (citations omitted). The Court emphasized that both the State and the individual have significant and legitimate interests in the commitment process that are protected by the clear and convincing evidence standard. <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b615 Montana statutes governing the commitment of developmentally disabled persons contain no required standard of proof for commitment proceedings. The hearing is held before the district court without a jury, and the maximum period of involuntary commitment is one year. Sections 53-20-125(6) and-126, MCA. G.M. argues that proof of grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>for commitment by clear and convincing evidence is not sufficient to protect the important individual rights to liberty, dignity, privacy, equal protection and due process guaranteed under the Montana Constitution. G.M. asserts that those rights can only be adequately protected by adoption and application of the statutory standard of proof found in the Montana statutes governing commitment of persons with serious mental illnesses. That statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters. However, the respondent\u2019s mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. Even though G.M.\u2019s arguments refer to this as a \u201cbi-furcated\u201d standard of proof, it more accurately contains three standards-beyond a reasonable doubt, clear and convincing, and to a reasonable medical certainty-to be applied depending upon the type of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b616 This Court has addressed the application of this multi-level standard of proof in mental illness commitment proceedings. <em>In the Matter of the Mental Health of T.J.D., </em>2002 MT 24, \u00b6 13, 308 Mont. 222, 41 P.3d 323. This Court explained that the evidentiary standard is \u201cbifurcated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">(1) with respect to physical facts or evidence, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) as to all other matters, including the existence of a mental disorder, there must be clear and convincing evidence. Under this bifurcated standard, proof of mental disorders to a reasonable degree of medical certainty is sufficient if, considered with all the other evidence in the case, the trier is led to the conclusion that the mental disorder exists by clear and convincing proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><em>In the Matter of G.P., </em>246 Mont. 195, 197, 806 P.2d 3, 4-5 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\u00b617 As a practical matter it is difficult to imagine how this standard of proof will in fact protect important constitutional rights here. If this Court were to adopt G.M.\u2019s position and impose the mental illness standard from \u00a7 53-21-126(2), MCA, the most crucial issues in a commitment proceeding, including the existence of developmental disability and cognitive impairment, would still be determined by a clear and convincing evidence standard. All medical testimony would meet the reasonable degree of medical certainty standard. Only \u201cphysical facts\u201d would be subject to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Physical facts could include whether the person can follow directions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>or whether he can use the phone, or whether some particular incident happened. Since only factual issues would come under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, adopting it would accomplish much less than G.M. asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b618 The proposed standard of proof would also make the process needlessly more complicated and confusing. The most important issues, including professional interpretation and application of the physical facts, prediction of future behavior, and proof of medical conditions, would still be considered under the standard of clear and convincing evidence or to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b619 Clear and convincing evidence is not a mere preponderance of the evidence, but is evidence that is \u201cdefinite, clear and convincing.\u201d <em>Matter ofW.M., </em>\u00b6 23. Section 27-1-221(5), MCA, defines clear and convincing evidence as that \u201cin which there is no serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence. It is more than a preponderance of evidence but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In Montana we require clear and convincing evidence for proof of a variety of important issues that also implicate individual constitutional rights. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-9-102, MCA (determination of rights of grandparent-child contact); \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA (termination of parent-child relationship); \u00a7 42-2-417(1), MCA (proof that consent to adoption was obtained by fraud or duress); \u00a7 42-2-608(l)(h)(ii), MCA (grounds for termination of parental rights); \u00a7 46-14-301(3), MCA (proof that a person previously committed upon finding of not guilty by reason of lack of mental state may not be safely released); and \u00a7 53-24-302(4), MCA (involuntary commitment of alcoholics).</p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">\u00b620 We find no legal or factual reason to conclude that application of the standard of proof advocated by G.M. would protect individual constitutional rights to any greater degree than the present clear and convincing evidence standard. The legislature has not chosen to apply the standard to developmental disability commitment proceedings, and it is not required as a matter of United States constitutional law. We therefore conclude that the District Court was correct to apply the clear and convincing standard of proof and that a proof of \u201cphysical facts\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt is not required in developmental disabilities commitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b621 Issue 2. The next issue is whether the District Court erred in limiting evidence concerning general conditions and practices at MDC, by granting the State\u2019s motion in limine. The State moved for an order precluding G.M. from introducing evidence of \u201clicensing infractions received by MDC\u201d and evidence that MDC \u201cdoes not properly evaluate or treat individuals.\u201d G.M. resisted the motion, arguing that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of any and all practices and conditions at MDC, whether or not they directly impacted or involved him, was relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b622 The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion, declining to receive \u201cevidence pertinent to the practices, rules and policies of the Montana Developmental Center or other state facilities,\u201d explaining that receiving such evidence \u201cwould be time consuming and have no practical effect on the Court\u2019s determination of whether the Respondent needs to be committed.\u201d On appeal, G.M. argues that this order caused him to forego a hearing and stipulate to recommitment, having concluded that the District Court would refuse to consider any evidence except proof of his age and the contents of the RFST report.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b623 G.M. expressly did not stipulate that he was seriously developmentally disabled or that he met the criteria for recommitment. Neither did he exercise his right to argue that he did not have a developmental disability or that he is not impaired in cognitive functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b624 Decisions regarding the relevance and admissibility of evidence are within the discretion of the district court. M. R. Evid. 401, 402. <em>Williams v. Union Fidelity Life, </em>2005 MT 273, \u00b6 39, 339 Mont. 158, 123 P.3d 213; <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 14, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326. Here, the court below determined that evidence regarding general conditions at MDC that were not designed to address the specific question before the court, whether G.M. was seriously developmentally disabled as required by Montana statute, was irrelevant and, therefore, not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b625 We are not persuaded by G.M.\u2019s contention that the order made his recommitment a foregone conclusion and that he had no alternative except to stipulate to recommitment. G.M.\u2019s chosen professional submitted an evaluation that was in excess of 50 pages, and there is nothing in the District Court\u2019s orders to indicate that the expert would not have been allowed to testify as to his opinions on G.M.\u2019s condition and the care he needed. The District Court ordered the county to pay for part of the expert\u2019s fee and the report was placed in the court record. The fact that G.M. may have been foreclosed from presenting a broad attack on the conditions or practices at MDC that did not directly involve him did not make recommitment a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d We conclude that the court\u2019s decision was not an abuse of discretion under the law and the facts presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b626 Issue 3. The next issue is whether the District Court erred in interpreting the term \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d as it relates to the availability of community-based services. A court may involuntarily commit a developmentally disabled person who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201cseriously developmentally disabled.\u201d Section 53-20-125(1), MCA. A person is seriously developmentally disabled if he or she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">(a) has a developmental disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">(b) is impaired in cognitive functioning; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">(c) cannot be safely and effectively habilitated through voluntary use of community-based services because of behaviors that pose an imminent risk of serious harm to self or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Section 53-20-102(18), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b627 The present issue arises from G.M.\u2019s prehearing motion asking the District Court to hold that he would not meet the definition of seriously developmentally disabled if he could be safely and effectively habilitated through community services, whether or not those services were actually available to him. The District Court held, in the prehearing ruling, that while there is a preference in the statutes for community-based placement, there is no absolute right to such placement, citing <em>Matter of W. M., </em>252 Mont. at 229, 828 P.2d at 381 and <em>Matter of T.W., </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b628 G.M. argued that if a community-based setting that would address his safe and effective habilitation could be described, then he was not seriously developmentally disabled under \u00a7 53-20-102(18)(c), MCA, whether or not such a setting was or ever has been actually available. He argued that if there was no community-based facility actually available that would accept him, he could not be committed to MDC.</p>\n<p id=\"AQc\">\u00b629 G.M. waived his right to a hearing and provided no proof of any alternative placement that would protect his and the community\u2019s interests and welfare or as to availability of community-based services. Therefore, our review is limited by the absence of a factual record as to whether there were community-based services available to G.M. However, the parties stipulated in the District Court that G.M. could be placed in a community facility at any time during the commitment, presumably if a facility was made available.</p>\n<p id=\"AjS\">\u00b630 The relevant statutes must clearly be read as the District Court read them to require that the community-based services referred to in \u00a7 53-20-102(18), MCA, must be services that are actually available for use. \u201cCommunity-based facilities\u201d are specifically defined as \u201cthose facilities and services that are <em>available </em>for the evaluation, treatment, and habilitation of persons with developmental disabilities in a community setting.\u201d Section 53-20-102(5), MCA (emphasis added). \u201cAvailable\u201d is also defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">(i) that services of an identified provider or providers have been found to be necessary and appropriate for the habilitation of a specific person by the person\u2019s individual treatment planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>team;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">(ii) that funding for the services has been identified and committed for the person\u2019s immediate use; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">(iii) that all providers have offered the necessary services for the person\u2019s immediate use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Section 53-20-102(1), MCA. Therefore as a matter of statutory construction, the District Court properly considered whether community-based services to safely and effectively habilitate G.M. were actually available.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b631 G.M. additionally argues that his individual constitutional rights to liberty, privacy, dignity, equal protection and due process are all violated by requiring that community-based services be actually available. However, Montana law does not provide persons with serious developmental disabilities an absolute right to placement in community-based services. District courts may not order a person to be placed into community-based services, \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, and this Court has upheld the constitutionality of that provision. <em>Matter ofT. </em>W., \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b632 In 1988, the Montana Constitution, art. XII, \u00a7 3, was amended to provide that the legislature has discretionary authority to provide economic and rehabilitative services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">The legislature may provide such economic assistance and social and rehabilitative services for those who, by reason of age, infirmities, or misfortune are determined by the legislature to be in need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Mont. Const, art. XII, \u00a7 3(3). The Constitution\u2019s specific grant of discretion as to whether to provide rehabilitative services and removal of the former mandatory duty to do so, preclude an argument that any failure to provide services is itself unconstitutional. \u201c[N]either the Constitution nor the implementing laws require the [State] to extend community-based services, much less to do so in a timely manner. Any reviewing court would be compelled to acknowledge as much.\u201d <em>Matter ofT.W., </em>\u00b6 36 (Cotter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">\u00b633 Issue 4. The next issue is whether yearly recommitment as provided by the statutes requires this Court to fashion a remedy to require some other outcome. G.M. argues that by the time each recommitment is contested, decided by the lower court, and appealed to this Court for review, another recommitment is in the works. Even if he gets a reversal from this Court as he did in 2008, he remains committed to MDC and he wants this Court to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">\u00b634 G.M. requests this Court to exercise its \u201cinherent authority\u201d to prohibit the State from seeking to recommit him unless there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201csignificantly changed factual circumstances\u201d from those that resulted in the reversal of his last commitment. In light of G.M.\u2019s stipulating to recommitment, the State has represented to this Court that it agrees not to seek recommitment of G.M. unless there are significantly changed circumstances. We therefore deem this issue settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b635 Issue 5. The last issue is whether the District Court erred in limiting the amount of public funds available for payment of the evaluation professional chosen by G.M. In the proceedings below, G.M. moved pursuant to \u00a7 53-20-112(2)(d), MCA, for an order directing the county to pay for an evaluation of him \u201cconducted by a professional of [his] choice.\u201d The State objected to the motion on the ground that no information had been presented to the District Court as to need or cost. G.M. responded that no such information had been provided because similar motions had been granted as a matter of \u201croutine\u201d in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"Ako\">\u00b636 Both sides briefed the issue, and G.M. identified his chosen professional as Dr. Michael Butz, who submitted a cost estimate of approximately $8,000 for an evaluation, exclusive of charges for any testimony. After considering the briefing, the District Court granted G.M.\u2019s motion to the extent of ordering that the county would be responsible for paying for eight hours of evaluation at a cost of $1,160. G.M. found other funds to make up the difference and was extensively evaluated by Dr. Butz, whose report was placed into the District Court record without objection by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b637 Section 53-20-112(2)(d), MCA, gives the parent or guardian of a person who is the subject of a commitment proceeding the right to have the person \u201cexamined by a professional of the parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s choice when a professional is reasonably available unless the person chosen is objected to by the respondent or by a responsible person appointed by the court.\u201d This was the section that G.M. relied upon below to support the motion, but it is not applicable because the motion was not made by a parent or guardian but was made by and on behalf of G.M. himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b638 The statute that actually applied to the situation was \u00a7 53-21-118, MCA, which is in the portion of the codes dealing with mental illness commitments, made applicable to developmental disabilities proceedings by \u00a7 53-20-112(1), MCA. Section 53-21-118(1), MCA, gives the respondent, his attorney or a friend appointed by the court the right to \u201csecure a professional person of his own choice to examine the respondent and to testify at the hearing....\u201d Subsection (2) provides that if the person wishing to secure the professional testimony can not afford to pay for it, the court \u201c[w]herever possible... shall allow the respondent a reasonable choice of an available professional person qualified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>perform the requested examination who will be compensated from the public funds of the county where the respondent resides.\u201d Under this statute, this was a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the District Court which we will not disturb without a showing of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b639 Here the District Court allowed the parties considerable latitude in presenting briefs and other materials including affidavits on this issue. Dr. Butz submitted an affidavit describing generally what he intended to do in his evaluation of G.M. along with his \u201cconservative cost estimate\u201d of $8,491, not including any court testimony. The State submitted materials from another case involving an examination by Dr. Butz in which the final public-expense bill was over $12,000, exceeding the pre-examination estimate by 50%. The State also argued that portions of the work Dr. Butz proposed to do covered items that were not at issue in the case. Further, G.M. had been evaluated extensively in 2006 by an expert of his choosing, Dr. Franczak, and the report of that evaluation was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b640 The only real issue before the District Court was how much of Dr. Butz\u2019s proposed fee the county should be required to pay, because G.M. did not need the court\u2019s permission to call Dr. Butz as a witness. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-115(2), MCA, made applicable to developmental disabilities proceedings by \u00a7 53-20-112(1), MCA. After considering these arguments and materials, the District Court ordered that only a portion (eight hours) of Dr. Butz\u2019s proposed charge be paid by the county. We note that in the context of mental illness commitments, there is a limit of eight hours on professional examinations ofrespondents. Section 53-21-123(1), MCA. While that is not one of the mental illness statutes specifically made applicable to developmental disabilities issues, it is instructive in evaluating the District Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b641 In summary, we find that the District Court properly exercised its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b642 For the reasons discussed above, the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AY0\">JUSTICES WARNER, RICE, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> The report by G.M.\u2019s chosen professional concluded that G.M. has a developmental disability and has impaired cognitive functioning. The professional also concluded that G.M. did not pose an imminent risk of harm ana should be placed in a community setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"Aud\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AzW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"A33\">\u00b643 I dissent to issue one. G.M. argues that the Court should adopt a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard as to proof of physical facts. The Court addresses this issue and concludes that there is no basis for adopting such a standard in a developmental disabilities commitment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b644 However, as the Court notes (Opinion, \u00b6 7), G.M. stipulated to a commitment and, as a result, there was no hearing and no \u201cfacts\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>presented to the District Court. I would conclude that since no \u201cfacts\u201d were presented or at issue, a ruling on what is the appropriate standard of proof is nothing more than an advisory opinion. <em>Bair Family Trust, </em>343 Mont. 138, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 183 P.3d 61.1 would defer ruling on this issue until we are presented with a case in which physical facts are at issue and the parties can address whether a higher standard of proof would make a difference in the context of a given factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b645 I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of issues two through five.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b352-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AbX\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b646 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b647 I join Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent from the Court\u2019s decision on Issue 1, standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b648 Additionally, I dissent <em>from </em>the balance <em>of </em>the Court\u2019s Opinion. I agree with the various statutory and constitutional arguments made by G.M. in his briefs on appeal. I am not going to go further than that, however, because writing a lengthy dissent and analysis here on the constitutional questions raised would accomplish little given G.M.\u2019s stipulation for recommitment. Presumably, these issues will be raised again in a future proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\u00b649 And, with respect to the stipulation, one can hardly fault G.M. for conceding his recommitment. He has already, after all, been slapped in the rear end so many times by the revolving door of Montana\u2019s recommitment process and the bureaucracy attendant thereto, <em>see In re G.M., </em>2008 MT 200, \u00b6 3, 344 Mont. 87, 186 P.3d 229 <em>(G.M. I), </em>that he can be excused for figuring, \u201cwhat\u2019s the use?\u201d in the instant proceeding. I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that G.M.\u2019s recommitment was not a foregone conclusion. Opinion, \u00b6 25. It was. <em>Infra, </em>\u00b6 50. Indeed, I expect G.M. will again be up for recommitment by the time this Opinion is handed down.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">\u00b650 Moreover, it is particularly troubling to me that the Court has upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of G.M.\u2019s attempt to submit evidence concerning the general conditions and practices at MDC. I disagree that such general conditions and practices are effectively irrelevant. Indeed, from the numerous recommitment appeals in which I have participated, I am convinced that the general conditions and practices of MDC, along with the bureaucratic process of recommitment proceedings, see <em>G.M. I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33, 36, 40, 41, 45-47, and <em>In re T.P., </em>2008 MT 266, \u00b6\u00b6 6-8, 15-17, 345 Mont. 152, 190 P.3d 313, and the trial courts\u2019 general practice of treating these proceedings as a foregone conclusion, see <em>G.M. I, </em>\u00b6 50, and <em>T.P., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9,13,18, are, fundamentally and inherently, a major part of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u00b651 Unfortunately, this approach seems to mirror the State\u2019s prevailing view of people with developmental disabilities. In its brief on appeal, arguing that mentally ill persons and developmentally disabled individuals are not similarly situated, the State adopts secondary authority for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">the cardinal difference is that mental retardation is not an illness. Mentally ill people encounter disturbances in their thought processes and emotions; mentally retarded people have limited abilities to learn. Many forms of mental illness are temporary, cyclical, or episodic. Mental retardation, by contrast, involves a mental impairment that is permanent. Thus, legal rules which focus upon the prospect of \u201ccuring\u201d mentally ill people may not address the condition of retarded people in an appropriate or useful fashion. [Internal citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">I refuse to embrace this crass and insensitive view that developmentally disabled people are essentially \u201cbroken and cannot be fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b652 Every day we encounter developmentally disabled people who go to school and colleges, who learn, who hold jobs, who earn wages, who live alone or with some assistance, who enjoy competitive sports, who have intimate relationships and who are productive members of society. See <em>e.g. Saucier ex rel. Mallory v. McDonald\u2019s Rest., </em>2008 MT 63, 342 Mont. 29, 179 P.3d 481 (a decision which, tragically, also demonstrates the darker side of how developmentally disabled people are exploited). Special Olympics is grounded in the idea that developmentally disabled people can enjoy competition and sports in the same fashion as those who are not so disabled. Perhaps mental retardation cannot be \u201ccured\u201d with our present state-of-the-art medicine, but there is no doubt that with proper, compassionate treatment and services, this condition can, at least, be ameliorated to the extent that developmentally disabled people-even those who exhibit dangerous behaviors-can enjoy a better quality of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b653 Moreover, in endorsing the argument that developmentally disabled people are \u201cincurable,\u201d the State might remember that it was not too many decades ago that mental illness was also viewed as a \u201cpermanent\u201d condition. Mentally ill people were \u201ctreated\u201d with involuntary frontal lobotomies and massive shock therapies, and were warehoused in insane asylums, often under deplorable conditions. Fortunately for those suffering from mental illness, medicine can now effectively treat most forms of this disease. We can trust that medicine will one day, likewise, find effective therapies for mental retardation and developmental illnesses as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u00b654 In the meantime, however, the system must respect the fundamental rights of dignity, privacy, liberty, health, safety, happiness, equal protection and due process that all developmentally disabled people, as Montana citizens, enjoy. Developmentally disabled people must not be condemned by their government to a paternalistic system that starts from the premise that they are broken, \u201cunfixable\u201d and \u201cincurable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b655 The Court\u2019s Opinion, however, does lead me to conclude that individual recommitment proceedings and appeals therefrom are not the appropriate forums in which developmentally disabled people might, in the future, challenge the general practices and conditions of MDC and vindicate their fundamental constitutional rights. Rather, it appears that these citizens\u2019 remaining remedies now will be a class action or action for declaratory judgment challenging not only the general practices and conditions of MDC, but, as well, this State\u2019s systemic failure to uphold the fundamental constitutional rights of developmentally disabled people and the Legislature\u2019s failure to enact a statutory scheme that requires appropriate treatment and funded services and community programs. <em>See T.P., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-23 (Nelson, J., concurring), \u00b6\u00b6 25-31 (Gray, C.J., concurring). I look forward to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b656 Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
