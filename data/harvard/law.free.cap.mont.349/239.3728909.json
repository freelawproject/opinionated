We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it affirmed STAB\u2019s decision to dismiss with prejudice the Menholts\u2019 appeal, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(d)?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b63 The matter before us arose from an assessment by the Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) of additional tax, interest and penalty on the Menholts for the tax years ending December 31,1995, through December 31, 1998. In August 2004, the Menholts contested the assessment and were referred to the DOR\u2019s Office of Dispute Resolution. The hearing examiner at the Office of Dispute Resolution requested, but did not receive, a number of documents from the Menholts\u2019 counsel pertaining to the tax years in question. The DOR then moved to vacate the hearing until it received the requested documents. The hearing examiner vacated the hearing and continued the case indefinitely, pending the receipt of the materials. In January 2006, nearly fifteen months after the initial request and after two additional requests by the DOR, the hearing examiner sent a letter to the Menholts\u2019 counsel again requesting the materials, to which the hearing examiner received no response. The DOR filed a motion to dismiss in July 2006. The Menholts again did not respond, and in August 2006 the hearing examiner dismissed the matter pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 41(b), stating the Menholts \u201cfailed to prosecute their claim in a timely manner, as amply demonstrated by the hearing file\u201d and as of the date of the order, \u201cno answer [had] been received from the Taxpayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u00b64 The Menholts immediately appealed the hearing examiner\u2019s dismissal of the matter to STAB. In February 2007, after an initial scheduling conference via telephone with both attorneys, the DOR sent a letter proposing a discovery schedule and also sent its \u201cFirst Combined Discovery Requests\u201d to the Menholts\u2019 counsel. The DOR did not receive a response from the Menholts\u2019 counsel and did not receive the requested documents. Accordingly, the DOR filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>dismiss pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(d). Thereafter, STAB granted the DOR\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201c[biased on the overwhelming evidence of a failure by counsel to prosecute this case on behalf of the taxpayer ....\u201d \u00b65 The Menholts subsequently petitioned the District Court for judicial review of STAB\u2019s dismissal order. In December 2007, the District Court affirmed STAB\u2019s decision stating that the record \u201cprovided STAB with sufficient evidence to support its Order dismissing Petitioners\u2019 appeal based upon Petitioners\u2019 complete failure to provide Respondent with the requested documents and answers to interrogatories.\u201d The Menholts now appeal the District Court\u2019s order affirming STAB\u2019s dismissal of their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b66 We review a trial court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under M. R. Civ. P. 37(d) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Neal v. Nelson, </em>2008 MT 426, \u00b6 16, 347 Mont. 431, 198 P.3d 819. We consider whether the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason, in view of all the circumstances, ignoring recognized principles resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Linn v. Whitaker, </em>2007 MT 46, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 131, 152 P.3d 1282 (citation and internal quotation omitted). Furthermore, we will afford great deference to a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions because \u201cthe trial judge is in the best position to know...which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court.\u201d <em>Xu v. McLaughlin Research Institute for Biomedical Science, Inc., </em>2005 MT 209, \u00b6 17, 119 P.3d 100, 328 Mont. 232 (quoting <em>Smart v. Molinario, </em>2004 MT 21, \u00b6 8, 319 Mont. 335, 83 P.3d 1284). The trial judge is also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate. <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it affirmed STAB\u2019s decision to dismiss with prejudice the Menholts\u2019 appeal, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(d)?</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b68 The argument we have discerned from the page and a half that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>comprised the substantive part of the Menholts\u2019 brief is an assertion that STAB violated \u00a7 15-2-201, MCA, and Admin. R. M. 2.51.201 by dismissing the Menholts\u2019 appeal without first conducting a hearing. Other than the mention of these two Rules, counsel for the Menholts fails to cite to any relevant authority to support this contention or to provide any analysis applying the rules to the facts at hand. The Menholts\u2019 counsel also fails to address the application of the rules of discovery or the facts surrounding the dismissal of the appeal under M. R. Civ. P. 37(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b69 Conversely, DOR argues the District Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing discovery sanctions pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(d), and the court properly dismissed the Menholts\u2019 appeal because the Menholts never responded to DOR\u2019s discovery requests. Furthermore, DOR argues that, in dismissing the Menholts\u2019 appeal, \u201cSTAB exercised sound, conscientious judgment given the undisputed facts ... which showed that ever since [the] Menholt[s] filed [their] appeal with [the Office of Dispute Resolution] in 2004, [the] Menholt[s] refused to support [their] position that the Department\u2019s assessment was either inaccurate or untimely, and wholly ignored formal discovery requests made by the Department.\u201d DOR concludes that \u201c[b]ecause [the] Menholt[s] never responded to the Department\u2019s First Combined Discovery Requests, STAB properly dismissed [the] Menholt[s\u2019] appeal pursuant to Rule 37(d)....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b610 \u201cThe purpose of discovery is to promote the ascertainment of truth and the ultimate disposition of the lawsuit in accordance therewith.\u201d <em>Richardson v. State, </em>2006 MT 43, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 231, 130 P.3d 634 <em>(citing Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 507, 67 S. Ct. 385, 392 (1947)). \u201cDiscovery fulfills this purpose by assuring the mutual knowledge of all relevant facts gathered by both parties which are essential to proper litigation.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b611 Since 1981, we have consistently held that discovery abuses will not be dealt with leniently. <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Owen v. F.A. Buttrey, </em>192 Mont. 274, 627 P.2d 1233 (1981)). As our jurisprudence indicates, this Court has a \u201clow tolerance attitude toward discovery abuses.\u201dZ\u00ab, \u00b6 20. Accordingly, we have \u201crepeatedly affirmed the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal with prejudice, by various district courts for discovery rule violations.\u201d <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b612 The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provide an appropriate remedy for discovery rule violations, including giving district courts the discretion to dismiss a litigant\u2019s action when the rules of discovery are violated. M. R. Civ. P. 37(d) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">[i]f a party ... fails ... (2) to serve answers or objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>interrogatories submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of the interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request, the court in which the action is pending on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Those authorized actions include \u201cdismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof....\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b613 It is clear from the record before this Court that the Menholts\u2019 counsel has blatantly ignored and failed to respond, either appropriately or at all, to repeated requests by the DOR for the production of information relevant to the Menholts\u2019 case. At each level of this action, counsel was asked to provide documents and either provided assurances that he would provide the documents and did not do so, or completely ignored the requests. As discussed above, this Court has a low level of tolerance for discovery abuses. We also give wide deference to the trial judge\u2019s discretion in sanctioning attorneys for discovery abuses because \u201cthe trial judge is also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate.\u201d <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b614 The District Court based its affirmation of STAB\u2019s dismissal of the Menholts\u2019 appeal on the record before it, which the District Court determined \u201cprovided STAB with sufficient evidence to support its Order dismissing Petitioners\u2019 appeal based upon Petitioners\u2019 complete failure to provide Respondent with the requested documents and answers to interrogatories.\u201d Counsel for the Menholts had numerous opportunities to comply with the rules of discovery throughout the various stages of this action. However, over the span of more than three years, counsel repeatedly failed to respond to discovery requests, even after assuring opposing counsel that he would do so. Most recently, counsel failed to respond to the DOR\u2019s \u201cFirst Combined Discovery Requests.\u201d As stated in the plain language of M. R. Civ. P. 37(d), if a party fails to serve answers or objections to interrogatories or a written response to a request for inspection of documents, the court may dismiss the action. It was clearly within the District Court\u2019s discretion to affirm STAB\u2019s dismissal of the Menholts\u2019 appeal. Furthermore, this type of non-compliance with discovery procedures prejudices the opposing party by withholding information necessary to move forward and prosecute the case. It is precisely this type of behavior the rules of discovery are designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b615 We also point out that the Menholts\u2019 brief is wholly inadequate. Not only does Menholts\u2019 counsel fail to present any relevant authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the brief is devoid of any analysis of the issues, and nowhere does counsel address his non-compliance with the rules of discovery. Rather, he makes an unsupported assertion that STAB erred in dismissing the appeal without granting the Menholts a hearing. The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure clearly state the argument portion of a brief presented to this Court \u201cshall contain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefore, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record relied on ....\u201d M. R. App. P. 12. This Court has repeatedly held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments and we are under no obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, 53 P.3d 1266. Accordingly, we decline to address further the Menholts\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASe\">\u00b616 The Menholts fail to demonstrate on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion by affirming STAB\u2019s dismissal of their appeal under M. R. Civ. P. 37(d). Thus, we hold the District Court\u2019s action affirming STAB\u2019s dismissal of the Menholts\u2019 appeal was well within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> The DOR has adopted model procedural rules.
