Before he was sentenced, Tyler moved to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming he discovered new evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>thus good cause existed for the District Court to grant his motion. The District Court denied his motion. Tyler appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding good cause did not exist to grant Tyler\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b63 In December 2005, police responded to a report of a disturbance at Lori Williams\u2019 residence. Williams told the officers her boyfriend, Tyler, struck her in the face. She stated Tyler also pushed and kicked her and showed the officers an abrasion on her leg. Williams said she chased Tyler off with her shotgun. While on scene, one of the officers witnessed Tyler toss a glass pipe onto a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b64 The State charged Tyler with one count of partner or family member assault and one count of criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Tyler initially pled not guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b65 A couple of weeks later, Williams met with a deputy county attorney and an investigator employed by the public defender\u2019s office who was working with Tyler\u2019s attorney. During this interview, Williams told Tyler\u2019s investigator that he did not hit her, she did not want to press charges, and she wanted the charges against Tyler dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b66 Three months later, Tyler pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement. During the colloquy with the judge at the change of plea hearing, Tyler confirmed he entered the plea agreement and waiver of rights \u201cfreely and voluntarily.\u201d Tyler then admitted he had been in possession of drug paraphernalia and that he struck Williams \u201cin the face in violation of the law.\u201d The District Court accepted Tyler\u2019s guilty plea and scheduled a sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u00b67 Williams appeared at Tyler\u2019s sentencing hearing and requested to speak to the court. She essentially reiterated what she told the investigator a few months earlier-she started the argument, the police misquoted her allegations that Tyler hit her, Tyler did not hit her, and she did not have any marks on her body. Even after the court asked her to step down, she continued, \u201cAndrew didn\u2019t hit me. He actually refrained and I want to give him credit for that. He has a good heart and he is a good man.\u201d She then asked the court to lift the \u201cno-contact order\u201d so she and Tyler could resume their friendship.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\u00b68 After Williams\u2019 testimony, the State outlined its recommendations for both counts. However, the court continued the hearing before it imposed its sentence because of a misunderstanding concerning the drug paraphernalia charge. When the sentencing hearing reconvened, Tyler made an oral motion to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>innocence. Tyler said he pled guilty because he received legal advice to the effect that if he did so, he would not have to go to jail. According to Tyler, the court should allow him to withdraw his guilty plea because good cause was established when Williams recanted from the witness stand at the beginning of the hearing, constituting new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b69 The District Court denied Tyler\u2019s motion concluding that he pled guilty voluntarily and knowingly and that Williams\u2019 testimony was not new evidence because it could have been discovered with any amount of diligence simply by interviewing Williams. Tyler appeals, again arguing that Williams\u2019 testimony at the sentencing hearing is new evidence establishing good cause to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo because whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b611 \u201cA plea of guilty is constitutionally valid only to the extent it is voluntary and intelligent.\u201d <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 214, 108 P.3d 500; <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 618, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 1609 (1998) (internal quotes omitted). The ultimate test for withdrawal of a guilty plea is whether it was voluntary. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b612 Section 46-16-105(2), MCA, permits withdrawal of a plea of guilty if good cause is shown. In addition to voluntariness, the discovery of new evidence may be considered good cause. <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>United States v. Turner, </em>898 F.2d 705, 713 (9th Cir. 1990) (determining \u201cfair and just\u201d reasons for withdrawal of guilty pleas include an inadequate colloquy, \u201cnewly discovered evidence, intervening circumstances or any other reason for withdrawing his guilty plea that did not exist when he pleaded guilty\u201d) (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"AHj\">\u00b6 13 Tyler argues, without citation to authority, that because Williams\u2019 statements at the sentencing hearing were under oath and on the official court record, they constitute new evidence. This, according to Tyler, is because Williams\u2019 statements made in court somehow carry more weight than her initial story to the police made just after the incident in question. Not only is this argument illogical, we do not consider unsupported arguments and are under no obligation to do legal research for a party. <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>2008 MT 328, \u00b6 12, 346 Mont. 150, 194 P.3d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b614 In <em>State v. Clark, </em>2005 MT 330, \u00b6 34, 330 Mont. 8, 125 P.3d 1099, we set forth five factors which are considered in analyzing a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>a new trial based on newly discovered evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">(1) the evidence must have been discovered since the defendant\u2019s trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">(2) the failure to discover the evidence sooner must not be the result of a lack of diligence on the defendant\u2019s part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">(3) the evidence must be material to the issues at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">(4) the evidence must be neither cumulative nor merely impeaching; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">(5) the evidence must indicate that a new trial has a reasonable probability of resulting in a different outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">We extended use of these same factors to consideration of petitions for postconviction relief based on newly discovered evidence in <em>Crosby v. State, </em>2006 MT 155, \u00b6 20, 332 Mont. 460, 139 P.3d 832. In this case, we utilize the <em>Clark </em>factors to determine whether Tyler presented newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish good cause to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">\u00b615 Under the first <em>Clark </em>factor, we consider whether Tyler knew before he pled guilty that Williams recanted her allegations that he assaulted her. Nowhere in the record before the District Court or in this Court does either Tyler or his attorneys unequivocally state Tyler was unaware Williams recanted before he pled guilty. In his brief filed in this Court, appellate counsel, rather than clearly stating what trial counsel\u2019s file shows, merely says counsel for Tyler could have, and \u201cprobably did\u201d interview Williams. The District Court record contains an affidavit from Tyler\u2019s investigator stating Williams met with her months before Tyler pled guilty and Williams recanted at that time. From the record before this Court, we must conclude Tyler was well aware Williams recanted before he pled guilty. Thus, the fact that she had done so is not newly discovered evidence. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">\u00b616 Neither Tyler nor his trial counsel informed the District Court his investigator took a statement from Williams wherein she recanted before Tyler pled guilty. Rather than being candid with the District Court, Tyler based his motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the misleading argument that good cause existed because Williams recanted on the witness stand at the sentencing hearing. Nevertheless, the District Court concluded Tyler failed to establish good cause to withdraw his guilty plea, based on newly discovered evidence, because the alleged new evidence could easily have been discovered with any amount of diligence by simply interviewing Williams. Under the circumstances, the District Court was justified in denying Tyler\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"AWFf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u00b617 The record clearly shows Tyler entered his guilty plea voluntarily and that he presented no new evidence to the District Court showing good cause to withdraw his guilty plea. The District Court did not err in denying Tyler\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"AUR\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-4\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
