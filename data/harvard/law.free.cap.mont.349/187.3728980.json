He later moved to withdraw his guilty plea, and the District Court denied his motion. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented for our review is whether the District Court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\u00b63 In May 2007, the State charged Appellant Shaun Wise, a/k/a Shanadoa Johnson (Wise), with felony elder abuse by way of exploitation, \u00a7\u00a7 52-3-803 and 52-3-825, MCA, and felony criminal mischief, \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA. The State charged Wise by Information and relied on an affidavit alleging that Wise and his brother scammed an eighty-six year old woman by performing fraudulent house repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"Av0\">\u00b64 The affidavit related that the victim contacted the police in response to a news release about other elder abuse investigations concerning Wise\u2019s reported brother. The affidavit states that Wise and his brother had contacted the victim about sealing her asphalt driveway. She agreed to their quoted price, but the brothers raised the price after the work began and she paid them a greater sum. The brothers then told the victim that the roofs of three of her barns were leaking and offered to repair them. As with the asphalt work, the brothers initially quoted a low price, but increased the price as the work progressed. The victim paid the brothers a much higher amount, but they continued to press her for money. She eventually paid them an additional amount to get them to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u00b65 The affidavit further stated that the work on both the asphalt and the roofs was substandard. Additionally, the affidavit stated that in the process of \u201cfixing\u201d the roofs the brothers actually caused damage to at least one roof, necessitating replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b66 On June 6, 2007, Wise appeared in court and changed his plea to guilty for the criminal mischief charge, acting against the advice of his counsel. The State and Wise reached an oral agreement that the State would dismiss the elder abuse charge if Wise pled guilty to criminal mischief and agreed to pay restitution for the damage he caused to the victim\u2019s roof and for all the money he received from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b67 Before accepting Wise\u2019s plea, the following exchange occurred between Wise and the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">THE COURT: And can you tell me in your own words, then, what you did that you are pleading guilty to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Me and my brother, we did some work for Mrs. Jensen. We painted some barn roofs, and evidently we messed up, didn\u2019t do it correctly, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">THE COURT: Do you agree that you damaged the roof of a barn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARB\">THE DEFENDANT: Yeah. I mean-according to what I\u2019ve seen, yes, sir. I do apologize. I mean-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">THE COURT: All right. The Court finds there is a factual basis for the criminal mischief charge. The plea has been knowing, voluntarily and intelligently entered. It is accepted. The Defendant is found guilty as charged to criminal mischief, a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u00b68 The District Court conducted a sentencing hearing on July 18, 2007, and sentenced Wise to the Department of Corrections for ten years with five years suspended, to be run concurrently with Wise\u2019s sentence from another case. At the end of the hearing, Wise stated that he wanted to withdraw his plea. Wise\u2019s counsel told the court that \u201cI believe in the colloquy he did not adequately admit guilt sufficient to be convicted of criminal mischief. He said at the time that he was on the roof and he regretted that they damaged it, but he didn\u2019t admit that he intentionally went up there for the purpose of doing damage.\u201d The parties briefed the issue and the court denied Wise\u2019s motion to withdraw on November 5, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">\u00b69 Section 46-16-105(2), MCA, states that a \u201ccourt may, for good cause shown, permit the plea of guilty ... to be withdrawn ....\u201d An involuntary plea can constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d to withdraw the plea, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u201cgood cause\u201d can be found for reasons other than voluntariness. <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 326 Mont. 214, 108 P.3d 500. \u201cWhen the voluntariness of the plea is at issue, we will review that ultimate mixed question of law and fact de novo, to determine if the trial court was correct in holding that the plea was voluntary.\u201d <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254 (emphasis omitted). \u201cIf there is any doubt that a plea is involuntary, the doubt should be resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>State v. Schaff, </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 421, 958 P.2d 682 (overruled on other grounds, <em>State v. Deserly, </em>2008 MT 242, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 468, 188 P.3d 1057).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err by denying Appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b611 Wise argues that there was an insufficient factual basis for his guilty plea, and that this shortcoming ultimately caused his plea to be involuntary. Wise asserts that there was not a sufficient factual basis for his guilty plea because there was no evidence that he knowingly or purposely caused the damage, demonstrating that the court\u2019s interrogation was inadequate and that his plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b612 Section 46-12-212, MCA, requires a trial court to determine the factual basis for a guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">(1) The court may not accept a guilty plea without determining that there is a factual basis for the plea in charges of felonies or misdemeanors resulting in incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">(2) A defendant who is unwilling to admit to any element of the offense that would provide a factual basis for a plea of guilty may, with the consent of the court, enter a plea of guilty or may, with the consent of the court and the prosecutor, enter a plea of nolo contendere to the offense if the defendant considers the plea to be in the defendant\u2019s best interest and the court determines that there is a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u00b613 Section 45-6-101(1), MCA, states that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of criminal mischief if the person knowingly or purposely ... injures, damages, or destroys any property of another ....\u201d At the plea hearing, Wise plead guilty to criminal mischief and acknowledged that he caused damage to the victim\u2019s roof. However, his acknowledgement of causing damage did not include any indication of criminal intent or culpability. Indeed, his statements that \u201cevidently we messed up\u201d and \u201caccording to what I\u2019ve seen\u201d imply that he was not even aware of the damage until a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"Amr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u00b614 \u201cA court \u2018need not extract an admission from the defendant of every element of the crime in order to establish a factual basis for the guilty plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Frazier, </em>2007 MT 40, \u00b6 20, 336 Mont. 81, 153 P.3d 18 (quoting <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2005 MT 234, \u00b6 22, 328 Mont. 397, 121 P.3d 521). \u201cHowever, the court must ascertain, from admissions made by the defendant at the plea colloquy, that the acts of the defendant, in a general sense, satisfy the requirements of the crime to which he is pleading guilty.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"Adk\">\u00b615 Although initially charged with elder abuse by exploitation, that charge was dismissed as part of the plea bargain. The general facts underlying the charge that Wise pled to, criminal mischief, involve a not uncommon situation: a building contractor whose construction work has been called into question. But more than quality of the work, the charge against him also called into question his intentions toward the work and the customer. Shoddy work, without more, does not constitute the crime of criminal mischief. Yet, the colloquy barely elicited an acknowledgement from Wise that his work was faulty, let alone demonstrate an intention to commit a criminal act by establishing his mental state. Thus, the colloquy failed to demonstrate that \u201cthe acts of the defendant, in a general sense, satisfy the requirements of the crime ....\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b616 We consider \u201ccase-specific considerations\u201d in determining whether a plea was entered voluntarily, including \u201cthe adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation, the benefits obtained from a plea bargain, the withdrawal\u2019s timeliness, and other considerations that may affect the credibility of the claims presented.\u201d <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 166, 176 P.3d 1057 <em>(citing Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b617 Here, the colloquy was clearly inadequate and Wise made a timely request for withdrawal. We have said that \u201c[a] significant part of the voluntariness inquiry is an evaluation of the court\u2019s plea colloquy with the defendant....\u201d <em>State v. Chase, </em>2006 MT 13, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 1, 127 P.3d 1038 (overruled on other grounds, <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 12). Wise simply did not \u201cown up\u201d to a criminal intention required by the charge. Although the State cites to the affidavit filed in support of the Information, the information provided therein was either directed toward the dismissed exploitation charge, or simply discussed the damage Wise caused, again without indicating that there was a criminal design to cause the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"Anq\">\u00b618 The District Court incorrectly concluded that there was a factual basis for Wise\u2019s plea, a violation of \u00a7 46-12-212(1), MCA, which casts doubt on the voluntariness of Wise\u2019s plea, and which he timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>moved to withdraw. Because we resolve doubt about the voluntariness of a plea in a defendant\u2019s favor, we hold that the case-specific considerations warrant withdrawal of the plea. We reverse the District Court\u2019s denial and remand the case to the District Court so that it may grant Wise\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
