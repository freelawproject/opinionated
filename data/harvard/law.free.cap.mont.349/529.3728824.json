Johnson (Johnson) appeals from an order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, that required Johnson to pay District VII, Human Resources Development Council (HRDC) $16,612.09 in loan principal and interest, attorney fees, costs, and accrued interest. Johnson\u2019s appeal requires us to resolve the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u00b62 Whether the District Court correctly converted HRDC\u2019s counterclaim of mutual mistake to an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly denied Johnson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly granted affirmative relief to HRDC on its counterclaim of mutual mistake when the court deemed the counterclaim to be an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">\u00b65 Johnson applied for a loan with HRDC to purchase an assisted living facility. Denise Jordan (Jordan), HRDC\u2019s loan officer, processed Johnson\u2019s loan application and determined that HRDC would require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>extra security on the loan. Johnson agreed to a second mortgage on her home and a lien on her business equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b66 Johnson received a letter from Jordan on February 20, 1998, notifying her that HRDC\u2019s loan review board had approved the loan at a 13% fixed interest rate. Jordan prepared all the loan documents including the loan agreement, promissory note (note), and Montana trust indenture.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b67 Johnson and HRDC signed a loan agreement on February 26, 1998. The terms of the agreement included the principal sum of $21,661, for a five-year term with monthly payments at an interest rate of 13% per annum. Johnson and HRDC also signed the note on February 26,1998. The terms of the note included the correct principal sum of $21,661 and monthly payments in the amount of $362.23 for sixty months. The note incorrectly listed an interest rate of <em>0.13% </em>per annum. Johnson conveyed her home by issuing a deed of trust on February 26, 1998, that listed First Montana Title Company (FMTC) as the trustee and HRDC as the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u00b68 Johnson discovered the interest rate error in March 2001 when she applied for a real estate loan. Johnson testified that she called HRDC about the discrepancy in the loan payoff amount. Johnson contended that Jordan asked her to sign new loan papers to repay the $16,000 deficiency at a nine percent interest rate. Johnson understood her balance at that time to be approximately $8,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\u00b69 Johnson further testified that she had been willing to pay half of the $16,000 on the grounds that the mistake had not been hers and that she timely had made her monthly payments. Johnson claimed that Jordan failed to return her telephone calls and that Jordan eventually referred her to HRDC\u2019s counsel, Peter Stanley (Stanley). Johnson testified that Stanley informed her that the error was a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error,\u201d a mutual mistake, and thus Johnson owed the entire $16,000 loan balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">\u00b610 Jordan testified that she had discovered the discrepancy in interest rates at approximately the same time as had Johnson. She immediately contacted Stanley. Jordan testified that she had made the mistake in interest rates and monthly calculations due to her unfamiliarity with HRDC\u2019s newly acquired lending software. She simply had input the information incorrectly. Jordan denied Johnson\u2019s claim that she had offered Johnson a change in the loan\u2019s terms. She lacked authority to approve such a change without approval from the loan committee or HRDC\u2019s executive director. Jordan admitted, however, that she had been willing to compromise with Johnson on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>extending the length of the payment and reducing the interest rate on future payments based on the authority of the executive director.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b611 Jordan further testified that Johnson made her last payment of $362.23 on March 5, 2003, leaving an outstanding loan balance of $11,066.44. Jordan calculated the 13% interest rate on that balance from March 5, 2003, through January 8, 2007, to yield an accrued interest amount of $5,545.65. Jordan thus calculated $16,612.09 as the total loan amount due. Jordan acknowledged that she was unaware of any demands by HRDC upon Johnson to pay any interest after her last payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b612 Johnson requested both FTMC and HRDC to release the lien on her home about two years after her final payment. FTMC refused. FTMC required a reconveyance request from HRDC and proof that Johnson had satisfied the loan. HRDC refused to request a reconveyance or release the trust indenture mortgage on Johnson\u2019s home until Johnson repaid the full amount of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u00b613 Johnson filed a complaint for damages on February 10, 2006, based upon HRDC\u2019s failure to reconvey her property and other actual damages arising from the lost potential to purchase and sell another piece of property due to the encumbrance on her property. HRDC denied Johnson\u2019s entitlement to damages and filed a counterclaim in which it alleged mutual mistake. HRDC claimed that Johnson knew of the clerical error in the note and sought payment of the note\u2019s full amount and allowable attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b614 Johnson moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of HRDC\u2019s liability. Johnson argued that the court should enforce the note\u2019s plain language. Johnson further asserted that the two-year statute of limitations had run on HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim. HRDC asserted that the 0.13% interest was a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error\u201d and that the court may correct a mutual mistake made in the preparation of a legal document. HRDC argued that the longer eight-year statute of limitations for action on a written document should apply to its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00b615 The District Court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The court determined that HRDC improperly had designated its claim of \u201cmutual mistake\u201d as a counterclaim. The court determined instead that the alleged \u201cmutual mistake\u201d constituted an affirmative defense for which no statute of limitations applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">\u00b616 The District Court held a trial on January 8, 2007. The court determined that Johnson knew before applying for the loan that HRDC offered a 13% interest rate. The court opined that Johnson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>claim of 0.13% interest rate conflicted with the nature of HRDC-to offer funds to high-risk borrowers. The court further determined that Johnson had signed the loan agreement and that she had accepted the 13% interest rate. As a result, the court concluded that Johnson knew, or suspected, that the rate offered on the note mistakenly listed the interest rate at 0.13%.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b617 The court ruled that Johnson\u2019s loan remained due and owing and therefore Johnson suffered no actual damages from HRDC\u2019s refusal to release the Montana trust indenture from her property. The court proceeded to revise the note pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA. This statute allows a revision when a party has committed a unilateral mistake that the other party knew, or suspected, at the time of contracting. The court concluded that 13% per annum over the five-year term of the loan constituted the appropriate interest rate to be listed on all documents involved in the transaction. The court held Johnson to be liable for the unpaid balance of $16,612.09. The court recognized that the note allowed HRDC to collect attorney fees and costs. The court\u2019s judgment included an award of $6,075 in attorney fees, $115 in costs, plus interest to HRDC. Johnson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b618 We review de novo the District Court\u2019s decision to convert HRDC\u2019s counterclaim to an affirmative defense. <em>Yellowstone County v. Drew, </em>2007 MT 130, \u00b6 11, 337 Mont. 346, 160 P.3d 557. We review for correctness the district court\u2019s application of the statute of limitations. <em>Wing v. State ex rel. Dept. of Transp., </em>2007 MT 72, \u00b6 9, 336 Mont. 423, 155 P.3d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b6 19 The unorthodox procedural history in the District Court continues on appeal as HRDC failed to file a brief. We must decide this matter solely on Johnson\u2019s brief and our review of the District Court record. As a result, the Court has been forced to look to legal authorities far beyond those presented by the parties to reach the correct result in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the District Court correctly converted HRDC\u2019s counterclaim of mutual mistake to an affirmative defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\u00b621 The District Court relied upon M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) to support its decision to convert HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim to an affirmative defense. Rule 8(c) permits a court to consider a mistakenly designated counterclaim to be an affirmative defense \u201cif justice so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>requires.\u201d The court determined that justice required it to treat HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim as an affirmative defense to avoid applying the two-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, to HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b622 Section 27-2-203, MCA, provides for a two-year period for the initiation of an action for relief on the grounds of fraud or mistake. The cause of action accrues upon discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts that constitute the fraud or mistake. Section 27-2-203, MCA. In <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Swanson, </em>240 Mont 435, 784 P.2d 919 (1990), the purchasers of real property brought an action to reform or rescind a property contract based on mistake. We determined that mutual mistake was the essence of the action and applied the two-year statute of limitations pertaining to actions seeking relief on the ground of mutual mistake. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>240 Mont. at 442, 784 P.2d at 923. Similarly, <em>in Naftco Leasing Ltd. v. Finalco, Inc., </em>254 Mont. 89, 92-93, 835 P.2d 728, 730-31 (1992), the plaintiffs filed an action to reform lease agreements based upon a mutual mistake discovered more than five years after executing the lease agreements. This Court cited <em>D\u2019Agostino </em>and affirmed that \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, barred the plaintiffs action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b623 HRDC is the aggrieved party in this case. Its counterclaim alleged a mutual mistake. The question arises, therefore, when HRDC learned of the mistake. The parties executed the loan agreement and note on February 26,1998. The loan agreement provided a 13% interest rate. The promissory note and accompanying payment coupons provided a O.13% interest rate. Johnson and Jordan testified that they separately discovered the mistake in March 2001. Stanley acknowledged the mistake in writing on July 20, 2001, and informed Johnson that approximately $16,000 remained due. Thus, HRDC discovered the mutual mistake no later than July 20, 2001. The two-year period prescribed in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, would have expired in 2003. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>240 Mont. at 442, 784 P.2d at 923. HRDC waited until March 27, 2006, to file its counterclaim based upon mutual mistake. The two-year limitations period contained in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, would have barred HRDC\u2019s counterclaim. <em>D\u2019Agostino, </em>240 Mont. at 442, 784 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u00b624 The court deemed application of this two-year limitation period to constitute an undeserved windfall to Johnson in light of its conclusion that Johnson knew, or should have known, that the 13% interest rate set forth in the loan agreement applied. The court further pointed to the fact that HRDC exists to provide loans to high risk borrowers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>These high risks naturally correspond to a higher interest rate as reflected in the 13% rate in the loan agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b625 M. R. Civ. P 8(c) provides that \u201c[i]n pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively ... any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d Rule 8(c) derives from \u201cthe same principles of fairness and notice which require a plaintiff to set forth the basis of the [plaintiffs claim] ....\u201d <em>Brown v. Ehlert, </em>255 Mont. 140, 146, 841 P.2d 510, 514 (1992). Rule 8(c) is not absolute, however, as the court retains discretion to allow a defendant to amend pursuant to the terms of M. R. Civ. P. 15, as determined by our holding in <em>Keller v. Dooling, </em>248 Mont. 535, 542, 813 P.2d 437, 441 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b626 M. R. Civ. P. 15(a) provides that \u201cleave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Rule 15(a) favors allowing amendments, but a trial court may justify denying a motion to amend on the grounds of \u201cundue prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional Consultants, </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923 (1990). We agree with the District Court that justice required the amendment of HRDC\u2019s time barred counterclaim to an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00b627 Johnson entered the loan agreement with the understanding that she would be required to repay the principal over a five-year period at a 13% interest rate. She signed the loan agreement that accurately reflected the 13% interest rate. She learned of the mistaken interest rate on the promissory note in 2001, before she had completed repayment of the loan. We cannot say that Johnson would suffer undue prejudice under these circumstances from the District Court\u2019s decision to amend HRDC\u2019s counterclaim to an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqc\">\u00b628 <em>Whether the District Court properly denied Johnson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u00b629 Johnson premised her motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim. Our determination that the District Court correctly amended HRDC\u2019s counterclaim to an affirmative defense also confirms the correctness of the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Johnson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court properly granted affirmative relief to HRDC on its counterclaim of mutual mistake when the court deemed the counterclaim to be an affirmative defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00b631 Our conclusion that the District Court properly concluded that the interests of justice required it to convert HRDC\u2019s counterclaim to an affirmative defense raises the question of whether HRDC could use this affirmative defense as a vehicle to recover damages against Johnson. HRDC filed a counterclaim to reform the note to reflect a 13% interest rate based on a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b632 Our general rule requires that a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint for affirmative relief must comply with the applicable statute of limitations. <em>State ex rel. Egeland v. City Council, </em>245 Mont. 484, 490, 803 P.2d 609, 613 (1990). We exempt from the statute of limitations a defensive claim where the defendant attempts to offset the amount that a plaintiff can recover, such as by recoupment, contribution, or indemnity. <em>Egeland, </em>245 Mont. at 490, 803 P.2d at 613. HRDC\u2019s \u201caffirmative defense\u201d of a mutual mistake goes well beyond a defensive claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b633 HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim, as alleged in its answer, sought an award of the entire unpaid balance on Johnson\u2019s loan. HRDC\u2019s answer included a claim for \u201cpayment of the balance due on the promissory note plus allowable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d Thus HRDC\u2019s counterclaim comported with the general rule that a counterclaim presents a cause of action that seeks affirmative relief. <em>Estate of Webster, </em>920 S.W.2d 600, 606 (Mo. App. W.D. 1996); <em>Haven Federal Sav. &amp; Loan v. Kirian, </em>579 So. 2d 730, 733 (Fla. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"A7SG\">\u00b634 This counterclaim suffered from HRDC\u2019s failure to raise it within the two-year period for the initiation of an action for relief on the grounds of fraud or mistake. Section 27-2-203, MCA. The District Court correctly converted HRDC\u2019s counterclaim to an affirmative defense. In doing so, however, the District Court cannot convert the counterclaim to an affirmative defense that seeks affirmative relief with bumping against the two-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. <em>Egeland, </em>245 Mont. at 490, 803 P.2d at 613. An affirmative defense properly seeks to defeat or avoid the other party\u2019s cause of action. <em>Webster, </em>920 S.W.2d at 606; <em>Haven Federal Sav. &amp; Loan, </em>579 So. 2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"ANe\">\u00b635 The District Court premised its award to HRDC of the unpaid balance of the loan on the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d of mutual mistake. Our decision in <em>Egeland </em>and \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, precludes this outcome. HRDC can recover nothing beyond Johnson\u2019s last payment of March 5, 2003, as \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, bars any further attempts by HRDC to recover. We therefore reverse this portion of the District Court\u2019s ruling. Conversely, Johnson is entitled to reconveyance of her property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>light of HRDC\u2019s inability to collect any additional payments under this loan.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag9X\">\u00b636 We also must reverse the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs in favor of HRDC. The court awarded attorney fees and costs to HRDC as the prevailing party in recovering the unpaid balance of Johnson\u2019s loan. The District Court erroneously awarded this unpaid balance to HRDC. The award of the attorney fees and costs associated with recovering this unpaid balance cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u00b637 We remand to the District Court for entry of judgment in favor of HRDC on Johnson\u2019s claim for damages. We further remand for entry of an order by the District Court that HRDC issue a deed of reconveyance of Johnson\u2019s property to allow FMTC to release the deed of trust. The District Court further should order each party to bear its own fees and costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b557-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AS07\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"A6h\">\u00b638 I concur with the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion under Issue 3-i.e., that HRDC is precluded by \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, from requiring Johnson to pay anything beyond her last payment of March 5, 2003, and that HRDC is barred from any further collection efforts. Opinion, \u00b6 35. I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s decision on Issues 1 and 2-respectively, whether the District Court correctly converted HRDC\u2019s counterclaim of mutual mistake to an affirmative defense, and whether the District Court properly denied Johnson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b639 As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to point out that HRDC did not bother to file a response brief in this appeal, even despite two granted requests for extensions of time in which to do so. Where an appellee does not appear by brief or argument, this Court will take the appellant\u2019s versions and positions as being correct if they are supported by the record. <em>Alden v. Board of Zoning </em>Commrs., 165 Mont. 364, 365, 528 P.2d 1320, 1320 (1974). Here, Johnson\u2019s positions are well-supported by the record and should be taken as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\u00b640 First, HRDC was aware of the \u201cscrivener\u2019s error\u201d in the promissory note no later than July 2001, but HRDC did not file its claim based on mutual mistake until March 2006, well beyond the two-year period of limitations prescribed by \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">\u00b641 Second, HRDC\u2019s \u201ccounterclaim\u201d was just that: a counterclaim. HRDC set forth a claim for relief: payment of the balance due on the note. This constitutes a counterclaim, not an affirmative defense. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (\u201cA pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.\u201d). Indeed, the Court so holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\">HRDC\u2019s mutual mistake counterclaim, as alleged in its answer, sought an award of the entire unpaid balance on Johnson\u2019s loan. HRDC\u2019s answer included a claim for \u201cpayment of the balance due on the promissory note plus allowable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d Thus HRDC\u2019s counterclaim comported with the general rule that a counterclaim presents a cause of action that seeks affirmative relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Opinion, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b642 Third, up until the District Court, entirely of its own accord, declared HRDC\u2019s counterclaim to be something other than it is, both Johnson and HRDC framed their respective arguments based on their shared understanding that HRDC\u2019s \u201ccounterclaim\u201d was, in fact, a counterclaim. That\u2019s why HRDC presented an argument in its brief opposing Johnson\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment that its \u201cclaim\u201d for reformation of the note pursuant to \u00a7 28-2-1611, MCA, was not barred by the statute of limitations-an argument that would have been unnecessary had HRDC\u2019s counterclaim actually been, in substance, an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b643 Fourth, \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, states: \u201cThe period prescribed for the commencement of an action for relief on the ground of. . . mistake is within 2 years, the cause of action in such case not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the ... mistake.\u201d Accordingly, HRDC\u2019s counterclaim was time-barred <em>(see </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 35), and Johnson was entitled to judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u00b644 To avoid this legally correct (but apparently unpalatable) result, the District Court decided in its September 1,2006 Memorandum and Order Denying Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment to treat HRDC\u2019s counterclaim as an affirmative defense. As grounds for this, the court cited M. R. Civ. P. 8(c), which states: \u201cWhen a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim . . . , the court on terms, if justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.\u201d Evidently, the court believed that justice required it to re-designate HRDC\u2019s counterclaim as an affirmative defense because Johnson otherwise would receive an \u201cundeserved windfall.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 24. This Court agrees, citing not only Rule 8(c), but also Rule 15(a), which states that a party may amend its pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>by leave of court and that leave \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b645 There are two obvious problems with this approach. First, HRDC, who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings in the District Court, never sought leave to amend its pleading. Nor did HRDC ask the District Court to convert its counterclaim into an affirmative defense. Second, and most importantly, a counterclaim may not be re-designated or amended to be an affirmative defense if it is not, in fact, an affirmative defense. Again, Rule 8(c) states when a party has \u201cmistakenly designated\u201d a defense as a counterclaim, the court shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation, if justice so requires. Here, HRDC\u2019s counterclaim was not \u201cmistakenly designated.\u201d It was, in fact, a claim for relief. Thus, there is no basis in law or in fact for treating it as an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) or amending HRDC\u2019s pleading (sua sponte) to state an affirmative defense, rather than a counterclaim, under Rule 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">\u00b646 It is difficult to understand the Court\u2019s holdings under Issues 1 and 2, given that the Court essentially agrees with all of the foregoing points. Specifically, in its analysis under Issue 3, the Court states that \u201cthe District Court cannot convert the counterclaim to an affirmative defense that seeks affirmative relief with bumping against the two-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34. But if the \u201ccounterclaim\u201d were in fact an \u201caffirmative defense,\u201d then the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-203, MCA, would not apply. By its terms, this statute applies to a \u201ccause of action.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-203, MCA. Thus, by applying this statute to the case at hand, the Court is tacitly conceding that HRDC\u2019s counterclaim is, in fact, a \u201ccause of action,\u201d not an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b647 Ultimately, what the Court does here is (1) call HRDC\u2019s counterclaim an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d for purposes of ruling against Johnson regarding the terms of the note and then (2) treat HRDC\u2019s counterclaim as a \u201ccause of action\u201d for purposes of ruling against HRDC regarding the unpaid balance of the note. While this result may seem fair or equitable under the circumstances, it is legally untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"A-v\">\u00b648 In this case, the trial court decided that \u201cjustice\u201d required it-sua sponte-to bail out HRDC from its own mistakes, sloppy document preparation, and hard-line business practices. I simply cannot agree that this is a proper function of a district court. HRDC either chose to take no action, or simply neglected to do so, when it became aware that the promissory note contained a glaring mistake. It was not the District Court\u2019s role to rescue HRDC by interceding, sua sponte, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>that party\u2019s behalf during the course of this litigation. HRDC is a corporation which is in the business of making loans. It caused its own problems. If HRDC is an \u201caggrieved\u201d party, as the Court asserts in \u00b6 23, it is so because of its own actions or inaction, not anything Johnson did or failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b649 Given the above, I concur in the result the Court reaches under Issue 3, but I dissent from the Court\u2019s holdings under Issues 1 and 2. I would hold that Johnson was entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. Accordingly, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order Denying Plaintiff s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and remand for further proceedings. In addition, I would award Johnson her attorney\u2019s fees and costs as the prevailing party at trial and on appeal, and I would order the computation of those on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b650 I concur and dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b560-6\">JUSTICE COTTERjoins the concurrence and dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
