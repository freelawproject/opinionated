We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\u00b62 We consider the following restated issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\u00b63 1. Was Makarchuk\u2019s constitutional right to be present at critical stages of the trial violated when he was absent from a portion of the conference settling jury instructions?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when denying Makarchuk\u2019s motion for a new trial by concluding that the State\u2019s closing argument was proper?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court exceed its statutory authority by imposing conditions on Makarchuk\u2019s parole?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err by failing to credit Makarchuk for time served on house arrest as a condition of his release on bond pending trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">\u00b67 In September 2003, Makarchuk was living in a camper trailer located on a dairy farm. The farm owners had initially permitted Makarchuk to stay on the property in exchange for work, but eventually asked Makarchuk to leave. However, Makarchuk did not leave, and was thereafter cited for trespass and escorted off the property. A short time later, Makarchuk returned to the property and was again cited for trespass. While on the property, police officers smelled strong chemical odors emanating from the trailer and obtained a search warrant. While searching the trailer, police discovered materials and chemical residues used in the manufacture of methamphetamine and consistent with operation of a drug lab. Makarchuk was arrested and charged with the offense of operating an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>unlawful clandestine laboratory, a felony, pursuant to \u00a7 45-9-132(1), MCA. Makarchuk pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b68 Prior to trial, Makarchuk moved for release on his own recognizance. The motion was denied. Thereafter, pursuant to a stipulation, Makarchuk was \u201creleased upon formal house arrest\u201d with several conditions. Nearly nine months later, the court revoked Makarchuk\u2019s release on bond when he violated the conditions of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b69 Trial commenced on October 16, 2006, and the State presented uncontroverted evidence that a meth lab was present in the trailer where Makarchuk was living. It was Makarchuk\u2019s theory at trial that he was unaware of the drug lab because he was kicked off the property and was absent from the trailer for a few days. Makarchuk testified that he returned to the property for purposes of gathering his belongings and that before the police arrived he called two people, Jim Bernard and Matt Marvin, and asked them to come over and help him. Makarchuk testified that he would not have made the telephone calls if he had known there was a drug lab in the trailer. Neither Jim Bernard nor Matt Marvin testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b610 At the close of evidence, the District Court excused the jury and began to settle jury instructions with counsel in-chambers. Part way through the conference, Prosecutor Dan Guzynski realized that Makarchuk was not present. When asked if Makarchuk waived his right to be present, Defense Counsel John Putikka stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I specifically advised him he had the right to be here. I told him he didn\u2019t need to be here unless he wanted to be, and he said no, that\u2019s okay.\u201d The court directed that Makarchuk be brought to the conference, and the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Makarchuk, sorry to disturb, whatever it is you went downstairs to do. We\u2019re settling instructions, and I know that Mr. Putikka told you we were going to do this, and my impression was he asked you if you wanted to be here and you said that was fine, you would go on downstairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">MR. PUTIKKA: I didn\u2019t specifically ask you if you waived your right to be here, and so that\u2019s some concern of the State, so they brought you up here, did you want to be here did I misunderstand!?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">MR. MAKARCHUK: If it\u2019s no trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">THE COURT: It\u2019s no trouble for you to stay for the rest, although we have done a fair amount, but I want to make sure you don\u2019t want us to repeat for you everything that we have done up to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">MR. MAKARCHUK: I\u2019m fine, I think it\u2019s out of my hands at this point, or whatever if it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">THE COURT: Okay. And so even though we have done some things here outside of your presence, you will waive your presence up to this point, but you\u2019d just as soon stay for the rest, am I understanding you right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">MR. MAKARCHUK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Makarchuk remained in-chambers for the remainder of the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"A3cO\">\u00b611 During the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument the prosecutor referenced Makarchuk\u2019s testimony stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">[I]t is the State\u2019s burden to prove a case, we have that burden of proof, and we acknowledge that, but, you know, when the Defendant is trying to put a fact in front of you they have the opportunity to call other witnesses besides the Defendant. All-the whole case-the Defendant\u2019s case is propelled by one thing, and that\u2019s what [Makarchuk] says. [Makarchuk] says he made a phone call in that shop. Did they get phone records-did they get phone records from the farm? Did they subpoena those phone records, get phone records to show that calls were made? Did they call Jim Bernard to the stand? Did they call Matt Marvin to the stand? No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Makarchuk\u2019s counsel objected and an off the record side-bar conference ensued. Following the sidebar, Guzynski continued his argument, again commenting on Makarchuk\u2019s testimony and asking the jury to \u201cdetermine his credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">\u00b612 The jury subsequently found Makarchuk guilty of operating an unlawful clandestine methamphetamine laboratory. Makarchuk filed a motion for new trial on the basis that the State\u2019s closing argument created reversible error and denied him due process of law and a fair trial. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">\u00b613 The District Court sentenced Makarchuk to twenty years in the Montana State Prison with ten years suspended with conditions. The judgment provides nineteen enumerated conditions of \u201cparole and probation.\u201d The District Court did not credit Makarchuk for the 264 days he was released on house arrest pending trial. Makarchuk appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">\u00b614 Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of his trial was violated is a question of constitutional law for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>which our review is plenary. <em>State v. Roedel, </em>2007 MT 291, \u00b6 35, 339 Mont. 489, 171 P.3d 694; <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 160, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 476, 139 P.3d 159; <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6 12, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional. <em>State v. Samples, </em>2008 MT 416, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 292, 198 P.3d 803. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Misner, </em>2007 MT 235, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 176, 168 P.3d 679. We review criminal sentences for legality only, to determine whether they are within the parameters set by statute. <em>State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6 27, 331 Mont. 129, 130 P.3d 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b615 1. Was Makarchuk\u2019s constitutional right to be present at critical stages of the trial violated when he was absent from a portion of the conference settling jury instructions?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b616 Makarchuk argues that the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment right under the United States Constitution, and corresponding right under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, to be present at all criminal proceedings against him when he was absent from the in-chamber conference where counsel settled a portion of the jury instructions. Makarchuk asserts that the conference was a critical stage of the proceedings for which he did not effectively waive his right to be present, and his exclusion from the conference amounts to \u201cstructural error, thereby requiring reversal of [his] conviction and a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u00b617 The State responds that pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-410(4), MCA, the presence of the defendant is not required during the settlement of jury instructions. The State contends that conferences consisting of \u201cpurely legal\u201d matters are not critical stages of trial because the \u201ccriminal defendant can do little to aid his defense.\u201d In the alternative, the State argues that Makarchuk waived his right to be present at the conference, and failed to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-16-410(4), MCA, which allows a defendant to be absent from the settling of jury instructions. The State asks that we affirm under the same rationale as in <em>Roedel, </em>where we declined to undertake a constitutional analysis when the statute had not been challenged (\u201cRoedel does not challenge the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Accordingly, we will not address whether \u00a7 46-16-410(4), MCA, impermissibly relieves a court of the obligation to obtain an express waiver of a defendant\u2019s presence from the settling of jury instructions.\u201d <em>Roedel, </em>\u00b6 60).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u00b618 In his reply brief, Makarchuk acknowledges the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>challenge \u00a7 46-16-410(4), MCA, in the District Court, and offers a belated constitutional challenge to the statute. Makarchuk explains that <em>Roedel </em>was decided after Makarchuk\u2019s opening brief was filed, and therefore the statute was not challenged earlier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Makarchuk reasons that <em>Roedel </em>represents a \u201cnew development in the law that in order to make a constitutional argument, the constitutionality of a statute must first be challenged\u201d and asks that we not apply the new development to his case, but declare the statute unconstitutional despite the lack of a previous challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\u00b619 However, this principle is not a new development in the law. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional, and \u201c[a]bsent a successful constitutional challenge to the propriety of a statute, we are obligated to apply it.\u201d <em>Elliott v. State Dept. of Revenue, </em>2006 MT 267, \u00b6 15, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741. Absent the extraordinary showing necessary for the Court to undertake review under the plain error doctrine, likewise not argued in Makarchuk\u2019s opening brief, constitutional challenges must generally be raised in the district court. Additionally, we have explained that \u201c[w]e will not address the merits of an issue presented for the first time in a reply brief on appeal.\u201d <em>Pengra v. State, </em>2000 MT 291, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 276, 14 P.3d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b620 Having failed to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-16-410(4), MCA, in the District Court or in his opening brief on appeal, Makarchuk has failed to preserve the issue. Accordingly, we will not consider his arguments regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-16-410(4), MCA, and affirm this issue pursuant to our decision in <em>Roedel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A1ye\">\u00b621 2. Did the District Court err when denying Makarchuk\u2019s motion for a new trial by concluding that the State\u2019s closing argument was proper?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b622 Makarchuk argues that the State\u2019s remarks during rebuttal closing argument deprived him of his right to a fair trial and due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution. Makarchuk contends that \u201cthe State\u2019s closing argument impinged on [his] presumption of innocence and attempted to mislead the jury about the burden of proof\u2019 when Guzynski \u201ccriticized [him] for failing to present certain evidence ... and for failing to call particular witnesses ....\u201d Makarchuk asserts that the only way to correct this error is for a new trial to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u00b623 The State responds that the \u201ccomments at issue were appropriate argument about the facts in evidence and the credibility of Makarchuk as a witness, prefaced by a commitment that the State bore the burden of truth.\u201d The State argues that Makarchuk has not demonstrated that he was actually prejudiced by the comments and accordingly the District Court did not err by denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AMv\">\u00b624 We consider alleged improper statements during closing argument in the context of the entire argument. <em>State v. Roubideaux, </em>2005 MT 324, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 521, 125 P.3d 1114. We will not presume prejudice from the alleged misconduct, rather the defendant must show that the argument violated his substantial rights. <em>Roubideaux, </em>\u00b6 11. While it is improper for the prosecution to comment on the failure of a defendant to testify, \u201cthe prosecution is permitted to point out facts at issue which could have been controverted by persons other than the defendant, but were not.\u201d <em>State v. Rodarte, </em>2002 MT 317, \u00b6 14, 313 Mont. 131, 60 P.3d 983 <em>(citing Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S. Ct. 2954 (1978)). Moreover, while the prosecutor may not comment on evidence not in the record and may not offer a personal opinion about the credibility of witnesses, the prosecutor may comment on contradictions in testimony as well as comment on evidence presented and suggest inferences the jury may draw therefrom. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b625 Makarchuk asserts that Guzynski\u2019s closing argument impermissibly suggested that the jury should infer guilt from his failure to subpoena the phone records or have Marvin and Bernard testify. Makarchuk likens his case to the plurality decision in <em>State v. Newman, </em>2005 MT 348, 330 Mont. 160, 127 P.3d 374. In <em>Newman, </em>two members of this Court voted to reverse the criminal conviction based on a conclusion that prosecutorial comments during closing argument had deprived the defendant of a fair trial by referring to the defense\u2019s failure to present witnesses to support his theory of the case. However, we recently explained that \u201c[bjecause it represents the view of just two members of the Court, the concurring opinion in <em>Newman </em>does not constitute controlling authority.\u201d <em>State v. Kolb, </em>2009 MT 9, \u00b6 26, 349 Mont. 10, 200 P.3d 504. Consequently, <em>Newman </em>offers no precedential value for this issue, and we analyze the current alleged error pursuant to our other well established rules regarding the acceptable scope of closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"A5f\">\u00b626 First, Makarchuk\u2019s argument that the State attempted to mislead the jury about the burden of proof is rebutted by the correct explanation offered to the jury by prosecutor Guzynski, that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>retained the burden of proof and the obligation to prove its case. We noted the significance of such a statement made by the prosecutor in rejecting a similar burden of proof argument offered by the defendant <em>inRoubideaux. </em>Second, during Makarchuk\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel argued at length about the weakness of the State\u2019s case in light of Makarchuk\u2019s testimony that he telephoned persons to come to the camper. Consequently, the State\u2019s rebuttal argument referencing the phone records and lack of testimony by Marvin and Bernard was, as the District Court concluded, presented to \u201cpoint out facts at issue which could have been controverted by persons other than the defendant.\u201d <em>Rodarte, </em>\u00b6 14. Finally, considering the closing argument in context and as a whole, <em>Roubideaux, </em>\u00b6 15, it is clear that the State was asking the jury to evaluate Makarchuk\u2019s credibility-an important consideration given defense counsel\u2019s primary reliance on Makarchuk\u2019s testimony. Indeed, Guzynski stated several times that it was \u201cimportant that you evaluate [Makarchuk\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Such an argument about witness credibility is well within the permissible scope of closing argument. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Makarchuk\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b627 3. Did the District Court exceed its statutory authority by imposing conditions on Makarchuk\u2019s parole?</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b628 Makarchuk argues that the District Court lacked authority to set conditions of parole. Makarchuk asserts that while a \u201cdistrict court has the authority to impose conditions of probation\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, \u201cno explicit statutory authority allows [the court], except in specific circumstances, to impose conditions affecting parole,\u201d adding that his situation does not fall within any of these specific circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b629 The State responds that Makarchuk waived this argument on appeal by failing to raise an objection at the time of sentencing. The State also asserts that the District Court is authorized to impose conditions on parole pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA, because it allows the court to impose \u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Makarchuk replies that he may raise this issue for the first time on appeal pursuant to <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b630 Generally, we refuse to review on appeal an issue which the party failed to object to at trial. <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892. However, in <em>Lenihan </em>we provided an exception to that rule and allowed appellate review of criminal sentences alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates, regardless of whether the defendant raised an objection in the trial court. <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 8. The challenged sentence must be plausibly illegal, and not just objectionable. <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-18.</p>\n<p id=\"APsC\">\u00b631 Recently, in <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, 342 Mont. 499, 182 P.3d 66, we rejected the State\u2019s argument, likewise offered here, that \u201cthe statutes governing a sentencing judge\u2019s authority gives a judge residual authority to impose parole conditions . . . .\u201d <em>Burch, </em>\u00b6 24. We concluded that \u201cnothing in \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, gives sentencing judges the authority to impose parole conditions.\u201d <em>Burch, </em>\u00b6 26. Consequently, we agree with Makarchuk that, while a district court has authority in limited situations to impose conditions of parole, <em>see e.g. Burch, </em>\u00b6 30 (explaining that a district court has authority pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-255(1), MCA, to impose conditions of parole on defendants convicted of a sexual or violent offense), Makarchuk does not fit within those recognized exceptions. Accordingly, the parole conditions imposed by the District Court are illegal as being beyond the statutory authority of the court, and are properly challenged on appeal pursuant to <em>Lenihan </em>and <em>Kotwicki. </em>We reverse Makarchuk\u2019s sentence to the extent the conditions imposed by the District Court apply to Makarchuk\u2019s parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b632 4. Did the District Court err by failing to credit Makarchuk for time served on house arrest as a condition of his release on bond pending trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b633 Makarchuk\u2019s last issue is that the District Court erred by not crediting his sentence for time served while on house arrest pending trial. Makarchuk argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, he is entitled to credit for the approximately nine months he served on house arrest. The State responds that Makarchuk failed to preserve this issue for appeal because he did not \u201cobject or request at sentencing that credit be given for the time that he was released on house arrest.\u201d Moreover, the State asserts that the <em>Lenihan </em>exception does not apply because it is within the court\u2019s discretion, as opposed to \u201cstatutorily required,\u201d to credit an offender with the type of house arrest at issue here. Because the District Court was not required to credit Makarchuk\u2019s sentence with the time spent, even if he had objected, the State argues that the issue renders the sentence objectionable, but not illegal for purposes of <em>Lenihan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u00b634 However, though the State offers a viable argument, Makarchuk notes that we recently denied his petition for habeas corpus which had raised this issue, explaining that he had also raised the issue on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>appeal and concluding that \u201cwe will address the issue raised in Makarchuk\u2019s petition in the appeal with the benefit of the full District Court record.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b635 Home arrest procedures are governed by Title 46, Chapter 18, Part 10 of the Montana Code Annotated. \u201cHome arrest\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cthe use of a person\u2019s home for purposes of confinement and home arrest procedures and conditions imposed under this part.\u201d Section 46-18-1001, MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-1002(1), MCA, a defendant may petition the sentencing court for an order directing that all or a portion of his sentence be served on house arrest. If such an order is granted, it must include a specific plan setting forth the conditions of the house arrest. Section 46-18-1002(3), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, upon revocation of a suspended or deferred sentence, \u201c[c]redit must be allowed for time served in a detention center or home arrest time already served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b636 We considered a similar issue in <em>State v. Gulbranson, </em>2003 MT 139, 316 MT 163, 69 P.3d 1187, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12 n. 1, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978. Gulbranson sought credit for time he spent on \u201cinformal house arrest\u201d which was a condition of his release on bond. We concluded that informal house arrest was not the \u201c\u2018house arrest\u2019 as provided for in Title 46, Chapter 18, Part 10 of the MCA,\u201d because it was not a condition of his suspended sentence and Gulbranson was not required to wear an electronic monitoring device. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6 12. We concluded that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, did not require Gulbranson\u2019s sentences be credited with the time served on informal house arrest. <em>Gulbranson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqdq\">\u00b637 The situation here is similar to <em>Gulbranson. </em>Like Gulbranson, Makarchuk was not required to wear an electronic monitoring device and was assigned to house arrest as a condition of his release on bond, rather than as a condition of his later suspended sentence. The only difference between these cases is that Makarchuk\u2019s release was ordered pursuant to a stipulation and was conditioned by use of the term \u201cformal house arrest.\u201d Makarchuk argues that this difference in wording and the \u201cformal stipulation\u201d requires a different outcome than in <em>Gulbranson, </em>and that the District Court \u201cshould have to credit Makarchuk for the time ....\u201d However, though the house arrest here was described within the bond release order as \u201cformal,\u201d and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>stipulated to by the parties, it nonetheless does not meet the statutory definition of \u201chome arrest\u201d as contemplated by Title 46, Chapter 18, Part 10. \u201cHome arrest\u201d is a procedure for serving a suspended sentence and, as the State notes, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(b), MCA, \u201cdoes not require that Makarchuk receive credit for the time he spent on formal house arrest as a condition of his pretrial release.\u201d Consistent with our opinion in <em>Gulbranson, </em>we conclude that the District Court was not required to credit Makarchuk with the 264 days he spent on house arrest, and did not impose an illegal sentence by refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b537-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> Of course, the statute was subject to challenge even before <em>Roedel </em>was decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> <em>Makarchuk v.
