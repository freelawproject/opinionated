We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AYE\">\u00b62 The Rohrers present the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u00b63 Whether the District Court abused its discretion in prohibiting the Rohrers from presenting evidence of differential settlement damage to other residences in Bel View Palisades.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction defining \u201cunfair practice\u201d under the Montana Consumer Protection Act was a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b65 The Rohrers purchased an undeveloped lot in the hillside Bel View Palisades subdivision overlooking Great Falls from Knudson in 1999. The Rohrers built their own home on the lot, finishing construction in 2002. In 2004, they learned that their neighbors, Kurt and Mary Fagenstrom (Fagenstroms), were sustaining substantial damage to their home from differential settlement. The Rohrers recognized similar damages developing in their home, including cracked walls, broken floor tiles, and sticking doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b66 The Rohrers learned that NTL Engineering had prepared a geotechnical engineering report concluding that the Fagenstroms\u2019 home demonstrated substantial differential movement. In February 2005, the Rohrers hired NTL Engineering to do a similar limited evaluation of their lot. Core sampling revealed uncontrolled fill materials to a depth of approximately 31 feet below grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b67 The Rohrers attempted to mitigate their damages by hiring a contractor to install resistance piers on their foundation. They installed 20 piers in March 2005 up to a depth of 55 feet below the foundation. At the time of trial in 2008, one of the piers had failed, the house continued to settle, interior damage increased, and the Rohrers faced installing additional piers.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b68 Knudson, doing business as G &amp; M Properties, developed many blocks in Bel View Palisades, including Block 20 and Block 22 where the Rohrers built their house. Knudson is a licensed professional engineer, and his firm, Delta Engineering, Inc., engineered the development of Blocks 20 and 22. Knudson is a geologist with expertise in geotechnical engineering and residential foundations.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">\u00b69 Development of Block 22 in the mid-1990s was formally reviewed under the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-101 through -625, MCA. A joint City/County Planning Board approved development subject to several conditions, including requiring Knudson to submit to the Public Works and Community Development Department a report on soil compaction and density tests for anticipated building and public improvement locations. There is some dispute as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>these soil compaction or density tests were completed on Block 22. While the annexation agreement between Knudson and the City of Great Falls references such tests, Knudson was unable to produce the test results during discovery or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b610 Bruce Rohrer investigated the historic topography and development of Block 22 prior to initiating suit. He found information that a ditch and steep railroad embankment existed on Block 22 and that major earth moving activities filled in the ditch and eliminated the railroad embankment sometime before 1964. The Rohrers claimed that Knudson should have been aware of and disclosed the fill conditions on Block 22 for the following reasons: topographical maps used by Knudson to develop Block 22 revealed the historic location of the railroad embankment; publicly available aerial photographs revealed the deep ditch and its elimination over time as the area developed; and Knudson\u2019s activities, including grading, recontouring, and excavating the site, would have revealed the widespread fill conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b611 Rohrers filed this action alleging negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the Montana Consumer Protection Act. The Rohrers claimed Knudson was negligent in failing to discover and disclose the existence of fill on their lot. Rohrers claimed that Knudson made a negligent misrepresentation when he told Bruce Rohrer that \u201cthere\u2019s good dirt at curb height,\u201d which Bruce Rohrer understood to represent that footings and foundation could be installed without extraordinary precautions. Lastly, the Rohrers claimed that Knudson\u2019s failure to perform required soil compaction or density tests was an unfair or deceptive act or practice resulting in damages recoverable under the Montana Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b612 At trial in late January 2008, Knudson claimed that the Rohrers\u2019 settlement problems resulted from their own negligence. Ray Womack, an engineering expert, testified that the cause of settlement was \u201cinvariably a water problem\u201d resulting from irrigation next to the foundation, poor site grading, and the failure to install drains around the foundation footings.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b613 The jury verdict denied the Rohrers recovery on their Montana Consumer Protection Act claims, found no negligent misrepresentation, and apportioned negligence 10% to Defendant Knudson, 45% to (settled) Defendant City of Great Falls, and 45% to Plaintiffs Rohrers. The Rohrers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Payne v. Knutson, </em>2004 MT 271, \u00b6 20, 323 Mont. 165, 99 P.3d 200. We will not reverse the district court unless the error be \u201cof such character to have affected the result.\u201d Payne, \u00b6 20. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s refusal to issue a proposed jury instruction is whether it abused its discretion. <em>Howard v. St. James Community Hosp., </em>2006 MT 23, \u00b6 16, 331 Mont. 60, 129 P.3d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in prohibiting the Rohrers from presenting evidence of differential settlement damage to other residences in Bel View Palisades.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b616 On motion prior to trial, Knudson\u2019s counsel sought to preclude the Rohrers from presenting evidence of differential settlement damage to any residences in Bel View Palisades other than the Rohrers\u2019 and Fagenstroms\u2019. Knudson\u2019s counsel argued that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial. In response the Rohrers\u2019 counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9l\">[I]f the argument is either made or insinuated by the Defense that the Rohrers\u2019 house is a unique anomalous occurrence, then I think it would be appropriate to show that there are a number of other homes within shouting distance of their house that are experiencing this, a similar thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Knudson\u2019s counsel responded, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t intend to try to introduce that.\u201d The court granted the motion to exclude evidence of damage to residences other than the Rohrers\u2019 and Fagenstroms\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b617 The Rohrers recite a litany of instances from the trial when Knudson\u2019s counsel referred to hundreds of homes in the Bel View Palisades area. They suggest that such testimony was presented to insinuate that damage to the Rohrers\u2019 house was unique, and thus likely the result of their own negligence. A review of the record reveals that much of this testimony merely attempted to support Knudson\u2019s argument that he did not know of any differential settlement problems at the time the Rohrers built their house. However, some testimony went beyond this legitimate argument and warranted an opportunity for rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\u00b618 In one such instance, Knudson\u2019s counsel ended his direct examination of Jean Clary, a real estate expert, by inquiring \u201c[a]re you aware of any reputation amongst buyers or sellers in the real estate community that the homes in Bel View Palisades are not worth as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>much as they used to be by virtue of any problems with settlement?\u201d She replied that she was not. In a sidebar shortly thereafter, Rohrers\u2019 counsel complained that opposing counsel had asked every witness about the hundreds of homes in Bel View Palisades:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">The only inference that can be drawn from that is that their house is an aberration. We have evidence to the effect that there\u2019s five houses on Block 22 that exhibit evidence of settlement. And she has testified that it has no adverse reputation for settlement. And I think I should be entitled to ask her if she is aware of those other houses that exhibit evidence of settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">However, the court adhered to its earlier ruling and prohibited counsel from inquiring about other residences that had settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b619 Similarly, at the close of Knudson\u2019s case, Rohrers\u2019 counsel sought to rebut Knudson\u2019s claims that no extraordinary foundation measures were needed on houses he constructed in the area. In particular, Bruce Rohrer was prepared to testify that he observed substantial settlement in a neighboring house that Knudson built and discussed in his testimony. Again the court excluded the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b620 Relevant evidence is generally admissible. M. R. Evid. 402. Evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. Evidence that is relevant may be excluded, however, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u00b621 A fact of consequence to the determination of this action is the cause of settlement of the Rohrers\u2019 house. In particular, the jury had to apportion negligence among the parties. The Rohrers contended that Knudson should have known of widespread fill in the area and disclosed that information. Knudson contended that the Rohrers were negligent in constructing their home. The jury heard evidence that there are hundreds of homes in the Bel View Palisades area, that the area has no reputation for settlement, that Knudson built homes on Block 22 that did not require extraordinary foundations because they were not built on fill, and that the Rohrers were negligent because they failed to install drains, they irrigated next to their foundation, and their site grading was poor. The jury was prevented from hearing evidence that a neighboring home built by Knudson, which he claimed did not require an extraordinary foundation, was settling in the same way as the Rohrers\u2019 home, and that the area could have a reputation for settlement if the extent of other homes with failing foundations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>were known. All of this evidence would be of consequence to determine the relative negligence of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b622 Whether the probative value of this evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice is left to the discretion of the trial judge. However, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of damage to other homes after Knudson\u2019s counsel presented evidence calculated to imply that such damage did not exist. Knudson\u2019s counsel opened the door to such rebuttal by eliciting testimony of the reputation for settlement in the area and suggesting that no extraordinary foundations were required for other houses in the area. Knudson cannot now complain of unfair prejudice when his own counsel sought to benefit from a similar prejudice by excluding proper rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b623 This Court has held that a lower court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence, offered in a negligence case involving a fallen light fixture, that other light fixtures were loose and subsequently repaired. <em>Rieger v. Coldwell, </em>254 Mont. 507, 512, 839 P.2d 1257, 1259-60 (1992). We found that such evidence was probative and tended to refute expert testimony that defective sheetrock at the accident scene was the sole cause of the accident. <em>Rieger, </em>254 Mont. at 512, 839 P.2d at 1259-60. Similarly, here evidence of differential settlement of other houses in the area was probative and tended to refute expert testimony as to the area\u2019s reputation for settlement and the implication that the Rohrers\u2019 settlement problems were unique.</p>\n<p id=\"AEm\">\u00b624 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s exclusion of such rebuttal testimony affected the result since any change in the apportionment of negligence would alter the Rohrers\u2019 recovery. We therefore reverse and remand for retrial. Upon retrial, the Rohrers should be allowed to present evidence of settlement of other houses in the area to rebut any contention that there is no reputation for settlement in the area or that neighboring houses do not require extraordinary foundations because they are not built on fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b625 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s instruction defining \u201cunfair practice\u201d under the Montana Consumer Protection Act was a correct statement of the law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b626 This issue requires clarification of the law under the Montana Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), \u00a7\u00a7 30-14-101 through -143, MCA. Like many other jurisdictions, but unlike the federal act, the MCPA provides a private cause of action. <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 21, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984; \u00a7 30-14-133, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u00b627 The MCPA declares that, \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.\u201d Section 30-14-103, MCA. While the MCPA does not further define these unlawful practices, it expresses a legislative intent to give \u201cdue consideration and weight\u201d to interpretations of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and federal courts regarding \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as amended. Section 30-14-104(1), MCA. Examples of unlawful acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce are listed in a Montana regulation, which also references interpretations of the FTC and federal courts regarding \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as amended. Admin. R. M. 23.19.101.</p>\n<p id=\"A5im\">\u00b628 At trial, the Rohrers\u2019 counsel offered a jury instruction defining an \u201cunfair\u201d act or practice as \u201cone which offends established public policy and which is either immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d Knudson\u2019s counsel proposed instructing the jury that an \u201cunfair\u201d act or practice is \u201cone which offends established public policy and which is either immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous.\u201d Referring to the amount of damages sought, Knudson\u2019s counsel argued that including the language \u201cor substantially injurious to consumers\u201d would \u201cessentially direct a verdict\u201d for the Rohrers. The court agreed and struck \u201csubstantially injurious\u201d from the jury instruction defining an \u201cunfair\u201d act or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b629 While this is a matter of first impression in Montana, there is abundant precedent in other jurisdictions. Most states with consumer protection acts patterned after \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act interpret unfairness as described in the landmark United States Supreme Court case, <em>FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. (S&amp;H), </em>405 U.S. 233, 92 S. Ct. 898 (1972). The Court noted with approval the FTC\u2019s use of the following criteria for determining whether a practice is unfair:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise-whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>S&amp;H, </em>405 U.S. at 244, n. 5, 92 S. Ct. at 905, n. 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">\u00b630 At least a dozen states apply the S&amp;H standard to define unfairness under their consumer protection acts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Grogan, </em>628 P.2d 570, 571-72 (Alaska 1981); <em>Cheshire Mortg. Serv., Inc. v. Montes, </em>612 A.2d 1130, 1143 (Conn. 1992); <em>PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Prop.

Federal Way Cycle Ctr., </em>698 P.2d 578, 583 (Wash. App. 1985). The S&amp;H standard has been applied by several federal circuit courts as well. <em>See Mass. Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., </em>412 F.3d 215, 243 (1st Cir. 2005); <em>South Atlantic Ltd. P\u2019ship of Tenn., LP v. Riese, </em>284 F.3d 518, 535 (4th Cir. 2002); <em>Spiegel, Inc. v. FTC, </em>540 F.2d 287, 293 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"AYIC\">\u00b631 We join these jurisdictions in adopting a version of the S&amp;H standard to define unfairness under the Montana Consumer Protection Act. In doing so, we give due consideration and weight to interpretations of the FTC and federal courts regarding \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act, as required by \u00a7 30-14-104(1), MCA. We hold as a matter of law that an unfair act or practice is one which offends established public policy and which is either immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b632 We disagree with the District Court\u2019s concern that this statement of law would essentially direct a verdict for the Rohrers. While Knudson conceded that the City\u2019s subdivision review process represented a public policy to avoid the type of harm suffered by the Rohrers, the record contains conflicting evidence as to whether soil compaction and density studies were completed. Thus, although there is little dispute that the Rohrers incurred substantial injury, a jury must still determine, as a question of fact, whether soil compaction and density studies were completed before concluding whether Knudson offended established public policy. A jury must also determine whether any unfair act or practice caused the damages claimed by the Rohrers in order for them to recover under the MCPA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA. These questions should be left to the jury on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b633 Reversed and remanded for retrial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The FTC announced a new unfairness definition in 1980, which was codified by Congress in 1994.
