We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">\u00b62 In April of 2006, Adkins was implicated in a methamphetamine distribution ring. The individual implicating Adkins also indicated that Adkins kept a small amount of methamphetamine at his residence. With the assistance of Adkins\u2019s probation officer, agents from the Central Montana Drug Task Force (\u201cCMDTF\u201d) decided to conduct a probation search of Adkins\u2019s residence, planning to use any methamphetamine found as leverage to gain his cooperation in their larger investigation. The agents met Adkins in his driveway, searched his person pursuant to the terms of his probation, and explained that he had been implicated in the methamphetamine ring. Upon the agents\u2019 inquiry, Adkins indicated he had a personal use amount of methamphetamine and paraphernalia hidden in his basement, which the agents retrieved. Adkins spent the next eleven days sequestered in a hotel room, cooperating with the CMDTF investigation into the larger methamphetamine distribution ring in exchange for their promise not to bring federal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">\u00b63 On May 25, 2006, Adkins was charged with felony Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs With Intent to Distribute (hereinafter \u201cintent to distribute\u201d) and misdemeanor Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. Adkins pled not guilty to both charges, and a jury trial was scheduled. For reasons not relevant to this opinion, at the omnibus hearing on November 15, 2006, the trial date was continued upon Adkins\u2019s motion and the court extended the deadline for filing pretrial motions to November 29, 2006. On November 27, 2006, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>moved to amend the information to add an alternative count of felony Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (hereinafter \u201cstraight possession\u201d), which the District Court granted. On November 28,2006, Adkins filed a motion to suppress statements made during his eleven day sequestration in the hotel room, alleging the CMDTF agents had not complied with the requirements set forth in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966). Adkins was arraigned on the straight possession charge and entered a plea of not guilty. On January 23, 2007, the day before the court heard argument on Adkins\u2019s motion to suppress, the State again moved to amend the information to dismiss the intent to distribute charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b64 At the hearing, the District Court determined that, in light of the State\u2019s decision to prosecute Adkins solely for the straight possession charge, Adkins\u2019s motion to suppress statements made in the hotel room (which formed the basis for the intent to distribute charge) was rendered moot. The court\u2019s decision was based in part upon the State\u2019s representation that the remaining charges were based solely on events that occurred during the initial encounter with the CMDTF agents at Adkins\u2019s residence, prior to his sequestration in the hotel room. Adkins\u2019s defense counsel strenuously objected, arguing that the straight possession charge constituted a new charge of which Adkins had no notice. Counsel therefore argued Adkins needed additional time to file a new motion to suppress statements he made to the CMDTF officers during the initial encounter which ultimately resulted in the recovery of methamphetamine and paraphernalia from his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"AFG\">\u00b65 The District Court explained to Adkins\u2019s counsel that the straight possession charge was not new, rather, that Adkins had notice of both the charge and the underlying facts since at least November 27, 2006, when the prosecution amended the information to add the alternative charge. The court noted that what Adkins\u2019s counsel alleged was an \u201c11th hour\u201d change in the charges was actually of benefit to Adkins-that the State was simply removing the more serious alternative charge from the information. Ultimately, the court denied Adkins\u2019s oral motion to continue, maintaining the scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"AyX_\">\u00b66 On January 25, 2007, Adkins filed a \u201cMotion for a Hearing on <em>Miranda.\u201d </em>In substance, the motion sought to exclude the statements Adkins made to the CMDTF agents which led to the discovery of methamphetamine and paraphernalia in his basement. The District Court denied the motion as untimely. A jury trial was held, and Adkins was convicted of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b67 We restate the dispositive issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b68 1. Was the District Court required to hold a second omnibus hearing upon Adkins\u2019s arraignment on an alternative charge where the factual basis for the alternative charge was the same as the factual basis for the initial charges?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b69 2. Did the District Court err in denying Adkins\u2019s motion for a suppression hearing as untimely?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b610 3. Was Adkins denied effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s determination that a motion to suppress is untimely is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>State v. VonBergen, </em>2003 MT 265, \u00b6 7, 317 Mont. 445, 77 P.3d 537. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s determination of the existence of good cause to grant relief from a waiver of an untimely motion to suppress. <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6 18. We similarly review a district court\u2019s trial administration rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, 134 P.3d 45. Finally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel implicate mixed questions of law and fact for which our review is de novo. <em>State v. Wood, </em>2008 MT 298, \u00b6 19, 345 Mont. 487, 191 P.3d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">\u00b612 As a threshold matter, Adkins\u2019s assertion that the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the CMDTF agents\u2019 <em>un-Mirandized </em>questioning violated his constitutional rights is not well taken. It is well established that this Court should avoid constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>See e.g. Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 62, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. Where, as here, we deem it possible to resolve the merits of an appeal without resort to a resolution of constitutional questions presented, we take that approach. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 62. We therefore turn to the dispositive issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">\u00b613 1. Was the District Court required to hold a second omnibus hearing upon Adkins\u2019s arraignment on an alternative charge where the factual basis for the alternative charge was the same as the factual basis for the initial charges?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">\u00b614 Section 46-13-110(1), MCA, provides that the District Court shall hold an omnibus hearing \u201cwithin a reasonable time following the entry of a not guilty plea but not less than 30 days before trial.\u201d The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Court may grant the State leave to substantively amend an information up until five days before trial. Section 46-11-205(1), MCA. Where the State substantively amends an information, the defendant must be given a reasonable time to prepare for trial on the amended information. Section 46-11-205(2), MCA. The criminal procedure statutes are silent as to whether a new omnibus hearing is required where a criminal defendant is arraigned on an alternative charge in an amended information. However, failure to hold an omnibus hearing where such failure prejudiced the defendant may constitute reversible error. Section 46-20-701(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b615 Adkins contends that the plain language of \u00a7 46-13-110(1), MCA, required the District Court to hold a new omnibus hearing after he entered a plea of not guilty to the alternative straight possession charge contained in the amended information. The State counters that the factual basis underlying the intent to distribute charge was identical to the factual basis underlying the straight possession charge, and thus a new omnibus hearing was not required because it would serve no practical purpose. Essentially, the State argues that the District Court correctly concluded that \u201cnothing had changed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">\u00b616 We find the State\u2019s logic persuasive. Adkins was originally arraigned on the intent to distribute charge. The charge of Possession of Dangerous Drugs With the Intent to Distribute is predicated on a criminal defendant\u2019s possession of dangerous drugs. Here, the intent to distribute charge was predicated on Adkins\u2019s possession of the drugs found in his basement. Therefore, the factual basis underlying the amended charge of straight possession was identical to the factual basis underlying the intent to distribute charge for which an omnibus hearing had already been held. Where, as here, the State amends an information to charge an alternate, lesser included offense which is supported by an identical factual basis, the District Court is not required to hold a new omnibus hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b617 This conclusion is consistent with a holistic view of our criminal procedure statutes and relevant case law. Conspicuously absent from \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, which provides for a substantive amendment of an information up to five days before trial, is language requiring that a new omnibus hearing be held. Rather, the statute logically provides that the defendant must be given a reasonable time to prepare for trial on the amended information. Section 46-11-205, MCA. The statute therefore requires the District Court to allow reasonable time for a defendant to prepare for trial in light of the substantive changes to the information. In the event the factual basis underlying the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>charge differs from the factual basis underlying the charge upon which the defendant was originally arraigned, a new omnibus hearing may be appropriate. However, in the instant case, as the District Court aptly noted, nothing had changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b6 18 2. Did the District Court err in denying Adkins\u2019s motion for a suppression hearing as untimely?</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b619 Under \u00a7 46-13-302(1), MCA, \u201c[a] defendant aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the court to suppress as evidence anything obtained by the unlawful search and seizure.\u201d By statutory mandate, a motion to suppress must be made at or before the omnibus hearing, or by a subsequent date upon the court\u2019s order. Section 46-13-101(1), MCA; <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 16. Failure to bring a motion to suppress within this timeframe constitutes a waiver. <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 16 (citing \u00a7 46-13-102(2), MCA.) Where such a waiver occurs, the court may grant relief upon good cause shown. Section 46-13-101(1), MCA. When considering whether to grant relief from a waiver, a district court \u201cretains the authority to control the progress of the case, and may, within its discretion, grant or deny the requested relief, as it deems appropriate.\u201d <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b620 The District Court held an omnibus hearing on August 2, 2006. Upon Adkins\u2019s motion, the court extended the deadline to file pretrial motions to November 29, 2006. In compliance with the deadline, Adkins filed a motion to suppress statements he made to the CMDTF agents during his eleven day sequestration in the hotel room. However, Adkins\u2019s motion to suppress did not address, even tangentially, the issue of whether the <em>xm-Mirandized </em>statements given during his initial encounter with the CMDTF agents in his driveway, which ultimately led to the discovery of methamphetamine and paraphernalia, were gained in violation of his constitutional rights. Adkins\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress evidence obtained during his initial encounter with the CMDTF agents constituted a waiver. <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b621 While the District Court was at liberty to grant Adkins relief from the waiver for good cause shown, we conclude that its decision not to grant such relief was within its broad discretion to control the progress of the case. <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6 21. Adkins argues that good cause was established by virtue of the change in the nature of the charges against him. However, as discussed above, the intent to distribute charge was predicated upon Adkins\u2019s possession of the methamphetamine found in his basement during the initial encounter with the CMDTF agents. The straight possession charge was based wholly upon the identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>facts. The record indicates that the only evidence of Adkins\u2019s possession of methamphetamine was the physical evidence found in his basement. Therefore, Adkins\u2019s counsel had notice of the facts supporting the straight possession charge (and by extension, the facts giving rise to a motion to suppress the evidence supporting that charge) at the time of his original arraignment on the intent to distribute charge. Under these circumstances, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by not finding good cause to grant relief from Adkins\u2019s waiver of the right to file a motion to suppress <em>un-Mirandized </em>statements which ultimately led to the discovery of the methamphetamine and paraphernalia in his basement.</p>\n<p id=\"ApA\">\u00b622 Adkins cites <em>State v. Bentley, </em>156 Mont. 129, 477 P.2d 345 (1970), for the proposition that where confusion over charges exists between the parties and the district court, relief from an untimely motion should be granted. <em>Bentley </em>is inapposite to the circumstances in this case. There, we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to grant relief from a waiver where the State expressed its intention to dismiss a charge against the defendant and then failed to fulfill its promise to do so. <em>Bentley, </em>156 Mont. at 132, 133, 477 P.2d at 346. Here, any confusion over charges was Adkins\u2019s alone. In the final analysis, Adkins was aware of the factual basis for both the intent to distribute and the straight possession charge, and any corresponding motion to suppress, from the inception of the case. Adkins\u2019s contention that the nature of the charges against him had fundamentally changed is without support in the record. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by finding that no good cause existed for allowing an untimely motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b623 3. Was Adkins denied effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b624 As a threshold matter, we note the State does not dispute that Adkins\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is record-based and therefore appropriate for review on direct appeal. We thus analyze Adkins\u2019s claim under the two-part test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Hammer v. State, </em>2008 MT 342, \u00b6 10, 346 Mont. 279, 194 P.3d 699. A defendant bears the burden of proving that: 1) the performance of defendant\u2019s counsel was deficient; and 2) that counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance was prejudicial. <em>Hammer, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687). Where the defendant makes an insufficient showing as to one prong of the test, it is unnecessary to address the other prong. <em>Hammer, \u00b6 </em>10. \u201c[W]hen it is possible to dispose of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>claim\u2019s failure to establish that the defendant was sufficiently prejudiced, it is best to follow that course.\u201d <em>Hammer, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b625 In order to show that defense counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance was prejudicial, a defendant must show that a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different had defense counsel\u2019s performance not been deficient. <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 19, 326 Mont. 63, 106 P.3d 1175. Where a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is predicated upon failure to file a motion to suppress evidence, he must \u201cestablish that there was arguably some merit to such a motion.\u201d <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 305, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 479, 100 P.3d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b626 Adkins asserts that the CMDTF agents\u2019 failure to <em>Mirandize </em>him rendered his unwarned statement regarding the location of the methamphetamine and paraphernalia in his home, and in turn the physical fruits of those unwarned statements, inadmissible. The State maintains that the physical evidence would be admissible pursuant to the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b627 Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Adkins, while on probation, was entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to his providing the location of the evidence, and assuming that the fruits of those <em>un-Mirandized </em>statements would be subject to the exclusionary rule,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the physical evidence supporting Adkins\u2019s conviction would have nonetheless been admissible under the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b628 The inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the general rule that courts must exclude evidence obtained by illegal means. This Court has recognized the application of the inevitable discovery doctrine in Montana. <em>See e.g. State v. Dickinson, </em>2008 MT 159, 343 Mont. 301, 184 P.3d 305; <em>State v. Notti, </em>2003 MT 170, 316 Mont. 345, 71 P.3d 1233; <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, 326 Mont. 63, 106 P.3d 1175. The doctrine of inevitable discovery provides that evidence otherwise inadmissible under the exclusionary rule need not be excluded if the prosecution can show that the evidence would have been discovered by legal means. <em>Dickinson, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Notti, </em>\u00b6 20. Our inquiry in this regard requires us to determine whether law enforcement had sufficient evidence to procure a search warrant. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>e.g. Dickinson, </em>\u00b6 25 (citations omitted). Where we have found that law enforcement had sufficient untainted evidence to obtain a search warrant, we have applied the doctrine of inevitable discovery. <em>Dickinson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b629 In the instant case, Adkins does not dispute that under the conditions of his probation, his residence was subject to random search at any time, with or without probable cause. It is also uncontroverted that at the time Adkins informed the officers of the location of the methamphetamine and paraphernalia in his basement, his probation officer was present and poised to conduct a probation search. Finally, there is no dispute that the CMDTF agents (and by extension Adkins\u2019s probation officer) had been informed by Adkins\u2019s colleague that he had a personal use amount of methamphetamine hidden in his house. The imminent probation search was an independent legal means by which the evidence would have been discovered, and therefore falls under the purview of the doctrine of inevitable discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"Arg\">\u00b630 We conclude that a motion to suppress based on the CMDTF agent\u2019s failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings would have been without merit. Consequently, Adkins\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to timely file such a motion was not prejudicial, thus his ineffective assistance of counsel claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-7\">JUSTICES RICE, WARNER, NELSON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> Because we conclude that ultimately, the evidence would have been admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine, we leave open the question of whether the exclusionary rule would have application to evidence that was the fruit of an un<em>Mirandized </em>statement. (See <em>U.S. v. Patane, </em>542 U.S. 630, 124 S. Ct. 2620 (2004), plurality opinion holding that the exclusionary rule does not require the suppression of physical evidence discovered as a result of un <em>-Mirandized </em>but voluntary statements.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
