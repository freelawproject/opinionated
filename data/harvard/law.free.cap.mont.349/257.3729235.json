We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b62 Appellant raised five issues on appeal. Because we reverse and remand on the issue of causation, which is dispositive, we will not address the remaining issues. Thus, we restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b63 Was there sufficient evidence that a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that D.M.S. caused injury, or posed an imminent threat of injury to himself or others because of his mental disorder?</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AzQ\">\u00b64 D.M.S. was charged with two felony counts of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) on two occasions in 2007 and was also the prime suspect in a felony arson investigation involving five vehicle fires. Based on a competency evaluation of D.M.S., the District Court adjudicated D.M.S. unfit to proceed in the criminal cases due to the mental disease or defect of cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), combined with alcohol abuse, borderline intellectual functioning and antisocial personality disorder. The District Court returned D.M.S. to MSH for ninety days of inpatient treatment to attempt to help D.M.S. gain fitness to proceed in the criminal trials; however, at the end of that period, D.M.S. had not gained fitness and, according to staff at MSH, was unlikely to do so in the reasonably foreseeable future. The District Court then dismissed the two criminal cases, pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(3)(a), MCA, and the Ravalli County Attorney immediately filed a petition for the commitment of D.M.S., pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-121, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u00b65 In December 2007, the District Court held a detention hearing and ordered that D.M.S. remain detained at MSH and appointed Dr. Casey as a \u201cprofessional person\u201d in the matter, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-122(2), MCA. Dr. Casey evaluated D.M.S. and concluded D.M.S. \u201cdoes not meet the criteria for commitment\u201d at MSH. The State then filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>motion for an additional examination to be performed by Dr. Mozer, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-123(2)(a), MCA, but D.M.S. refused to meet with Dr. Mozer. D.M.S. filed a motion to dismiss the petition for commitment, arguing that Dr. Mozer had been unable to conduct a successful examination and the only professional recommendation available to the court was by Dr. Casey, who recommended against commitment. The District Court denied the motion. D.M.S. also filed pretrial motions seeking to prevent the State from introducing evidence regarding his criminal history prior to a 2005 head injury, which both parties stipulate caused his cognitive disorder NOS, and evidence regarding the District Court\u2019s decision that he was unfit to proceed in the two DUI cases. The District Court excluded the evidence regarding his pre-2005 convictions but allowed evidence regarding his being found unfit to proceed in the criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b66 The commitment case was tried before a jury on December 27 and 28, 2007. Because both parties stipulated D.M.S. suffered from a mental disorder in the form of cognitive disorder NOS, the only issue at trial was whether D.M.S. required commitment under \u00a7 53-21-126, MCA. The State called several law enforcement officers to testify concerning the alleged DUI and arson offenses. One officer testified that when he stopped D.M.S. in December 2006, D.M.S. smelled strongly of alcohol, failed a horizontal gaze nystagmus test, admitted he had been impaired to where he could not safely operate his vehicle and, when arrested, became angry and profane. The State introduced other testimony that, in March 2007, deputies from the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office investigated reports of unoccupied vehicles that were set on fire at two different trailheads. D.M.S.\u2019s vehicle was seen at one of the trailheads at the time of the fires. One of the deputies located and stopped D.M.S.\u2019s vehicle, which at the time had a flat tire and was being driven on the rim. According to the officer\u2019s testimony, D.M.S. showed signs of intoxication and admitted to having consumed \u201ca couple beers.\u201d The arresting officer found evidence possibly connected to the arson, including broken glass in D.M.S.\u2019s boots and on the floor and seat of the patrol car in which D.M.S. was transported. Law enforcement also found other items in D.M.S.\u2019s vehicle, such as a hammer with particles of glass in its handle, matches, lighters, an empty can labeled \u201ckerosene,\u201d and alcoholic beverage containers, some empty and some full.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b67 The State then called Dr. Mozer to testify regarding D.M.S.\u2019s mental condition. D.M.S. moved to dismiss on the grounds that Dr. Mozer\u2019s evaluation was statutorily insufficient to support commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to MSH because Dr. Mozer only reviewed D.M.S.\u2019s file and did not evaluate him personally. The District Court denied the motion and then ordered that D.M.S. submit to an additional examination by Dr. Mozer. D.M.S. objected to this mid-trial evaluation and refused to speak with Dr. Mozer.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b68 At the conclusion of the commitment trial, the jury returned a special verdict form, which concluded the following: D.M.S. suffers from a mental disorder; because of a mental disorder and \u201cthrough an act or an omission, [D.M.S.] caused self-injury or injury to others ...;\u201d there exists an \u201cimminent threat of injury to [D.M.S.] or to others because of [D.M.S.\u2019s] acts or omissions ...;\u201d and, if his mental disorder goes untreated, it will \u201cpredictably result in deterioration of [D.M.S.\u2019s] mental condition to the point at which [D.M.S.] will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for [his] own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety ....\u201d The District Court then committed D.M.S. to MSH for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b69 Following D.M.S.\u2019s commitment to MSH, the District Court reheard the issues on D.M.S.\u2019s fitness to stand trial. The court then reversed its prior decision that D.M.S. was unfit for trial and reinstated the DUI charges. D.M.S. now appeals the District Court\u2019s order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b610 Since D.M.S. has already served his commitment at MSH, a question arises as to whether this matter is now moot. This Court has held that appeals from judgments of civil commitment are not rendered moot by the expiration of a ninety-day involuntary commitment, because such a commitment is too short in duration to allow the issues to be fully litigated prior to the respondent\u2019s release. <em>In re Mental Health of D.V., </em>2007 MT 351, \u00b6 32, 340 Mont. 319, 174 P.3d 503. Furthermore, the stigma associated with an involuntary commitment and the potential for damage to reputation extend well beyond the actual time a person is committed. Thus, because of the short duration of D.M.S.\u2019s commitment as well as the potential damage to D.M.S.\u2019s reputation because of being involuntarily committed, the matter before us is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b611 In an involuntary commitment proceeding, the State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and by clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters. Section 53-21-126(2), MCA; <em>Matter of D.D., </em>277 Mont. 164, 167, 920 P.2d 973, 975 (1996). This Court has not articulated a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>standard of review for involuntary commitment cases where a jury serves as the trier of fact. However, because the burden of proof for the State is the same in both an involuntary commitment proceeding and a criminal trial-that the State must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt-we analogize to the standard we use in a criminal trial. Where the sufficiency of the evidence is at issue in a criminal trial, regardless of whether a judge or a jury serves as the trier of fact, the standard of review is whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Brogan, </em>261 Mont. 79, 87, 862 P.2d 19, 24 (1993), <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 419, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 354, 198 P.3d 809. Thus, we will review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury\u2019s special verdict in a civil commitment case to determine whether any rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, could have found the essential elements necessary for commitment beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b612 Was <em>there sufficient evidence that a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that D.M.S. caused injury, or posed an imminent threat of injury to himself or others because of his mental disorder?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b6 13 Appellant argues \u201cthe State presented absolutely no evidence that D.M.S.\u2019s alleged threat of imminent injury was <em>because </em>of his cognitive disorder NOS. Rather, the State\u2019s evidence was that D.M.S. was dangerous because of his alcoholism and because of [a] life long pattern of criminal activity.\u201d Appellant next argues these conditions do not constitute a mental disorder pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-102(9), MCA, or provide the causation necessary to find D.M.S. in need of commitment. Appellant concludes there is a \u201ccomplete absence of testimony that D.M.S.\u2019s alleged recent acts of injury or his threat of imminent injury resulted from his cognitive disorder NOS ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b614 The State argues \u201c[i]t was the combination of alcohol and D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder that caused Dr. Mozer\u2019s concern about the safety of the community and the threat posed by D.M.S.\u201d Furthermore, the State argues, \u201c[t]he jury received sufficient testimony upon which to find that D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder, together with his penchant for alcohol, presented an imminent threat of injury to self or others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b615 At a trial or hearing on a petition for commitment, the court is tasked with determining whether or not the respondent is suffering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>from a mental disorder and whether he requires commitment. Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. If the court determines the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, then the court shall use the following criteria to determine whether he requires commitment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Sections 53-21-126(1), -127(7), MCA. Commitment is justified if any of the criteria above is satisfied, based on the court\u2019s \u201cdetailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment....\u201d Section 53-21-127(7), 8(a), MCA. An imminent threat of self-inflicted injury or injury to others \u201cmust be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant as to the respondent\u2019s present condition.\u201d Section 53-21-126(2), MCA; <em>In re Mental Health of A.K., </em>2006 MT166, \u00b6 18, 332 Mont. 511, 139 P.3d 849 (citation omitted). And the State must \u201cconnect [respondent\u2019s] serious mental illness with the claimed imminent threat of injury ....\u201d <em>A.K., </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b616 As \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(b)-(c), MCA, above provide, before the court can commit D.M.S., the court must determine that any of the above criteria occurs <em>because </em>of D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder. The State did not present evidence that D.M.S.\u2019s alleged threat of injury was because of his cognitive disorder NOS. Rather, the State\u2019s evidence demonstrated D.M.S.\u2019s alleged threat of injury was because of his history of criminal activity and because of his alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">\u00b617 Dr. Mozer testified as to his opinion of D.M.S.\u2019s condition based on \u201creviewing] a great deal of material on him ...\u201d including hospital records and evaluation reports. During the State\u2019s direct examination of Dr. Mozer, counsel for the State asked Dr. Mozer whether, in his opinion, D.M.S. is a threat to others. His reply was \u201cI\u2019m deeply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>concerned that he\u2019s a threat to the community.\u201d Counsel for the State then asked Dr. Mozer on what he based that opinion and he replied \u201cthe history of violent behavior preceding the matters that have been discussed here today.\u201d Upon D.M.S.\u2019s objection, the court did not allow Dr. Mozer to testify regarding specific acts he did not personally witness, and the State was not allowed to introduce evidence of D.M.S.\u2019s pre-2005 criminal history. However, Dr. Mozer testified that he had read documentation of D.M.S.\u2019s behavior from the past year and he found it to be \u201calarming.\u201d He also stated there were \u201c[ijnstances of profanity and altercations\u201d supporting his concern that D.M.S. was a threat to others. Dr. Mozer went on to testify as to his opinion of D.M.S.\u2019s alcohol use and stated that it is a \u201cforegone conclusion that once released into society he will be drinking again ...\u201d and that it is \u201chighly predictable\u201d that once D.M.S. begins drinking again his behavior will be a threat to others. Finally, counsel for the State inquired whether Dr. Mozer had \u201cformed an opinion as to whether [D.M.S.\u2019s] mental disorder will, if untreated, predictably result in a deterioration of his mental condition[.]\u201d Dr. Mozer responded \u201cyes\u201d and, when asked the basis for that opinion, stated \u201cI think everyone in this room knows that alcohol greatly deteriorates a person\u2019s behavior and demeanor.\u201d Dr. Mozer also testified that, in his opinion, if D.M.S. were not committed he would be a threat to others because \u201c[l]ess external control over his behavior surely means less self-control of his behavior.\u201d Dr. Mozer then referred to other parts of D.M.S.\u2019s record that described him as \u201cirritable\u201d and \u201cvery volatile\u201d and Dr. Mozer stated that the entirety of the record has \u201ca great deal to say about him being dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b618 The State also called several law enforcement officers, including a deputy sheriff and a patrol sergeant from Ravalli County Sheriffs Office to testify regarding D.M.S.\u2019s two arrests for DUI and the traffic stop of D.M.S. in relation to the arson investigation. As part of that testimony, counsel for the State asked the detective whether there was \u201canything that made you concerned that he might have been driving in an impaired-appearing manner because of his medical conditions[.]\u201d The detective responded \u201cI had nothing to make me believe it at that time, that it was anything other than the consumption of an alcoholic beverage.\u201d The detective also stated that before he placed D.M.S. under arrest his behavior was \u201cnormal but intoxicated\u201d but after the arrest he began to use profanity and was \u201cvery irate, very escalated.\u201d He also testified that at various times throughout the booking process D.M.S. vacillated between calm and irate.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b619 Although this testimony may show D.M.S. suffers from various antisocial behavior patterns or alcohol abuse, neither the State nor the District Court drew a causal connection showing D.M.S. posed an imminent threat of injury to self or others <em>because </em>of his mental disorder or that his cognitive disorder NOS caused such behavior. The testimony focused on past criminal activity and alcohol use. While a \u201cmental disorder may co-occur with addiction or chemical dependency\u201d the term \u201c[mjental disorder\u201d \u201cdoes not include ... addiction to drugs or alcohol....\u201d Section 53-21-102(9), MCA. Dr. Mozer\u2019s testimony focused heavily on the effects of D.M.S.\u2019s alcohol abuse and how it affected D.M.S.\u2019s behavior. Dr. Mozer\u2019s testimony also focused on D.M.S.\u2019s manifestations of his antisocial personality, including profanity and altercations. D.M.S.\u2019s antisocial personality was not, however, stipulated or considered a mental disorder in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AC3\">\u00b620 The State must \u201cconnect [respondent\u2019s] serious mental illness with the claimed imminent threat of injury ....\u201d <em>A.K., </em>\u00b6 30. The State did not present any evidence indicating that, because of his cognitive disorder (as opposed to alcoholism or antisocial behavior), D.M.S. caused injury or posed an imminent threat of injury to himself or others. Accordingly, the evidence presented did not establish a causal connection between D.M.S.\u2019s cognitive disorder NOS and the behavior described in the reports or alleged by law enforcement. Even viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could not have found D.M.S. in need of commitment to MSH.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b621 Thus, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order of commitment of D.M.S. and remand to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b284-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"A54W\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b622 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion. I write separately, however, to note that I would have also reversed in this case because of the violation of D.M.S.\u2019s right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b623 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the court ordered D.M.S. to submit to a new mental health interview by Dr. Mozer. D.M.S. refused to cooperate in the interview. Both the State and the District Court then commented to the jury regarding D.M.S.\u2019s refusal to speak with Dr. Mozer. Indeed, at the beginning of D.M.S.\u2019s case, the court instructed the jury to the effect that the court had ordered D.M.S. to submit to further testing and that D.M.S. had declined. Furthermore, the State purposely solicited testimony regarding D.M.S.\u2019s silence during its direct and re-direct examinations of Dr. Mozer, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>prosecutor attempted to create the impression that D.M.S. was trying to manipulate the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b624 Individuals who are involuntarily detained or against whom a petition for civil commitment has been filed have an express statutory right to remain silent. Section 53-21-115(6), MCA. This right is in addition to any other rights that may be guaranteed by the United States and Montana Constitutions. Persons subject to commitment are required to be advised of this right by the county attorney in writing. Section 53-21-114, MCA. This Court has recognized the existence of this statutory right to remain silent and that this right applies to professional person examinations under \u00a7 53-21-123(1), MCA. <em>In re Mental Health ofKG.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485. And, we have repeatedly held that the procedural protections guaranteed respondents in civil commitment cases, such as the right to remain silent, are \u201ccritically important due to the \u2018calamitous effect of a commitment,\u2019 which includes loss of liberty ....\u201d <em>In re A.K., </em>2006 MT 166, \u00b6 11, 332 Mont. 511, 139 P.3d 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b625 Commenting on an involuntary commitment respondent\u2019s right to remain silent is akin to the State or the court commenting on a criminal defendant\u2019s exercise of his or her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article II, \u00a7 25 of the Montana Constitution. Both the United States Supreme Court and this Court have concluded that when that sort of comment is introduced into a criminal trial, reversible error occurs. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 618-19, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 2245 (1976); <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. 25, 34-35, 927 P.2d 1033, 1039 (1996); <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>229 Mont. 78, 82, 746 P.2d 588, 590 (1987). If a person\u2019s right to remain silent is to have any meaning, then the individual protected by that right must be protected from the State or the trial court using the individual\u2019s exercise of that right against him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b626 In this case, the State and the trial court both injected reversible error into D.M.S.\u2019s commitment proceedings by commenting on his exercise of his right to remain silent and to not be interviewed by Dr. Mozer. Were we not reversing on the issue of causation, I would reverse on this ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b627 I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b285-8\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A0Qg\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u00b628 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to vacate D.M.S.\u2019s commitment. I conclude sufficient evidence exists in the record for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that D.M.S. recently caused injury to others and to find to a reasonable medical certainty he did so because of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>mental disorder. Section 53-21-126(l)(b), (d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b629 As stated by the Court, in a criminal case, a motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence is only appropriate if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, no evidence exists upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>State v. Bomar, </em>2008 MT 91, \u00b6 13, 342 Mont. 281, 182 P.3d 47; <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of such a motion de novo, because evidence is either sufficient or it is not. <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19. However, when considering the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court should not-as I believe it does in this case-substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact because the trier of fact views the evidence firsthand, observes the demeanor of the witnesses, and weighs the credibility of each party. <em>State v. Maetche, </em>2008 MT 184, \u00b6 14, 343 Mont. 464, 185 P.3d 980; <em>State v.

However, considering all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, it is clearly sufficient to establish that D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder causes him to be dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b631 D.M.S. exercised his right to remain silent by refusing to speak with Dr. Mozer. Nevertheless, after reviewing the evidence available to him, Dr. Mozer testified that, in his expert opinion, D.M.S. was dangerous to the community even when he was in a controlled environment. In the structured setting of the state hospital, D.M.S. engaged in violence against other patients. Dr. Mozer also testified that D.M.S. was an alcoholic and alcohol caused a deterioration of his mental condition. A fair interpretation of Dr. Mozer\u2019s testimony is that the deterioration of D.M.S.\u2019s mental condition made him dangerous. The jury was entitled to interpret this testimony to the effect that D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder causes the violent outbursts and destructive behavior, not the consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b632 Dr. Hill, a qualified mental health expert called by D.M.S., testified D.M.S. suffered a cognitive decline contributed to by alcohol abuse. She went on to confirm that, while in a controlled setting at the state hospital, D.M.S. attacked another patient at least once. She testified that D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder causes him to become violent if he does not get his way. She said D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>predictably deteriorate further if left untreated and that he poses a risk to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b633 Several times during the trial when things were not going his way, in the presence of the jury, D.M.S. spontaneously interjected comments, demonstrating anger as well as an inability to control himself. The jury witnessed these outbursts and was entitled to consider them in making its determination whether D.M.S.\u2019s consumption of alcohol or his admitted mental disorder caused him to be a threat to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b634 When one drinks to excess, one does not necessarily burn up vehicles. From the evidence of D.M.S.\u2019s actions when he was sober, his actions at the trial, and the facts surrounding the arson, the jury was entitled to find that D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder, and not the consumption of alcohol, caused him to burn the vehicles at the trailheads.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b635 I would conclude the jury was presented with more than sufficient evidence to find, as a matter of fact, D.M.S.\u2019s mental disorder caused him to recently harm others and made him a danger to the community. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
