We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b62 Albert presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b63 Whether Billings Municipal City Code (BMCC) 27-601(g) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to Albert.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">\u00b64 Whether Albert was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">\u00b65 Whether the Municipal Court erred in denying Albert\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">\u00b66 Whether the District Court erred in determining Albert\u2019s sentence was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">\u00b67 Albert owns a residence on South 26th Street in Billings, Montana. On September 1, 2005 and September 22, 2006, Billings Code Enforcement Officer Don Vegge (Vegge) charged Albert with storage of salvage, in violation of BMCC 27-601(g). Ajury trial on both counts was held in Municipal Court on March 28, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">\u00b68 Counsel for the City of Billings (City) presented testimony from Vegge and two other City Code Enforcement Officers in its case in chief. The witnesses testified regarding complaints received from Albert\u2019s neighbors, their repeated attempts to work with Albert to clean up his property, and the facts surrounding issuance of the two citations. Numerous photographs depicting Albert\u2019s property were also admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">\u00b69 Albert was represented by counsel. Albert did not testify and his counsel presented no case in chief. Albert\u2019s counsel moved for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the City\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Colette B. Davies denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b610 The jury found Albert guilty on both charges. Judge Davies sentenced Albert to six months in jail and a $500 fine, all suspended, on each count. The conditions for suspension were that Albert clean up his property to the satisfaction of the Code Enforcement Division by April 30, 2007, and that he receive regular treatment from Dr. Van Dyke and take his medication as prescribed. Albert appealed to the District Court, which affirmed his convictions and sentence. Albert appeals the District Court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b611 Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality. <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 167, 174 P.3d 469. The person challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional. <em>Knudson, </em>\u00b6 12. The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law. <em>Knudson, </em>\u00b6 12. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Constitution to determine if it is correct. <em>Knudson, </em>\u00b6 12. Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>Knudson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"AEN\">\u00b6 12 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of fact and law that we review de novo. <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 18, 316 Mont. 198, 70 P.3d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b613 A motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence (formerly a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal) is appropriate in a criminal trial if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, \u201cno evidence exists upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Bomar, </em>2008 MT 91, \u00b6 13, 342 Mont. 281, 182 P.3d 47; <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 16, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511; <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-16-403, MCA. We review a district court\u2019s denial of such a motion de novo, because evidence is either sufficient or it is not. <em>Bomar, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19.</p>\n<p id=\"AgK\">\u00b614 We review a criminal sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Legg, 2004 MT </em>26, \u00b6 24, 319 Mont. 362, 84 P.3d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\u00b615 <em>Whether Billings Municipal City Code (BMCC) 27-601(g) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to Albert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u00b616 A criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague if \u201ca person is required to speculate as to whether his contemplated course of action may be subject to criminal penalties.\u201d <em>State v. Mainwaring, 2007 MT </em>14, \u00b6 18, 335 Mont. 322, 151 P.3d 53. Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution protect against vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>statutes that infringe a citizen\u2019s right to due process. U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 17. The void for vagueness doctrine \u201crequires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Knudson, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 1858 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"AcL2\">\u00b617 Relying on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Kolender, </em>this Court developed a two-part test to determine whether a statute is unconstitutional as applied to a particular situation. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 27, 299 Mont. 165, 998 P.2d 544. First, we consider whether actual notice was given to citizens. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27. Second, we ask whether the statute contains minimal guidelines sufficient to govern law enforcement. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b618 Albert argues that BMCC 27-601(g) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, infringing on his right to due process. Albert contends that the substantive terms in the municipal ordinance are not defined, thus the ordinance failed to provide actual notice of what conduct was proscribed and failed to provide minimal guidelines sufficient to govern City Code Enforcement Officers. In essence, Albert claims that there is no reasonable way to ascertain from the ordinance what property cannot legally remain in his yard for over five days.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab8\">\u00b619 The pertinent part of BMCC 27-601(g) reads, \u201c[pjermanent open storage of salvage, inoperable vehicles, rubbish or other chattel shall not be permitted in any zoning district.\u201d The ordinance defines \u201cpermanent storage\u201d as \u201cstorage of chattel, salvage, rubbish or junk for a period exceeding five (5) days without moving.\u201d BMCC 27-601(a). \u201cOpen storage\u201d is defined as \u201cthe storage for a period of five (5) days or more of an unlicensed or inoperable vehicle, appliance, implement or machinery, or any part thereof, outside of an enclosed structure.\u201d BMCC 27-601(a). Albert argues that inconsistencies between these two definitions make understanding what constitutes \u201cpermanent open storage\u201d unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b620 Additional definitions in the Billings Municipal City Code diminish these claimed inconsistencies. In particular, \u201cjunk\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">any worn out, cast off or discarded article or material which is ready for destruction or has been collected or stored as salvage, for conversion to some other use or for reduction into components. Junk includes but is not limited to old or scrap brass, rope, rags, batteries, paper, tires, rubber debris or waste, iron, steel and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>other old or scrap ferrous or non-ferrous material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">BMCC 27-601(a). This definition was provided to the jury. When viewed as a whole, BMCC 27-601(g) is thus increasingly specific on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b621 There was nothing vague about how the ordinance was applied to Albert. Albert received multiple warnings by City Code Enforcement Officers before he was cited for violating the ordinance. Officer Vegge described at trial how he visited Albert on several occasions in response to complaints received from neighbors. Vegge explained what items needed to be removed and even offered to assist in removal efforts. Vegge testified as to the following items, which he considered trash, debris, junk or garbage in Albert\u2019s yard: all kinds of bicycle parts and tire rims hanging on the house or in trees; piles of junk wood that could not be used; plastic and metal containers, some rusted or covered in dust and debris; metal barrels; lots of cardboard boxes strewn around, both empty and full of garbage or food; a trailer; car batteries; ladders against the house; an old umbrella; lots of things in piles or covered by a tarp; and other items hanging off the house. Clearly these items are within the meaning of BMCC 27-601(g). Vegge\u2019s warnings constituted actual notice to Albert of what was required for him to comply with the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b622 Having concluded that Albert was given actual notice of what he was required to remove from his yard, the remaining question under the <em>Dixon </em>test is whether the ordinance contains minimal guidelines sufficient to govern law enforcement \u201cin a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting <em>Kolender, </em>461 U.S. at 357, 103 S. Ct. at 1858). Officer Vegge described how the City Code Enforcement Division enforces BMCC 27-601(g) at trial. Enforcement is complaint generated. This avoids \u201ca standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting <em>Kolender, </em>461 U.S. at 358, 103 S. Ct. at 1858). The City\u2019s enforcement process does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because officers only respond to citizen complaints. Furthermore, a certain degree of subjective judgment is inherent in many criminal statutes. For example, subjective judgment is required to determine what constitutes \u201ccareful and prudent\u201d driving when enforcing \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA, prohibiting careless driving. Similarly, \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, prohibiting disorderly conduct requires subjective judgment to determine what conduct \u201cdisturbs the peace.\u201d Likewise, the minimal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>guidelines provided by BMCC 27-601(g) are sufficient to govern law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"ANu\">\u00b623 Since Albert has not proven BMCC 27-601(g) unconstitutional, we conclude that the District Court was correct in determining that BMCC 27-601(g) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Albert.</p>\n<p id=\"AG3q\">\u00b624 <em>Whether Albert was denied effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b625 Albert claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his defense, on the grounds that his counsel presented no case in chief, did not call Albert as a witness to testify, and failed to present any pretrial motions to the City Court challenging the constitutionality of BMCC 27-601(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b626 We have discussed our approach to ineffective assistance of counsel claims on many occasions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. This Court has adopted the two-pronged test of <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, in judging ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>Sellner v. State, </em>2004 MT 205, 322 Mont. 310, 95 P.3d 708. The defendant must demonstrate that (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d State <em>v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 275, \u00b6 14, 70 P.3d 1234, \u00b6 14 (citing State <em>v. St. John, </em>2001 MT 1, \u00b6 37, 304 Mont. 47, \u00b6 37, 15 P.3d 970, \u00b6 37); and (2) \u201cestablish prejudice by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing State <em>v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 19, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 19, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 19). The first prong carries a strong presumption in favor of the State, as counsel is allowed wide latitude in deciding what tactics she should, and should not, employ in defending her client. <em>See State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 48, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 48, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 48.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">State <em>v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. We have also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">[I]t is entirely possible within the framework of <em>Strickland </em>to find attorney error which possibly prejudiced the defendant, yet conclude that such error did not rise to a level serious enough to result in a verdict unworthy of confidence.... The burden on the defendant under <em>Strickland </em>is a heavy one. The defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>show that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d while also showing that counsel\u2019s deficient performance was so prejudicial that he was denied a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><em>State v. Hagen, </em>2002 MT 190, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 117, 53 P.3d 885 (quoting <em>Strickland, 466 U.S. </em>at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b627 Applying the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we find that Albert\u2019s counsel was reasonably effective. The City presented overwhelming evidence against Albert at trial, including photographs of his yard taken at the time of both citations and testimony by three City Code Enforcement Officers. Nonetheless, Albert\u2019s counsel was effective in voir dire and cross examination. During cross examination, Albert\u2019s counsel vigorously questioned the City\u2019s proof that the salvage was permanent, i.e. had not moved for over five days. This strategy formed the basis of his unsuccessful motion to dismiss for inefficient evidence. As noted above, \u201ccounsel is allowed wide latitude in deciding what tactics [he] should, and should not, employ in defending [his] client.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 48).</p>\n<p id=\"AH9i\">\u00b628 Furthermore, under the second <em>Strickland </em>prong, we find no reasonable probability that Albert would have been acquitted had his counsel pursued a different trial strategy. We concluded above that the constitutional challenge failed. Given the overwhelming evidence against Albert, we cannot conclude that Albert\u2019s testimony would have changed the results of the trial. Therefore, we hold that Albert was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b629 <em>Whether the Municipal Court erred in denying Albert\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient </em>evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b630 Albert contends that the Municipal Court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. He claims that the evidence did not prove that the offending items in his yard were \u201cpermanent,\u201d which was defined by the ordinance as storage for longer than five days without moving. Albert now argues that the District Court erred in finding sufficient evidence to convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">\u00b631 We find that there was sufficient evidence to convict Albert. Counsel for the City asked each witness how they knew that the items remained in Albert\u2019s yard without moving for more than five days. The officers indicated that they drove by Albert\u2019s property regularly and that the condition of his yard did not improve. Photographs showed items that remained in Albert\u2019s yard a year after the first citation. The testimony of the City Code Enforcement Officers and the photographs of Albert\u2019s property were sufficient for a jury to conclude that the items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>remained in Albert\u2019s yard for longer than five days. We therefore conclude that the Municipal Court was correct in denying Albert\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining Albert\u2019s sentence was legal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b633 Section 46-18-201(4), MCA, allows a sentencing judge to impose any reasonable conditions during the period of suspension of a sentence. Judge Davies suspended Albert\u2019s sentence on the condition that he clean up his property to the satisfaction of the City Code Enforcement Division. Albert argues that this condition is illegal because the particular items to be removed must be specifically itemized. Otherwise, Albert claims that the sentence allows a \u201cblanket clean up\u201d of his property left solely to the discretion of City Code Enforcement Officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b634 During trial Albert saw the photographs and heard the testimony of officers regarding the items that must be removed from his yard. Further, when Judge Davies asked him if he understood what he needed to do to become code compliant, Albert responded, \u201cI understand what they want.\u201d The City Code Enforcement Division provided a dumpster behind Albert\u2019s property and was ordered to assist in the clean up. Albert was informed that he could either dispose of the offending items or store them inside. Nothing about the sentence or conditions is unreasonable. As the District Court noted, if the officers should act unreasonably in enforcing code compliance, Albert can seek post-conviction relief. We conclude that Albert\u2019s sentence was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-8\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-17\"> We deem Albert\u2019s motion as a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence made pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, and apply the same standard of review as previously used for motions for a directed verdict of acquittal. <em>See State v.
