He appeals, arguing that the District Court erred in denying his pretrial motion to exclude evidence of his status as a probationer. We agree with Derbyshire and further conclude that the State has not demonstrated the error was harmless. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>We accordingly reverse Derbyshire\u2019s conviction, vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment, and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b62 As alleged in the State\u2019s probable-cause affidavit, federal and state officers executed a search of Derbyshire\u2019s residence and vehicle on March 7, 2007. Derbyshire was present during the search. The officers found three baggies of marijuana and a digital scale in his pickup and two baggies of marijuana in his jacket (which he was not wearing at the time). They also found some marijuana hidden in a bedroom ceiling tile. In sum, the officers allegedly found 639.46 grams of marijuana. The State further alleged that Derbyshire admitted he had been dealing marijuana since January 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b63 The case proceeded to trial on December 6, 2007. At a conference held that morning, the prosecutor informed the court that he would be calling a federal probation officer and a state probation officer as witnesses. Both officers had been involved in the search of Derbyshire\u2019s residence and vehicle. The prosecutor noted that he had instructed the officers not to discuss the reasons why Derbyshire was on probation, but he acknowledged that \u201ccertainly the fact that they are probation officers is going to get the jury\u2019s ear.\u201d Thus, he stated he would not have a problem with the court\u2019s giving a cautionary instruction concerning evidence of prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b64 Defense counsel objected, arguing that there should be \u201cno reference at all to my client being on probation.\u201d Counsel pointed out that Derbyshire was not contesting the legality of the search, and he suggested that the witnesses could identify themselves as \u201cofficers\u201d or \u201cagents\u201d of the State. But the prosecutor contended that it was impossible for the officers to testify without mentioning that they were \u201cprobation\u201d officers. He explained that he intended to ask questions about their experience and their ability to identify the marijuana found during the search. Defense counsel replied that \u201cthey can do that without identifying that they\u2019re probation officers.\u201d Counsel suggested the officers could testify \u201cthat they work for the State, that they do searches all the time, that they\u2019re aware and been trained in what marijuana is, they know its smell, its appearance. I think that can all be done without going into the fact they are probation officers.\u201d Counsel also pointed out that identifying them as a federal probation officer and a state probation officer would imply that Derbyshire had been convicted of not just one, but two felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b65 The District Court ruled that the officers could identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>themselves as \u201cprobation officers.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201cthe general rule is that if there is part of a transaction that involves probation officers that-in which that is certainly the situation here then the State\u2019s not required to excise their evidence in order to put their case on trial.\u201d The court granted defense counsel\u2019s request for a continuing objection to such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b66 After the jury was selected and preliminary instructions were given, but prior to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, the District Court (outside the jury\u2019s presence) revisited the issue of \u201cprobation\u201d references. The court inquired whether the prosecutor could present the State\u2019s evidence \u201cwithout making reference to the fact that it was a probation search.\u201d The court also inquired whether the officers could testify simply \u201cthat they are, in fact, law enforcement officers, and that they conducted this search in that regard.\u201d The court suggested that redacting the references to Derbyshire\u2019s status as a probationer might be prudent so as to avoid \u201ca legitimate issue of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b67 The prosecutor, however, responded that \u201cI\u2019m perfectly comfortable with this going up on appeal as to the prejudice.\u201d He argued that it was necessary to identify the officers as \u201cprobation officers\u201d in order to explain why and on what basis they searched Derbyshire\u2019s residence and vehicle, what steps they took in executing the search, how they determined that the substance they found was marijuana, and how they knew that Derbyshire was the only person living in the residence. He noted that he intended in his opening statement to tell the jury not to decide the case based on Derbyshire\u2019s status as a probationer, but he maintained that the fact the officers were \u201cprobation\u201d officers conducting a \u201cprobation\u201d search was admissible under the transaction rule (discussed below) because this evidence was inextricably linked to and explanatory of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b68 The District Court agreed, reasoning that \u201cthe involvement of the probation officer was part of the transaction of the whole investigation here.\u201d The court also reasoned that the officers\u2019 status as \u201cprobation officers\u201d would be \u201crelevant as to why they had certain knowledge\u201d and \u201cwhy they did certain things the way that they did.\u201d Thus, the court denied Derbyshire\u2019s motion to exclude \u201cprobation\u201d references, though the court again granted defense counsel\u2019s request for a continuing objection to any such references. In addition, recognizing that there was \u201can inherent prejudice\u201d in identifying the witnesses as \u201cprobation officers\u201d and Derbyshire as a \u201cprobationer,\u201d the court indicated that it would give the jury a cautionary instruction. In this regard, the prosecutor suggested that \u201ca modification of the regular 404(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>instruction\u201d would be sufficient (a reference to the jury instruction typically given when evidence is admitted under M. R. Evid. 404(b)). \u00b69 The District Court then recalled the jury, and the prosecutor gave his opening statement. At the outset, he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">On March 7, 2007, Great Falls Police Detective Rob Lopez, a narcotics investigator, was asked to assist in conducting a search of the residence of James Derbyshire, the defendant here today. Derbyshire at the time-the reason for the search was that information had been received that Derbyshire was possibly involved in drugs. Derbyshire at the time was a probationer, and as such his residence was subjected to search on reasonable suspicion, less of a-less of a requirement than those of us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">And let me just be clear on something from the get-go. The State, the defense, and the Court are asking you to weigh this case based only on the evidence presented, and, in fact, you must do so, and not based in any way on this defendant\u2019s status as a probationer. I just want to make that very clear, and she\u2019ll instruct you on that as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">With that said I\u2019ll continue. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The prosecutor then recounted the search of Derbyshire\u2019s residence and vehicle as well as the statements Derbyshire made to Detective Lopez. The prosecutor mentioned two of the probation officers (Jim Brills and Kevin Heiferman) a number of times, referring to them alternatively as \u201cprobation officers,\u201d \u201cpolice officers,\u201d or simply \u201cOfficer Brills\u201d and \u201cOfficer Heiferman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b610 The State called Detective Lopez as its first witness. Among other things, Lopez testified to the following. He was aware on the day of the search that Derbyshire was a \u201cprobationer.\u201d He discussed with \u201cprobation officers\u201d whether Derbyshire was possibly engaged in drug activity. He and \u201cthe probation office\u201d agreed on how to proceed. They did not need a warrant to search Derbyshire\u2019s residence because he was a \u201cprobationer.\u201d The \u201cprobation officers\u201d involved in the search \u201cwere two federal probation officers, Officer Antonson and Officer Heiferman and two state probation officers which would have been Officer Brills and Officer Hydes.\u201d Upon their arrival, Derbyshire came out of the residence because one of the \u201cprobation officers\u201d had called him and asked him to come down to \u201cthe probation office\u201d for a meeting. The \u201cprobation officers\u201d conducted the search of the residence. The \u201cprobation officers\u201d found an illegal substance. The \u201cprobation officers\u201d gave Lopez the items they had found. While Lopez was interviewing Derbyshire, the \u201cprobation officers\u201d were still at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>residence conducting the search. When Lopez returned to the residence, the \u201cprobation officers\u201d turned over additional drugs. It is pretty common for the police to assist with \u201cprobation searches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b611 Over the course of Lopez\u2019s testimony on direct examination (spanning 37 pages of a double-spaced transcript), \u201cprobation\u201d appears 18 times. Notably, the word does not appear during his testimony on cross-examination. In addition, it is noteworthy that the prosecutor used the word far more often than Lopez. Indeed, Lopez generally referred to Antonson, Heiferman, Brills, and Hydes as \u201cofficers,\u201d not \u201cprobation officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b612 At the conclusion of Lopez\u2019s testimony, the court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">The State has presented evidence that the Defendant was on probation at the time of the search, and this evidence has been submitted for the sole purpose of explaining the facts surrounding this search. The jury is prohibited from using this information to assume that somehow the Defendant is more likely to be guilty of this offense because he was on probation. He\u2019s to be judged on this offense based only upon the evidence that is submitted to you regarding this offense and that alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b613 The State next called Officer Brills. Brills testified that in his \u201cwork as a probation and parole officer, we do a lot of searches and end up finding a lot of paraphernalia and drugs.\u201d He further testified that in conducting \u201cprobation searches,\u201d he had come across marijuana multiple times and, thus, was familiar with the odor and sight of the drug. Turning to the search of Derbyshire\u2019s residence, Brills stated that he arrived with \u201cstate probation and parole officer Tim Hydes, federal probation and parole officer Ray Antonson and federal probation officer Kevin Heiferman, and Detective Rob Lopez, Great Falls PD.\u201d Brills then described his search of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u00b614 Over the course of Brills\u2019 testimony on direct and redirect examinations (spanning 15 pages), \u201cprobation\u201d appears 16 times, almost exclusively in Brills\u2019 answers (as opposed to the prosecutor\u2019s questions). It even seems that Brills went out of his way to use the word, as illustrated here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">Q. And did [Derbyshire] exit the residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">A. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">Q. And what happened when he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">A. He was detained by Officer-federal probation and parole officer Heiferman and federal probation and parole officer Antonson as well as Detective Rob Lopez. Probation and parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>officer Hydes and myself came across the street. We parked across the street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Similarly, on redirect, Brills testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">Q. Mr. Brills, was that dropped ceiling throughout the house, or was it only in the defendant\u2019s bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">A. No, it was also a drop ceiling in the living room and I believe Officer Hydes and-probation officer Hydes and federal probation officer Antonson were looking in the ceiling tile above the ceiling tile in the living room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Brills also used \u201cprobation\u201d twice during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b615 Officer Heiferman\u2019s testimony is not quite as saturated with the word \u201cprobation,\u201d though it does appear eight times in the first two pages of the direct examination where Heiferman discusses his occupation and prior experience and identifies \u201c[m]yself, another federal probation officer, Ray Antonson, state probation officers Jim Brills and Tim Hydes\u201d as the persons who were present at the search of Derbyshire\u2019s residence. All in all, the prosecutor and the State\u2019s three witnesses used the term \u201cprobation\u201d (or some form of the word, such as \u201cprobationer\u201d) 44 times.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b616 The State and the defense both rested on the first day of trial. The following morning, prior to closing arguments, the District Court read the jury a number of instructions, including Instruction No. 10, which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">The State has presented evidence that the Defendant was on probation at the time of the search. This evidence was introduced for the sole purpose to explain the facts surrounding the search. The jury is prohibited from using this information to assume that the Defendant is more likely to be guilty of this offense. He is to be judged on this offense based only on the evidence regarding this offense alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">\u00b617 The jury returned a verdict of guilty. Thereafter, the District Court sentenced Derbyshire to the Montana State Prison for a term of 20 years, with no time suspended. Derbyshire now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">\u00b618 We address two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Derbyshire\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his status as a probationer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">2. If so, has the State demonstrated that the error was harmless?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b619 A trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 471, 133 P.3d 206. Thus, as a general rule, we review a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 10. In exercising its discretion, however, the trial court is bound by the Rules of Evidence or applicable statutes. Thus, to the extent the court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, our review is de novo. <em>See State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458 (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretations of the Constitution or the rules of evidence, <em>de novo.\u201d)', State v. Incashola, </em>1998 MT 184, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 399, 961 P.2d 745 (\u2018Where, as here, a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law, we review that conclusion to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law.\u201d); <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 196, 179 P.3d 534 (\u201cThe interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law, which we review de novo.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b620 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in denying Derbyshire\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his status as a probationer?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYLB\">\u00b621 We begin with the undisputed proposition that evidence of Derbyshire\u2019s status as a probationer constitutes evidence that he has committed other crimes, which is generally inadmissible. <em>See State v. Bain, </em>176 Mont. 23, 29, 575 P.2d 919, 923 (1978) (\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of a separate or collateral crime is not admissible.\u201d); <em>State v. Tiedemann, </em>139 Mont. 237, 242, 362 P.2d 529, 531 (1961) (\u201cProof that [the] accused committed other crimes, even if they were of like nature to that charged, is not admissible to show his depravity or criminal propensities, or the resultant likelihood of his committing the offense charged; nor may such evidence be offered if it only tends to create a prejudice against the accused in the minds of the jury.\u201d); <em>Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, 475, 69 S. Ct. 213, 218 (1948) (\u201cThe State may not show defendant\u2019s prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpetrator of the crime.\u201d); <em>cf. State v. West, </em>245 Mont. 298, 301-02, 800 P.2d 1047, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>1049-50 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b622 One of the dangers in admitting such evidence is that the jury will \u201c \u2018prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gowan, </em>2000 MT 277, \u00b6 19, 302 Mont. 127, 13 P.3d 376 (quoting <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 476, 69 S. Ct. at 218). A defendant must not be convicted \u201cmerely because he is an unsavory person,\u201d <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 19, or on the rationale that because he committed a crime in the past, he has a defect of character that makes him more likely than people generally to have committed the charged offense, <em>see State v. Medina, </em>245 Mont. 25, 28, 798 P.2d 1032, 1034 (1990), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Olson, </em>286 Mont. 364, 373, 951 P.2d 571, 577 (1997). Accordingly, we have said that the general rule barring proof of other crimes \u201cshould be strictly enforced in all cases where applicable, because of the prejudicial effect and injustice of such evidence, and should not be departed from except under conditions which clearly justify such a departure. The exceptions should be carefully limited, and their number and scope not increased.\u201d <em>Tiedemann, </em>139 Mont. at 242-43, 362 P.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Rule 404(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b623 In this connection, M. R. Evid. 404(b) states that while evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts \u201cis not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,\u201d it \u201cmay ... be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d The admission of evidence under Rule 404(b), however, requires compliance with four substantive and three procedural criteria first announced in <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 269, 274, 602 P.2d 957, 961, 963-64 (1979), and subsequently modified in <em>State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142-43, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991). These criteria are known as the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>See Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b624 Derbyshire contends that evidence of his status as a probationer does not meet the substantive criteria of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. We need not address that issue, however, because Derbyshire also points out, correctly, that the State did not comply with all of the procedural criteria of the Rule. Specifically, evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts \u201cmay not be received unless there has been written notice to the defendant that such evidence is to be introduced.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. The notice must \u201cspecify the evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts to be admitted, and the specific Rule 404(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>purpose or purposes for which it is to be admitted.\u201d <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142-43, 814 P.2d at 56; see <em>also </em>\u00a7 46-13-109, MCA. In the present case, the State did not provide such notice. Thus, evidence of Derbyshire\u2019s status as a probationer was not admissible under Rule 404(b) and <em>Matt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Section 26-1-103, MCA</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b625 Instead, as discussed above, the State invoked the transaction rule as grounds for allowing its witnesses to identify themselves as \u201cprobation\u201d officers conducting a \u201cprobation\u201d search of the home and vehicle of a \u201cprobationer.\u201d Under the transaction rule, \u201c[w]here the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. The admission of evidence under the transaction rule is not subject to the substantive and procedural requirements of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>See State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53. We thus have characterized the transaction rule as an \u201cexception\u201d to the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule. <em>See e.g. Buck, </em>\u00b6 75; <em>State v. Marshall, </em>2007 MT 198, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 395, 165 P.3d 1129; <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 36, 341 Mont. 450, 178 P.3d 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b626 The District Court agreed with the State\u2019s theory, reasoning that \u201cthe involvement of the probation officer was part of the transaction of the whole investigation here\u201d and that the officers\u2019 status as \u201cprobation officers\u201d would be \u201crelevant as to why they had certain knowledge\u201d and \u201cwhy they did certain things the way that they did.\u201d Derbyshire, however, contends that the District Court erred in this respect. He argues that the \u201cfact in dispute\u201d at his trial was whether he possessed a dangerous drug with intent to distribute. See \u00a7 45-9-103(1), MCA. He suggests that evidence of this fact would include whether he possessed a dangerous drug and whether he had intent to distribute it. But the specific roles and titles of the officers who gathered evidence, Derbyshire asserts, had no consequence on the ultimate issue of whether he possessed a dangerous drug with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b627 The State responds that it \u201cneeded to explain how police came to understand certain facts-i.e., that Derbyshire \u2018was possibly engaged in drug activity\u201d . . . and that Derbyshire lived alone.\u201d Moreover, the State claims it \u201cwas necessary for the officers who conducted the probation search to establish their knowledge and ability to recognize marijuana,\u201d it also \u201cwas necessary to explain to the jury why the police and probation officers were there and why they were allowed to be there,\u201d and there was \u201ca need to differentiate\u201d the roles of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>probation officers from the role of Detective Lopez. The State contends that the only way to accomplish these purposes was to have the officers identify themselves as \u201cprobation officers\u201d and testify that Derbyshire was \u201con probation and under their supervision in their capacities as probation officers.\u201d According to the State, such testimony was admissible under the transaction rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b628 First, there is an undertone in the State\u2019s arguments, both here and in the District Court, that the \u201cprobation\u201d references were properly allowed because they were \u201cneeded\u201d and \u201cnecessary.\u201d The criterion, however, is \u201cadmissibility,\u201d not \u201cneed\u201d or \u201cnecessity,\u201d and evidence which is otherwise inadmissible in a criminal trial does not become admissible merely by showing that the evidence is \u201cneeded\u201d or \u201cnecessary.\u201d Rather, the State (or the defendant, as the case may be) must cite and comply with authority-e.g., a statute or rule of evidence-which allows the evidence in question to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b629 That being said, the transaction rule, as noted, states that \u201c[wjhere the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. \u201cAdmissibility under the transaction rule is predicated on the jury\u2019s right to hear what transgressed immediately prior and subsequent to the commission of the offense charged, so that they may evaluate the evidence in the context in which the criminal act occurred.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Detonancour, 2001 MT 213, \u00b6 29, 306 Mont. 389, 34 P.3d 487 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the fact in dispute was whether Derbyshire possessed a dangerous drug (marijuana) with intent to distribute. Section 45-9-103(1), MCA. The officers\u2019 status as \u201cprobation\u201d officers and Derbyshire\u2019s status as a \u201cprobationer\u201d are neither part of nor evidence of this disputed fact. Nor are they evidence of what transgressed immediately prior and subsequent to the commission of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b630 Indeed, the prosecutor did not offer the officers\u2019 status as \u201cprobation\u201d officers and Derbyshire\u2019s status as a \u201cprobationer\u201d in order to prove specifically that Derbyshire possessed marijuana with intent to distribute. Rather, he candidly offered this evidence to establish the circumstances surrounding the search. Accordingly, at the conclusion of Lopez\u2019s testimony, the District Court instructed the jury: \u201cThe State has presented evidence that the Defendant was on probation at the time of the search, and this evidence has been submitted for the sole purpose of explaining the facts surrounding this search.\u201d (Instruction No. 10 was to the same effect.) The search, however, was not a fact in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>dispute. Consequently, \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, was not a ground for admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u201cInextricably Linked To and Explanatory Of\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b631 The State does not contend that the \u201cprobation\u201d references were \u201cpart of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact.\u201d Section 26-1-103, MCA. Rather, the State identifies in our caselaw several alternative standards of varying stringency for admitting evidence under the transaction rule. In <em>State v. Wing, </em>264 Mont. 215, 870 P.2d 1368 (1994), for example, we stated that evidence which \u201ctends to explain circumstances surrounding the charged offense\u201d is relevant, probative, and competent, and we associated this standard with \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. <em>See Wing, </em>264 Mont. at 224-25, 870 P.2d at 1374. In <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2004 MT 34, 320 Mont. 26, 85 P.3d 753, we stated that evidence is admissible under the transaction rule if it is \u201cinextricably linked to, and explanatory of, the charged offense,\u201d and we again associated this standard with \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. <em>See Lozon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Notably, we also used the phrases \u201cinseparably related to the alleged criminal act\u201d and \u201cnot wholly independent or unrelated to the charged offense.\u201d <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 12. The former requires that the evidence fall within narrow parameters (be \u201cinseparably related\u201d), while the latter requires that the evidence not fall outside broad parameters (not be \u201cwholly independent or unrelated\u201d). In any event, based on these standards, the State suggests that evidence of a defendant\u2019s probationary status is admissible under the transaction rule if it is \u201cinextricably linked to the circumstances surrounding the crimes charged.\u201d The State observes that we agreed with this contention on the facts of <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, 308 Mont. 99, 39 P.3d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b632 In considering the State\u2019s argument, we first note that the standards discussed in the preceding paragraph evolved from this Court\u2019s jurisprudence under the doctrines of corpus delicti and res gestae. <em>See e.g. State v. Hayworth, </em>1998 MT 158, \u00b6 31, 289 Mont. 433, 964 P.2d 1 (\u201cUnder the concept of <em>corpus delicti, </em>\u2018[ejvidence of acts which are inextricably or inseparably linked with the crime charged is admissible without regard to the rules governing \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence.\u2019 \u201d (brackets in <em>Hayworth))', Wing, </em>264 Mont. at 224, 870 P.2d at 1374 (\u201cThe concepts embraced by the term <em>res gestae </em>are included within the codification of that common law doctrine in \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, also referred to as the \u2018transaction\u2019 rule.\u201d); <em>State v. Moore, </em>254 Mont. 241, 245, 836 P.2d 604, 607 (1992) (\u201cThe alleged acts of the defendant occurring after the alleged crime was committed are also inseparably related to the alleged criminal act, as part of the res gestae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>or corpus delicti of the crime, and therefore are not subject to the restriction of \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence.\u201d). Tracing the standards back even further, it appears they originated in this Court\u2019s pre-Rule 404(b) \u201cother crimes\u201d jurisprudence. <em>See e.g. State v. Riley, </em>199 Mont. 413, 425-26, 649 P.2d 1273, 1279 (1982); <em>State v. Jackson, </em>180 Mont. 195, 201-02, 589 P.2d 1009, 1014 (1979); <em>State v. Frates, </em>160 Mont. 431, 436-37, 503 P.2d 47, 50 (1972); <em>State v. Jensen, </em>153 Mont. 233, 238, 455 P.2d 631, 633-34 (1969); <em>State v. Merritt, </em>138 Mont. 546, 548-49, 357 P.2d 683, 684 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b633 In <em>State v. Hansen, </em>1999 MT 253, 296 Mont. 282, 989 P.2d 338, however, we rejected the notion that evidence of matters closely related to and explanatory of the charged offense is part of the corpus delicti of the crime. <em>See Hansen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-69. We also abandoned the doctrine of res gestae. <em>See Hansen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72-84. We stated that we will, \u201cinstead, use the specific rule of evidence or statute that applies to the particular factual situation presented\u201d to determine the admissibility of the evidence at issue. <em>Hansen, </em>\u00b6 81. In the present case, the specific rule of evidence or statute that applies to the particular factual situation presented is \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Yet, in spite of our decision in <em>Hansen, </em>we have not addressed whether the standards previously recognized under the doctrines of corpus delicti and res gestae and associated with the transaction rule in <em>Wing, Lozon, Hayworth, </em>and other cases are correct interpretations of \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA. Nevertheless, while it may be necessary to resolve this question in a future case, we need not do so here. For the reasons which follow, we reject the State\u2019s argument that evidence of the officers\u2019 status as \u201cprobation\u201d officers and Derbyshire\u2019s status as a \u201cprobationer\u201d was \u201cinextricably linked to the circumstances surrounding the crime charged.\u201d As noted, the State identifies several purposes for such evidence. We address each one in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b634 First, the State contends that it \u201cneeded to explain how police came to understand ... that Derbyshire \u2018was possibly engaged in drug activity\u2019 indicating a reasonable basis to search his home.\u201d Along these same lines, the State contends that it had \u201cto present evidence that the officers were authorized to search Derbyshire, his house, and his truck without a warrant\u201d because \u201cit was necessary to explain to the jury why the police and probation officers were there and why they were allowed to be there.\u201d Yet, the lawfulness of the search is not an element of the crime charged, and the officers\u2019 authority to conduct the search is not inextricably linked to Derbyshire\u2019s alleged possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Notably, as the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>acknowledges, Derbyshire never challenged the legality of the search. But even if he had, that was not a matter for the jury to decide. Finally, even assuming, arguendo, that the State needed to establish the legality of the search, Derbyshire points out that the officers could have testified they had reason to believe he possessed marijuana based on information they had received from reliable sources. The jury did not need to know that the officers learned this information because Derbyshire was on probation and under their supervision. For that matter, the prosecutor could have requested an instruction from the court that the lawfulness of the search was not at issue, and the officers could have testified simply that they found marijuana in Derbyshire\u2019s residence and pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b635 Second, the State contends that it needed to establish that Derbyshire lived alone in order to \u201ccement[ ] the allegation that Derbyshire, and not someone else, possessed the marijuana found in his house.\u201d Yet, the officers did not have to identify themselves as \u201cprobation officers\u201d in order to establish that Derbyshire lived alone. Indeed, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of Officer Brills illustrates this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">Q. And just lastly, did you find any indications in the defendant\u2019s house that he was-that anybody else was living there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">A. No indication whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Q. No personal property of anybody else, no mail of anybody else, no clothes of anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think it\u2019s beyond the scope of cross-examination, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">THE WITNESS: There was no indication that anyone else lived there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Similarly, the prosecutor questioned Officer Heiferman as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">Q. Mr. Heiferman, was there any indication from the room that that room was occupied by anyone else besides the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-14\">A. No, no other indication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-15\">Q. Was there any indication in the rest of the room that you observed that anybody else was living there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-17\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: No more questions. Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbD\">\u00b636 Third, the State contends that \u201cit was necessary for the officers who conducted the probation search to establish their knowledge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ability to recognize marijuana.\u201d The State fails to explain, however, why it was necessary in this connection to identify the officers specifically as \u201cprobation officers.\u201d The State asserts that the officers gained their knowledge and ability to recognize marijuana through training and experience. Yet, the State offers no reason why they could not have testified to that effect (i.e., that they are federal/state officers who have been trained to recognize marijuana or have the ability to do so through prior experience) without identifying themselves as \u201cprobation officers.\u201d This point aside, the State\u2019s argument fails on a more fundamental ground. As the State proposes to use the evidence, the officers\u2019 status as \u201cprobation officers\u201d is explanatory of <em>their knowledge and ability to recognize marijuana. </em>That, however, is not the purpose of the transaction rule. To be admissible, the evidence must be explanatory of <em>the charged offense </em>(i.e., of Derbyshire\u2019s alleged possession of the drug with intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b637 Fourth, the State contends that \u201cin the context of a probation search supported by law enforcement, there is a need to differentiate the roles of the probation officers-to conduct the search-and the roles of the police-to secure the suspect, premises, and any evidence seized.\u201d For the reasons discussed above, however, the individual roles played by the officers conducting the search are not inextricably linked to Derbyshire\u2019s alleged possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Nor is it necessary to identify the officers\u2019job titles in order to explain what they did during the search of his residence and vehicle-the legality of which is not an issue, in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b638 Lastly, we address the State\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2002 MT 7, 308 Mont. 99, 39 P.3d 689. In that case, the defendant (Bauer) was charged with two counts of incest and one count of unlawful transactions with children. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 13. The district court ruled that the fact of Bauer\u2019s lengthy prior prison internment and his status as a probationer when he visited the victim (Amanda) in Anaconda were admissible as part of the transaction. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 20. In reviewing this ruling, we observed that in order for the jury to understand the context of the alleged incest, Amanda needed to explain that she had not seen or known Bauer because he had been incarcerated since she was a small child. Moreover, we noted that Bauer had used his prison sentence to silence Amanda by telling her that he would be returned to prison and either die or commit suicide there if she spoke about the incest. Finally, Bauer was required, as a condition of probation, to apply for permission to travel, and the travel permits were presented at trial to show that Bauer had falsified the forms to conceal his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>intention to stay with Amanda when visiting Anaconda. <em>See Bauer, </em>\u00b6 23. On these facts, we agreed with the State that Bauer\u2019s history of imprisonment and his probationary status when he visited Amanda in Anaconda were inextricably linked to the circumstances surrounding the crimes charged. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>see also State v. Brasda, </em>2003 MT 374, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 319 Mont. 146, 82 P.3d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b639 Analogizing to <em>Bauer, </em>the State asserts that the jury needed \u201cto understand the context of Derbyshire\u2019s possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.\u201d The State does not explain why this is so, but regardless of that fact, we conclude that the State\u2019s analogy is unavailing. The officers here could have testified, without identifying themselves as \u201cprobation officers,\u201d that they found marijuana in Derbyshire\u2019s pickup, bedroom ceiling tile, and jacket. Such testimony would have established the \u201ccontext\u201d of his possession. Thus, whereas Bauer\u2019s probationary status was inextricably linked to the context of his visits with Amanda, Derbyshire\u2019s probationary status was not inextricably linked to the context of his alleged possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\">\u00b640</p>\n<p id=\"Aej\">Based on the foregoing discussion, and in light of the State\u2019s arguments in this Court and in the District Court, it appears that the prosecution simply wanted the jury to know that Derbyshire was on state and federal probation when he committed the charged offense. Derbyshire, however, may not be convicted based on the inference that because he committed crimes in the past, he is more likely to have committed the one charged here. <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Medina, </em>245 Mont. at 28, 798 P.2d at 1034; <em>Tiedemann, </em>139 Mont. at 242, 362 P.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">\u00b641 The District Court admitted the evidence in question \u201cfor the sole purpose of explaining the facts surrounding this search.\u201d The transaction rule, however, allows the admission of evidence of \u201cthe fact in dispute\u201d under \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA, or evidence of matters that are inextricably linked to and explanatory of \u201cthe charged offense\u201d under the alternative standards set forth in our caselaw. The search was neither a fact in dispute nor an element of the charged offense. Thus, the transaction rule was not a basis for allowing the officers to identify themselves as \u201cprobation officers\u201d and to testify that Derbyshire was \u201con probation.\u201d We hold that the District Court erred in denying Derbyshire\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his status as a probationer. Given this conclusion, we now consider whether the State has demonstrated that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b642 <em>Issue 2. Has the State demonstrated that the error was </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>harmless?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Am_\">\u00b643 A cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial. Section 46-20 -701(1), MCA. In <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735, we articulated the analytical framework for determining whether an error prejudiced the convicted person\u2019s right to a fair trial and is, therefore, reversible. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Step One</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b644 The first step in the <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis is to determine whether the error is structural error or trial error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error is the type of error that affects the framework within which the trial proceeds. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. It typically is of constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Given its nature, structural error cannot be qualitatively weighed against the admissible evidence introduced at trial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. As a result, structural error is not subject to harmless error review. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Rather, it is automatically reversible, and no additional analysis or review is required. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39. Trial error, by contrast, is the type of error that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Trial error can be reviewed qualitatively for prejudice relative to other evidence introduced at trial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. Thus, trial error is not presumptively prejudicial, is not automatically reversible, and is subject to harmless error review. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">\u00b645 Derbyshire contends that the error here was structural because it \u201cundermined the entire trial framework, given that it set the stage for what the officers could say time and time again.\u201d He further argues that the error \u201cdid not occur during the presentation of the case. Rather, it established how the case would be presented.\u201d Yet, under this reasoning, every erroneous ruling on a motion in limine would constitute structural error because the ruling would \u201cset the stage\u201d for what happens at trial. This approach would dramatically expand the concept of \u201cstructural error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">\u00b646 Structural errors are defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism which infect and contaminate the framework within which the trial proceeds. <em>See State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6 32, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244. Examples include lack of an impartial trial judge, total deprivation of the right to counsel, conflict of interest in representation throughout the entire proceeding, the right to self-representation at trial, the right to a public trial, unlawful exclusion of grand jurors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the defendant\u2019s race, and an erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction to the jury. <em>See Matt, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204. We cannot agree with Derbyshire that the error here contaminated the trial mechanism along the lines that a biased judge, lack of counsel, or a jury-selection error would. Although the District Court made its ruling prior to trial, the errors ultimately occurred during the presentation of the case each time the court (despite Derbyshire\u2019s pretrial motion and his continuing objection) allowed the officers to testify that they were \u201cprobation officers\u201d and that Derbyshire was \u201con probation.\u201d We conclude, therefore, that the error was trial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Step Two</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b647 The second step in the <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis is to determine under the cumulative evidence test whether the trial error was harmless. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41, 43; <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 307 Mont. 172, 36 P.3d 922. The first question under this test is whether the tainted evidence was admitted to prove an element of the offense. <em>See Peplow, </em>\u00b6 49. Next, if the tainted evidence was admitted to prove an element of the offense, then the State must direct us to admissible evidence that proves the same facts as the tainted evidence and demonstrate that the quality of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility it might have contributed to the conviction. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 49; <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-45. But if the tainted evidence was not admitted to prove an element of the offense, then the admission of the evidence will be deemed harmless only if the State demonstrates that the quality of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility it might have contributed to the conviction. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49, 51; <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46, 47; <em>accord State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 26, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b648 Applying this test, we first observe that \u201ca person commits the offense of criminal possession with intent to distribute if the person possesses with intent to distribute any dangerous drug as defined in 50-32-101.\u201d Section 45-9-103(1), MCA (2005). Marijuanais a dangerous drug. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 50-32-101(6), -222(4)(t), MCA. The facts that the officers were \u201cprobation officers\u201d and that Derbyshire was \u201con probation\u201d are not elements of this offense. Accordingly, the tainted evidence was not admitted to prove an element of the offense. Thus, the admission of the evidence will be deemed harmless only if the State demonstrates that I the quality of the tainted evidence was such that there was no reasonable possibility it might have contributed to Derbyshire\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u00b649 The State contends that Derbyshire has objected to only \u201cthe officers\u2019 titles as federal and state probation officers\u201d and not the \u201csubstantive probation search evidence.\u201d Thus, according to the State, the error here was harmless because other evidence, to which Derbyshire purportedly did not object, proved the same fact as did the tainted evidence (namely, that he was on probation). This argument is without merit. Defense counsel asserted that there should be <em>\u201cno reference at all </em>to my client being on probation\u201d (emphasis added), and Derbyshire has maintained that position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b650 Alternatively, citing <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 27, 327 Mont. 238, 113 P.3d 290, the State argues that \u201cthe inherent prejudice in mentioning Derbyshire\u2019s probation and identifying witnesses as his probation officers\u201d was cured by the District Court\u2019s two cautionary instructions and the prosecutor\u2019s command during his opening statement that \u201cyou [must] weigh this case based only on the evidence presented . . . and not based in any way on this defendant\u2019s status as a probationer.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b651 For one thing, we explained in <em>State v. Croteau, </em>248 Mont. 403, 407, 812 P.2d 1251, 1253 (1991), and again in <em>State v. Ray, </em>267 Mont. 128, 133-34, 882 P.2d 1013, 1016 (1994), that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts must, as a general rule, be excluded because \u201cprior acts or crimes are highly prejudicial to the defendant, and usually irrelevant for purposes of the charged crime.\u201d Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts or uncharged misconduct creates the risk that the jury will penalize him simply for his past bad character, <em>Croteau, </em>248 Mont. at 407-08, 812 P.2d at 1253; <em>Ray, </em>267 Mont. at 134, 882 P.2d at 1016, or prejudge him and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against the particular crime charged, <em>State v. Gowan, </em>2000 MT 277, \u00b6 19, 302 Mont. 127, 13 P.3d 376. Therefore, in terms of quality, the tainted evidence here was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b652 To make matters worse, the prosecutor and the State\u2019s three witnesses managed to incorporate this highly prejudicial evidence into their respective questions and answers 44 times. <em>Long, </em>therefore, is clearly distinguishable. That case involved a single, unsolicited statement by a witness to which there was a contemporaneous objection followed by a curative instruction. <em>See Long, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-27. By contrast, the present case involves numerous (and apparently deliberate) uses of the word \u201cprobation\u201d which, by virtue of its repetition, is one of the most conspicuous aspects of the trial transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\">\u00b653 We hold that there is a reasonable possibility the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the tainted evidence might have contributed to Derbyshire\u2019s conviction and that the State, therefore, has not demonstrated that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b654 The Dissent asserts that our analysis \u201cgoes astray.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 58. The Dissent does not dispute that the admission of the \u201cprobation\u201d references was error. Rather, the Dissent argues that the error was harmless because the State presented \u201ctruly overwhelming\u201d and \u201cunassailable\u201d evidence of Derbyshire\u2019s guilt. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 58,62,63. In <em>Van Kirk, </em>however, we categorically rejected this \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d approach, under which a court simply tallies the admissible evidence of guilt to determine whether, quantitatively, it is sufficiently \u201coverwhelming.\u201d We stated that the <em>quality of </em>the tainted evidence (more specifically, the qualitative impact the tainted evidence might have had on the fact-finder), not the <em>quantity </em>of the admissible evidence, is the proper focus when determining whether trial error was harmless. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-36, 43. To that end, the State must show that, <em>qualitatively, </em>there is no reasonable possibility the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44,46. And for the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the State has not made this showing in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASc\">\u00b655 Testimony by the State\u2019s witnesses that they were \u201cprobation officers\u201d and that Derbyshire was \u201con probation\u201d was not admissible under Rule 404(b) or the transaction rule. Thus, the District Court erred in denying Derbyshire\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his status as a probationer. The State has not demonstrated that this error was harmless. We accordingly reverse Derbyshire\u2019s conviction, vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment, and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u00b656 Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-9\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AUo\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">\u00b657 I dissent. I agree with the Court that it would have been better to grant Derbyshire\u2019s motion to exclude the fact that he was on probation. Derbyshire made no challenge to the search of his person or his residence, and the State had ample evidence that he lived alone. Thus, the fact that it was probation officers who authorized and conducted the search did not tend to prove that a fact of consequence was more or less probable. Thus, the \u201cprobation\u201d designation is irrelevant. M. R. Evid. 401. However, any error was clearly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">\u00b658 Citing <em>Peploui </em>and <em>VanKirk, </em>the Court notes at \u00b6 47 that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>erroneous admission of evidence is harmless if the State demonstrates that the quality of the tainted evidence does not raise the reasonable possibility that such evidence contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>VanKirk </em>was decided in 2001. In later cases, the Court has specifically considered the strength of the evidence against the defendant, as well as the prejudicial effect of the testimony and whether a cautionary jury instruction could cure any prejudice, in making its determination whether a particular error was harmless. <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 238, 113 P.3d 290; <em>State v. White, </em>2008 MT 129, \u00b6 15, 343 Mont. 66, 184 P.3d 1008. In this case, the Court should, but does not, consider that the evidence against Derbyshire is truly overwhelming. <em>See White, </em>\u00b6 15. This, in my opinion, is where the Court goes astray.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b659 The charge is criminal possession of drugs with the intent to distribute. As was noted by the District Court, the allegations are straightforward. There was a probation search. A digital scale and 639.46 grams of marijuana were found on Derbyshire\u2019s person and in his home. Derbyshire made admissions to the officers that he was in possession of the marijuana. There was no evidence indicating that the marijuana was for Derbyshire\u2019s personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b660 Prior to trial, Derbyshire advised the District Court that what he wanted was a plea bargain, but the State\u2019s offer was for too much prison time. So, no agreement had been reached and he decided to go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b661 At the beginning of his opening statement the prosecutor told the jury that Derbyshire was on probation and immediately commanded the jury not to take this fact into account in determining his guilt. Then, four witnesses testified that Derbyshire had possession of a digital scale, marijuana on his person and a large supply of marijuana in his residence where he lived alone. Derbyshire waived his opportunity to make an opening statement and presented no witnesses. The District Court twice instructed the jury that it was not to consider the fact that he was on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b662 The State\u2019s evidence was simple, straightforward, and clearly showed Derbyshire was guilty as charged. In his closing argument, defense counsel admitted to the jury that none of the evidence was controverted and that the State had proven that Derbyshire was in possession of at least 60 grams of marijuana. The only defense argument offered was that since all of the evidence seized had not been tested by the state crime laboratory, the State had not proved that it I was all marijuana, and thus asked for a misdemeanor conviction. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>However, all of the leafy plant material in evidence, part of which was admittedly marijuana, was before the jury to look at, smell and compare with that part of the evidence which had been tested. In short, the jury was presented with unassailable evidence that Derbyshire had been caught red-handed in possession of a very large amount of contraband, he admitted such possession, he had a scale to weigh it for sale, there was no evidence that the marijuana was for his personal use, and he presented no viable argument that he was not guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b663 I conclude that considering the overwhelming evidence of guilt, along with the admonition of the prosecutor and the cautionary instructions of the District Court, there is no reasonable possibility that the admission of the irrelevant fact that Derbyshire was on probation had anything at all to do with his conviction. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
