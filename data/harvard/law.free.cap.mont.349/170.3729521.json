The District Court ordered B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights terminated. B.J.M. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"A_A\">\u00b62 The sole issue B.J.M. raises on appeal is whether the District Court erred in terminating B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights because B.J.M. was unfit as provided in \u00a7 42-2-608(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">\u00b63 In December 2003, B.J.M. gave birth to K.P.M. Until a paternity test was conducted in summer 2004, it was unclear who KP.M.\u2019s father was. When it was confirmed that I.J.C. was KP.M.\u2019s father, he and B.J.M. maintained an informal parenting plan for about a year where they shared custody of K.P.M. During this time, B.J.M. was living a transient lifestyle and was unreliable in keeping her commitments to or maintaining contact with I.J.C. and K.P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">\u00b64 In March 2005, B.J.M. transferred primary parenting responsibility to I.J.C. A month later, I.J.C. filed a petition in the District Court to determine that he was K.P.M.\u2019s father and to establish a parenting plan. The District Court granted the petition, determined that I.J.C. was KJP.M.\u2019s father, and established a parenting plan, making I.J.C. KP.M.\u2019s primary parent and giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>B.J.M. regularly scheduled weekly and holiday visitation. However, B.J.M. did not regularly visit with K.P.M. and had no contact with either K.P.M. or I.J.C. for substantial periods of time. Between July 2005 and November 2006, B.J.M. made no contact with I.J.C. or K.P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b65 The parenting plan ordered B.J.M. to pay $103 per month in child support to begin several months later, so she could attempt to achieve greater financial stability. By the time S.J.D. commenced this action, B.J.M. had paid only $12.94 in child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b66 For about half of 2006, B. J.M. was incarcerated or in residential treatment for problems related to illegal drug use. In November 2006, after being released from treatment, B.J.M. contacted I.J.C. to arrange a visit with K.P.M. At the visit, K.P.M. did not know who B.J.M. was at first, but after playing for an hour in the park, he warmed up to her. However, because of the sporadic nature of B.J.M. and KP.M.\u2019s contacts, K.P.M. never bonded with B.J.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b67 S.J.D., I. J.C.\u2019s wife, filed a petition to adopt K.P.M. in March 2007. Two months later, she filed a petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights in the same district court action as her petition for adoption. \u00b68 At the hearing on the petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights, the District Court found that B.J.M. provided an unsuitable environment for K.P.M. because her home was unkempt, she associated with known drug dealers and users, and she was involved with abusive partners and exposed K.P.M. to such abuse. The District Court further found S.J.D. was a constant in KP.M.\u2019s life and is the only mother that K.P.M. has known. The District Court found any attempt to establish a relationship between B. J.M. and K.P.M. would not be in K.P.M.\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b69 Based on its findings of fact, the District Court concluded that clear and convincing evidence established B.J.M. abandoned K.P.M. and also that she failed to support him, financially and otherwise, when she was able to do so for a period of over one year. The District Court concluded B.J.M. was unfit and ordered her parental rights terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the evidence, or if we come away from our review with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye, </em>250 Mont. 320, 323, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>820 P.2d 1285, 1287 (1991). Because parental rights are a fundamental liberty interest, an order terminating these rights must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Adoption of </em>C.R.N., 1999 MT 92, \u00b6 7, 294 Mont. 202, 979 P.2d 210. Clear and convincing evidence is not a mere preponderance of evidence nor is it unanswerable or conclusive evidence or evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. Clear and convincing evidence is a preponderance of evidence that is definite, clear, and convincing. <em>In re </em>G.M., 2008 MT 200, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 87, 186 P.3d 229. The three part <em>DeSaye </em>test is used to determine if a finding of fact is clearly erroneous in a case where clear and convincing evidence is the standard of proof. <em>In re </em>G.M., \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b611 Finally, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re </em>C.R.N., \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b612 Relating to adoption, \u00a7 42-2-602, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">A child is not legally free for adoption until the parental rights of the birth parent or parents have been terminated by a court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">(1) as provided in this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(2) pursuant to Title 41, chapter 3; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">(3) of competent jurisdiction in another state or country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">\u00b613 Therefore, parental rights maybe terminated as provided in Title 42, MCA. The general provisions of the Montana Adoption Act (Title 42) set forth who may be adopted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">(1) A child is legally free for adoption if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">(a) the child does not have a living parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">(b) the parental rights of the living parents of the child have been terminated according to the laws of this state or of another jurisdiction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">(c) the living parents, guardian authorized by the court, or department or agency with custody of the child consent to the adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">(2) An adult maybe adopted as provided in 42-4-401 through 42-4-405.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-17\">(3) A stepchild may be adopted as provided in 42-4-301 through 42-4-304 and 42-4-309 through 42-4-312.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">Section 42-1-105, MCA. At the time she filed her petition to adopt K.P.M., S.J.D. mistakenly alleged that B.J.M. would consent. When consent was not forthcoming, she filed the petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights pursuant to Title 42, MCA. Section 42-4-302, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(1) A stepparent has standing to file a petition for adoption of a minor child of the stepparent\u2019s spouse if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">(a) the spouse has legal and physical custody of the child and the child has been in the physical custody of the spouse and the stepparent during the 60 days preceding the filing of a petition for adoption;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">(3) A petition for adoption by a stepparent may be joined with a petition for termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b614 Under \u00a7 42-4-302(l)(a), MCA, S. J.D. qualifies as a stepparent who has standing to file a petition for adoption of K.P.M. Statutes are not to be read in isolation, but as a whole. In construing statutes, this Court must give effect to all of their provisions if possible. <em>Darby Spar, Ltd. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>217 Mont. 376, 379, 705 P.2d 111, 113 (1985). Considering \u00a7 42-4-302, MCA, as a whole, it is only logical to conclude that S.J.D., as a custodial stepparent, has standing to adopt under subdivision (1), and may combine her petition to adopt with a petition for termination of parental rights under subdivision (3). Consequently, she has standing to petition for termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b615 Section 42-4-310, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">A stepparent who desires to adopt a stepchild shall obtain an order of termination of parental rights of the child's noncustodial parent prior to or contemporaneously with the petition to adopt. Any necessary consents must be filed with the petition for adoption. Notice of the hearing on the petition must be given, and the stepparent shall attend the hearing conducted by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO7\">\u00b616 The most reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA, is that</p>\n<p id=\"AJT\">a stepparent who must obtain a termination of the parental rights of the child's noncustodial parent, and who may do so prior to or contemporaneously with her petition to adopt her stepchild, has standing to petition for the required termination. Otherwise, the stepparent would easily be stymied by an inability to petition for termination, thus frustrating legislative intent. Reading relevant statutory schemes in their entireties is what allows the Court to give true effect to the will of the Legislature. <em>Dukes v. City of Missoula, </em>2005 MT 196, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 155, 119 P.3d 61. Considering Title 42 as a whole, it is clear the Legislature intended a custodial stepparent to have standing to file a petition to terminate a noncustodial parent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\u00b617 In compliance with \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA, S.J.D. sought and obtained the termination of B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights. Thus, B.J.M.\u2019s consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>KP.M.\u2019s adoption is no longer necessary. KP.M.\u2019s father has consented to the adoption. K.P.M. is thus available for S.J.D. to adopt, which is the next step in the process and will be scheduled for consideration by the District Court, pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b618 <em>Sua sponte, </em>the dissent posits that S.J.D. has no standing to petition to terminate B. J.M.\u2019s parental rights, asserting that only those included in the categories listed in \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, have standing to file a petition to terminate parental rights. However, \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, does not state that the only persons or entities that may file a petition to terminate parental rights are those that fall into one of the listed categories. Nor does it state that a stepparent lacks standing to file a petition to terminate a noncustodial parent\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b619 If \u00a7 42-2-603, MCA, was interpreted as the dissent suggests, no one would have standing to petition to terminate B. J.M.\u2019s parental rights. Neither DPHHS nor a child placing agency is involved in this case as I.J.C., the birth father, is caring for K.P.M. B.J.M. has not relinquished her parental rights to anyone, and there is no guardian. Under the dissent\u2019s interpretation, even I.J.C. could not petition for termination as he is not listed in sub-section (2). The logical interpretation of \u00a7 42-2-603, MCA, is that it applies in those instances when a birth mother has chosen to relinquish her parental rights and consent to the adoption of her child, but that it does not deny standing to a stepparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b620 Nowhere, in either party\u2019s pleadings, in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, in the evidence at the hearing, in the post-hearing briefing, in the District Court\u2019s order, or in the briefing to this Court, is there any contest to the fact that S.J.D. has standing to petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights and to adopt K.P.M. This is understandable. This Court has approved previous applications of Title 42 that are consistent with our interpretation today. <em>E.g. In re Adoption of C.W.D., </em>2005 MT 145, 327 Mont. 301, 114 P.3d 214 (affirming the grant of the stepfather\u2019s petition to terminate the natural father\u2019s parental rights); <em>See e.g. Matter of Adoption of J.B.T., </em>250 Mont. 205, 819 P.2d 178 (1991) (analyzing whether the stepfather carried his burden to justify terminating the natural father\u2019s parental rights, pursuant to \u00a7 40-8-lll(l)(a)(v), MCA); <em>Matter of Adoption of C.J.H., </em>246 Mont. 52, 803 P.2d 214 (1990) (holding the district court did not err in granting stepfather\u2019s petition for adoption and terminating natural father\u2019s rights); <em>Matter of Adoption of D.J. </em>V., 244 Mont. 209, 796 P.2d 1076 (1990) (affirming the district court\u2019s termination of the natural father\u2019s parental rights upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>stepfather\u2019s showing lack of support under \u00a7 40-8-lll(l)(a)(v), MCA); <em>Matter of Adoption of R.M., </em>241 Mont. 111, 785 P.2d 709 (1990) (affirming the termination of the father\u2019s parental rights because the stepfather showed by clear and convincing evidence the father was able to pay support and failed to do so); <em>Kanvick v. Reilly, </em>233 Mont. 324, 326, 760 P.2d 743, 745 (1988) (noting \u201c[i]n a separate adoption proceeding brought by K.R.\u2019s new stepfather, [the natural fatherj\u2019s parental rights were terminated\u201d); <em>Adoption of J.M.G., </em>226 Mont. 525, 736 P.2d 967 (1987) (holding the stepfather adduced substantial credible evidence to support the termination of the natural father\u2019s parental rights). S.J.D., as a custodial stepparent and pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 42-4-302 and 42-4-310, MCA, has standing to petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b621 Returning to the issues briefed by the parties, a district court may terminate a parent\u2019s rights to a child if it determines by clear and convincing evidence that a parent is unfit. Section 42-2-607(2), MCA. Grounds for unfitness are, <em>inter alia, </em>that the parent willfully abandoned the child or that the parent was able to support her child and failed to do so for one year before the filing of a petition to adopt. Section 42-2-608(l)(b)-(c), MCA. Section 41-3-102(l)(a)(i), MCA, defines \u201cabandonment\u201d as \u201cleaving a child under circumstances that make reasonable the belief that the parent does not intend to resume care of the child in the future.\u201d Alternatively, abandonment can be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">willfully surrendering physical custody for a period of 6 months and during that period, not manifesting to the child and the person having physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical custody or to make permanent legal arrangements for the care of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Section 41-3-102(l)(a)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b622 B.J.M., citing <em>Matter of Adoption of Doe, </em>277 Mont. 251, 921 P.2d 875 (1996), argues that the District Court erred in including the time she spent incarcerated when calculating the time period to establish abandonment. In <em>Adoption of Doe, </em>the hearing testimony clearly established that both parties understood the custody arrangement was temporary when the mother went to prison. The mother repeatedly and firmly refused to grant permanent custody and she made contacts with her children monthly while in prison. <em>Adoption of Doe, </em>277 Mont. at 257-58, 921 P.2d at 879. Thus, we concluded that the district court\u2019s finding of abandonment, based on its finding that the mother did not intend to resume caring for her children in the future, was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Adoption of Doe, </em>277 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Mont. at 258, 921 P.2d at 879-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b623 The circumstances of this case are readily distinguishable from <em>Adoption of Doe. </em>Unlike <em>Adoption of Doe, </em>there was no understanding between I.J.C. and B.J.M. that she would resume custody of K.P.M. in the future. I.J.C. may have known that the particular parenting arrangement was temporary at first, but \u201cthat it went downhill\u201d after they started sharing custody. He then did not hear from B.J.M. for over a year.</p>\n<p id=\"AFm\">\u00b624 Although <em>Adoption of Doe </em>did establish that involuntary separations due to incarceration do not necessarily rise to the level of abandonment in every case, the Court\u2019s decision there hinged on the determination that even though she was in prison, the mother clearly intended to resume care of her children in the future. <em>Adoption of Doe, </em>277 Mont. at 258, 921 P.2d at 879-80. Here, B.J.M. did not manifest the intention to resume custody, or even maintain contact with K.P.M. while she was incarcerated. Under the circumstances of this case, the District Court did not err in considering B.J.M.\u2019s time in prison and residential drug treatment-during which she had no contact with her son-as evidence she abandoned K.P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b625 The District Court found that B.J.M. failed to make any contact with K.P.M. for fifteen months. This time exceeds the six month requirement for application of \u00a7 41-3-102(l)(a)(ii), MCA. Also, before and during her absence, B.J.M. failed to manifest any intention she would someday resume physical custody or make permanent legal arrangements for K.P.M. Section 41-3-102(l)(a)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Afo\">\u00b626 In light of the record showing that during her periods of absence, B.J.M. was struggling with an abusive relationship, was using illegal drugs, and was running with known criminals, and because B.J.M. previously failed to follow through on her commitments to care for and visit with K.P.M., it was reasonable for the District Court to find that she did not intend to resume care of K.P.M. in the future, regardless of any understanding that the initial informal parenting plan was temporary. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-102(l)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AqgE\">\u00b627 We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that B.J.M. abandoned her son, as defined by \u00a7 41-3-102(l)(a), MCA, and thus was an unfit parent, is supported by substantial evidence. It is not apparent the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, and we are not left with the firm conviction that the court made a mistake. The District Court\u2019s finding that B.J.M. was unfit is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u00b628 We defer to the District Court\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>witnesses and to resolve any conflicts in the evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Pearson, </em>1998 MT 236, \u00b6 56, 291 Mont. 101, 965 P.2d 268. Atrial court is in a better position than the appellate court to judge the credibility of testimony. Absent a clear preponderance of the evidence against the district court\u2019s valuation, its findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal when based on substantial though conflicting evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Milesnick, </em>235 Mont. 88, 95, 765 P.2d 751, 755 (1988). Thus, because we have determined the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous, we base our analysis on the facts it found true.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b629 S.J.D. initially filed her petition for adoption under the impression that she had B.J.M.\u2019s consent to do so. As soon as S.J.D. knew B.J.M. would not consent, she followed the statutory mandate and filed her petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights, pursuant to \u00a7 42-4-302(3), MCA, to accompany the petition for adoption in this same proceeding. Thus, her petition to terminate parental rights is proceeding contemporaneously with her petition for adoption, and she has complied with \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA. While the dissent would dismiss S.J.D.\u2019s petition to adopt for failure to follow the correct statutory procedure, that matter was neither raised in the appellate briefs, nor was it an issue before the District Court in its consideration of the petition to terminate parental rights. This Court will not consider issues not raised or briefed. M. R. App. P. 12(1); <em>See State v. Slade, </em>2008 MT 341, \u00b6 23, 346 Mont. 271, 194 P.3d 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b630 Lastly, B.J.M. argues that the District Court erred when it found B.J.M. failed to support K.P.M. when she was able to do so for one year prior to the filing of the petition for adoption. <em>See </em>\u00a7 42-2-608(l)(c), MCA. Because we affirm the District Court\u2019s finding of unfitness based on abandonment, we need not address B.J.M.\u2019s lack of support argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b631 We conclude the District Court\u2019s finding that B.J.M. was an unfit parent, pursuant to \u00a7 42-2-608(l)(b), MCA, is not clearly erroneous. The District Court\u2019s judgment that B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights are terminated and that K.P.M. is available for adoption is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"Aqrh\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b198-8\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AB9\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u00b632 I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion in this case because S.J.D. did not have standing to bring a petition for termination of B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights, and because S.J.D. did not follow the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>statutory procedure in petitioning to adopt K.P.M. I am not suggesting here that B. J.M. should be granted sole custody of K.P.M., or even that B.J.M. should be granted unlimited visitation with K.P.M., nor am I unmindful of what may be in the best interests of K.P.M. I am simply stating that B. J.M.\u2019s fundamental right to parent K.P.M. should not be terminated without following the proper statutory criteria set forth by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b633 The Majority complain that \u201c[njowhere, in either party\u2019s pleadings, in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, in the evidence at the hearing, in the post-hearing briefing, in the District Court\u2019s order, or in the briefing to this Court, is there any contest to the fact that S.J.D. has standing to petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights and to adopt K.P.M.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. However, the Majority ignore the fact that standing is a doctrine involving justiciability and, as such, it is a threshold requirement in every case which we must address and decide <em>sua sponte </em>even if it is not raised by a litigant. <em>See Matter of Paternity of Vainio, </em>284 Mont 229, 235, 943 P.2d 1282, 1286 (1997). The standing requirement cannot be waived by failure to, or agreement not to, object. <em>Armstrong v.

Laws, chapter 480. The Adoption Act sets forth specific procedures to be followed in the adoption of a child. For example, \u00a7 42-1-107(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]n adoption decree may not be entered if the child who is the subject of an adoption proceeding is not legally free for adoption.\u201d And, \u00a7 42-2-602, MCA, provides that \u201c[a] child is not legally free for adoption until the parental rights of the birth parent or parents have been terminated by a court: (1) as provided in this title [Title 42]; [or] (2) pursuant to Title 41, chapter 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>[the Child Abuse and Neglect Act]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b635 Section 42-2-603, MCA, provides that, under Title 42, a petition for termination of parental rights may be filed by (1) the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS); (2) a licensed child-placing agency; (3) the prospective adoptive parent to whom a relinquishment has been issued; or (4) a guardian with custody of the child. Because S.J.D. is not one of the parties listed in this statute, she does not have standing to bring a petition for termination of B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b636 An \u201cagency\u201d is defined in \u00a7 42-1-103(4), MCA, to mean \u201ca child placement agency licensed by the state of Montana pursuant to Title 52, chapter 8, that is expressly empowered to place children preliminary to a possible adoption.\u201d In this case, neither DPHHS nor a licensed child-placing agency was involved in S.J.D.\u2019s attempt to adopt K.P.M. or in bringing a petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights. Consequently, neither of these two provisions of the statute confer standing on S.J.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b637 Section 42-2-603(2), MCA, also provides that a termination of parental rights may be filed by \u201cthe prospective adoptive parent <em>to whom the relinquishment is issued </em>[emphasis added].\u201d \u201cRelinquishment\u201d is defined at \u00a7 42-1-103(18), MCA, as the \u201cinformed and <em>voluntary release </em>in writing of all parental rights with respect to a child by a parent to an agency or individual [emphasis added].\u201d Hence, \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, contemplates that the birth parent or parents have voluntarily relinquished their parental rights in favor of the adoptive parent and consented to the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b638 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>S.J.D. claimed in her Petition for Adoption that B.J.M. had executed a Consent to Adoption, however, no Consent to Adoption by B.J.M. was filed with the petition, nor was one ever filed. B.J.M. did not voluntarily relinquish her parental rights, nor did she consent to the adoption. Thus, S.J.D. does not have standing to petition for termination of parental rights under this provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b639 In addition, \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, provides that a petition for termination of parental rights may be filed by a guardian with custody of the child. While the term \u201cguardian\u201d is not defined in the Adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Act, it is defined in the Montana Youth Court Act (Title 41, chapter 5, MCA) at \u00a7 41-5-103, MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">(21) \u201cGuardian\u201d means an adult:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">(a) who is responsible for a youth and has the reciprocal rights, duties, and responsibilities with the youth; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">(b) <em>whose status is created and defined by law. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Similarly, \u201ccustody\u201d is not defined in the Adoption Act, nor does \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, indicate whether it refers to legal custody or physical custody. Nevertheless, \u201cphysical custody\u201d is defined in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (Title 40, chapter 7, MCA) at \u00a7 40-7-103(14), MCA, as \u201cthe physical care and supervision of a child.\u201d \u201cLegal custody\u201d is defined in the Youth Court Act, again at \u00a7 41-5-103, MCA, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">(29) (a) \u201cLegal custody\u201d means <em>the legal status created by order of a court of competent jurisdiction </em>that gives a person the right and duty to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">(i) have physical custody of the youth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">(ii) determine with whom the youth shall live and for what period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">(iii) protect, train, and discipline the youth; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">(iv) provide the youth with food, shelter, education, and ordinary medical care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">(b) An individual granted legal custody of a youth shall personally exercise the individual\u2019s rights and duties as guardian unless otherwise authorized by the court entering the order. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">\u00b640 Under these statutory definitions, although S.J.D. has \u201cphysical custody\u201d of K.P.M. by virtue of the fact that she is married to and living with I.J.C. who has \u201clegal custody\u201d of K.P.M., S.J.D. is not the actual \u201cguardian\u201d of K.P.M. with \u201cstatus ... created and defined by law.\u201d Rather, that position is held by I.J.C., and, although S.J.D. asserted in her petition to terminate that she was filing the petition in conjunction with I.J.C., I.J.C. did not sign the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">\u00b641 Consequently, because S.J.D. was not one of the parties authorized to bring a petition for termination of parental rights under \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, she did not have standing to bring said petition.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa7\">\u00b642 The Majority claim that \u201c\u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, does not state that the only persons or entities that may file a petition to terminate parental rights are those that fall into one of the listed categories.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18. However, the Majoriy choose to ignore that nowhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, does it state that a petition for termination of parental rights may be brought by anyone other than those persons or entities that fall into one of the listed categories. It is axiomatic that it is not the role of a judge to insert what has been omitted from a statute or to omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Moreover, under the canon <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>we interpret the expression of one thing in a statute to imply the exclusion of another. <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>2007 MT 195, \u00b6 48, 338 Mont. 370, 169 P.3d 352 (citing <em>State v. Good, </em>2004 MT 296, \u00b6 17, 323 Mont. 378, 100 P.3d 644).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b643 In addition, while a stepparent has standing to file a <em>petition for adoption </em>under the criteria set forth in \u00a7 42-4-302(1), MCA, a stepparent does not have standing to file a <em>petition for termination of parental rights. </em>As noted previously, \u00a7 42-1-107(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]n adoption decree may not be entered if the child who is the subject of an adoption proceeding is not legally free for adoption,\u201d and a child is not legally free for adoption until the parental rights of the birth parent or parents have been terminated by a court. Section 42-2-602, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b644 The Majority contend that this interpretation of the statutes would mean that no one would have standing to petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights because there is no guardian. Opinion, \u00b6 19. This is entirely untrue. The Uniform Parentage Act (Title 40, chapter 6, part 1, MCA) defines the parent and child relationship as \u201cthe <em>legal relationship </em>existing between a child and the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parents <em>incident to which the law confers or imposes rights, privileges, duties and obligations.\u201d </em>Section 40-6-102(2), MCA (emphasis added). In an earlier proceeding, the District Court granted I.J.C.\u2019s petition to establish that I.J.C. was KP.M.\u2019s natural father and to give I.J.C. legal custody of K.P.M. As already noted, a \u201cguardian\u201d means \u201can adult... who is responsible for a youth and has the reciprocal rights, duties and responsibilities with the youth ....\u201d Section 41-5-103(21), MCA. Clearly I.J.C. is K.P.M.\u2019s guardian with all the concomitant rights, duties and responsibilities to K.P.M., and, as such, I.J.C. had standing to file for termination of B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA. However, he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b645 I also disagree with the Majority\u2019s position that because S.J.D. had standing to petition for adoption of K.P.M., she also had standing to petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights. Opinion, \u00b6 14. While \u00a7 42-4-302(3), MCA, states that \u201c[a] petition for adoption by a stepparent may <em>he joined </em>with a petition for termination of parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>rights [emphasis added],\u201d that does not give a stepparent standing to actually file a petition for termination. Rather, a stepparent may join their petition for adoption with the natural parent\u2019s petition for termination of parental rights. This more logically follows from the plain language of the statute since a stepparent needs the custodial parent\u2019s consent to adopt under \u00a7\u00a7 42-4-303, MCA. Thus, contrary to the Majority\u2019s contentions, S.J.D. did not seek and obtain the termination of B. J.M.\u2019s parental rights <em>\u201cin compliance </em>with \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b646 The Majority also contend that previous applications of Title 42 are consistent with the Majority\u2019s interpretation. Opinion, \u00b6 20. The Majority fail to point out however that all but one of the cases cited in the Opinion as a \u201cprevious application\u201d of Title 42 actually pre-date Title 42 as it exists today. Title 42 was completely revised in 1997, <em>see </em>1997 Mont. Laws, chapter 480, and the statute providing the criteria for termination of parental rights was added at that time long after most of the cases cited by the Majority were decided. Prior to 1997, it was only necessary for a stepparent to bring a petition for adoption; a petition for termination of parental rights was not required. <em>See </em>Title 40, chapter 8, MCA (1995) (repealed 1997 Mont. Laws, chapter 480, \u00a7 171).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b647 Furthermore, one of the cases the Majority cite, <em>Matter of Adoption of J.B.T., </em>250 Mont. 205, 819 P.2d 178, rims counter to the Majority\u2019s argument as the petition in that case was brought by <em>both </em>the natural mother and the stepfather. This Court also stated in that case that \u201c[b]ecause the natural parent can forever lose parental rights, this Court requires <em>strict compliance </em>with the statute.\u201d <em>Adoption of J.B.T., </em>250 Mont. at 208, 819 P.2d at 179 (emphasis added). As to the only case cited by the Majority that was decided after the 1997 revisions to the Adoption Act, <em>In re Adoption of C.W.D., </em>2005 MT 145, 327 Mont. 301, 114 P.3d 214, the issue of standing was not raised or decided by this Court. However, our failure to <em>sua sponte </em>raise the question of standing in that case does not permit this Court to perpetuate that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b648 Based on the foregoing, I would hold that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to grant S.J.D.\u2019s petition to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights to K.P.M. because S.J.D. did not have standing to bring such a petition. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b649 I also dissent from the Opinion in this case because S.J.D. did not follow the required statutory procedure in petitioning to adopt K.P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u00b650 This Court has repeatedly held that <em>\u201ca </em>natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re </em>J.N., 1999 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 524, 977 P.2d 317 (quoting <em>In re E. </em>W., 1998 MT 135, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 190, 959 P.2d 951; <em>Matter of R.B., </em>217 Mont. 99, 103, 703 P.2d 846, 848 (1985)). Hence, each applicable statutory requirement must be adequately addressed before a district court may terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>In re E.W., </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Matter of R.B., </em>217 Mont. at 103, 703 P.2d at 848). Moreover, \u201c[t]he party seeking to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence <em>that the statutory criteria for termination have been met.\u201d In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>In re E.W., </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Matter of J.L., </em>277 Mont. 284, 288, 922 P.2d 459, 461 (1996)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b651 Of particular relevance to the instant case are \u00a7\u00a7 42-4-310 and 42-2-603, MCA. Section 42-4-310, MCA, provides that \u201c[a] stepparent who desires to adopt a stepchild <em>shall obtain </em>an order of termination of parental rights of the child\u2019s noncustodial parent <em>prior to or contemporaneously with </em>the petition to adopt [emphasis added].\u201d Contrary to the statement at \u00b617 of the Opinion, S. J.D. did not comply with this statute. S. J.D. filed her petition to adopt K.P.M. on March 13, 2007. She did not, as required by \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA, obtain an order of termination of B. J.M.\u2019s parental rights \u201cprior to or contemporaneously with\u201d filing her petition to adopt K.P.M. In fact, she did not file a petition to terminate B. J.M.\u2019s parental rights to K.P.M. until May 8, 2007, almost two months after filing the petition to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b652 The Maj ority assert that following the correct statutory procedure is not a matter that was raised in the appellate briefs, nor was it an issue before the District Court in its consideration of the petition to terminate parental rights. Opinion, \u00b6 19. On the contrary, the record shows that B.J.M. raised this issue in her \u201cHearing Brief\u2019 filed in the District Court on January 23, 2008. There B.J.M. argued that S.J.D.\u2019s petition was \u201cdeficient\u201d because S.J.D. did not follow the criteria set forth by the Legislature in Title 42. In support of her argument, B.J.M. specifically cited to \u00a7\u00a7 42-2-301, 42-4-310, and 42-5-101, MCA. B.J.M. raised this issue again, citing to the same statutory criteria, in her \u201cPost Hearing Brief\u2019 filed with the District Court on February 19, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u00b653 Moreover, B.J.M. stated at page 11 of her Appellant\u2019s Brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">The party seeking to terminate parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence <em>that the statutory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>requirements for termination have been met. In re the Matter of A.S., Youth in Need of Care, </em>2006 MT 281, \u00b6 6, 334 Mont. 280, 146 P.3d 778. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">B.J.M. also stated at page 19 of her Appellant\u2019s Brief and again at page 8 of her Reply Brief that S.J.D. \u201chas failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met.\u201d Even so, whether the correct statutory procedures have been followed is a threshold issue in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b654 In addition, \u00a7 42-5-101, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">(2) There <em>must </em>be attached to or accompanying the petition [for adoption]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">(a) any written consent required by 42-2-301;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">(b) a certified copy of any court order terminating the rights of the child\u2019s parents .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Although S.J.D. claimed in her Petition for Adoption that B.J.M.\u2019s written consent was attached to the petition, that was not the case as B.J.M never consented to the adoption. Because B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights had not been terminated at the time the Petition for Adoption was filed, S.J.D. did not and could not attach \u201ca certified copy of any court order terminating the rights of the child\u2019s parents,\u201d as provided for in \u00a7 42-5-101(2)(b), MCA, to the Petition for Adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\u00b655 Consequently, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to terminate B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights because S.J.D. did not follow the statutory requirements for bringing her petitions and I dissent from this Court\u2019s failure to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u00b656 Furthermore, while the Court places great emphasis on B.J.M.\u2019s lifestyle at the time she placed K.P.M. in I.J.C.\u2019s care, no mention is made of the fact that B.J.M. has worked hard to turn her life around. She is now married, has another child and a steady job. The Court also does not mention that the death of her first child, while she was pregnant with K.P.M., sent B.J.M. into a depression that contributed to her inability to properly care for K.P.M. Although I do not condone the path she chose to take after the loss of her child, I do recognize the fact that she had the sense to place K.P.M. in a stable environment.</p>\n<p id=\"AQg\">\u00b657 The District Court terminated B.J.M.\u2019s parental rights on the basis that she had abandoned K.P.M. While I applaud I. J.C. and S.J.D. for the love and care they have given K.P.M. in the intervening years, I cannot help but note that some small part of the blame for B.J.M.\u2019s abandonment of K.P.M. was caused by I.J.C.\u2019s continued refusal to allow B.J.M. to see him-facts conveniently left out of the Opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u00b658 I make one final observation. The Legislature adopted significant amendments to the Adoption Act in 1997. If one reviews the legislative history to those amendments, one is struck by the Legislature\u2019s intent to preserve the parental rights of the biological parents to a child. Indeed, this follows the policy of this State \u201cto support and preserve the family as the single most powerful influence for ensuring the healthy social development and mental and physical well-being of Montana\u2019s children.\u201d Section 41-7-102(1), MCA (the Montana Family Policy Act enacted in 1993). While no doubt well-meaning, the Majority do not respect that legislative commitment. Rather, the Majority\u2019s approach ignores the statutory framework which the Legislature set out to preserve the fundamental rights of biological parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b659 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-5\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Dissent of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\"> The Child Abuse and Neglect Act does not apply here because a termination of parental rights under that Act may only be brought by the county attorney, the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county, \u00a7 41-3-422(2), MCA, none of whom did so in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
