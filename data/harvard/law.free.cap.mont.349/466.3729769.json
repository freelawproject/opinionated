We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in revoking Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence based upon her failure to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Striplin to serve thirty days in jail as a condition of her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">\u00b65 In October 2003, the State charged Striplin by Information with two felony counts of Deceptive Practices in violation of \u00a7 45-6-317(l)(d)(i), MCA (2001), for making unauthorized charges to the credit card of her f\u00edanc\u00e9\u2019s mother, Edith Poulsen, and for making a false credit card application in Poulsen\u2019s name. The Information indicated that both offenses occurred \u201cduring the year 2002.\u201d Striplin reached a plea agreement with the State in which she agreed to plead guilty to both counts in exchange for the State recommending a deferred imposition of sentence. Striplin subsequently pled guilty to the charges and agreed to pay full restitution \u201cto the victim and/or her credit card accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">|\u00b66 Because Striplin had received a deferred sentence some years earlier for a crime committed in another state, the District Court sentenced Striplin to a five-year suspended sentence on each count rather than a deferred sentence. These sentences were to run concurrently and were subject to certain terms and conditions, such as requiring Striplin to find employment and to pay full restitution to the Department of Corrections (DOC) who would then distribute the restitution amounts to the credit card companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">\u00b67 Striplin\u2019s counsel asserted at the sentencing hearing that Striplin represented to him that a significant portion of the debt had already been paid. Apparently, prior to sentencing, Striplin had transferred a diamond ring to Poulsen as payment on the debt. Upon the sale of the ring, and due to the fact that the credit cards had \u201ccleared,\u201d Poulsen declared that the debt had been satisfied. Striplin never made a payment to DOC, as ordered by the court, or to the credit card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>companies, nor did she ever contact the credit card companies to see if the debts had in fact been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b68 Three years after sentencing, Striplin\u2019s probation officer reported that Striplin had violated the terms of her suspended sentences. Thus, on July 5, 2007, the State petitioned to revoke Striplin\u2019s suspended sentences on the grounds that Striplin failed to fulfill her restitution obligation and that she failed to seek and maintain employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b69 At the October 18, 2007 hearing on the State\u2019s petition to revoke, Striplin argued that transferring the diamond ring to Poulsen had satisfied her restitution obligation. The State pointed out, however, that Striplin owed restitution to the credit card companies, not to Poulsen. The court postponed its final determination on revocation pending the receipt of information from Poulsen\u2019s credit card companies regarding the status of the accounts in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b610 The hearing recommenced on March 6, 2008, at which time Striplin\u2019s counsel stated that the credit card companies had not been paid and that they, instead, had written off their losses. Striplin admitted that she had not paid any money to the DOC or to the credit card companies, but she explained that she had assumed that the proceeds from the sale of the ring had satisfied her restitution obligations. It appears from the record that, unbeknownst to Striplin, Poulsen had used the proceeds from the sale of the ring to satisfy other debts unrelated to this action. Striplin\u2019s counsel introduced evidence from various sources that Striplin was unable to work and, therefore, unable to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b611 The District Court determined that Striplin violated the terms of her probation when she failed to pay restitution as ordered, thus the court revoked her original suspended sentences and resentenced her to five years suspended for each of the original counts, to run concurrently. The court did not reimpose a condition that Striplin pay restitution as the court found that she did not have the ability to pay. Instead, the court sentenced her to serve thirty days in jail. The court reasoned that Striplin had misrepresented to the court in 2004 her ability to work and to pay restitution expressly to avoid a harsher sentence that the court would otherwise have imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b612 Striplin\u2019s counsel moved the court to suspend the commitment to the county jail pending appeal, but the court denied the motion and ordered Striplin taken immediately to the detention center. The following day, on Striplin\u2019s renewed motion, the court ordered a stay of execution of her commitment to the county jail pending appeal. Striplin now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b613 This Court clarified its standard of review for criminal sentences in <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017. There, we held that if the offender is eligible for sentence review, we will review the sentence for legality only. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 22. If, however, the offender is statutorily ineligible for sentence review, then we will utilize the two-tiered approach which we employed prior to the creation of the Sentence Review Division (SRD), i.e., we will review such sentences for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b614 Section 46-18-903, MCA, provides that a person sentenced to a term of one year or more in the state prison or to the custody of the DOC, is eligible for sentence review before the SRD. In the instant case, Striplin was sentenced to five years with the DOC on each count, with all five years suspended. Consequently, because Striplin is eligible for sentence review, we review her sentence for legality. On that basis, we determine whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. White, </em>2008 MT 464, \u00b6 12, 348 Mont. 196, 199 P.3d 274 (citing <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, 179 P.3d 502).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b615 In addition, we review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a deferred or suspended sentence by determining whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2008 MT 233, \u00b6 15, 344 Mont. 394, 188 P.3d 1034 (citing <em>State v. Senn, </em>2003 MT 52, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 348, 66 P.3d 288). \u201c \u2018Even a single violation of the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence is sufficient to support a district court\u2019s revocation of that sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>State v. Rudolph, </em>2005 MT 41, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 132, 107 P.3d 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">ISSUE 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in revoking Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence based upon her failure to pay restitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAa\">\u00b617 Because the District Court determined that Striplin does not have the ability to pay restitution and, thus, did not reimpose that condition as part of her amended sentence, Striplin argues that the District Court erred in revoking her suspended sentence based on her failure to pay restitution. She contends, in effect, that because the court did not make a determination of her financial resources and future ability to pay restitution at the time of her original sentence in 2004 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>required by \u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a), MCA (2001) (the statute in effect at the time the offenses were committed), the condition of her 2004 sentence requiring her to pay restitution was illegal and her sentence cannot now be revoked based on the violation of that illegal condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b618 The State maintains on the other hand that the 2003 version of the statute governs in this case and that version of the statute only required that a presentence investigation make \u201ca list of the offender\u2019s assets.\u201d Section 46-18-242(l)(a), MCA (2003). In support of this argument, the State points out that when the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA, in 2003, it provided that the amendment would apply retroactively to offenders who had an unpaid restitution obligation as of October 1, 2003, the effective date of the amendment. <em>See </em>2003 Mont. Laws, chapter 272, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b619 It is not necessary that we determine here which version of \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA, applies in this case because Striplin may not, within the context of this revocation proceeding, challenge the legality of the conditions imposed in her 2004 sentence, as such a challenge is untimely. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318). Rather, Striplin may challenge only the legality of the conditions imposed in her 2008 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b620 As to the revocation of Striplin\u2019s sentence for failure to pay restitution, the 2004 Judgment indicated that Striplin was to pay restitution to the DOC and that the DOC would then distribute the funds to the two credit card companies as the funds were collected. The condition of the 2004 Judgment specifically requiring her to pay restitution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">The Defendant shall pay restitution in the amount of $6,845.78, to bear interest at 10% per annum from the date of Judgment, plus a 10% restitution supervision fee as allowed by law. If any of this amount has been repaid, it is Defendant\u2019s responsibility to obtain documentation from the victim showing amounts paid and remitting that documentation to the Department of Corrections for their records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b621 Striplin admitted at the 2007 and 2008 adjudicatory hearings on the State\u2019s petition to revoke that she did not make any payments to the DOC. Instead, she claimed that she had given Poulsen a diamond ring and that the proceeds from the sale of that ring satisfied her restitution obligation. However, Poulsen was not the victim in this case. Rather, the District Court made clear at Striplin\u2019s 2004 sentencing hearing that the two credit card companies were actually the victims of her criminal offenses and restitution was owed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>THE COURT: The Court will impose the restitution amounts that it sees reported in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report. That\u2019s $4,694.34 to-It\u2019s not clear, but I imagine the parties know which credit card company. It looks like it\u2019s Discover credit card company. As well as the additional amount of restitution of $2,151.41, which, again, the way I read this I think it\u2019s to Discover credit card. But whoever it is, you shall make both of those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Now, typically restitution payments are made to what? The Department of Institutions?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">COURTROOM CLERK: Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">THE COURT: Department of Corrections. So if some of these payments have already been made directly to the credit card company-And I\u2019m telling you this [defense counsel]. The DOC is going to get my judgment that says your client owes about $6,700, and they\u2019ll be looking for $6,700. So you\u2019re going to have to inform them of the amounts and may have to get some letter from the victim that that amount has been paid, just so the records are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b622 Furthermore, the evidence introduced at the revocation hearings indicated that Striplin never made any attempt to contact the credit card companies to determine whether they had been paid. As noted above, \u201c \u2018[e]ven a single violation of the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence is sufficient to support a district court\u2019s revocation of that sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Rudolph, </em>\u00b6 13).</p>\n<p id=\"Ajd\">\u00b623 Because Striplin never made any payments to the DOC as ordered by the court, nor did she at any time contact the credit card companies to make sure they had been paid, also as ordered by the court, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence based upon her failure to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">ISSUE 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b624 <em>Whether the District Court erred in sentencing Striplin to serve thirty days in jail as a condition of her sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">\u00b625 After revoking Striplin\u2019s suspended sentences, the District Court again sentenced Striplin to five years with the DOC on each count, with all five years suspended. The court also reimposed all of the terms and conditions of her prior sentences except the obligation to pay restitution. Instead, the court found that Striplin did not have the ability to pay any restitution, fines, fees or surcharges, thus, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>additional condition, the court sentenced Striplin to thirty days in the Ravalli County Detention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b626 Striplin argues on appeal that the imposition of this thirty-day jail term is illegal because the District Court also reimposed the full five years on each count thereby increasing her sentence from the original sentence. Striplin also argues that the thirty-day jail term is illegal because it is contrary to Montana law regarding the imposition of incarceration when a defendant cannot pay fines, fees or restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"Af_\">\u00b627 The State argues on the other hand that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA (2003), allows a court, at its discretion, to \u201crevoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence ....\u201d The State thus argues that the District Court \u201cclearly meant\u201d the thirty-day jail term to be included within the five-year span of the suspended sentences and not in addition to the five-year suspended sentences. However, the State has not provided any support for this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b628 The State also incorrectly argues that \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(ii), MCA, provides that the court had specific authority to amend or add to the terms and conditions of Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence. On the contrary, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(ii), MCA, provides that the judge may <em>\u201ccontinue </em>the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions (emphasis added).\u201d In this case, the court <em>revoked </em>Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence, it did not <em>continue </em>that sentence. Consequently, the correct subsection of the statute to apply is subsection (7)(a)(iii). The actual question here is which version of \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA, applies, the statute in effect when the offenses were committed or the statute as it existed at the time Striplin\u2019s sentence was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b629 In 2003, the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA, to contain the language as indicated in \u00b6 27. <em>See </em>2003 Mont. Laws, chapter 386. The 2003 Legislature also added a new subsection to the statute that provides: \u201cThe provisions of this section apply to any offender whose suspended or deferred sentence is subject to revocation regardless of the date of the offender\u2019s conviction and regardless of the terms and conditions of the offender\u2019s original sentence.\u201d Section 46-18-203(9), MCA (2003). In enacting subsection (9), the Legislature included the following retroactivity clause: \u201c[This act] applies retroactively, within the meaning of 1-2-109, to offenders in the custody of or under the supervision of the [DOC] on [the effective date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of this act, April 15, 2003].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b630 Nevertheless, we determined in <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 220, 113 P.3d 297, that a person has the right to be sentenced under the statutes which are in effect at the time of the offense, and that imposition of a sentence under statutes not in effect at the time an offense was committed is an <em>ex post facto </em>application of the law and therefore unconstitutional. \u201cIt is a violation of Article I, Section 10, of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 31, of the Montana Constitution, to apply a statute enacted subsequent to the time a defendant commits an offense, <em>which increases a defendant\u2019s punishment.\u201d Tracy, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Suiste, </em>261 Mont. 251, 253, 862 P.2d 399, 400 (1993)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b631 The statute in effect in 2002 when Striplin committed the offenses for which she was convicted contains substantially the same language as the statute in effect when Tracy committed his offenses in 1996:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">If the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence, the judge may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(iii) revoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence imposed <em>or any lesser sentence ....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alx\">Section 46-18-203(7)(a), MCA (2001) (emphasis added). We pointed out in <em>Tracy </em>that a sentence to the Montana State Prison</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">is <em>not the same sentence, or a lesser sentence, </em>than a commitment to DOC for placement in an appropriate facility or program. A person committed to DOC for an appropriate placement is not necessarily incarcerated in a detention facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\"><em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 18 (emphasis added). Consequently, we concluded in <em>Tracy </em>that even though the sentence reimposed by the court in that case did not include a longer term than the original DOC commitment, it did impose an additional, more burdensome, condition requiring Tracy to go to prison. Thus, we held that the application of the 2003 version of \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA, to Tracy was an <em>ex post facto </em>application of the law which could not stand constitutional muster, and we vacated Tracy\u2019s sentence. <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"ABzl\">\u00b632 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>had the District Court <em>continued </em>Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(ii), MCA (2001), the court could have added the condition that Striplin spend thirty days in the Ravalli County Detention Center. However, because the court <em>revoked </em>Striplin\u2019s suspended sentence under \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA (2001), the addition of a condition requiring Striplin to spend thirty days in the Ravalli County Detention Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>was an additional, more burdensome, condition, and the District Court had no authority to impose it. <em>See Tracy, </em>\u00b6 20. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s March 13, 2008 judgment to that narrow extent and we remand this case with instructions that the court strike that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b633 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
