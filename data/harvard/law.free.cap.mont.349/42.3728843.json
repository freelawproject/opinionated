(Sudan), appeals from a summary judgment entered by the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, in this action for foreclosure of a construction lien. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as whether genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b63 On April 25, 2005, Sudan filed a complaint in the District Court to foreclose on a construction lien against property owned by Glen D. Anacker and Clarice M. Anacker. According to the complaint, the lien represents the balance due Sudan for digging the first of two wells on Anackers\u2019 property. In the complaint, Sudan asked for $3,970 due under the lien, plus interest, attorney fees, and costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u00b64 The Anackers filed an answer in which they admitted having entered into a verbal contract with Sudan, under which Sudan was to drill a domestic water well on their property. They denied owing Sudan any money under the contract, however. As a first affirmative defense, the Anackers claimed the location in which Sudan dug the first well was in violation of both the septic setback terms of their agreement and state and local septic regulations requiring a 100 foot setback between a well and a neighboring septic drainfield. As a second affirmative defense, the Anackers claimed Sudan was advised of the correct location to drill the well before drilling operations commenced and is estopped from prevailing on its lien because it drilled in a location other than it was instructed and in breach of the verbal contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b65 The parties deposed Glen D. Anacker; Marvin Sudan, the owner and president of Sudan; Chad Danielson, Sudan\u2019s employee who drilled the wells; and James Battee, the Anackers\u2019 excavating subcontractor who leveled out a pad for the well drilling equipment to sit on while the wells were being drilled. Based on the record, including those depositions, the Anackers moved for summary judgment. At the District Court hearing on that motion, Sudan requested that summary judgment instead be granted in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">\u00b66 The District Court later issued a written order granting the Anackers\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying Sudan\u2019s request for summary judgment. The court\u2019s decision was based on two grounds: that the undisputed fact that the first well was not completed was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>dispositive to defeat Sudan\u2019s lien, and that the undisputed facts established that Sudan had breached its contract with Anackers to drill a domestic well in a workmanlike manner. The District Court directed the Clerk and Recorder of Flathead County to remove Sudan\u2019s construction lien on the Anackers\u2019 property from the public record. Sudan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, using the same criteria as does the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2008 MT 81, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 156, \u00b6 14, 179 P.3d 1169, \u00b6 14. Pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(c), the judgment sought \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cA material fact is a fact that involves the elements of the cause of action or defenses at issue to an extent that necessitates resolution of the issue by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Arnold v. Yellowstone Mountain Club, LLC, </em>2004 MT 284, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 295, \u00b6 15, 100 P.3d 137, \u00b6 15 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). All reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered evidence must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Rosenthal v. County of Madison, </em>2007 MT 277, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 419, \u00b6 22, 170 P.3d 493, \u00b6 22. Finally, summary judgment is an extreme remedy which should not be substituted for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact. <em>Mary J. Baker Revoc. Trust v. Cenex Harvest, </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 17, 338 Mont. 41, \u00b6 17, 164 P.3d 851, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b68 <em>Do genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AR7\">\u00b69 A person furnishing services or materials under a real estate improvement contract may attach and enforce a construction lien against the real estate for any unpaid part of the contract price. Sections 71-3-521 and -526, MCA. The contract price is the amount agreed upon by the contracting parties, increased or diminished by the price of change orders or extras, amounts attributable to altered specifications, and any breach of contract. Section 71-3-522(3), MCA. \u00b610 The depositions filed in this case establish that Sudan and the Anackers entered into a verbal contract under which Sudan agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>drill a well on the Anackers\u2019 property and the Anackers agreed to pay Sudan $21 per foot of well drilled. Before a well could be drilled, the Anackers\u2019 excavation subcontractor, James Battee, excavated a roadway to the well\u2019s future location and prepared a flat pad upon which the well-drilling equipment could sit. In his deposition, Battee stated he made the pad (otherwise described as a wide spot in the road) two to three weeks before the first well was drilled, at which time the location for the well was marked by a stake in the ground. A week or two before the well was drilled, the Anackers\u2019 general contractor, Dave Christensen, notified Battee that the pad needed to be widened, and Battee widened it. Battee did not notice the stake when he widened the pad. Then, after Sudan partially completed drilling the first well, Glen Anacker noticed the well was too close to a neighbor\u2019s drainfield. Anacker notified Christensen, who directed Sudan to abandon the first well and drill a second well in a spot further away from the drainfield. Sudan did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s first rationale for granting summary judgment to the Anackers was that Sudan\u2019s construction lien was invalid because it did not complete the first well. The court relied upon <em>Durand v. Dowdall, </em>232 Mont. 347, 757 P.2d 1302 (1988), for the principle that a valid construction lien will not arise when the party claiming the lien failed to substantially complete the contract work.</p>\n<p id=\"A7x\">\u00b612 Here, the verbal contract between Sudan and the Anackers required Sudan to complete one well for the Anackers. Sudan completed one well for the Anackers \u2014 the second well it drilled. As a result, we conclude the District Court\u2019s first rationale for granting summary judgment for the Anackers is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b613 In addition, the depositions reveal a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the abandonment of the first well represented a change order or altered specifications in the contract, for which the Anackers are responsible or, instead, a breach of contract by Sudan when Sudan drilled in the wrong place, thereby eliminating its entitlement to a lien for that work. Chad Danielson, Sudan\u2019s well driller, testified by deposition that he believed his boss Marvin Sudan told him where to drill the first well, but he also stated he asked \u201cthe operator that was operating the Cat\u201d to confirm where the well should go. The Anackers claim Sudan or its employee should have relied only on information directly from them or their general contractor, Christensen, on where to drill the well. In support of that position, they offer excavator Battee\u2019s deposition opinion that, if a question arose as to where work was to be done, the subcontractor should go directly to the contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>for the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b614 On the other hand, Marvin Sudan stated in his deposition that his driller told him Battee\u2019s \u201cman\u201d had said the place they were putting the well looked fine by him, and that a subcontractor was a source of information on whom he would regularly rely for such information. Additionally, well-driller Danielson stated by deposition that he drilled the first well in the only place he could have done so, based on the location and orientation of the pad prepared by the Anackers\u2019 subcontractor Battee. Further, as Sudan points out on appeal, Marvin Sudan testified by deposition that he presumed the Anackers\u2019 general contractor, Christensen, had located the spot for Battee to widen for the drill pad for the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b615 Finally, in a letter attached as an exhibit to Glen Anacker\u2019s deposition, and which he verified in that deposition, Anacker wrote to Marvin Sudan, \u201cI know that our Contractor, Dave Christensen, and you met on the site Thursday and you were shown the correct location of the well prior to beginning work on the well\u201d and \u201cI have continuously made myself available to questions on the location of the well, as has our Contractor.\u201d Sudan contends Glen Anacker\u2019s letter constitutes inadmissible hearsay. However, substantially the same information is in the uncontested deposition testimony of subcontractor and excavator Battee, who stated he understood Christensen had shown Sudan where to drill the well.</p>\n<p id=\"AD-\">\u00b616 In summary, some deposition testimony supports the Anackers\u2019 position that Sudan breached the contract by drilling in the wrong location and, therefore, no valid lien exists. Other deposition testimony supports Sudan\u2019s position that its lien is valid because it drilled in the wrong location at the direction of the Anackers\u2019 general contractor, Christensen, or only because the Anackers\u2019 excavator, Battee, prepared the drilling pad in the wrong location, which dictated the location of the well. Resolution of this factual matter is material to determining whether Sudan has a valid lien for drilling the first well. \u00b617 We conclude genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment. Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b66-8\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A1W\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b618 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion because it appears to be in accordance with ample precedent in our construction lien case law. I write separately to express my view that cases such as this seem to confound the purpose underlying the construction lien statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u00b619 The policy underlying the construction lien statutes is to ensure that a contractor who has performed satisfactory construction work in accordance with a contract receives payment. One who perfects a construction lien is entitled, among other perks, to priority of payment (\u00a7\u00a7 71-3-541 and -542, MCA) as well as the recovery of attorney fees incurred in the filing of the lien and any ensuing litigation (\u00a7 71-3-124(1), MCA)-benefits not available to parties in common law litigation. The statutory scheme was not intended, it seems to me, to provide a forum for litigating factual disputes over who must pay for work that was clearly not satisfactorily completed in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"ABg\">\u00b620 The amount Sudan is now attempting to recover is the expense incurred in installing the abandoned first well. Regardless of whose fault this abandonment was, the undisputed fact is that the first well was neither \u201ccompleted nor substantially completed\u201d in accordance with the contract. This being so, the condition precedent for the perfection of a construction lien vis-a-vis the first well-that the work was substantially completed in accordance with the contract-was never met. <em>Durand, </em>232 Mont. at 351, 757 P.2d at 1305. This appears to have been the basis for the District Court\u2019s decision in this matter. Unfortunately, over the years, courts have implicitly condoned the utilization of the construction lien statutory scheme as a tool to resolve not only disputes over payment for satisfactory and complete work, but also as a mechanism to litigate disagreements over unsatisfactory work, as here. <em>See e.g. Rossi v. Pawiroredjo, </em>2004 MT 39, 320 Mont. 63, 85 P.3d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b621 I am not suggesting that contractors whose work is rejected as a result of the fault of another should have no forum for recovery of their losses; provided they could establish that the problems with the work were occasioned by the negligence of another, they could recover their losses in a common law suit for damages against the culpable party. However, it seems especially unsuitable to litigate cases like this one under the auspices of the construction lien statutes, when full payment was made for the work that was actually properly completed, leaving only the work that was not properly done as the subject of a construction lien. In this respect, I understand why the District Court ruled as it did, and find its logic in doing so compelling. I nonetheless join the Court\u2019s decision because our jurisprudence in the construction lien field has expanded to cover virtually every claim for construction payment, whether or not the work at issue was substantially completed in accordance with the contract. I therefore concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-5\">JUSTICE NELSON concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u00b622 While the Court\u2019s Opinion is written in accordance with existing jurisprudence, I agree with Justice Cotter\u2019s Concurrence. Our caselaw has strayed far afield of the purpose of the construction lien statutes. This will be an interesting issue to take up if and when it is properly preserved for appeal in the trial courts and argued here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
