Kolb appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b62 The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it quashed the subpoena of Missoulian reporter Tristan Scott?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of Brian Hughes\u2019 criminal charges and pretrial release conditions?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">\u00b65 3. Did the prosecutor commit misconduct during closing argument by shifting the burden of proof to the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">\u00b66 On the evening of January 14,2006, Missoula, Montana, residents Matthew Madsen and Brian Hughes traveled to Whitefish, Montana, with plans to ski at Big Mountain Ski Resort the following day. They checked into a motel and then went out to play pool, socialize, and drink at local bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">\u00b67 Madsen and Hughes met Jacob Hogsett, Brett Johnson, and defendant Kyle Kolb at a bar called Casey\u2019s. When Casey\u2019s closed, Madsen\u2019s and Hughes\u2019 new acquaintances agreed to give them a ride back to their motel. En route to the motel, they discussed the possibility of drinking more alcohol, smoking marijuana, and bringing some girls up to Madsen\u2019s and Hughes\u2019 motel room. They also stopped at an ATM machine, where Hughes withdrew $200, some of which he planned to use to purchase marijuana from Hogsett. Once at the motel, Madsen and Hughes invited the others to their room.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">\u00b68 According to Madsen and Hughes, immediately after the group entered their motel room, Kolb, Hogsett, and Johnson placed both of them in headlocks and forced them down onto the beds. The trio choked and punched Madsen and Hughes and took their money, including the $200 Hughes had just withdrawn from the ATM. Both Madsen and Hughes testified at Kolb\u2019s trial that, during the melee, Kolb and Hogsett brandished a handgun with which they threatened to shoot Hughes. When the three left the room, Hughes ran after them out into the parking lot, where he kicked their truck and pounded on its windows before they drove away. He also noted the truck\u2019s license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>plate number and called 911. After law enforcement officers responded to his call, Hughes was taken to an emergency room for treatment of hematomas on both sides of his forehead and injuries to his hand and his ankle. Later that night, an officer from the Columbia Falls Police Department stopped the truck and arrested Kolb, Hogsett, and Johnson. Kolb had $203 in his pocket when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b69 Kolb was charged with felony robbery for inflicting bodily injury upon another, threatening to inflict bodily injury upon another, or purposely or knowingly putting another in fear of immediate bodily injury in the course of committing a theft. At the end of a three-day trial, the jury found Kolb guilty. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b610 Under circumstances similar to those presented here, we have reviewed a district court\u2019s quashing of a subpoena as trial error, employing harmless error analysis. <em>See State v. Slavin, </em>2004 MT 76, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 320 Mont. 425, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 87 P.3d 495, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, \u00b6 17, 324 Mont. 173, \u00b6 17, 103 P.3d 503, \u00b6 17. To determine whether comments by a prosecutor require reversal, we first examine whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper and, if so, we then determine whether the comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 51, 341 Mont. 240, \u00b6 51, 177 P.3d 444, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err when it quashed the subpoena of Missoulian reporter Tristan </em>Scott?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\u00b612 Prior to trial, Kolb subpoenaed Tristan Scott, a reporter for the Missoulian newspaper who had interviewed Hughes for an article about the robbery. In that newspaper article, Scott attributed to Hughes a statement that a \u201cshotgun\u201d was pointed at him during the robbery. The Missoulian moved to quash the subpoena pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-902, MCA-a provision of the Media Confidentiality Act (Act) which protects media representatives from being required to disclose information in a legal proceeding if the information was gathered, received, or processed in the course of the media representative\u2019s employment. The defense opposed the motion to quash on grounds that the information sought by subpoena was non-confidential and that the Act cannot restrict a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>reviewing the arguments from both sides, the District Court quashed the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b613 We acknowledge Kolb\u2019s argument that the District Court did not correctly balance his constitutional right to a fair trial as against Scott\u2019s rights under \u00a7 26-1-902, MCA, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. More accurately stated, the District Court avoided the constitutional issue by determining there was another way for Kolb to get the information he sought into evidence. This approach was proper; as a matter of longstanding principle, courts avoid constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>See State v. Carlson, </em>2000 MT 320, \u00b6 17, 302 Mont. 508, \u00b6 17, 15 P.3d 893, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b614 Kolb sought to present evidence through Scott that Hughes had made an inconsistent statement about the type of gun-a shotgun, instead of a handgun-used in the robbery. Relying on <em>Slavin, </em>he argues that, in order for the quashing of the subpoena to be upheld, other live witnesses must have been available to testify to his inconsistent statement about a \u201cshotgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b615 The District Court also relied on <em>Slavin </em>in relation to this issue. In that case, the district court quashed the defendant\u2019s subpoenas of a newspaper reporter and editor on grounds that several other witnesses were available to testify to the same facts as the witnesses whose subpoenas were quashed. On appeal, the defendant argued his right to compel attendance of witnesses should prevail over the reporter and editor\u2019s rights under \u00a7 26-1-902, MCA. We held that, even if quashing the subpoenas was error, any error would be harmless when considered in light of the abundant cumulative evidence that proved the same point. <em>Slavin, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b616 <em>Slavin </em>does not stand for the proposition for which Kolb cites it; it represents an example of circumstances under which other available evidence made unnecessary the issuance of a subpoena. Here, like in <em>Slavin, </em>the District Court noted the information sought was otherwise available. The court stated that, given the Missoulian article\u2019s attribution to Hughes of a statement that a \u201cshotgun\u201d had been used in the robbery, Kolb\u2019s counsel could question Hughes on whether he told the reporter a shotgun was used. If Hughes replied affirmatively, the defense could suggest the jury use that information to assess Hughes\u2019 credibility. If, on the other hand, Hughes claimed he did not make the statement, the Missoulian article could be introduced as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">\u00b617 Under the circumstances presented here, the District Court determined Kolb had not established that the evidence sought was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>otherwise unavailable. Therefore, the court ruled, no constitutional analysis was triggered and the subpoena was properly quashed. We agree. We hold the District Court did not err in quashing Scott\u2019s subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of Brian Hughes\u2019 criminal charges and pretrial release conditions?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">\u00b619 Prior to trial, the State moved in limine to exclude all testimony regarding the criminal histories of any of the witnesses based on M. R. Evid. 609, which prohibits the use of evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime to attack the witness\u2019s credibility. Kolb then filed a notice of intent to disclose evidence of a pending criminal charge against Hughes, relying on M. R. Evid. 404(b), which allows evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts for purposes including proof of motive. Kolb contended Hughes\u2019s admitted acts of entering bars and consuming alcohol on the night of January 14, 2006, violated the conditions of his pretrial release in a criminal case then pending against him and presented a motive for him to provide false testimony in this case. The District Court rejected that contention on the basis that Hughes had already admitted to violating his conditions of release in the pending criminal matter. The court also relied on the M. R. Evid. 609 prohibition on use of evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime. The court granted the State\u2019s motion in limine and struck Kolb\u2019s notice of intent to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b620 On appeal, Kolb argues evidence of Hughes\u2019 criminal record should have been admitted for purposes of establishing another motive for fabricating the robbery-to conceal a drug deal and his possession of marijuana in the motel room. Kolb also argues the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence should have been admitted under this Court\u2019s modified <em>Just </em>rule. <em>See State v. Matt, </em>249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">\u00b621 As a longstanding rule, we will not consider an issue first raised on appeal or a change in legal theory on appeal. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, \u00b6 24, 44 P.3d 499, \u00b6 24. Aside from being raised for the first time on appeal, neither of the two new legal theories raised here has merit. Why would Hughes fabricate a robbery to conceal a drug deal and his possession of marijuana, when he simply could have not reported the robbery and achieved the same \u201cconceal\u201d result with much less risk of being exposed? As to the modified Just rule, that rule relates to other crimes, wrongs, or acts of a criminal defendant. Kolb has cited no authority to support the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the modified <em>Just </em>rule applies to evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a non-defendant witness, except in limited circumstances where the defendant is attempting to inculpate another person for the crime. <em>See e.g. State v. Clifford, </em>2005 MT 219, \u00b6 44, 328 Mont. 300, \u00b6 44, 121 P.3d 489, \u00b6 44. Those circumstances are not presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b622 We hold Kolb has failed to establish that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Hughes\u2019 criminal charges and pretrial release conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b623 <em>Did the prosecutor commit misconduct during closing argument by shifting the burden of proof to the defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b624 During the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor directed the jury\u2019s attention to the defense\u2019s failure to call three witnesses who allegedly observed Hughes following Kolb, Hogsett, and Johnson out into the motel parking lot after the robbery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">[T]hey keep talking about maybe these three witnesses that were there. Well, [defense counsel] has subpoena power also, did he bring those people in? If he knew they were going to say something different, and this is a very important-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\">At that point, counsel for the defense objected that the defense had no obligation to prove anything, and the court commented, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve told the jurors about that.\u201d The prosecutor then proceeded with another line of argument. Kolb did not move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b625 Kolb contends the prosecutor\u2019s remark constitutes reversible error under <em>State v. Newman, </em>2005 MT 348, 330 Mont. 160, 127 P.3d 374 (Nelson, J., specially concurring). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">\u00b626 In <em>Newman, </em>two members of this Court voted to reverse the criminal conviction based on a conclusion that prosecutorial comments during closing argument had deprived the defendant of a fair trial by referring to the defense\u2019s failure to present witnesses to support his theory of the case. Because it represents the view of just two members of the Court, the concurring opinion in <em>Newman </em>does not constitute controlling authority. <em>See Doll v. Major Muffler Cntrs., Inc., </em>208 Mont. 401, 408, 687 P.2d 48, 51-52 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">\u00b627 Additionally, the prosecutor\u2019s comment must be placed in context. <em>See State v. Roubideaux, </em>2005 MT 324, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 521, \u00b6 15,125 P.3d 1114, \u00b6 15. <em>In Roubideaux, </em>the prosecutor commented in closing argument that, as a result of the defense\u2019s presentation of an alternative theory of the events underlying the charges, \u201call [the jury] ha[d] to do [wa]s decide who is telling the truth.\u201d <em>Roubideaux, </em>\u00b6 9. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>prosecutor also clearly referred in closing argument to the State\u2019s burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt. In that context, we ruled the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper. <em>Roubideaux, </em>\u00b6 15. Here, like in <em>Roubideaux, </em>the prosecutor acknowledged during closing argument that he bore the burden of establishing his case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b628 Moreover, in the present case, it was defense counsel who first introduced at trial the matter of the three witnesses from the parking lot. During his opening statement, defense counsel told the jury that three witnesses saw the men come running out of the motel and did not see a gun. Then, during cross-examination of Hughes, defense counsel asked if it was true that three witnesses had observed him running after and yelling at Kolb, Hogsett, and Johnson as they ran across the parking lot outside the motel. Finally, in his closing argument, Kolb\u2019s counsel pointed out the prosecution had failed to call any of the parking lot witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">\u00b629 We hold that, placed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not improper. Thus, we need not consider whether the comment prejudiced Kolb\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
