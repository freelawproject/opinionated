They contend that the available scientific evidence compels the conclusion that continued use of 2,4,5-T around homes and on food crops creates an \u201cimminent hazard to the public,\u201d and that consequently suspension is required by the FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">In Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Hardin, we construed the judicial review provisions of the FIFRA, and held that the statute authorizes direct review in this court of an order denying suspension, at the instance of any person adversely affected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To facilitate review in that case, we remanded it to the Secretary for a statement of reasons for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the suggestion of the Secretary, we followed a similar course in this case, asking in addition for an explanation of the standard used to determine when a hazard is sufficiently \u201cimminent\u201d to warrant immediate suspension of a registration rather than commencement of ordinary cancellation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"> Our review of the Secretary\u2019s action is shaped both by general principles of administrative law, and by the nature of the particular administrative action at issue in this case. We begin with the proposition that, within broad limits, the administrator has latitude not merely to find facts, but also to set policy in the public interest. Like most regulatory statutes, the FIFRA confers broad discretion on the Secretary. It is particularly appropriate to defer to that discretion when the question at issue is a matter of interim relief, as it is in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Nevertheless, the court has an obligation to ensure that the administrator has made a reasoned decision, which conforms to the legislative language and purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And close scrutiny of administrative action is particularly appropriate when the interests at stake are not merely economic interests in a license or a rate structure, but personal interests in life and health.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">With these various principles in mind, we turn to the decision of the Secretary in this ease. He articulated standards for the exercise of the suspension power, made findings of fact concerning the herbicide 2,4,5-T, and applied his standards to reach a decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">The Secretary\u2019s criteria for suspension are not seriously challenged here. In his view, the power to suspend a registration in order \u201cto prevent an imminent hazard to the public\u201d is an emergency power, to be exercised only when there is a \u201cpublic health situation which must be corrected immediately, and cannot be permitted to continue while a hearing is being held * * <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">Although cancellation notices should issue as soon as the Secretary finds a substantial question concerning the safety of a registered product,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he reserves the suspension power for cases in which serious and irreparable harm to the public health is likely to occur before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>conclusion of the ordinary cancellation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">In order to apply his standard to a particular product, the Secretary must first determine what harm, if any, is likely to flow from the use of the product during the course of administrative proceedings. He must consider both the magnitude of the anticipated harm, and the likelihood that it will occur. Then, on the basis of that factual determination, he must decide whether the anticipated harm amounts to an \u201cimminent hazard to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Petitioners contend that the use of 2,4,5-T around the home in nonliquid forms is sufficiently hazardous to warrant suspension under the Secretary\u2019s test. He explains his refusal to suspend, however, on the ground that nonliquid forms of the chemical are much less hazardous for home use than liquid forms. The basis for the distinction is that non-liquid forms contain relatively small concentrations of the chemical, whereas liquid forms contain high concentrations which must be diluted by the user.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No challenge is made to the factual finding that nonliquid forms are less hazardous than liquid forms.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the question remains whether the public is entitled to protection from that lesser hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">The Secretary has not explained why the hazard associated with nonliquid forms of the chemical does not warrant suspension. We think it fair to infer, however, that he has identified a level of exposure which can safely be tolerated during the period required for formal administrative proceedings, and that nonliquid forms of 2,4,5-T prepared for household use result in exposure below that level. While we would have preferred a more explicit analysis, we are satisfied that the relevant factors were considered in a manner that accords with the requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">The decision concerning the use of 2,4,5-T on food crops is more troublesome. The Secretary stated that the risk of harm from that use is insuffi-^ cient to warrant suspension, because residues are negligible in food products that reach the consumer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>He did not discuss the risk of injury to farm workers or others who might be exposed to the chemical by virtue of its use on food crops, despite the fact that he clearly recognizes a hazard from direct exposure, as well as from consumption with food or water.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We are troubled by the possibility that the Secretary failed to give petitioners\u2019 allegations the careful consideration to which they were entitled,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or that he failed to assign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>sufficient importance to the risk of harm to human lives.</p>\n<p id=\"ahu-dedup-0\">Accordingly, we remand the case for further consideration, and for a decision supported by a reasoned analysis of the relevant factors.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We think this course is especially appropriate in view of the fact that we are venturing into a new and uncharted area of the law. A new public sensitivity to issues of environmental protection has imposed new responsibilities on the courts, the legislature, and the administrative agencies. A new Environmental Protection Agency has been established, and its Administrator has the critical task of developing standards for administrative action throughout this area. In particular, he has succeeded the Secretary of Agriculture as the official responsible for the administration of the FIFRA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, in remanding this case for further action, we have left undisturbed the order of the Secretary denying relief, giving the new Administrator the opportunity to reconsider that order and, more important, to develop the standards needed for the effective administration of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"a4k-dedup-0\">Remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\">.
