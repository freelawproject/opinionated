The trial judge\u2019s comments in his charge to the jury on the \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cobscured\u201d nature of this witness\u2019 testimony is supported by the record and cannot in any event be deemed prejudicial. Moreover, the jury was instructed \u201cyou are the judges of the facts. Your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in the case,\u201d and \u201cyou judge the credibility of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-26\"> As to the contention that the trial judge erred in failing to give the requested instruction, it need only be said that he properly charged the jury on the score of \u201cpossession.\u201d The form of an instruction is within the sound discretion of the trial court.
