This Court\u2019s jurisdiction on appeal from the final order below is based upon Section 24a of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">In 1967, Buddy R. Barasch (\u201cBuddy\u201d), the debtor, filed suit for divorce in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County. His wife and appellee here, Shirley B. Barasch (\u201cShirley\u201d), filed a cross-complaint. During the course of the divorce proceedings, various <em>pen-dente lite </em>orders were entered regarding the then community property of the parties. On August 4, 1967, an order was entered authorizing Shirley to dissolve two family corporations. On May 29, 1968, a second <em>pendente lite </em>order granting her exclusive powers to manage and control certain real properties was entered. Pursuant to this order, however, she was prohibited from using the proceeds for her own use and was to render an account to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">After a prolonged and bitter trial, an Interlocutory Decree of Divorce was entered by the Superior Court on August 19, 1968, awarding a substantial portion of the community property to Shirley. In the decree, Shirley was ordered to pay most of the creditors who could look to the community property. Both parties appealed from the interlocutory decree. The California Court of Appeal upheld the disposition of the trial court shortly before the hearing in this case. A petition for hearing before the Supreme Court of California may be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">While the state court appeals were pending, Buddy, the husband, filed a petition on November 18, 1968, under \u00a7 322 of the Bankruptcy Act, seeking an Arrangement under Chapter XI. Appellant Joel Mithers was appointed as Receiver of the debtor\u2019s estate. He immediately made demand upon Shirley for the property, and, upon her refusal, filed an Application to Confirm the Jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court over the property, for a Turnover Order, Accounting and Injunctive Relief. Shirley specially appeared, contested the summary jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and objected to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">After a hearing, the Referee ruled that the bankruptcy court had no summary jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the Receiver and filed his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order denying the petition. The Receiver then filed an Application to Review the Referee\u2019s Order and an Application for Injunctive Relief <em>Pendente Lite </em>in the District Court. Both matters were resolved upon hearing against the Receiver by the Judge\u2019s Order of November 13, 1969. It is from this af-firmance of the Referee\u2019s Order that the present appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-10\">In the instant case, appellant Receiver argues that in bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter XI the test of summary jurisdiction is debtor\u2019s ownership, not actual or constructive possession as in ordinary bankruptcy. In response to a similar claim, we said recently in Wikle v. Country Life Insurance Co., 423 F.2d 151,153 (9th Cir. 1970):</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-11\">\u201cThe two major bankruptcy treatises are in conflict on this point. Appellant relies on statements in 8 Collier on Bankruptcy, ft 3.02, pages 176-182, while appellees counter with a contrary view in 9 Remington on Bankruptcy, \u00a7 3573, pages 214-18 6th Ed. 1955. Although the matter is not free from doubt, case authority favors appellees\u2019 position. Sada Yoshinuma v. Oberdorfer Insurance Agency, 5 Cir., 136 F.2d 460, 461; Lockhart v. Garden City Bank and Trust Co., 2 Cir., 116 F.2d 658; In re California Paving Co., N.D.Cal., 95 F.Supp. 909.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>In Loyd v. Stewart and Nuss, Inc., 327 F.2d 642, 645 (9th Cir. 1964), and Pasadena Investment Company v. Weaver, 376 F.2d 175, 178 (9th Cir. 1967), however, this Court noted that \u201cSection 311 [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 711] confers exclusive summary jurisdiction to determine controversies with respect to property owned by the debtor, <em>or </em>in the actual or constructive possession of the debtor or the Bankruptcy Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">Despite this seeming disagreement, we are not required to reach this precise question in resolving this case. Our past holdings establish that whether the \u201ctitle\u201d or the \u201cpossession\u201d theory is accepted and applied in Chapter XI proceedings, the bankruptcy court \u201cdoes not acquire summary jurisdiction over property not in the debtor\u2019s possession where the debtor\u2019s title to it is disputed by a substantial adverse claim.\u201d Loyd v. Stewart and Nuss, Inc., <em>supra </em>at 645; Pasadena Investment Co. v. Weaver, <em>supra, Collier, supra, </em>at 181-182, seems in agreement on the point although its treatment of this issue is somewhat unclear. In Martoff v. Elliott, 326 F.2d 204, 207-208 (9th Cir. 1963), we applied the test for the substantiality of an adverse claim in bankruptcy set out by the Supreme Court in Harrison v. Chamberlin, 271 U.S. 191, 46 S.Ct. 467, 70 L.Ed. 897 (1926). In <em>Harrison, </em>the Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-7\">\u201c[W]e are of opinion that [an adverse claim] is to be deemed of a substantial character when the claimant\u2019s contention 'discloses a contested matter of right, involving some fair doubt and reasonable room for controversy\u2019 * * * in matters either of fact or law; and is not to be held merely col-orable unless the preliminary inquiry shows it is so unsubstantial and obviously insufficient, either in fact or law, as to be plainly without color of merit, and a mere pretense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 195)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">In the proceedings below, the referee in bankruptcy decided that the appellee\u2019s adverse claim under the interlocutory divorce decree was substantial and therefore deprived the bankruptcy court of summary jurisdiction. We agree. The appellee\u2019s claim of ownership must, of course, be tested under California law. It need only be substantial and not irrefutable or incontestable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">Our review of applicable California law on the effect of an interlocutory decree under appeal discloses a situation which may be fairly characterized as uncertain. The concurring opinion of Justice Mosk in Decker v. Occidental Life Insurance Co., 70 Cal.2d 842, 848-849, 76 Cal.Rptr. 470, 474-475, 452 P.2d 686, 690-691 (1969) is enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-11\">\u201c[I]n merely adopting the Court of Appeal opinion the majority have failed to discuss or resolve two frequently recurring questions: (1) Does a trial court commit reversible error in ordering an immediately effective disposition of property in an interlocutory decree? (2) If not, where the language of the decree is ambiguous or silent on the question of intended timing, does the presumption favor immediate or delayed disposition? Proper resolution of this case, as well as necessary guidance to trial courts and the bar, compels a reply to these queries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-12\">\u201cThe first question is raised by implication, if not directly, in the instant case. In Luepe v. Luepe [sic] (1942) 21 Cal.2d 145, 149, 130 P.2d 697, this court determined that a trial court had the power- \u2014 -i. e., jurisdiction \u2014 to make an immediately effective disposition of property in an interlocutory decree, though perhaps it \u201cshould not\u201d do so. Based on that hortatory expression; Gudelj v. Gudelj (1953) 41 Cal.2d 202, 214, 259 P.2d 656, held that regardless of the trial court\u2019s jurisdictional power, it was reversible error to make an immediate disposition. So far as our subsequent pronouncements indicate, this is the present state of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1449-13\">\u201cHowever, Fritschi v. Teed (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 718, 29 Cal.Rptr. 114, on which the majority largely rely, cast considerable doubt upon the <em>Gu-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1396\">*1396</page-number><em>delj </em>holding. Granted that <em>Fritschi </em>purported to distinguish <em>Gudelj </em>and later \u2018dissonant authorities,\u2019 it went beyond that point and strongly implied that <em>Gudelj </em>was not an accurate, statement of the law and that it was \u2018out of harmony with common practices of trial judges and divorce counsel throughout the state.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 723, 29 Cal.Rptr. at p. 117.) This implication was fortified by the court\u2019s readiness to conclude, in the face of ambiguous language, that the trial court had in fact made an immediate disposition. A clear inference is thaty contrary to <em>Gudelj, </em>the trial court involved in <em>Fritschi </em>not only acted within its power, but it acted properly \u2014 i. e., did not commit reversible error \u2014 in making an immediate disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1450-4\">\u201cThis court, by adopting the Court of Appeal opinion herein which relies on <em>Fritschi </em>for an identical conclusion, without mention of the <em>Gudelj </em>question, unfortunately perpetuates this confusion. It is now this court that implies an immediate disposition is proper \u2014 as I agree it should be \u2014 but without forthrightly stating as much. The <em>Fritschi </em>court, like the Court of Appeal below, was without power to do more than question the <em>Gudelj </em>holding; this court, however, can and should overrule it. I would hold that a trial court in its discretion may make an immediately effective property disposition in the interlocutory judgment of divorce, if the intention to do so is expressly stated therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aor-dedup-0\">Many cases in which the time for appeal has run, have followed <em>Leupe </em>and held that the interlocutory decree is binding on the parties and is <em>res judica-ta. E. g., </em>In re Chappel, 243 F.Supp. 417 (C.D.Cal.1965). Although <em>Gudelj </em>may still be good law where the interlocutory decree is under appeal, <em>Fritschi, supra </em>and <em>Decker </em>question its present strength and persuasiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">In addition, recent cases such as McClenny v. Superior Court, 62 Cal.2d 140, 41 Cal.Rptr. 460, 396 P.2d 916 (1964) and Elliott v. Elliott, 231 Cal.App.2d 205, 41 Cal.Rptr. 686 (1964) suggest that an interlocutory decree even though appealed does confer rights in the property upon the victorious spouse. In <em>McClenny </em>an interlocutory decree was entered in favor of the wife, reserving power to divide community property. Prior to any hearings concerning the rights of the parties to the community property, the wife died. The court held that \u201cthe interlocutory decree created in Mrs. McClenny a valuable property right which her death cannot destroy.\u201d <em>McClenny, supra </em>at 145, 41 Cal.Rptr. at 463, 396 P.2d at 919. Similarly, in <em>Elliott, supra, </em>the interlocutory decree of divorce awarded the wife a half interest in a promissory note which had been executed with the husband as the sole payee. While the husband\u2019s appeal was pending, the statute of limitations on the note expired. The wife then filed an action against the husband claiming that his wrongful refusal to recognize her interest caused the loss. In his defense, he argued that his refusal did not become wrongful until an adverse determination was rendered in the appeal from the divorce decree. The trial court found that the husband held the note as constructive trustee for the wife. Upon appeal, the California court stated that \u201c[o]nce the interlocutory decree of divorce was entered, the wife\u2019s undivided interest in the note was legally established.\u201d <em>(Elliott, supra </em>at 209, 41 Cal.Rptr. at 688).</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-7\">Despite strong language in In re Cummings, 84 F.Supp. 65 (S.D.Cal.1949) which accords California interlocutory divorce decrees no effect in a bankruptcy context, its precedential value appears eroded by subsequent state court decisions. On the whole, the precise status of subsequently appealed interlocutory divorce decrees is uncertain. We therefore feel justified in ruling that under controlling law, the appellee\u2019s adverse claim is substantial albeit not precisely determined. The recent cases cited above lead to the conclusion that an immediate disposition of property in a California interlocutory decree of divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>does confer substantial rights on the receiving spouse although they are subject to divestment. Because of the intricacy and complexity of California family law (which we are comparatively seldom called upon to interpret), and the unclear status of the legal rule in relation to this narrow issue, we believe it inappropriate to determine more than the substantiality of the adverse claim presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">No less in a Chapter XI arrangement than in a straight bankruptcy, the Receiver can take only what the bankrupt has when he files his petition. The interlocutory decree created at least a colorable divestment from the husband of his interest in the community awarded to the wife and created in her a substantial adverse claim in the same property. Under such circumstances the bankruptcy court did not have summary jurisdiction over the community property awarded to the wife by the interlocutory decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">In light of our decision, we find no occasion to discuss whether the referee properly declined to exercise summary jurisdiction as a matter of discretion. Finally, we find no sufficient reasons advanced for injunctive relief <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1451-7\">The Order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
