He and his wife on their joint return seek long term capital gains treatment under IRC \u00a7 631(a). The question is did Clemens hold the timber for a full six months before January 1, 1964. If one takes the bid date in June, 1963, he did hold it six months. If the formal acceptance by the Bureau of Land Management in July, 1963, is the date, he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The bidding notice gave the government the right to reject bids \u201cwhen it is in [its] interest to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">Much as we would like to, we cannot say that Clemens had a vested interest in the timber prior to July 1, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">The trouble is the government almost always has a right to retreat until it finally signs up. <em>See </em>Ferry v. Udall, 9 Cir., 336 F.2d 706.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
