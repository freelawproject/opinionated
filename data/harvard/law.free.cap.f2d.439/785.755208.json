This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm because appellant failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies prior to seeking habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Appellant enlisted in the Army for a three-year term in June of 1967. He applied for compassionate reassignment while awaiting shipment overseas at Fort Lewis Washington. On approximately August 15, 1968, after talking to a non-commissioned officer in the personnel office, appellant picked up his personnel file and pay records and flew home to Youngstown, Ohio. He remained there until the Army stopped his wife\u2019s allotment checks 20 months later. On April 16, 1970, he returned to Fort Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">During his absence appellant was neither declared A.W.O.L. or a deserter. Following an investigation it was decided not to charge him with being A.W.O.L. However, under the authority of 10 U. S.C. \u00a7 972, supplemented by AR 630-10, it was administratively determined that a portion of appellant\u2019s absence, <em>i.e., </em>from January 5, 1969 to April 5, 1970, was avoidable and must be made up.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Included in AR 630-10 at jf 71(b) (4) is a provision for a direct appeal to The Adjutant General, Department of the Army, from an adverse administrative decision. Rather than pursuing that administrative appeal, Breinz immediately filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">In failing first to exhaust his administrative remedies, appellant relies on Beaty v. Kenan, 420 F.2d 55 (9th Cir. 1969). Beaty was sent home to await orders which never arrived and he did not report officially until his enlistment had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">However, in <em>Beaty </em>the serviceman had exhausted all available administrative remedies for direct review<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> except the final step of appealing to the Board for the Correction of Army Records under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552. This court there held that judicial determination was appropriate even though the exhaustion rule had not been fully complied with and restricted the decision to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">It is emphasized that <em>Beaty </em>only permitted relaxation of the exhaustion rule to the extent that the rule required an appeal to the Board for the Correction of Army Records. <em>Beaty </em>does not eliminate the necessity of following administrative remedies specified in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s failure to pursue his administrative appeal to The Adjutant General precludes habeas corpus relief. <em>Cf. </em>Lockhart v. United States, 420 F.2d 1143 (9th Cir. 1969) en banc; Donato v. United States, 302 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1962); Proho-roff v. United States, 259 F.2d 694 (9th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-18\">. Beaty had unsuccessfully sought intervention by the Secretary of the Army.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
