Appellant was convicted on separate counts of possessing and cultivating a narcotic drug (marijuana) and given concurrent five-year sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">He contends: (1) that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated when testimony was admitted to impeach a co-defendant, to the effect that, when arrested in his apartment and asked about ownership of marijuana found there, defendant remained silent and advised the codefendant to do the same; (2) that a search warrant on the basis of which appellant\u2019s apartment was searched was issued without probable cause; (3) that the entry of officers into his apartment was illegal because a ruse was employed to get the occupants to open the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">We need not consider these matters. None relate to appellant\u2019s conviction, not claimed to be defective, for cultivating marijuana in a plot near his apartment, under which a concurrent sentence was imposed. United States v. Sims, 434 F.2d 258 [5th Cir. 1970]; United States v. Howard, 433 F.2d 1 [5th Cir. 1970].</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
