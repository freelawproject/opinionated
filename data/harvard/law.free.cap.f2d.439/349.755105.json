We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">Mrs. Friedman brought suit against Bache, her stock brokerage firm, on the theory that Bache had violated \u00a7 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j, and Regulation 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Commission, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. Her complaint charged that Bache had violated its duty as a broker to treat its customers with fairness and good faith by twice \u201cfreezing\u201d her account \u2014 that is, refusing to allow her to withdraw funds or securities and refusing to execute her buy and sell orders. Bache answered her complaint with the contention that it had acted lawfully in restricting trading in Mrs. Friedman\u2019s account. It pointed out that the first restriction was imposed as a protective measure because Mrs. Friedman and Bache had been named as defendants by Mrs. Friedman\u2019s parents in a lawsuit charging them with the unlawful conversion of certain securities. The second restriction occurred when Bache discovered that Mrs. Friedman owed it $8,423.02 in connection with the purchase of certain securities for her account. Moreover, Bache argued, any controversy that may have existed at one time between the parties over the restrictions on Mrs. Friedman\u2019s account had been settled by Mrs. Friedman\u2019s execution of two releases. Bache asserts that these releases are valid and binding and a bar to the present lawsuit. Mrs. Friedman countered with the allegation that the releases were invalid for duress. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the district court granted Bache\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, and Mrs. Friedman appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-20\">On appeal Mrs. Friedman presents five contentions: (1) the district court erred in directing a verdict at the close of her case; (2) there was sufficient evidence to present jury questions as to whether Bache\u2019s conduct violated \u00a7 10 of the Securities Exchange Act and Regulation 10b-5; (3) the releases were invalid under \u00a7 29(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78cc(a); (4) the releases were invalid for duress; and (5) Mrs. Friedman had suffered damages as a result of Baehe\u2019s unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the record and conclude that there is no merit to Mrs. Friedman\u2019s contentions. For the reasons expressed in its memorandum opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>See </em>Friedman v. Bache &amp; Co., Inc., S.D.Fla.1970, 321 F.Supp. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
