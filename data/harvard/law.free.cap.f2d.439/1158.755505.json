Blanks under \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), for review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare denying him old age insurance benefits on the ground that he had failed to establish that he had reached 62 years of age, the minimum age for entitlement to such benefits. See \u00a7 202(a) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a). The District Court, finding that the administrative decision was supported by substantial evidence, granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-21\"> The Social Security Act itself requires that we give conclusive weight to the Secretary\u2019s findings of fact, if they are supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Reviewing courts are not required, however, to stand aside and give rubber-stamp approval to administrative decisions which frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute. NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278, 291, 85 S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965). Rather, our function is to review the entire body of evidence, including that which is opposed to the Secretary\u2019s view. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). This is particularly true in cases such as this one, where the question before the Secretary is not one requiring the application of administrative expertise. In such cases we are called upon to examine the record closely. Merrell v. Gardner, 397 F.2d 65 (5th Cir. 1968), followed in Sadler v. Finch, 1A CCH Unemp.Ins.Rep. par. 15,725 (E.D.Ark., Feb. 27, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-23\">Blanks claimed that he was born on November 25, 1905. The trial examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>made a factual finding that his correct birthdate was November 25,1907.</p>\n<p id=\"AT2\">The evidence before the trial examiner may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzU7\"><em>Document </em>Marshall County, Alabama School Census Record U. S. Census Record DeKalb County Family Bible Record Birth Certificate of Child of Appellant Application for Social Security Account Insurance Policy Insurance Policy Delayed Birth Certificate Application for Retirement Insurance Benefits Statement of Appellant's Older Brother born August 1, 1896 Statement of George L. Logan, a non-relative Born April 5, 1878 Statement of Appellant's Sister, Annie Mae Blanks Pritchett, born July 24, 1903 Statement of Appellant's Younger Brother, Jodie Allen Blanks, born July 4, 1907 <em>Date Recorded </em>1916 January 1, 1920 May 25, 1920 August 30, 1927 (Showing age 21 for father) November 12, 1937 August 17, 1942 (Age 37 next birthday) September 14, 1953 (Age 48 next birthday) October 4, 1965 September 6, 1967 1967 1967 1967 November 15, 1967 <em>Indicated Age and/or Date of Birth </em>Age 8, November 5, 1907 Eleven years November 25, 1905 1905 November 25, 1904 1905 1905 November 25, 1905 November 25, 1905 November 25, 1905 November 25, 1905 November 25, 1905 November 25, 1905</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-38\">In concluding that Blanks was born in 1907, the trial examiner relied exclusively on the Marshall County School Census Record of 1916, since it was the oldest piece of documentary evidence before him. It is apparent at a glance, however, that this document is a questionable indicator of appellant\u2019s age, since it shows his birthdate as November 5 instead of November 25. Even the trial examiner agreed with Blanks that his birthdate was November 25, and he so found. Thus, the school census record was inaccurate on its face, and it was unreasonable for the trial examiner to make it the sole basis for his decision as to the year of birth, and reject everything else. Merrell v. Gardner, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>(d) <em>Certified copy in lieu of original. </em>In lieu of the original of any record, except a bible or other family record, there may be submitted as evidence of age a copy of such record or a statement as to the date of birth shown by such record, which has been duly certified (see See. 404.701(g)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-16\">(e) <em>When additional evidence may he required. </em>If the evidence submitted is not convincing, additional evidence may be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-42\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>The Secretary has promulgated regulations which govern the submission and evaluation of evidence in cases of this kind.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These regulations should be fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>lowed with intelligent reasonableness. We note initially that \u00a7 404.703(c) requires the trial examiner to give highest probative weight to birth records established before age five. No such records were available to Blanks. Therefore, in considering the other documents before him, the trial examiner was obliged by \u00a7 404.703(c) to give consideration to the \u201ccircumstances attending their establishment or recordation.\u201d Here there was no showing of who provided the information contained in the school census report, how the information was obtained, or what degree of accuracy was attempted in taking the census.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">Moreover, \u00a7 404.703(c) makes it plain that in the absence of a birth record made before age five, school records are not entitled to any greater probative weight than delayed birth certificates, insurance policies, family Bibles, or any of the other types of documentary evidence which Blanks presented in support of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">Much of the reasoning of Judge Thornberry in reviewing the evidence in Merrell v. Gardner, <em>supra, </em>is relevant here. Special emphasis should be placed upon the delayed birth certificate issued by state officials, who relied upon evidence from the mother, who was then living, for the age of her child. It is unreasonable to ride roughshod over the memories of the brothers and sisters as to age hierarchy of the children in the family. Their statements may not lead to exact ages, but they certainly should be persuasive as to the order of birth. The Secretary would rewrite the family tree to makes James younger than his brother Jodie, contrary to the recollection of all family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-9\">In sum, there was no substantial evidence to support a finding that Blanks was born on November 25, 1907. Weighing the evidence in the manner required by the Secretary\u2019s own regulations, we think the evidence would not fairly support any conclusion other than that Blanks was born on November 25, 1905. We direct that claimant Blanks is to be paid old age insurance benefits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>accordance with our determination that his correct date of birth is November 25, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1214-39\">. 20 C.F.R. 404.703 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1214-40\">(a) <em>When required. </em>An applicant for benefits under title II of the Act shall file supporting evidence showing the date of his birth if his age is a condition of entitlement or is otherwise relevant to the payment of benefits pursuant to such title II. Such evidence may also be required by the Administration as to the age of any other individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>when such other individual\u2019s age is relevant to the determination of the applicant\u2019s entitlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-11\">(b) <em>Type of evidence to he suibmitted. </em>Where an individual is required to submit evidence of date of birth as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section, he shall submit a public record of birth or a church record of birth or baptism established or recorded before his fifth birthday, if available. Where no such document recorded or established before age 5 is available, the individual shall submit as evidence of age another document or documents which may serve as the basis for a determination of the individual\u2019s date of birth provided such evidence is corroborated by other evidence or by information in the records of the Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-12\">(c) <em>Evaluation of evidence. </em>Generally, the highest probative value will be accorded to a public record of birth or a church record of birth or baptism established or recorded before age 5. Where such record is not available, and other documents are submitted as evidence of age, in determining their por-bative value, consideration will be given to when such other documents were established or recorded, and the circumstances attending their establishment or recordation. Among the documents which may be submitted for such purpose are: school record, census record, bible or other family record, church record of baptism or confirmation in youth or early adult life, insurance policy, marriage record, employment record, labor union record, fraternal organization record, military record, voting record, vaccination record, delayed birth certificate, birth certificate of child of applicant, physician\u2019s or midwife\u2019s record of birth, immigration record, naturalization record, or passport.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
