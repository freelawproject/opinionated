Murrali, Senior Circuit Judge of the 10th Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b837-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Appellant was convicted of conspiring to smuggle marihuana and of unlawfully transporting illegally imported marihuana, both in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176(a). The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in limiting cross-examination of the government\u2019s principal witness, appellant\u2019s codefend-ant, concerning his motivation to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">We reaffirm the well-settled rule that \u201c[t]he extent to which cross-examination of a witness will be allowed rests in the sound judicial discretion of the trial court.\u201d Beck v. United States, 298 F.2d 622, 629 (9th Cir. 1962); <em>see </em>United States v. Carlson, 423 F.2d 431, 440 (9th Cir. 1970); Kohatsu v. United States, 351 F.2d 898, 905 (9th Cir. 1905). Because of the peculiar circumstances of this case, however, we reluctantly conclude that the trial court unduly limited appellant\u2019s cross-examination of his co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">The witness was allegedly appellant\u2019s sole accomplice. The government relied almost entirely upon his testimony, which had little or no corroboration. The witness\u2019 testimony was directly contrary to that of appellant. The witness\u2019 credibility was therefore of crucial importance, and it was essential that appellant be given a maximum opportunity to test that credibility by exploring the witness\u2019 motivation for testifying. <em>See </em>United States v. Dickens, 417 F.2d 958, 959-961 (8th Cir. 1969); Thurman v. United States, 316 F.2d 205, 206 (9th Cir. 1963); United States v. Hogan, 232 F.2d 905 (3d Cir. 1956); cf. Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 270, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959); Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 693, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931). Cross-examination was unduly restricted here. Appellant was not permitted, for example, to inquire whether the witness knew the minimum mandatory sentence he would face if the government elected to prosecute him under section 176(a); and questioning of the witness regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>any hope or expectation of leniency he might entertain was limited to a single question, put by the court, as to whether he had been given any <em>promise </em>about what the court or prosecutor would do for him because he had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
