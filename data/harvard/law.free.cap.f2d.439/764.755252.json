(So, we do not reach other questions.) Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643, 82 S.Ct. 980, 8 L.Ed.2d 168, is clearly applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-24\">The situation would be different if it were alleged in the complaint that the supervisor is acting outside his authority or is violating some federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-25\">As a matter of policy, it seems a shame that the County of Bonner cannot find a forum or a proper party to sue to test its claim to the land in question. In other fields, the government has created the Court of Claims and the Federal Tort Claims Act for its citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-26\">We wonder why the government won\u2019t sue the County of Bonner, as it may, to quiet title, rather than laughing at its contentions and saying, \u201cIf you have a right, you can\u2019t vindicate it.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
