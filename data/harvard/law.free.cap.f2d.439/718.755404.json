We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-21\">Plaintiff\u2019s allegations affirmatively show a lack of federal jurisdiction of her claim. Diversity is non-existent\u2014 the parties all are citizens and residents of California. Nor is the action one which \u201carises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States\u201d and hence within the purview of 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1331(a). To the contrary (and despite plaintiff\u2019s conclusionary characterization of defendants\u2019 acts as viola-tive of due process and equal protection, etc.) the claim is simply one for breach of contract, the charge being that the defendant school district refused to perform certain obligations imposed upon it under a teaching contract entered into with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-22\">Plaintiff did litigate her claim in the appropriate state court; the judgment went against her and was affirmed on appeal. Adelt v. Richmond School District, 250 Cal.App.2d 149, 58 Cal.Rptr. 151 (1967). Thereafter, the California Supreme Court denied her petition for hearing. The present suit, in effect, constitutes an attempt to have a federal court correct errors assertedly made in the state proceedings. However, the asserted errors are not of Constitutional dimension and present no federal question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
