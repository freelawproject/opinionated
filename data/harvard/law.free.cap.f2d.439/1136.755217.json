These allegations are insufficient as a matter of law because (1) Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), is not retroactive, (2) the record shows that appellant knew his prior convictions could be used to increase his sentence, and (3) appellant represented himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-16\">Appellant also alleged that the trial judge promised him that if he admitted his prior convictions, the judge would not sentence him as a prior offender. What the record shows, however, is that after the judge inquired whether appellant wished to admit the allegations of prior convictions, appellant moved to strike those allegations; that the judge thereupon informed appellant that after admitting the prior convictions he could still file a motion to strike the allegations on legal grounds; that appellant then admitted them; and that later, at the sentencing hearing and before imposition of sentence, appellant, in accordance with the judge\u2019s ruling, again moved to strike the allegations of prior convictions. The record, therefore, conclusively shows that appellant\u2019s claim was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
