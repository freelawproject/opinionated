Collins, like appellants in Roark et al. v. Boyle, 439 F.2d 497, decided today, had applied for a pension and been rejected on the ground that his last employment in the coal industry was not with a signatory employer. The District Court held this requirement invalid as being arbitrary and capricious. We affirm for the reasons set forth in our <em>Roark </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
