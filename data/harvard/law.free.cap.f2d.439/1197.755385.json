The controlling principles of law are set forth in United States v. Wells, 5 Cir., 1968, 403 F.2d 596. The deficiency judgment here was denied on what the court termed as equitable considerations. We are unable to find any basis in the record for any such consideration or for denying the deficiency judgment. The judgment appealed from must be reversed with direction that judgment be entered for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-35\">Reversed with direction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
