Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965) and its progeny did not authorize the issuance of an injunction; and that plaintiff would suffer no irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">One day earlier, the Supreme Court had decided Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669, Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701; and Dyson v. Stein, 401 U.S. 200, 91 S.Ct. 769, 27 L.Ed.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-20\">Appellant filed in this Court notice of appeal and a motion for injunctive relief pending appeal. The order of the District Court is vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court for further consideration by it in the light of the foregoing decisions by the Supreme Court of February 23, 1971. The District Court is directed to enter at once an order enjoining any further action of the grand jury of Pike County, Mississippi concerning the appellant, pending final disposition by the District Court of the case on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-21\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
