He was admitted to the United States on December 2, 1960, as a resident alien. On March 14, 1968, he was convicted in a Texas district court for unlawful possession of marijuana and placed on probation. When petitioner had satisfactorily complied with the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>ditions of his probation, the state court, pursuant to petitioner\u2019s motion under section 7 of the Texas Adult Probation and Parole Law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> set aside the verdict of conviction. Following a hearing before a Special Inquiry Officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service petitioner was ordered deported from the United States under section 241(a) (11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the order was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, wherein he contended that the deportation order was invalid for two reasons: (1) He is not an alien but a citizen of the United States; and (2) his conviction, which was subsequently set aside by the state court, does not constitute a final conviction upon which a valid deportation order may be predicated. From the district court\u2019s denial of the petition, Gonzalez de Lara takes this appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">Appellant\u2019s first contention, that he is a United States citizen, is without merit. His mother, who left this country prior to her twelfth birthday and remained absent from it for twenty-six years, clearly did not fulfill the statutory residency requirement that would have entitled appellant to claim United States citizenship by birth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant, however, suggests that the residency requirement is onerous and invites us to declare it unconstitutional,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an offer we must refuse. Congress unquestionably possesses the authority to create standards for the attainment of United States citizenship by foreign-born persons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The standards here challenged, which were promulgated under that authority, are neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and are not susceptible to successful attack on constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">Appellant\u2019s remaining argument is that he is not deportable under 8 U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (11) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because he has not been finally convicted of the marijuana offense upon which the deportation order is predicated. This allegation is premised on the theory that a motion under section 7 of the Texas Adult Probation and Parole Law,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when granted, serves to expunge or erase the conviction. We join the Ninth Circuit, which has faced the same argument in construing a California statute similar to the one in question,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in rejecting the ex-pungement rationale. First, it is by no means clear that the effect of a motion to set aside the verdict, when granted, is to erase the conviction completely. We note, for example, that section 7 specifically provides that after the court has granted the motion to set aside the verdict, the party \u201c * * * shall thereafter be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime of which he has been convicted * * *, except that proof of his said conviction * * * shall be made known to the court should the defendant again be convicted of any criminal offense.\u201d Rather than a statute that completely erases the conviction, we believe the provision in controversy is accurately characterized as one that rewards a convicted party for good behavior during probation by releasing him from certain penalties and disabilities otherwise imposed upon convicted persons by Texas law. Secondly, we believe that the sanctions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (11) are triggered by the fact of the state conviction. The manner in which Texas chooses to deal with a party subsequent to his conviction is simply not of controlling importance insofar as a deportation proceeding \u2014 a function of federal, not state, law \u2014 is concerned. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[i]t would defeat the purpose * * * [of federal law] if provisions of local law, dealing with rehabilitation of convicted persons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>could remove them from the ambit of [federal penal enactments] * * * We do not think Congress intended such a result.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm</p>\n<p id=\"aut-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1371-4\">.

In support of his contention appellant cites Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L.Ed.2d 757 (1967); Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 84 S.Ct. 1187, 12 L.Ed.2d 218 (1964); and Bellei v. Rusk, 296 F.Supp. 1247 (D.D.C.1969). These cases are directed toward the question whether Congress can enact, consistently with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, a law stripping United States citizenship from one who has not voluntarily renounced it.
