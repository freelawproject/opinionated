This was not the intent of the opinion. To avoid any such impression, the paragraph of the decision filed July 1, 1970, reported in 430 F.2d at page 122 and reading \u201cThe privilege as commonly formulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>* * * \u201d and continuing to the paragraph on page 122 (right-hand column) reading \u201cIn view of the position * * <em>\u201d </em>in the opinion reported at 430 F.2d 106, is deleted. However, with respect to the Friedland report, we believe that under the circumstances it was properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">We have considered all the other grounds advanced in the petition for rehearing, and deny the petition except as noted above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
