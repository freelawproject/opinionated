App. \u00a7 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-23\">We reverse Pike\u2019s conviction because the district court erroneously denied Pike\u2019s timely request to represent himself. As Judge Medina observed in United States v. Plattner (2d Cir. 1964) 330 F.2d 271, 273: \u201cThe right to act <em>pro se </em>* * * is a right arising out of the Federal Constitution and not the mere product of legislation or judicial decision. Thus we would be required to remand the case, even if no prejudice to Plattner were shown to have resulted from the refusal to permit him to act <em>pro se.\u201d </em>Nothing in the record suggests that Pike\u2019s election \"io waive counsel and to conduct his own defense was incompetent or un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>intelligent. <em>See </em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann (1942) 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268. This is not a case in which the court appointed counsel to provide assistance to a defendant in representing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">It is unnecessary to discuss Pike\u2019s other contentions. They are either authoritatively decided by other cases that have come down since the appeal was taken or arise from circumstances that are unlikely to recur in the event of retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
