It is plain on the record here that there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings that the retiree\u2019s income from salary and self employment equalled the salary paid to him by his corporation, set up to take over his sole proprietorship at age 65, the salary paid to his wife who did no substantial work, plus the profits remaining in the corporation at the end of the accounting period.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">The trial court erred in making findings of fact<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in conflict with findings by the Secretary thus substantially supported on the record as a whole. See Brown v. Finch, 5 Cir., dec. July 2, 1970, 429 F.2d 80; Knox v. Finch, 5 Cir., dec. June 12, 1970, 427 F.2d 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">The judgment is reversed and the ease is remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\">. The trial court found that the retiree, after incorporation, performed \u201cmarkedly restricted services,\u201d whereas the Secretary found as a fact that \u201cclaimant\u2019s work activities in the store are substantially the same since incorporation as they were prior thereto. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-24\">It is not disputed that the volume of business and sales were also substantially the same after incorporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
