We reject his assertion advanced upon appeal that certain comments made to the trial jury by the prosecutor during the Government\u2019s summation had the effect of denying appellant a fair trial, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">During trial defendant\u2019s counsel had sought to impugn the Government\u2019s proof and had suggested to the jury that the non-testifying informant and the four testifying government narcotics agents had collectively plotted to \u201cframe\u201d Hestie. In his summation the prosecutor noted that all the agents had identified Hestie and he warned the jury that \u201cto acquit, you have to call all four of those agents liars.\u201d Prosecutors would do well to avoid such extreme statements. A defendant may only be claiming, or, alternatively to other claims, only be suggesting, that the customary difference between the testimony of prosecuting witnesses and that of the defendant has been occasioned by defects in the witnesses\u2019 perception or by the inaccuracies of memory. Here, however, in view of the particular circumstances of this cas\u00e9, we are constrained to hold that the response was not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The Government has conceded that the prosecutor erred when he made an unwarranted remark during the summation concerning the contents of a Jencks Act report which had previously been given to defense counsel in the sight of the jury. Frankly, we cannot understand why Assistant United States Attorneys in this circuit should fail to observe the procedures relative to the turning over of Jencks Act material that was specified in United States v. Gardin, 382 F.2d 601, 605-606 (2 Cir. 1967). We take this opportunity to warn them and their supervisors that further lapses may not be condoned. However, the record discloses that the jury\u2019s request to see the report was rebuffed by Judge Weinfeld who stated that the report was not in evidence and was not to be considered, and as the author of the report was known by the jury to have provided only corroborative evidence, we think that this error, \u201cviewed in the light of the trial record as a whole,\u201d United States v. Grunberger, 431 F.2d 1062, 1069 (2 Cir. 1970), was so lacking in prejudicial effect that its interjection at trial was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Moreover, no objection to any part of the summation was taken at trial. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
