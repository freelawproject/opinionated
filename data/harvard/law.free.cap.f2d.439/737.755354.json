Thereafter on August 20, 1969 his local draft board mailed him an Order to Report for Induction.' Three days prior to the reporting date of September 8, 1969, he was granted a postponement to permit him to pursue further action in an effort to secure discretionary review of his file by National Selective Service Headquarters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">While the outstanding order was in this officially postponed status, plaintiff enrolled as a student at the University of North Dakota. The University duly notified plaintiff\u2019s Local Board of his status as a full-time student. The National Selective Service System subsequently declined to grant the requested conscientious objector classification, and the Local Board by letter dated October 27 terminated plaintiff\u2019s postponement, directing him to report for induction on November 10, 1969. Soon after receipt thereof, plaintiff wrote his Local Board requesting a I-S student deferment under Section 6(i) (2) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(i) (2). That statute reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">\u201cAny person who while satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college * * * is ordered to report for induction * * * shall upon the facts being presented to his local board, be deferred (A) until the end of such academic year, or (B) until he ceases satisfactorily to pursue such course of instruction, whichever is earlier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Since the registrant\u2019s file did not indicate that he was a student prior to the issuance of the original Order to Report for Induction, the Local Board denied the requested deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">Having no right to an administrative appeal from that denial of a reopening of his case by his local board, plaintiff commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, asking for preliminary and mandatory injunctive relief in the nature of an order requiring his Local Board to grant him the requested I-S student classification under Section 6(i) (2). Following a hearing on cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court on December 22,1969, entered judgment in registrant\u2019s favor. In an unreported memorandum opinion, the court held (1) that Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not bar pre-induction review of the Selective Service System\u2019s actions as challenged by this registrant, and (2) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>a registrant is entitled to the Section 6(i) (2) deferment (I-S) whenever the date upon which he is directed to report for induction, as distinguished from the date upon which the induction order is. received in the first instance, interrupts his college year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Section 10(b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (3) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201cNo judicial review shall be made of the classification or processing of any registrant by local boards, appeal boards, or the President except as a defense to a criminal prosecution instituted under Section 12 of this title [50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462] after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction * * * provided that such review shall go to the question of jurisdiction * * * only when there is no basis in fact for the classification * * *\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The Supreme Court has prescribed a narrow exception to this otherwise complete preclusion of pre-induction judicial review for eases in which the registrant challenges Selective Service System action which is \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d or patently violative of distinct legal rights. Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board No. 11, supra; Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968); Breen v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, 396 U.S. 460, 90 S.Ct. 661, 24 L.Ed.2d 653 (1970). See also Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y.1968), aff\u2019d per curiam at 393 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 553, 21 L.Ed.2d 511 (1969) on the basis of Clark v. Gabriel, <em>supra. </em>This Circuit has on several occasions considered the availability of pre-induction review under the <em>Oestereich </em>exception to Section 10(b) (3). See Kolden v. Selective Service Local Board No. 4, 406 F.2d 631 (8th Cir. 1969), vacated and remanded 397 U.S. 47, 90 S. Ct. 811, 25 L.Ed.2d 33 (1970); Green v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Local Board No. 87, 419 F.2d 813 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. dismissed 397 U.S. 1059, 90 S.Ct. 1407, 25 L.Ed.2d 682 (1970). See also United States v. Pence, 410 F.2d 557, 559 (8th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The confusion generated by <em>Oestereich, Clark </em>and <em>Breen </em>is witnessed by the volume of recent litigation over the applicability of the exception to Section 10(b) (3) at the appellate level.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The decisions are significantly unanimous in two respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">I. Where the registrant challenges the Local Board\u2019s resolution of issues of evi-dentiary fact,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 10(b) (3) plainly precludes pre-induction review. Clark v. Gabriel, <em>swpra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">II. Where the underlying evidentiary facts are not in dispute and the registrant\u2019s claim is cast as a challenge to the legality of the Selective Service System\u2019s reading or application of relevant law, then the court may afford pre-induction review only if on investigation of the merits of the issue presented it determines that the Board has acted in a \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d manner. Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board, <em>supra; </em>Breen v. Selective Service Local Board No. 16, <em>supra. </em>In other words, when faced with the Section 10(b) (3) problem in a challenge to the Selective Service System\u2019s application of law to undisputed facts, the court is required to go beyond the mere style of the registrant\u2019s claim to analyze its substance and appraise its likelihood of success on the merits. The barren allegation of an illegality in Selective Service procedures for the classification or processing of a registrant is not alone sufficient to permit pre-induction review under the narrow exception to Section 10(b) (3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Thus, none of the courts in the eases cited <em>supra, </em>footnote 5, found that the nature of the registrant\u2019s claim entitled the registrant to pre-induction review under the exception to Section 10(b) (3) and then ruled against that claim on the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">This Circuit has demonstrated its adherence to this approach to the Section 10(b) (3) problem in Green v. Local Board No. 87, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Green, </em>the registrant sought preinduction review of the legality of an Order to Report for Induction, where the registrant had received the Order while several older I-A registrants had not. All relevant facts were undisputed. The only issue was whether the Board had violated the order of call specified by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7. The court resolved the jurisdictional issue by examining the substance of the registrant\u2019s claim to determine whether it had merit under applicable law. After some analysis, it concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201cPetitioner Green\u2019s allegation that ten older men classified I-A remained on the draft rolls presents no picture of facially unlawful draft board procedures in inducting him as was the case in <em>Oestereich.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">419 F.2d at 815. On that basis, the court held that Section 10(b) (3) barred pre-induction review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">\u201cGreen\u2019s claims do not fall within the limited exception to \u00a7 10(b) (3) as enunciated in <em>Oestereich,. supra, </em>and as clarified by the companion case of Clark v. Gabriel, <em>supra. </em>Mr. Justice Douglas, who wrote for the majority in <em>Oestereich, </em>explicated the limits of that exception in a separate concurring opinion in Clark v. Gabriel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-14\">\u2018But in my view it takes the extreme case where the Board can be said to flout the law, as it did in Oestereich v. Selective Service [System Local] Board., <em>ante, </em>p. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, to warrant pre-induction review of its actions.\u2019 393 U.S. at 260, 89 S.Ct. at 427.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-15\">Green makes no such case here. * <em>*\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzF\">419 F.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">Our inquiry into the Section 10(b) (3) problem in this case therefore leads us necessarily to a consideration of the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">Registrant claims entitlement to a I-S student deferment under Section 6(i) (2) because the pre-college enrollment induction Order of August 20, 1969 required ultimately (after postponements) that he report for induction on November 10, 1969, during the current college term.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">The language of Section 6(i) (2) and the policy behind its enactment make it quite clear that this suggested interpretation is inaccurate. The statute gives the registrant the right to deferment until the end of the academic year if, while he is \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution,\u201d his Local Board issues an Order to Report for Induction. As the District of Columbia Circuit has recently observed in Nestor v. Hershey, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 73, 425 F.2d 504 at 513 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-19\">\u201cUnlike the II-S, designed to permit education in the national interest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>I-S classification is intended to avoid the hardship and waste of an interrupted academic year. In permitting its student recipient to complete the academic year <em>in which he received an induction order, </em>the I-S classification saves him from the loss of academic credit and tuition which would otherwise result from the interruption of his school year.\u201d [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The Second Circuit has also assumed, in recent Section 6(i) (2) cases, that it is the date of the Order\u2019s mailing, not the specified Induction date, which determines the availability of that deferment. Marsano v. Laird, 412 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1969); Carey v. Local Board No. 2, 412 F.2d 71 (2d Cir. 1969). See also, United States ex rel. Mazenis v. McBee, 435 F.2d 18, 20 (7th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Where, as here, the order issues prior to the registrant\u2019s enrollment in a college program which might otherwise qualify him for the Section 6 (i) (2) deferment, the evil which the statute was designed to circumvent does not exist. In these circumstances, the actual date of induction cannot be characterized as an unforeseeable interruption of the academic year. After the date of the order\u2019s mailing the registrant is appropriately forev/arned of his impending induction, and in fact may seek further deferment or exemption only for circumstances beyond his control under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2(b). If he then chooses to enter college he does so at his peril, and may not avail himself of the Section 6(i) (2) end-of-the-academic-year deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Our decision tracks with the reasoning of the court in Peller v. Selective Service Local Board No. 65, 313 F.Supp. 100 (N.D.Ind.1970), which held that the section 6(i) (2) deferment is available only where the order is received during the school year. The <em>Peller </em>court rejected an argument identical in substance to the one advanced by the registrant in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201cThe interpretation suggested by plaintiff would create a serious administrative burden for the Selective Service System. It would place an immense premium on stalling tactics for anyone who receives his induction order during the summer. Even a dropout could gain a year\u2019s reprieve if he could stave off the actual day of induction until he was able to re-enter classes somewhere. The possibilities for fraud are obvious; and even in the absence of fraud, the inevitable flood of postponement requests could impose an intolerable burden on the system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">313 F.Supp. at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">On the basis of the foregoing, it is perfectly clear that the registrant has not demonstrated a \u201cblatantly lawless\u201d action on the part of his Local Board in its denial of his requested I-S Section 6(i) (2) deferment. The District Court was therefore without jurisdiction by operation of Section 10(b) (3) and should have dismissed the complaint. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and instruct that it dismiss the case. The Induction Order of August 20, 1969 is therefore reinstated and its previous cancellation revoked.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">. The registrant has not contended that the Local Board was without power to order his induction during the pendency of this discretionary appeal of the denial of his conscientious objection claim. His formal appeal rights, it is conceded, were exhausted on June 23, 1969, with the Presidential Appeal Board\u2019s adverse decision. The postponement was given purely as a matter of grace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-18\">. Quoted in this opinion hereinafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\">. Plaintiff advised his Local Board by letter of February 7, 1970, that he was no longer attending the University. This operated to terminate his eligibility for a student deferment under Section 6(i) (2), and the Government forthwith moved this court to vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with instructions to dismiss for mootness. The motion was denied by this court on April 17, 1970. This court was not apprised of any subsequent developments which might justify reversing that denial pending a decision on the present appeal. The Order to Report for Induction of course was cancelled upon the reopening and reclassification as I-S pursuant to the mandate of the District Court. While the registrant does not currently enjoy eligibility for that deferment, he has been reverted to the I-A pool and therefore has certain rights collateral to the deferment itself \u2014 including the right to seek other deferments and exemptions and the right to be processed in accordance with the Lottery System. He would not have these rights if the original induction order's validity were upheld by this court. See United States v. Bundle, 413 F.2d 329 at 334 (8th Cir. 1969). Resolution of the issues on appeal, therefore, may have serious practical consequences despite the fact that the registrant is no longer eligible (if ever he was) for the student deferment. See Nestor v. Hershey, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 73, 425 F.2d 504 at 523-526 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b793-12\">. Section 10(b) (3) has been considered a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d provision because it operates to limit the power of the courts to consider pre-induction challenges to the registrant\u2019s classification. In order to distinguish the 10(b) (3) problem from other jurisdictional problems in Selective Service cases, some courts have characterized it as a codification of the doctrines of \u201cripeness\u201d (Boyd v. Clark, 287 F.Supp. 561 (S.D.N.Y.1968)), \u201cexhaustion\u201d (United States v. Pence, 410 F.2d 557 (8th Cir. 1969)), or \u201cabstention\u201d (Stella v. Selective Service System, 427 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"At-\">It is clear that the petitioner for preinduction injunctive relief must establish <em>both </em>(1) jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 or some other general jurisdictional statute, and (2) judicial power to deal with the claim prior to induction under the exception to Section 10(b) (3). See Oestereich v. Selective Service System Local Board No. 11, 393 U.S. 233, 239, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968); Boyd v. Clark, supra; Fein v.
