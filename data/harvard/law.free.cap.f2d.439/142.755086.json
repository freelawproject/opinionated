We think the charge was clear and accurate. The robbery requirements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) constitute a lesser included element of the crime defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d). The application of the merger doctrine in connection with sentencing under this statute should not be confused with the fact that the various sub-paragraphs of the statute nevertheless create separate crimes. See United States v. McKenzie, 414 F.2d 808 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s second contention, the court properly charged that although defendant was indicted only as a principal he could be convicted of aiding and abetting. United States v. Provenzano, 334 F.2d 678, 691 (3d Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Defendant also says \u201cit was error to exclude certain persons of the same color [black] and physical bearing as defendant who were there for identification purposes, from the enclosure near the defendant under the circumstances of this case.\u201d Since defendant based his defense on mistaken identity, he moved immediately before trial to have three other Negro males seated with him during the trial itself. The fact is that the district court agreed that all but one of these individuals could sit near the defendant. It was defendant\u2019s choice not to have any of them present under the circumstances. The individual the court excluded by its ruling wore a goatee and moustache and was the same height and build as defendant. While defendant was clean-shaven at the time of his motion and trial, the Government represented to the court without challenge that defendant had also had a goatee when arrested. We think the ruling of the district court was well within the exercise of sound discretion. See United States v. King, 433 F.2d 937 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Other alleged errors were not the subject of trial objection. Since they do not amount to plain error the court will not rule on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
