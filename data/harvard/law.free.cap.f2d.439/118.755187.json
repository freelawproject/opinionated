All relate to complaints by the Chapter X Trustee, Mortimer M. Caplin, concerning alleged failure on the part of The Marine Midland Grace Trust Company of New York (\u201cMarine\u201d), trustee under an Indenture whereunder Webb &amp; Knapp issued unsecured debentures now outstanding in the amount of $4,298,200, to enforce certain covenants made by the debtor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">Marine had filed a proof of claim in the sum of $51,447.55 for services rendered and expenses incurred by it as indenture trustee. The Chapter X Trustee objected to this on the ground of Marine\u2019s alleged breach of duty and counterclaimed for damages in the amount of the debentures that remained outstanding. With the authorization of the district court, he also filed a plenary suit seeking the same relief. In addition he moved that Marine be required to file an accounting. Marine moved to dismiss the objections to its proof of claim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>counterclaim and the plenary suit. The judge held that grant of Marine\u2019s motions to dismiss the counterclaim and the complaint was required by Clarke v. Chase Nat\u2019l Bank, 137 F.2d 797 (2 Cir. 1943), but denied its motion to dismiss the objections. He also denied the Trustee\u2019s motion to compel Marine to account since there was no allegation that Marine had mishandled any funds which came into its hands as indenture trustee, and the only claim asserted by the Chapter X Trustee was the indenture trustee\u2019s alleged failure to enforce the negative covenant, a claim that would stand no better as a counterclaim to an accounting than as a plenary action or as a counterclaim to a proof of claim. Each party appealed from the decisions adverse to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">After a panel consisting of Judges Moore, Kaufman and Hays had come to the conclusion that <em>Clarke </em>should be overruled, the court voted, in accordance with its usual practice in such cases, see, e. g., Indussa Corp. v. S.S. Ranborg, 377 F.2d 200 (2 Cir. 1967), to consider the appeals <em>in bane </em>upon the briefs already filed. A majority of the full court have concluded that <em>Clarke </em>was correctly decided and, since this case is admittedly not distinguishable, that the dismissal of the counterclaim and the plenary suit should be affirmed. We are all of the view that the orders denying the Trustee\u2019s motion to require Marine to account and refusing to strike his objections to Marine\u2019s claim should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>Clarke </em>was an action by the Chapter X Trustee of Associated Gas and Electric Company (Ageco) against the Chase National Bank, trustee under an indenture for debenture holders. Broadly speaking the complaint contained two differing sets of counts. The first and third alleged that Chase, in breach of its duties as indenture trustee, had failed to enforce certain covenants against the mortgage or pledge of Ageco\u2019s property or its merger into another corporation and sought to recover losses suffered by the debenture holders in consequence. The second count sought recovery of $4,-000,000 allegedly received by Chase from Ageco in payment of an indebtedness, though Chase knew the latter was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency; the fourth count alleged that Chase had received a preference in respect of $4,249,000 of Ageco debentures owned by Chase, through an unfair exchange with Ageco\u2019s subsidiaries of these debentures for securities of greater value, at a time when Chase knew Ageco was insolvent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court unanimously reversed an order dismissing the second and fourth counts. A majority, with Judge Augustus N. Hand writing for himself and Judge Chase, upheld an order of a different judge dismissing the first and third counts; as to this Judge Learned Hand dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The majority in <em>Clarke </em>reasoned that, assuming liability, \u201cwe cannot see that the claims for breach of the covenants are any part of the property of the bankrupt or would affect the plan of reorganization\u201d ; they were rather claims \u201cof the debenture-holders not derived from the bankrupt\u2019s estate but arising through the alleged tortious action of the indenture trustee.\u201d 137 F.2d at 800. They cited the earlier decisions in In re 1775 Broadway Corp., 79 F.2d 108 (2 Cir. 1935), that the reorganization court has no jurisdiction to force nonassenting noteholders to release claims against an indenture trustee for misrepresentation in the sale of the notes, since these were not claims against the debtor or its assets or claims that must be settled to bring property into the reorganized company, and in In re Nine North Church Street, Inc., 82 F.2d 186 (2 Cir. 1936), that the reorganization court has no jurisdiction to enjoin nonassenting certificate holders from suing the guarantor of a mortgage on the debtor\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>since the suit was to enforce a personal right against the guarantor and did not concern property subject to reorganization. Judge Learned Hand argued that the indenture trustee had a duty to prevent the violation of the covenants in the indenture, 137 F.2d at 802, which was true enough, and then asked \u201cIn what way does that [breach of duty] differ from allowing a debtor, in violation of the mortgage, to substitute improper collateral?\u201d The answer was that in the latter case the mortgage trustee would have dealt improperly with property of the bankrupt. Judge L. Hand himself had based his opinion in Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. President and Directors of Manhattan Co., 105 F.2d 130, 131-132 (2 Cir. 1939), on the ground that there the accounting dealt with property of the debtor which trustees for secured creditors had allegedly surrendered in breach of the trust, and that the rights of the creditors to compel them to restore the <em>res </em>was within the \u201cextended\u201d concept of the debtor\u2019s property in a reorganization.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was there careful, however, to distinguish the case in which the creditors asserted rights having \u201cnothing to do with the <em>res </em>and [which] would not restore it\u201d and \u201chad nothing to do with anything that had ever been the debtor\u2019s property, or with the distribution of any part of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. This distinction, apparently lost sight of in his dissent in <em>Clarke, </em>had been further developed by Judge Frank in Brooklyn Trust Co. v. Kelby, 134 F.2d 105, 110-112, 116 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 319 U.S. 767, 63 S.Ct. 1330, 87 L.Ed. 1717 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">A year and a half after <em>Clarke, </em>a panel consisting of the three other judges of the court as it then stood, Swan, Clark and Frank, decided the complicated case of President and Directors of Manhattan Co. v. Kelby, 147 F.2d 465 (2 Cir. 1944), cert. denied, 324 U.S. 866, 65 S. Ct. 916, 89 L.Ed. 1422 (1945). The unanimous opinion was written by Judge Frank, who had long been expert in reorganization matters and was a member of the SEC when Chapter X was adopted, in no small measure at its instance. The court took a broad view of the rights of reorganization trustees against a trustee under an indenture but stopped when it came to an issue similar to that here presented. One of the claims of the Chapter X Trustees was that the indenture trustee was liable in damages for failing to enforce a covenant of Prudence-Bonds Corporation to deposit a guarantee by the Prudence Company. Although recognizing that such damages might be considerable, the court held that \u201can action for those damages is not one for restoration of the [trust] fund\u201d and \u201ccannot be maintained in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d 147 F.2d at 478, citing Brooklyn Trust Co. v. Kelby, <em>supra, </em>134 F.2d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">It is with this background that we come to Prudence-Bonds Corp. v. State Street Trust Co., 202 F.2d 555, 558 (2 Cir.) cert. denied, 346 U.S. 835, 74 S.Ct. 47, 98 L.Ed. 357 (1953), more particularly to Judge Learned Hand\u2019s opinion on rehearing. The Chapter X Trustee regards this as fundamentally inconsistent with <em>Clarke, </em>which the opinion did not mention. In our view the reason for failing to mention <em>Clarke </em>was that for grounds clearly stated by Judge Hand, there was no inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The holdings in <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>with which we are concerned were (1) that the Chapter X Trustees could have maintained an action against an indenture trustee for failure to enforce a \u201cSecondary Guaranty\u201d by the Prudence Company of mortgages held by the indenture trustee as security for the bondholders, and (2) that this right had been conveyed to the reorganized company. Indeed it is only the first holding that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>of real interest here. Its justification was thus stated, 202 F.2d at 561 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">But by the Secondary Guaranty the Guarantor became a surety for the performance of the mortgagors, just as the mortgages were a surety for the same performance. The only difference between them was that in one case the security was the promise of a third person and in the other it was a lien upon property. The promise was a part of the <em>res </em>in precisely the same sense that the promises were in the policies of fire and title insurance, mentioned in Article 1, \u00a7 2. As we have said, it was in effect the equivalent of a policy of credit insurance of the mortgagors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The significance of this was heightened by the distinction drawn between the indenture trustee\u2019s failure to enforce the \u201cSecondary Guaranty\u201d and the \u201cPrimary Guaranty,\u201d i. e., a guarantee by the Prudence Company of the bonds of Prudence-Bonds themselves. While the court said it \u201cneed not answer\u201d the question whether this \u201cwas also a part of the <em>res,\u201d </em>the opinion in effect did so when it said that this \u201cwas a promise to the bondholders to pay the Debtor\u2019s obligations, and had nothing to do with the <em>res.\u201d Id. </em>It was the Primary Guaranty which was like the \u25a0 claim sought to be pressed in <em>Clarke </em>and here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Far from being indistinguishable, as the dissent claims, <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>differs from this case and from <em>Clarke </em>on the very ground Judge Hand was at such pains to clarify. If Marine had held property of Webb &amp; Knapp through pledge or, for example, as a result of payments into a sinking fund, the Chapter X Trustee could sue under <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>for mismanagement of such assets, since he would be asserting a claim to property of the debtor which the indenture trustee had held. Here, as in <em>Clarke, </em>he is not. The difference between failure to enforce a third party\u2019s guaranty of a mortgage assigned to an indenture trustee or other property held by it as security and failure to enforce a promise by the debtor is the highly significant one that the former has diminished the debtor\u2019s estate and the latter has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The collapse of the argument of the Chapter X Trustee based on <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>does not, of course, mean that we could not overrule <em>Clarke </em>if we were convinced that Judges Augustus Hand and Chase had been in error. But we are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">It is necessary in the first instance to consider what effect a recovery by the Chapter X Trustee would have on the reorganization. On a superficial view this might seem substantial \u2014 if, for example, the Chapter X Trustee were to achieve a complete recovery, the debenture holders would be paid off and it might seem there would be that much more for the other creditors and the stockholders. But this pleasant prospect speedily evaporates when the law of subrogation is brought into play. As a result of sub-rogation, Marine would simply be substituted for the debenture holders as the claimant. Cf. ALI, Restatement of Security \u00a7 141 (1941). If th'e^Chapter X Trustee recovered judgment in a lesser amount, the claim of the debenture holders would still be provable in full, with the division of the proceeds between them and Marine dependent upon the results of the reorganization, and other creditors or stockholders would not be affected. Indeed, even these hypotheti-cals put the case too favorably for the Chapter X Trustee, since we do not see the answer to Judge A. N. Hand\u2019s observation in <em>Clarke, supra, </em>137 F.2d at 800.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Each creditor, including the debenture-holders, can prove the full amount of his claim, and only to the extent that a debenture-holder fails to satisfy it from the bankruptcy estate will he suffer a loss which he can assert against the defendant through its failure to enforce the negative covenants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The claim against Marine thus could not be prosecuted to judgment until the results of the reorganization become known.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Equally important to the <em>Clarke </em>decision was the necessity, 137 F.2d at 801, under F.R.Civ.P. 17(a), here applicable by virtue of General Order in Bankruptcy 37, that \u201cEvery action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d To determine whether Caplin has that status, we look to the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Sections 186 and 187 provide that a Chapter X Trustee \u201cshall be vested with the same rights, be subject to the same duties, and exercise the same powers as a trustee appointed under section 44 of this Act, and, if authorized by the judge, shall have and may exercise such additional rights and powers as a receiver in equity would have if appointed by a court of the United States for the property of the debtor.\u201d Section 70, sub. a vests a trustee appointed under \u00a7 44 \u201cwith the title of the bankrupt\u201d to eight types of property therein described. None of these, by the remotest stretch of language or even of imagination, could include the claims of debenture holders against an indenture trustee for permitting the debtor to violate covenants made by the debtor to the indenture trustee for the bondholders\u2019 protection. The bankruptcy trustee\u2019s task is to \u201ccollect and reduce to money the property of the estates for which they are trustees,\u201d \u00a7 47. While the reorganization trustee\u2019s added duty, \u00a7 167(3), to \u201creport to the judge any facts ascertained by him pertaining to fraud, misconduct, mismanagement and irregularities, and to any causes of action available to the estate,\u201d may be broad enough to authorize him to report whether in his opinion an indenture trustee has failed in its duties to debenture holders and this may assist the latter in asserting their rights, nothing in the statute allows him to collect any moneys or other property not owed to or owned by the estate although, as indicated, see fn. 3, he may sometimes be able to recover an insolvent corporation\u2019s property when the corporation itself might be subject to a defense of consent or estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Any other view would, for example, allow a Chapter X Trustee to settle claims of debenture holders against third parties with the approval of the reorganization court, and would, in principle, sanction a plan of reorganization providing for a partial or even total release of such claims. Yet \u00a7 216(2) says that the plan \u201cmay deal with all or any part <em>of the property of the debtor\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) and \u00a7 216(13) directs that it \u201cmay include provisions for settlement or adjustment of <em>claims belonging to the debtor or to the estate\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The debenture holders\u2019 claims against Marine simply do not fit under those rubrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The Reorganization Trustee relies heavily on statements from the legislative history of Chapter X, such as that in the House Report, H.R.Rep. 1409, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 43-44 (1937), that \u201cThere must be power and responsibility in the hands of a qualified representative of investors.\u201d It was exactly in this spirit that Chapter X was read in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>early years by the judges who sat on this court in the 1940\u2019s, one of whom, as noted, had played no small role in its enactment. These were not judges who read statutes in the niggling way condemned by Mr. Justice Holmes, \u201cWe see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before.\" Johnson v. United States, 163 F. 30, 32 (1 Cir. 1908). But they could find nothing in Chapter <em>X, </em>as we cannot, to indicate that Congress was \u201cdriving at\" allowing a trustee to enforce claims not belonging to the estate. Now that the issue has again been raised after so many years, Congress may wish to consider whether it is possible and, if so, desirable to go further and permit the trustee to enforce individual claims of security holders against third parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is a policy decision to be made by the legislature, not by our overruling soundly reasoned decisions of our distinguished predecessors, who knew the statute every bit as well as we do and construed it to mean what it rather clearly says. We therefore affirm Judge McLean\u2019s dismissal of the Chapter X Trustee\u2019s counterclaim and plenary suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We are all in accord with the decision of the panel to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Trustee\u2019s motion for an accounting. Although \u00a7 212 gives the reorganization court power to enforce an accounting under instruments whereby any one of a number of persons, including an indenture trustee, \u201cpurports to represent any creditor or stockholder,\u201d this does not authorize the court to require an \u201caccounting\u201d by an indenture trustee when there is no claim that he holds property belonging to the debtor or any security holder, or has mishandled any such property in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">We likewise are in accord with the panel\u2019s decision affirming the denial of Marine\u2019s motion to strike the Chapter X Trustee\u2019s objections to its proof of claim. Marine claims it is entitled to be paid its pro-rata share out of the debtor\u2019s property for services it rendered as the indenture trustee, whereas Caplin contends it did not perform the services it should have performed. We cannot say that the objection, if well founded in fact, would not be valid in law. As already indicated, even though the debtor corporation here might have been estopped to assert failure of consideration as a defense to the trustee\u2019s claim, as Marine argues, it does not follow that the reorganization trustee may not do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The orders of the district court are affirmed. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\">. The breach concerns mainly, if not indeed solely, Section 3.6 of the Indenture. Webb &amp; Knapp there covenanted that so long as any of the debentures remained outstanding, it would not incur or assume indebtedness resulting from borrowings or from the purchase of real property or interests in real property on which it would be personally liable, or to purchase any real property, or interests in real property, unless on the basis of computations (made as of the last day of the fourth month prior to such transaction) its \u201cconsolidated tangible assets\u201d would equal 200% of certain liabilities. In determining \u201cconsolidated tangible assets\u201d the Company was authorized, <em>inter alia, </em>to rely on and use appraisals made by its officers and approved by the Board of Directors \u201cof real property, of interests in real property * * * or of the controlling stock interest in any corporation the principal assets of which consist of real property or interests in real property.\u201d The Company was required to file a certificate of compliance annually with Marine. In addition to such certificates Marine requested, as permitted by the Indenture, and received separate officers\u2019 certificates stating specifically that Webb &amp; Knapp was not in violation of \u00a7 3.6. In accordance with \u00a7 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>77ooo, </em>\u00a7 10.1 of the Indenture required Marine to examine all reports furnished to it but authorized it, in the absence of bad faith, to rely upon certificates or opinions conforming to the requirements of the Indenture. The Chapter X Trustee claims that although the reports for 1959-63 showed asset-liability ratios ranging from a high of 258.30 in 1961 to a low of 200.56 in 1963, Marine should have known that the appraised values were inflated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. A fifth count sought to recover $40,000 that had been paid Chase as trustee\u2019s fees, which the district court had dismissed with leave to amend; the court dismissed the appeal from this order for lack of appellate jurisdiction, 137 F.2d at 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\">. The \u201cextension\u201d was that in some instances the Chapter X trustee may be able to recover property of the company which the debtor, because it might be barred by a defense of consent or, estoppel, could not. See McCandless v. Furlaud, 296 U.S. 140, 159-161, 56 S.Ct. 41, 80 L.Ed. 121 (1935).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">. We do not regard In re Solar Mfg.

McGirl, 345 U.S. 940, 73 S.Ct. 831, 97 L.Ed. 1366 (1953), as in conflict with <em>Clarke. </em>Although we would not be persuaded by the procedural distinction made at p. 332 n. 6, the counterclaim against the Indenture trustee there sustained was for failure to earmark $450,000 it had received upon the sale of certain of the debtor\u2019s property. Since the claim was for failure to keep funds of the debtor which the indenture trustee was bound to hold in trust, the court concluded that the cause of action was \u201cquasi in rem for the benefit of the trust\u201d and \u201cfor the restoration of trust funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. Caplin argues that failure to allow suit by him would leave the debenture holders without remedy against Marine as a practical matter, since under Elkind v. Chase Nat'l Bank, 259 App.Div. 661, 20 N.Y.S.2d 213 (1st Dept.), aff\u2019d 284 N.Y. 726, 31 N.E.2d 198 (1940), each would have to sue individually. Apart from other possibilities under F.R.Civ.P. 23, we would not regard it as unlikely that a class action could be maintained in federal court for violation of \u00a7 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, although, of course, we are not to be understood as so deciding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b178-5\">. An affirmative answer should not simply be assumed. Apart from possible question whether the bankruptcy power extends to claims of creditors against solvent third parties, which Congress might not think it worthwhile to raise, there would be serious problems if other states have rules like that prevailing in New York before 1950 that transfer of a bond does not carry accrued claims against trustees or guarantors, see El-kind v. Chase Nat\u2019l Bank, <em>supra, </em>259 App.Div. 661, 20 N.Y.S.2d 213, overruled in part by statute, L.1950, c. 812, N.Y. Personal Property Law \u00a7 41, subd. 4, contrast, Welch v. Northern Bank &amp; Trust Co., 100 Wash. 349, 170 P. 1029 (1918), or when such claims had been reserved by agreement. With no showing that the <em>Clarke </em>decision had caused any real difficulty over the past twenty-seven years, Congress might well decide that it was best to adhere to the policy of allowing holders of the bonds of debtors in reorganization to pursue their own remedies against third parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b178-12\">.

State Street Trust Co., 202 F.2d 555 (2d Cir. 1953), without saying so expressly. The plaintiff in <em>Prudence-Bonds, </em>like Caplin, sought redress on behalf of bondholders for the alleged default by the trustee of a bond indenture. The reorganized corporation, successor to the reorganization trustee and proceeding pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court, alleged that the indenture trustee had negligently failed to demand payment by a guarantor of a mortgage pledged to the indenture trustee as security for the bonds, following the mortgagee\u2019s default. Although at the time of the default and for a period thereafter the guarantor was solvent and presumably could have made good on its guarantee, the guarantor\u2019s insolvency followed close upon that of the debtor. Learned Hand, joined by Chief Judge Swan and Judge Frank, found that the broad authority of the reorganization court to implement a reorganization plan furnished ample authority for the newly reorganized corporation to assert before the bankruptcy court the liability of the indenture trustee \u201cto the bondholders for any loss that resulted\u201d from that trustee\u2019s alleged breach. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-629.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In its brief on appeal, Marine attempted to distinguish <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>in several respects, but each is inconsequential. The relevance of the assertion that Marine successfully opposed Caplin\u2019s application for an accounting by Marine or that Marine is not now seeking a release as trustee, escapes me altogether. Such considerations would seem to bear more on jurisdiction than standing. And the claim that the bondholders\u2019 interests here are unsecured, unlike those in <em>Prudence-Bonds, </em>is also of no moment. Moreover, I would not attribute to Congress the perverse purpose of permitting a bankruptcy court to authorize a corporation already reorganized to assert bondholders\u2019 claims against the indenture trustee, as in <em>Prudence-Bonds, </em>while denying it the power to dispose of those claims in more orderly fashion by permitting the trustee to raise them <em>before </em>the reorganization plan has jelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The majority concedes that <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>is indistinguishable in any of these respects, but suggests that it may be explained away on yet another ground. The opinion tells us that a Chapter X trustee may proceed against an indenture trustee for failure to enforce a guaranty <em>by a third party </em>that secures the trust res, as in <em>Prudence-Bonds, </em>but not for failure to enforce a promise <em>by the debtor himself </em>contained in the trust indenture, as here, which also protects and secures the trust res. This anomalous result is said to be forced upon us because of language in Learned Hand\u2019s <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>opinion having nothing to do with that court\u2019s discussion of the standing problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">But when a hypothesis as to a law\u2019s meaning is seen to yield such awkward conclusions, it is perhaps better to reexamine the hypothesis than to ascribe to Congress an intent to fashion so irrational a design. In this instance, the pressure to ascribe such an intent is very slight indeed. For in purporting to set forth the reasoning of the <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>court with respect to the standing problem, 202 F.2d 555 at 560, the majority relies entirely on dictum which occurs in the court\u2019s later analysis of the merits of the successor corporation\u2019s action against the trustee. 202 F.2d at 561. The finding of standing in <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>is not premised at all on this dictum, but rather \u201cof the broad imple-mentary powers of a judge when a plan is confirmed\u201d and specifically on an order of the reorganization court permitting the new corporation to pursue <em>\u201cany </em>objections\u201d (emphasis added) to the indenture trustee\u2019s accounts \u201con its own behalf and on behalf of\u201d the bondholders. There is no basis in the <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>opinion for limiting this language, which clearly would comprehend such an action as Caplin\u2019s, by transposing into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the court\u2019s discussion of standing later dictum intended to bear \u2014 and even then incidentally and by way of speculation and musing \u2014 only on the merits of the new corporation\u2019s action, and not on its right to bring it.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In distinguishing <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>the majority is compelled to rely on dictum in the opinion irrelevant to the question presently before this court. But, we can understand this, for otherwise the majority would be required to show in detail why there should have been standing in <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>under the rationales that it advances to support its decision today. My brothers rightly conclude, and no one has asserted otherwise, that Caplin\u2019s claim against Marine could not \u201cby the remotest stretch of language or even of imagination\u201d be considered an action to \u201ccollect and reduce to money the property of the [estate] for which\u201d Caplin is trustee, citing Section 47 of the Bankruptcy Act. But it requires no lesser feat of linguistic gyration to conclude that the action in <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>was such an action. The action in <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>was one for an accounting for the loss to the bondholders, on behalf of the bondholders alone, that resulted from the indenture trustee\u2019s breach <em>of a </em>negative covenant, as here. It was not in any sense an action for restoration of the trust fund or the debtor\u2019s property (unless Caplin\u2019s action may also be so described). Indeed Judge L. Hand specifically observed that \u201cthe breach was at most a failure properly to protect a part of the <em>res\u201d </em>\u2014 which is precisely the situation here \u2014 \u201cand not a \u2018surrender or release\u2019 \u201d of the res. 202 F.2d at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">This is not the end of the majority\u2019s difficulties with <em>Prudence-Bonds. </em>My brothers go to great lengths to show\u2014 wrongly, I believe \u2014 that \u201cother creditors or stockholders would not be affected\u201d by Caplin\u2019s action in this case. But the reorganization in <em>Prudence-Bonds </em>had already been effected and was not likely to be altered retrospectively. Even had the suit been brought before a plan had been approved, the recovery would have inured to the benefit of no one but the bondholders, as is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">There is <em>a more </em>fundamental answer, however, to the argument that only one class of creditors will be affected if Cap-lin recovers. Although the bondholders\u2019 recovery will swell directly only the purses of the bondholders, the majority ignores the central consideration that certainty as to the bondholders\u2019 rights against the indenture trustee cannot fail to affect the views of the interested parties and the court in passing on the fairness of the reorganization plan. 11 U.S. C. \u00a7 621(2). The majority thus seems to misconstrue the true scope and nature of a reorganization proceeding. The process of reorganizing is not performed merely by a nice, sharp, precise and mathematical apportionment of a debt- or\u2019s estate according to fixed formulas. Rather, the objective is carried out through a process of negotiation, and some give-and-take, in an attempt to adjust equitably and with sensitivity to the nuances of the individual case the rights of competing interested parties. As Judge L. Hand argued persuasively in dissenting from the decision in <em>Clarke, </em>the reorganization court has jurisdiction over a case such as this as part of its obligation to \u201cadjust the mutual rights of the debtor\u2019s creditors as between themselves.\u201d 137 F.2d at 802. I see no reason for denying to the reorganization court, as the majority does, the power to discharge this obligation here or properly to perform its duty to adjudge the equitableness of a proposed reorganization plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">This latter consideration is particularly relevant to this case, where it appears that the indenture trustee may be implicated in the causes for Webb &amp; Knapp\u2019s bankruptcy. As Judge Hand put it, \u201cthe trustee should have prevented the debtor from siphoning its assets away from its creditors \u2014 the bondholders along with the other general creditors. * * * The loss was * * * of the debtor\u2019s assets; the remedy will be in their restoration; I do not under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>stand how that can be alien to a reorganization.\u201d 137 F.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Thus, the parade of horribles which my brothers assert would follow if Cap-lin were allowed to bring this claim\u2014 including virtually the confiscation of property of parties with no semblance of due process \u2014 is a phantasm. We are concerned here only with the standing of a trustee in reorganization to <em>assert </em>the claims of creditors, not to <em>cancel </em>them, where the reorganization trustee asserts that creditors have been damaged along with all other parties to the reorganization by the indenture trustee\u2019s negligent failure to protect the debtor\u2019s assets. It is a very narrow proposition that the majority rejects, not an infinitely expandable one. By rejecting it, the majority retreats from this court\u2019s previously declared commitment to the flexible approach announced in <em>Prudence-Bonds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Moreover, the view of the majority appears significantly narrower than that of the <em>Clarke </em>majority. That court was unwilling to constrict itself to the narrow \u201cproperty\u201d analysis advanced by the majority, but suggested instead that the indenture trustee might have standing if \u201cthe claims for breach of the covenants [were] any part of the property of the bankrupt <em>or </em>would affect the plan of reorganization.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 137 F.2d at 800. Immediately following this sentence, the <em>Clarke </em>court launched upon an extended discussion of the question whether the claim would affect the plan after which it appended, almost as an afterthought, the observation that \u201cMoreover the trustee * * * has no title to the claims embraced in the first and third counts * * Although I believe that the <em>Clarke </em>majority was in error to hold that the claim would not affect the plan, its analysis was considerably broader than that adopted by my brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Finally, the result today ill serves two reforms central to the scheme of the Chandler Act: to promote the collection and dissemination of all information relevant to the debtor and its affairs and to involve the Securities and Exchange Commission in complex reorganization proceedings as an advisor or friend of the court, a role it has assumed as a party to this appeal, in urging us to permit Caplin to pursue his claims. See H. Report No. 1409 on H.R. 8046, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 47-48 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The reorganization trustee is empowered to undertake a comprehensive investigation into the history and financial condition of the debtor by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 567.' To compel the bondholders in these circumstances to proceed individually or in a separate class action, would only give rise to a massive redundancy of fact-finding. To restate the point somewhat more positively, a fair adjudication of the issue between the bondholders and Marine will be promoted if the information available to the trustee is efficiently brought to bear in that dispute and revealed to the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">Scrutiny or active participation by the SEC is provided for by numerous provisions of Chapter X (11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 561, 567(5), 571-574, 590, 608 622). On few issues is that agency\u2019s expertise more relevant than in a ease such as this, involving the adjudication of rights and duties of a trustee functioning under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77aaa et seq. This expertise will be available in a reorganization proceeding but ordinarily not in individual or class action bondholders\u2019 suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">In short, today\u2019s decision not only retreats from past precedent but is contrary to the purposes which motivated Congress to enact the Chandler Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">. Tlie manifest inconvenience of the <em>Clarke </em>rule is magnified in a case where, as here, the indenture trustee filed a claim against the estate of the debtor for his services as trustee. A determination of the merits of Caplin\u2019s plenary action and counterclaim will not require the bankruptcy court to investigate any matters that it would not have to pass upon in adjudicating Caplin\u2019s objection to Marine\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
