The offense charged arose from the possession of a firearm (\u201csawed-off\u201d shotgun), as defined by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5848, alleged to have been made in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5821, such possession being violative of \u00a7 5851 of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-23\">In appealing his conviction, Goodson has raised five points of error \u2014 (1) insufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction; (2) error by the trial court in instructing the jury; (3) admission into evidence of two shotgun shells seized in contravention of Good-son\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights; (4) violation of appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination; and (5) the punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>imposed was cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Because we have concluded on the facts of this case that appellant\u2019s first point of error requires reversal of his conviction we pretermit discussion of the remaining points of error assigned on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Upon appellant's trial in the court below, the government introduced through accomplice witness testimony evidence of the defendant\u2019s possession of the weapon at the time and place alleged in the indictment and that the weapon was a \u201cfirearm\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 5848(1) of the Act, note 1, <em>supra. </em>The government introduced into evidence as well a report from the custodian of the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, which indicated that no person had registered possession of the described weapon [20 gauge Winchester-Western (Canada) shotgun], nor had any person acquired the firearm by importation, transfer or making, nor had anyone paid a transfer or making tax with respect to the transfer or making of the subject firearm. It was upon this evidentiary base that the government\u2019s case was submitted to the jury which returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Although challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on the issue of possession, the primary thrust of appellant\u2019s argument focuses upon the government\u2019s failure to prove that the firearm in question was made [manufactured, put together or altered] <em>\u201cin the United States\" </em>\u2014 a condition prerequisite to liability for payment of the making tax and filing of the declaration of intent to make, \u00a7 5821, note 1, <em>supra, </em>and, <em>a for-tiori, </em>a violation of \u00a7 5851 under the indictment as laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">While the government candidly admits that there was no proof that the firearm in question was made \u201cin the United States\u201d, it contends that proof of that fact is not required to secure a conviction under \u00a7 5851, or, alternatively, that the evidentiary presumption contained in \u00a7 5851 operates to cast upon the defendant the burden of proving that the firearm was <em>not made </em>\u201cin the United States.\u201d The reasoning of the government is predicated upon the fact that the shotgun was originally manufactured in Canada and, so the government\u2019s theory goes, the possible \u201cmade in Canada\u201d is an affirmative defense which the government is not required to negate. We find the government\u2019s contention on both points to be untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">We note initially that mere possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 5848 is not per se unlawful \u2014 only when that possession is conjoined with the failure of the possessor or another to comply with one or more of the enumerated regulatory sections does a violation of \u00a7 5851 occur. As the Tenth Circuit noted in Waters v. United States, 328 F.2d 739 (10th Cir. 1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-10\">\u201cSection 5848(1) describes the physical characteristics of the firearms to which the provisions of \u00a7 5851 are applicable. But, the enumerated sections in \u00a7 5851 describe the illegal attributes of firearms, the possession of which is condemned by \u00a7 5851. This section, i.e., \u00a7 5851, then provides that proof of possession of \u2018such firearms * * * shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction * * The phrase \u2018such firearm\u2019 has reference not only to a firearm defined in \u00a7 5848(1), but also to a firearm which is illegally possessed for non-compliance with one of the enumerated regulatory sections, viz., a firearm \u2018which has at any time been made in violation of section 5821,\u2019 or \u2018which has not been registered as required by section 5841.\u2019 <em>It is therefore, incumbent upon the Government to prove, not only possession of a firearm defined in </em>\u00a7 <em>5848 (1), but that the firearm is one illegally possessed, for failure to comply with one of the enumerated regulatory sections.\u201d </em>328 F.2d at 742 (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">We likewise reject the government\u2019s argument that the last sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>of \u00a7 5851, note 1 <em>supra, </em>commonly referred to as a presumption, relieves the government of proving that the firearm was altered in the United States or, at a minimum, shifts the burden to the defendant to show that the firearm was <em>not </em>made or altered in the United States. The burden is upon the government to prove each and every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Collier, 381 F.2d 616 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1043, 88 S.Ct. 1639, 20 L.Ed.2d 304 (1968); Bryan v. United States, 373 F.2d 403 (5th Cir. 1967). Moreover, as the indictment is drawn, violation of \u00a7 5821 is an \u201cindispensable ingredient\u201d of the crime defined and charged in \u00a7 5851. United States v. Casson, 288 F.Supp. 86 (D.Del.1968). While it is true that the government is not required to adduce positive evidence to support a negative averment in the indictment, Rossi v. United States, 289 U.S. 89, 53 S.Ct. 532, 77 L.Ed. 1051 (1933), that is not a creature of the law with which we are here concerned, notwithstanding the government\u2019s alchemistic attempts at transmutation. What we here deal with is a positive and affirmative fact [a making in the United States] absent which \u00a7 5821 has no applicability and \u00a7 5851 is without foundational support. The simple answer to the government\u2019s contention is that if the firearm was not \u201cmade\u201d in the United States, non-compliance with the making tax and declaration provisions of \u00a7 5821 has no operative legal effect. The presumption contained in \u00a7 5851 is unavailing to the government in this regard, for as a rule of evidence it does not come into play until possession is shown of a firearm \u201cmade\u201d in contravention of \u00a7 5821. See, e. g., Sipes v. United States, 321 F.2d 174 (8th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 913, 84 S.Ct. 208, 11 L.Ed.2d 150. The presumption of \u00a7 5851, as other statutory presumptions, does no more than accord to the government\u2019s evidence its natural probative force and effect. United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. 63, 85 S.Ct. 754, 13 L.Ed.2d 658 (1965). The cases cited by the government in support of its argument are inapposite to our consideration of the issue before us, i.e., the validity of a conviction wherein an essential affirmative act is neither proven nor admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The fact of a \u201cmaking in the United States\u201d like any other fact, is provable by direct or circumstantial evidence and the permissible inferences drawn therefrom. This the government failed to do and such omission is fatal to its ease. To hold to the contrary would require the defendant to prove a negative [not made in the United States] \u2014 a burden the government has recoiled from and one which we do not here readily impart to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Ordinarily on this state of the facts we would remand to the court below for a new trial. However, the record reveals it is doubtful that the government can supply the defect in the evidence upon a remand. That being the case and in view of the fact that the defendant did not ask for a new trial in the court below, Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal \u00a7 470 (1969), the judgment of conviction is reversed and the case remanded with directions to enter judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">.
