Cor-relatively, appellant asserts that failure to execute the warrant deprived the sentencing court of running the remainder of one sentence concurrent with a new sentence if the court so desired. Appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-26\">In 1964 Fitts was sentenced to a four-year term to run concurrent with a previous sentence. On April 18, 1967 he was mandatorily released with 465 days statutory and extra good time deductions. On June 5, 1967 a mandatory release violator\u2019s warrant was issued by the United States Board of Parole. On November 22, 1967 Fitts was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>in Texas of a Dyer Act violation and sentenced to five years. Thereafter, on January 17, 1968, the violator\u2019s warrant was returned unexecuted and remains so.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"> The issued warrant was not required to be executed immediately upon issuance; it was not self-executing when appellant was not taken into custody thereunder; it need not be executed prior to the end of the sentence imposed on conviction of the crime committed on parole; and the withholding of the warrant did not deprive appellant of any reduction of sentence or consideration thereof to which he is by law entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Appellant presents no argument grounded in law which would compel us to reconsider our position, firmly established, in cases like that now before us. <em>See </em>Nash v. Moseley, 10 Cir., 433 F.2d 923, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
