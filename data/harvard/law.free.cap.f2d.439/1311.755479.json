There is one area, however, where we have never seen eye to eye: the test for determining wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>er a discharge for established misconduct was in fact an unfair labor practice. Having in mind that a business decision is involv\u00e9d, it has been our position that the Board has the burden of making a clear showing that the employer\u2019s dominant motive was not a proper business one, but union animus. In spite of constant reiteration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> neither our eases, nor even our statement of the principle, appear in trial examiners\u2019 discussions or Board opinions. This failure shows itself in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The facts in the present case require a considerable exposition. In the fall of 1968 an open attempt was made by a union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to organize the Guayama, Puerto Rico, plant of Fibers International Corporation. The names of three employees, of which one Rub\u00e9n de Jes\u00fas was listed second, appeared regularly on union leaflets. On January 23, 1969, a different type of leaflet was circulated endorsing the union, purportedly signed by some 95 employees. A number of these employees were disturbed by the use of their names. They asserted they had not authorized such circularization, and feared that it would cause them difficulties with the company. Ibzan Ortiz, a supervisor in de Jes\u00fas\u2019 department, assured the employees that there would be no reprisals. The company was engaged in collecting evidence to contest the union\u2019s conduct of the election, and Ortiz also announced that any employee wishing to make a written statement that he had not authorized the leaflet could do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the employees who signed such a disclaimer was Luis Cruz. We proceed with four paragraphs from the examiner\u2019s report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-14\">\u201cAround 4:30 on the afternoon of Tuesday, January 28 as the maintenance electricians who had just gotten off work were entering the company parking lot from the plant, De Jesus confronted Cruz about his giving the statement to the company. De Jesus started the conversation by taking hold of Cruz\u2019 right arm and asking him if he had made a statement for the company The two then got into an argument and de Jesus became somewhat vehement. According to him he accused Cruz of \u2018not telling the truth,\u2019 and made remarks impugning Cruz\u2019 manhood. According to Cruz, whom I credit, the argument continued as he got into his car at which point de Jesus took hold of his left arm. Two co-workers who rode with Cruz, Miguel Rivera and Carlos A. Colon, both corroborated his testimony that De Jesus used obscene language, calling him a homosexual and lacking sufficient manhood to stand behind what he had done. Both Cruz and Rivera testified that the last thing de Jesus said to Cruz was that they would see each other. [Footnote omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-15\">\u201cDe Jesus did not hurt Cruz when he took hold of his arm. But Cruz who on the stand appeared to be a timid man, was frightened. He took de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>Jesus\u2019 closing remarks as an assertion that in the future De Jesus would catch him outside the plant and do him harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">\u201cDe Jesus denied telling Cruz he was a homosexual or grabbing him by the arm or telling him he would take care of him later. In view of the other evidence relating to these matters I do not credit de Jesus\u2019 denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">\u201cAt the end of the argument de Jesus got into a car driven by fellow employee [Gazhound] Soto. As Cruz was driving out of the parking lot Soto\u2019s car blocked the way. It is not clear from the evidence what caused this. Soto denied that it was intentional. But Cruz in his frightened state of mind thought it was intentional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">The testimony before the examiner was even more colorful. Cruz and three others filed a written report on the incident with the company. When de Jes\u00fas was called to the office the day following Cruz\u2019 complaint and asked about it, he denied the event occurred. He stated, \u201cI had a high concept of honor and * * * I did not speak badly to any human being, much less to a co-worker.\u201d A Mr. Gray thereupon discharged him. The following day de Jes\u00fas filed an unfair labor practice charge and gave a written report to the Board. He said nothing about the Cruz incident, although it had been the only subject mentioned at the discharge. On February 17 he gave the Board a second statement; on February 19 two more. In none did he mention the incident. Finally, on March 13, the Board representative, having learned of the Cruz matter, asked de Jes\u00fas about it. He testified, \u201c[T]hen I remembered that we had had a few words and I told them to the investigator, Mr. Sykora, in case it had any connection or could help in any way.\u201d This desire to \u201chelp in any way\u201d had not caused the matter to occur to him before, he explained, \u201cbecause that was not too important and besides there was nothing there that could be cata-logued as an offense or as an agression so that somebody would complain and they would suspend me from my work.\u201d \u201c[I]f Sykora had not touched that point during the investigation it would never have occurred to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">Of course, as de Jes\u00fas knew, every part of this explanation, like his original denial, was totally untrue. In addition to what we have already recited, we note that he admitted on cross-examination that within a few days after his discharge he sought three witnesses to the parking lot occurrence, told them that this was why he was discharged, and asked them to give the Board absolving statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">The trial examiner\u2019s reasons for his conclusion that the discharge of de Jes\u00fas was improperly motivated, even though he was guilty of misconduct,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> meriting \u201csome kind of disciplinary action,\u201d were several. First, the examiner found that he was \u201cthe outstanding union activist, [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] * * * which requires close scrutiny of the employer\u2019s motivation.\u201d Second, he noted that \u201c[t]here is some evidence although not a great deal, of company union animus.\u201d We agree it was not a great deal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, the report cites \u201cthe one-sided investigation of the parking lot incident. No effort was made to obtain de Jes\u00fas side of the story prior to his discharge. When on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>afternoon of January 29 he was called into supervisor Gray\u2019s office and accused of improper conduct in the parking lot, he denied acting improperly and sought to learn who his accusers were. Instead of getting his side of the story, Gray fired him on the spot.\u201d We do not know what the examiner means by \u201cno effort\u201d to get de Jes\u00fas\u2019 \u201cside of the story.\u201d It had his total denial. The investigation was \u201cone-sided\u201d because the four other witnesses disagreed with him. Two pages later, the examiner states his fourth reason, the \u201cconclusion [of improper motive] is supported by the testimony of industrial relations supervisor Guerrero who made it clear that they carefully considered the case of de Jes\u00fas in order to make sure they had enough on him [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] to fire him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">The Board\u2019s brief says that this \u201cis a classic \u2018pretext\u2019 case.\u201d The fact is, it is more a classic Board rationalization case. We are accustomed to the Board concluding that the employer must have been improperly motivated because it acted too slowly. <em>E. g., </em>N.L.R.B. v. Billen Shoe Co., n. 1, ante, at 803; N.L.R.B. v. Agawam Food Mart, n. 1, ante; <em>cf. </em>Board of Publication of Methodist Church v. N.L.R.B., 6 Cir., 1962, 297 F.2d 379, 380. In the case at bar it has achieved the millenium. Here the company is condemned for its haste. In the next breath it is criticized for its care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">Finally, the examiner reviewed seven of the company\u2019s prior disciplinary proceedings, five of which resulted in discharges. He concluded that all seven, including the two that did not result in discharges, were \u201cmore serious,\u201d and that nothing was called for here but \u201csome modest disciplinary action.\u201d We cannot agree with the comparison, or with the conclusion. The examiner describes Cruz as a \u201ctimid\u201d man, and found that de Jes\u00fas promise to catch him outside the plant frightened him, and reasonably caused him to fear future bodily harm. This was not a \u201cmodest\u201d affair, or less serious than, for example, the instance of horseplay between friends, even though a knife was flashed. Nor was it an ordinary dispute. Considering how seriously the Board regards company misconduct that might be designed to influence employees to reject the union, we may fairly expect the Board to take equally seriously employee misconduct aimed in the other direction. In any event, an employer has a right to do so. Corriveau &amp; Routhier Cement Block, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 1 Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 347, 350. Furthermore, as we had occasion to point out in <em>Billen Shoe, </em>n. 1, ante, no wise employer can afford to countenance deliberate misconduct by a union leader. This must particularly be so when a union leader asserts himself by chastizing an employee for giving the company a statement. That an employer lawfully engaged in seeking evidence of improper union conduct should have to tolerate as modest physical threats by coemployees to its witnesses seems inconceivable. The examiner\u2019s comparison of this matter with a previous disciplinary case involving an altercation over the quality of the soup shows singular lack of acumen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">We would consider it a gross miscarriage for the company to be saddled by Board action with this ill-behaved, not to mention perjurious, employee. If the Board wanted to overlook de Jes\u00fas obvious misconduct vis-a-vis itself, that was its affair. The company was not obliged to be as forgiving. No evidence warrants a finding that the company\u2019s decision, although no doubt pleasing to it, <em>cf. </em>N.L.R.B. v. Lowell Sun Pub. Co., 1 <em>Cir., </em>1963, 320 F.2d 835, 842; N.L.R.B. v. Birmingham Pub. Co., 5 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 2, 9, was not motivated by proper business considerations. The section 8(a) (3) order requiring reinstatement and back pay must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-11\">The Board\u2019s other finding is based on a barely warranted analysis of conflicting testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We accept it as justify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>ing an 8(a) (1) order, without intimating that it would have been enough to vitiate an election, had the union lost, which it did not. The 8(a) (1) order will be enforced. Respondent\u2019s argument was limited to the 8(a) (3) order, however, and costs will be charged against the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>N.L.R.B. v. Agawam Food Mart, Inc., 1 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 1045, 1047, and cases cited; N.L.R.B. v. Gotham Industries, Inc., 1 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1306, 1309 n. 5; N.L.R.B. v. Billen Shoe Co., 1 Cir., 1968, 397 F.2d 801, 803, and cases cited. No purpose would be served by collecting cases from other jurisdictions ; we are aware of no substantial conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">So that there may be no misunderstanding about what we mean by dominant motive, we state it again. Regardless of the fact that enforcing the penalty may have given the employer satisfaction because of the employee\u2019s union activities, the burden is on the Board to establish that the penalty would not have been imposed, or would have been milder, if the employee\u2019s union activity, or a union animus, bad not existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1366-17\">.

A Board witness testified that Ortiz offered \u201csome considerations\u201d in return for such statements, but Ortiz denied this and the examiner credited Ortiz.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1366-19\">. Except in a matter not relevant to this issue, the examiner\u2019s report was adopted by the Board. The Board\u2019s opinion is reported at 181 N.L.R.B. No. 93 (March 19, 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">. The examiner concluded, \u201c[I]t is fair to say that he spoke to Cruz in angry abusive terms. Moreover, in view of his ill-tempered language emphasized by twice taking hold of Cruz\u2019 arm, his parting words indicating that they would see each other in the future was, in context, reasonably construed as a threat of future bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1367-13\">.

The prime difficulty appears to be that the Board considers the word \u201cdominant\u201d to impose an undue burden upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">To dominate means to control. The \u201cdominant\u201d motive is the controlling or effective motive. We use this particular word because of its insistent quality, to remind the Board that its burden is to find that the improper motive was the one that in fact brought about the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">In support of its petition the Board cites some fifteen cases, listing them by circuit. While none states that the improper motive must be \u201cdominant,\u201d we consider the language of several to be indistinguishable. NLRB v. Milco, Inc., 2 Cir., 1968, 388 F.2d 133, 138 (\u201cthe true reason\u201d); Hugh H. Wilson Corp. v. NLRB, 3 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 1345, 1352, cert. denied, 397 U.S. 935, 90 S.Ct. 943, 25 L.Ed.2d 115 (\u201cthe \u2018real\u2019 stimulus\u201d); NLRB v. Buitoni Foods Corp., 3 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 169, 174 (\u201cin fact motivated\u201d); NLRB v. Central Power &amp; Light Co., 5 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 1318, 1322 (\u201cactually <em>motivated\u201d); </em>NLRB v. Stemun Mfg. Co., 6 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 737, 741 (\u201cthe actual impelling motive\u201d). It is true that the Board cites cases using general phrases indicating that a \u201cpartial\u201d motive that is improper is enough. Some of these, however, proceed, in discussing the evidence, to apply a standard not significantly different from ours. <em>E. g., </em>NLRB v. Princeton Inn Co., 3 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 264; S. A. Healy Co. v. NLRB, 10 Cir., 1970, 435 F.2d 314. No case cited by the Board articulates a lesser requirement for finding a discharge to be an unfair labor practice. Even NLRB v. Whitfield Pickle Co., 5 Cir., 1967, 374 F.2d 576, on which the Board particularly relies, after saying that the \u201canti-union motive need not be dominant,\u201d goes on to say that the Board must show \u201cthat the employee would not have been fired but for the anti-union animus of the employer.\u201d 374 F.2d at 582. The only opinions not expressing that standard express none at all. We decline to delete the word \u201cdominant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">With regard to our use of the word \u201cclear\u201d we do not mean, as the Board fears, that its burden of proof on this issue is any greater than it is on any other. However, our experience has been that from time to time the Board not only forgets that \u201cpartially motivated\u201d means effectively motivated, but forgets that an aura of even strong union animus is not sufficient in itself, once an adequate and proper business reason has been established. While of course an employer who has good cause to apply a particular sanction may in fact do so for an impermissible reason, in such circumstances the Board must have an affirmative basis for believing that the employer rejected the good reason and chose the bad. It is not enough, as in the case at bar, to ignore or denigrate the business reason, or to substitute speculation in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">The petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
