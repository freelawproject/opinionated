Although the primary suit here is a school desegregation case, this peripheral case is not racial, both the hired and the unhired being black citizens. The sole question is whether the school board discriminated against him because of his wife\u2019s civil rights activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">A review of the record indicates that his application was considered. Another was chosen. There was no proof requiring the trial court to hold that any civil right of Linder Burt\u2019s was violated and the court did not abuse its discretion in denying interim injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
