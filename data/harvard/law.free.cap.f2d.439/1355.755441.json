S. Chatham, a vessel anchored in the harbor of Nha Trang, South Vietnam, Karl Von Rodenstein was severely beaten and narrowly averted being thrown overboard. A jury found appellants Ross and Wynn to have been the perpetrators of these vicious acts and pronounced them guilty of assault with intent to commit murder, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a). We are satisfied there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. For this reason and because resolution of this appeal does not require a factual analysis of the crime, we deem it unnecessary to recite the gruesome details of the brutal beating inflicted on Von Rodenstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-22\">Appellants contend they were denied due process of law and the right to a speedy trial because by the time the indictment was returned some eleven months after the commission of the offense, the one witness who could have planted the seed of doubt as to Von Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>denstein\u2019s veracity (and thus persuaded the jury to discount Von Rodenstein\u2019s testimony that appellants initiated the assault in his cabin) had been lost at sea one month earlier. According to the appellants, the death of the Chatham\u2019s master, Harry Pearce, denied them the opportunity to demonstrate that Von Roden-stein was a disruptive influence and thus many of his shipmates \u201chad reason to assault him\u201d. In the view of the appellants, \u201cthe indictment should have been dismissed, or a judgment of acquittal should have been granted\u201d, because of the \u201cobvious prejudice\u201d resulting from the \u201cunjustified delay\u201d in the indictment\u2019s return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">The assertion that the death of Pearce prior to the return of the grand jury indictment denied appellants the opportunity to raise the \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that other crew members had sufficient motivation to assault Von Rodenstein is patently absurd. Although appellants claim on appeal that Von Rodenstein was a source of perpetual irritation to his shipmates, at the trial they chose not to call even one member of the crew who might corroborate this allegation. Instead, appellants limited their proof to the following letter written by Pearce to the Provost Marshal at Nha Trang, which was introduced into evidence over the vociferous objection of the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-6\">\u201cRespectively request that Ex-Acting First Assistant Engineer Karl Von Rodenstein, be held in custody, until this ship sails, and/or action by the United States Consul.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-7\">\u201cThis man has consistently used profane and abusive language toward his superior officers and his subordinates. He has also threatened the Master with bodily harm. He performs no duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-8\">\u201cIn view of these circumstances, it is imperative that this man be removed from this vessel, for the vessel\u2019s continued safe operation and for his own personal protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-9\">\u201cFurthermore, request that this man be given a complete physical and if possible, mental examination, as to his competence to perform his duties. At present he has an unfit for duty slip, issued by a Doctor in Honolulu. He has flatly refused a medical examination in the port of Cam Ranh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-10\">\u201cThis man is a disruptive and mutinous influence aboard this ship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-11\">Since the jury was exposed to Pearce\u2019s impressions of Von Rodenstein, it is difficult for us to fathom how his death prior to the return of the indictment truly prejudiced the appellant\u2019s defense. It appears the death of Captain Pearce has been used as a convenient prop to a claim of prejudice. See United States v. Halley, 431 F.2d 1180, 1182, (9th Cir. 1970) where this court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that he had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial because of a seventeen month interval between the time he became a suspect and the time the grand jury indictment was returned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1411-12\">\u201c * * * The charge was filed well within the statute of limitations. Halley does not show how he was prejudiced by this delay, nor does he show that the delay was due to oppressive or culpable Government conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\">See also, Kroll v. United States, 433 F.2d 1282 (5th Cir. 1970); Fleming v. United States, 378 F.2d 502 (1st Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-15\">The offense for which appellants were found guilty of having committed occurred aboard the vessel \u201cChatham\u201d, which was anchored in the harbor of Nha Trang, South Vietnam. In its anchored state the \u201cChatham\u201d was approximately ten to fifteen minutes from shore by way of motor launch. These facts satisfy us that at the time of the offense\u2019s commission, the \u201cChatham\u201d was on the \u201chigh seas\u201d. United States v. Flores, 289 U.S. 137, 53 S.Ct. 580, 77 L.Ed. 1086 (1933); United States v. Rodgers, 150 U.S. 249, 14 S.Ct. 109, 37 L.Ed. 1071 (1893); Nixon v. United States, 352 F.2d 601 (5th Cir. 1965). Accordingly, the only serious question as to this case being within the special maritime jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>of the United States<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is whether the \u201cChatham\u201d was a registered vessel of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">At the trial, Frank Oda, Chief of Marine Documents, United States Coast Guard, produced a volume entitled <em>Merchant Vessels of the United States. </em>According to Oda, this book, which is published by the Coast Guard, is \u201ca compilation of all the vessels documented and owned by citizens or corporations of the United States\u201d. Oda testified that the \u201cS. S. Chatham\u201d was listed in this official government publication. Oda also testified that \u201cin order to be registered as a vessel of the United States, eighty five percent of the stockholders must be citizens of the United States. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"akb-dedup-2\">Further proof of United States registry was established by the testimony of George Kohl, the \u201cChatham\u2019s\u201d third assistant engineer. According to Kohl, the \u201cChatham\u201d flew the American flag as it carried its shipload of rice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">Establishment of the \u201cChatham\u2019s\u201d registry by way of the testimony of Oda and Kohl closely parallels the situation in St. Clair v. United States, 154 U.S. 134, 14 S.Ct. 1002, 38 L.Ed. 936 (1894). There, a certificate of registry and evidence that the vessel \u201cHesper\u201d \u201ccarried the American flag\u201d was deemed sufficient to make out \u201ca <em>prima facie </em>case of proper registry under the laws of the United States, and of the nationality of the vessel and its owners.\u201d 154 U.S. at 151, 14 S.Ct. at 1009. Here, the nature of the official government publication coupled with the corroborating evidence concerning the American flag satisfy us that the requirement to bring this case within the \u201cspecial maritime jurisdiction of the United States\u201d have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-8\"> As an adjunct to their jurisdiction claim, appellants also urge that venue did not lay in the Northern District of California. We find this portion of appellants\u2019 attack totally free of legal and factual realities. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3238 provides that an offense committed on the high seas may be prosecuted in a district where \u201cany one of two or more joint offenders, is arrested or is first brought; but if * * * not so arrested or brought * * * an indictment or information may be filed in the district of the last known residence of * * * any one of two or more joint offenders * * Here, it is clear that appellants were not \u201cfirst brought\u201d to Hawaii as claimed by appellants. Appellant Ross testified that their civilian flight from Vietnam to Hawaii was absent any form of on board restraint. See, United States v. Provoo, 215 F.2d 531 (2d Cir. 1954); Chandler v. United States, 171 F.2d 921 (1st Cir. 1948), cert. den. 336 U.S. 918, 69 S.Ct. 640, 93 L.Ed. 1081 (1949); Kerr v. Shine, 136 F. 61 (9th Cir. 1905). Upon alighting in San Francisco from their unrestrained commercial flight from Hawaii, appellants were subpoenaed to appear before a Coast Guard hearing called to review their licenses in light of the events which had occurred aboard the \u201cChatham\u201d. During the course of these hearings, the grand jury\u2019s indictment was returned and Ross was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">The City of San Francisco was certainly familiar to appellant Ross. He admitted that he had lived there \u201coff and on for years\u201d and that he \u201chad sailed out of\u201d that city \u201cfor a good many years\u201d. Despite these admissions, Ross maintained that San Francisco was not the situs of his \u201cofficial residence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>It can be readily seen that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3238 have met with compliance. One of the appellants was arrested in the district where the trial was conducted. The testimony of that appellant indicated that he was a resident of the district. The \u201coff and on\u201d nature of this residence is perfectly consistent with his sailing vocation. It is somewhat significant that appellant Ross was unable to name his true \u201cofficial residence\u201d while he maintained that it was not San Francisco. In sum, we find nothing in the record which indicates that venue was not proper in the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">Finally, we have reviewed the record aware of appellants\u2019 contention that the trial court improperly limited the scope of their cross examination, thus denying them their Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We are satisfied that no such right was denied to appellants by the lower court. For this reason and those previously stated, the appellants\u2019 convictions are</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe term, \u2018special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\u2019, as used in this title, includes :</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-7\">\u201c(1) The high seas, any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, and any vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen thereof, or to any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, when such vessel is within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
