We grant the application for certificate of probable cause and leave to appeal IFP, and summarily vacate and remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-27\">Haggard filed his federal habeas petition in the district court on July 13, 1970, and thereafter that court ordered that the State of Alabama show cause why relief should not be granted. In response thereto the Attorney General of Alabama filed an answer on September 1, 1970, stating that Haggard had failed to exhaust his available state remedies because he had an appeal then pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>in the Court of Criminal Appeals of the State of Alabama from the February 6, 1970 dismissal of his petition for error coram nobis relief by the Circuit Court of Bibb County, Alabama. The district court denied Haggard\u2019s federal habeas petition on the basis of the State\u2019s response, holding that the petition was premature in view of his pending state eoram nobis appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In considering the issue of exhaustion, it has come to this court\u2019s attention that the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of coram nobis relief on June 23, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Since petitioner\u2019s application for federal habeas corpus relief was filed subsequent to June 23, 1970, it is clear that requisite exhaustion of state remedies has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The order of the district court is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-17\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, Rule 22(b), F.R.A.P.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-29\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
