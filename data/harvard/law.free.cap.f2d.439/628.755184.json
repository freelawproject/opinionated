S.C. \u00a7 1952 and 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1501, 1502, and 1503, all of which prohibit the operation of co-called \u201cnumbers games\u201d. His conviction followed the denial of a motion to suppress certain evidence seized from the apartment of one Russ J. Cecchini by an F.B.I. agent possessing a search warrant issued by a United States magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The issue on appeal is a narrow one; we must determine whether the trial court was correct in finding that the affidavit in support of the search warrant was sufficient to constitute probable cause for the search and seizure. The affidavit in question is reproduced in an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">In Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 111, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), the court emphasized the deference that reviewing courts should accord to determinations of probable cause made by magistrates in issuing search warrants. In addition, it was stated in United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965), that \u201cIf the teachings of the Court\u2019s cases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search warrants * * * must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion.\u201d See also Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), and United States ex rel. Gary v. Follette, 418 F.2d 609, 611 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Nonetheless, there are certain basic standards for the content of affidavits in support of search warrants which must be met. In the absence of the minimum required information, no valid basis exists upon which a finding of probable cause can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">In Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 1514, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), the court weighed the sufficiency of an affidavit that was offered in support of a search warrant and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ams-dedup-0\">\u201c[The] magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, and some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant * * * was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), is remarkably analogous to the case at bar. The court summarized the affidavit in <em>Spinelli </em>as follows (p. 413, 89 S.Ct. pp. 587-588):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-17\">\u201c1. The FBI had kept track of Spinelli\u2019s movements on five days during the month of August 1965. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>four of these occasions, Spinelli was seen crossing one of two bridges leading from Illinois into St. Louis, Missouri, between 11 a.m. and 12:15 p. m. On four of the five days, Spinelli was also seen parking his ear in a lot used by residents of an apartment house at 1108 Indian Circle Drive in St. Louis, between 3:30 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. On one day, Spinelli was followed further and seen to enter a particular apartment in the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\u201c2. An FBI check with the telephone company revealed that this apartment contained two telephones listed under the name of Grace P. Ha-gen, and carrying the numbers WY-down 4-0029 and WYdown 4-0136.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201c3. The application stated that \u2018William Spinelli is known to this af-fiant and to federal law enforcement agents as a bookmaker, an associate of bookmakers, a gambler, and an associate of gamblers.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201c4. Finally, it was stated that the FBI \u2018has been informed by a confidential reliable informant that William Spinelli is operating a handbook and accepting wagers and disseminating wagering information by means of the telephones which have been assigned the number WYdown 4-0029 and WYdown 4-0136.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In holding the affidavit insufficient to support a finding of probable cause, the court in <em>Spinelli </em>reaffirmed the standards outlined in <em>Aguilar. </em>In addition, however, the court stated that when an affidavit fails to specify how an informant came by his information</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aot\">\u201c* * * it is especially important that the tip describe the accused\u2019s criminal activity in sufficient detail that the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation.\u201d (p. 416, 89 S.Ct. p. 589).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">See Von Utter v. Tulloch, 426 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1970). In our opinion, the affidavit fails to provide the necessary detail to support a finding of probable cause. In terms of <em>Aguilar, </em>it fails to assert the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d upon which the informants based their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">The government attempts to distinguish <em>Spinelli </em>on the basis that in the present action the affidavit stated that the informants\u2019 tip was based on the informants\u2019 \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the appellant\u2019s activities. This is only a conclusion, however, and, standing alone, it does not cure the lack of specificity inherent in the affidavit. There is no indication of the source of the informants\u2019 \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d, nor are their tips sufficiently detailed to allow a magistrate to \u201cinfer that the informant [s] had gained [their] information in a reliable way.\u201d <em>Spinelli, </em>393 U.S. at 417, 89 S.Ct. at 589. See Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959). Furthermore, the fact that information was given by <em>two </em>informants adds nothing of substance to the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Considerable detail is presented in the affidavit regarding the F.B.I.\u2019s observations of the appellant\u2019s comings and goings during the period of August 15, 1969 to September 10, 1969. While some specificity is provided as to the times the observations were made on the days in question, the conduct of the appellant that was observed and reported by the F.B.I. are entirely innocent acts that might be performed by any citizen going about his normal activities. It is averred that on two occasions the appellant looked about, as if to see \u201cif he was being watched\u201d; this is entirely conclusory and insufficient to support a probability that appellant was engaged in some sort of illegal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">In sum, the affidavit presents an assertion that two unamed informants had personal knowledge that the appellant was engaged in a numbers operation in Russ Cecchini\u2019s apartment together with a statement of the results of the observations of appellant\u2019s movements when entering and leaving the apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ment. In our opinion, even if there is no dispute as to the informants\u2019 reliability, there is an absence of any corroborative facts, either from the informants or the FBI, sufficient to subject the appellant to a lawful search. The minimum standards of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>simply have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Affidavit in support of an application for a United States Magistrate\u2019s arrest warrant for violation of Title 18, Section 1952, United States Code; and Title 22, Sections 1501 and 1502, District of Columbia Code for Lynwood \u201cShorty\u201d Long; and in support of a United States Magistrate\u2019s search warrant for the premise located at Apartment Number 1604, 2338 24th Street, S.E., Washington, D.C., which apartment bears the name of R. J. Cecchini on the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">\n<em>Statement of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Information was received on February 3, 1966, from a confidential informant that he had personal knowledge that a bookmaking office was being operated from an apartment located at 1700 Irving Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

C. to Prince Georges County, Maryland, was subsequently verified by investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Information was received on August 6, 1969, from this same confidential informant that he has personal knowledge that Lynwood \u201cShorty\u201d Long, who resides in nearby Maryland, is now conducting a numbers operation at the residence of Russ Cecchini in Washington, D.C. strictly by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">The above confidential informant is well acquainted with gambling activities in the Washington, D.C. area and on numerous occasions in the past has furnished information that has been verified as correct either through independent sources or Federal Bureau of Investigation observations or has resulted in arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">Another confidential informant advised on September 9, 1969, he has personal knowledge that Lynwood \u201cShorty\u201d Long has worked in numbers offices in the local area for many years and is currently working in a numbers office, location unknown. This latter confidential informant is also well acquainted with gambling activities in the Washington, D.C. area and has furnished information on numerous occasions in the past that was either verified as correct through independent sources or Federal Bureau of Investigation observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">According to the records of the Metropolitan Police Department, Russell Joseph Cecchini, 2338 24th Street, S.E., Washington, D.C., was arrested on September 17, 1968, on charges of operating a lottery, maintaining a gambling premise, and possession of numbers slips.
