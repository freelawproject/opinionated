After a hearing, recovery was denied. No effort was made to set aside this award; rather, plaintiff instituted suit in a New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>court against C.B.S. in which he sought substantially the same relief. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York where Judge Tyler, ruling that the arbitration award was res judicata, granted summary judgment for C.B.S. No appeal was taken from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Plaintiff then commenced the present action against the unions charging that they breached their duty to fairly represent him in connection with the C.B.S. arbitration. Judge Motley dismissed the complaint on the grounds that plaintiff was bound, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, by Judge Tyler\u2019s decision that the arbitration was binding and hence plaintiff\u2019s claim against C.B.S. had been foreclosed. Now, by appealing from Judge Motley\u2019s dismissal of the complaint before us, he seeks to relitigate, by a charge of breach of fiduciary relationship, the very issue of the validity of the award, which Judge Tyler has decided adversely against him. Since we believe that plaintiff\u2019s present claim is barred by Judge Tyler\u2019s decision, which Allessan-drini failed to appeal, we need not intimate any views on the further reasons given by Judge Motley for dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-18\"> Plaintiff\u2019s union contract provided that a band leader would receive a salary 75 per cent greater than that of a sideman if the band consisted of six or more men including the leader; otherwise he would receive the same as a sideman. Aless was paid as a sideman. When production of the show switched from live performance to taped, plaintiff was dismissed. He claimed that as Sterling, the show\u2019s star, played the drums during every performance the band actually consisted of six men.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
