Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. Central of Georgia Ry., 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 320, 321. We need not here repeat the historical narrative which others have already published. E g., Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen v. Akron &amp; Barberton Belt R. R., 1967, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 385 F.2d 581, 588-592, cert. denied, 1968, 390 U.S. 923, 88 S.Ct. 851, 856, 19 L.Ed.2d 983. Instead, we shall confine our explication to events comprising the factual context of this particular controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On November 15, 1965, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and En-ginem'en served upon the Atlanta and West Point Railroad and the Western Railway of Alabama three section 6 notices <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> proposing changes in the existing collective bargaining agreement. The present controversy is concerned primarily with Notice No. 3, which pertained to establishment of an apprentice-engineer training program for firemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">Responding to the Union\u2019s proposals, the railroads scheduled a conference. During this and subsequent meetings, they contended that the Union\u2019s requests were \u201cpremature, unlawful, and non-bargainable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Later, however, management expressed willingness to begin preliminary discussions but, viewing all notices served on November 15, as constituting a single section 6 notice, insisted on concurrent consideration of the railroads\u2019 counterproposal of January 1966.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Union rejected this invita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tion since it deemed the notices mutually independent. Indeed, on February 22, 1966, T. F. Carr, general chairman of the Union\u2019s local grievance committee, stated in a letter to Marshall L. Bowie, the carriers\u2019 personnel director, that conferences concerning the Union\u2019s proposals had been terminated prior to that date and could not be reopened. Although Carr later modified his position with regard to the training program, the record discloses no formal attempt to reopen negotiations. Consequently the merits of Notice No. 3 have never been discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The District Court found that, at one time or another, both parties refused to resume negotiations concerning the bargainability of Notice No. 3. The court plausibly concluded that the hiatus resulted because all concerned were awaiting the outcome of litigation, instituted by other unions and other carriers, to determine the bargainability of Notice No. 3. Necessarily antecedent to the resolution of this issue was an answer to the question whether any union \u2014 the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers were specifically concerned \u2014 possessed the exclusive right to contractually arrange an apprentice-engineer program with the carriers. Finally, in Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. National Mediation Board, 1969, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 410 F.2d 1025, 1032, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 878, 90 S.Ct. 149, 24 L.Ed.2d 136, the District of Columbia Circuit held \u201cthat the Firemen\u2019s Section 6 notice concerning engineer apprenticeship programs * * * was bargainable under the Railway Labor Act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On November 7, 1969, little more than two weeks after the Supreme Court denied certiorari in the above ease, the National Railway Labor Conference, which represents the railroads involved here and other carriers, sent the United Transportation Union a written offer to negotiate, and suggested a time and place for the meeting. The Union\u2019s international president replied on November 12 that the Union was not prepared to consider the matter on a national basis. He concluded that the \u201csuggestion for a meeting [concerning Notice No. 3 should] be sent to the General Chairmen of those General Committees which served that Notice.\u201d On November 14, the Union\u2019s international vice-president arrived in Montgomery, Alabama. On November 15, he informed the general chariman of the Union on the Atlanta and West Point Railroad and the Western Railway of Alabama that a strike would commence at 6:00 a. m. that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The strike was short-lived. During the evening of November 15, the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia issued a temporary restraining order. That order was continued by consent of the parties until December 4. Following a hearing on that date, the temporary order remained in force pending issuance of the court\u2019s ruling. On January 5, 1970, the court decided that the union had mistakenly treated \u201cthe abortive discussions between the parties <em>about </em>negotiations as a substitute <em>for </em>negotiations and as an exhaustion of the procedural requirements <em>of </em>the RLA so that it now may strike.\u201d 307 F.Supp. at 1210. According to the district judge, the Railway Labor Act requires good-faith negotiations as a prerequisite to the exercise of self-help by either party. Therefore, the carriers must be enjoined from refusing to negotiate and from refusing to comply with the Act\u2019s other mandatory provisions; and the Union must be enjoined from striking pending such compliance, unless in the meantime the carriers should unilaterally alter existing working conditions or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>disturb the <em>status quo. Id. </em>at 1211. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">Accordingly, an injunction will issue against the union until the statutory procedures have been followed and until further order of the court, and both parties shall proceed forthwith to make a good-faith effort to settle in conference their differences with regard to all bargainable propos- \u25a0 als for changes which the union served upon plaintiffs [railroads] in November 1965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Appealing this order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(a) (1), the Union argues that the District Court erred both in its findings of fact and in its application of the law. The appeal rests on three grounds: First, the four year delay between the Union\u2019s section 6 notices and the railroads\u2019 offer to negotiate conclusively indicates that the carriers have not made \u201cevery reasonable effort\u201d to settle the dispute, a requirement of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, section 8. Having failed to satisfy this condition precedent, the railroads had no standing to seek injunctive relief. Second, because the carriers unilaterally changed one of the terms or conditions of the firemen\u2019s employment in violation of the Railway Labor Act, section 6, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, section 8, precluded any injunction against the strike. Finally, by negotiating with the Engineers rather than the Firemen with regard to the apprentice-engineer program, the railroads attempted to \u201cinterfere with, influence, or coerce\u201d their employees in violation of the Railway Labor Act, section 2, Third. The District Court\u2019s order rewarded the railroads for engaging in such illegal activity. We find each of these conclusions untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 104, specifically provides: \u201cNo court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute * * By its terms this prohibition is absolute. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has recognized a duty to reconcile the policies underlying the Norris-La-Guardia Act with those underlying the Railway Labor Act. <em>E. g., </em>Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Indiana R. R., 1957, 353 U.S. 30, 40-42, 77 S.Ct. 635, 1 L.Ed.2d 622; Virginian Ry. v. System Federation No. 40, 1937, 300 U.S. 515, 563, 57 S.Ct. 592, 81 L.Ed. 789; <em>see </em>Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, 1970, 398 U.S. 235, 251-252, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199. Recently the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">The heart of the Railway Labor Act is the duty, imposed by .\u00a7 2 First upon management and labor, \u201cto exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all disputes * * * in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">The Act provides a detailed framework to facilitate the voluntary settlement of major disputes. * * * While the dispute is working its way through these stages, neither party may unilaterally alter the <em>status quo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 1969, 394 U.S. 369, 377-378, 89 S.Ct. 1109, 1115, 22 L.Ed.2d 344; <em>see </em>Detroit &amp; Toledo Shore Line R. R. v. United Transportation Union, 1969, 396 U.S. 142, 90 S.Ct. 294, 24 L.Ed.2d 325; National Airlines, Inc. v. International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 998, 1000-1002; United Industrial Workers, v. Board of Trustees of Galveston Wharves, 5 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 320, 323-324, cert. denied, 1969, 395 U.S. 905, 89 S.Ct. 1747, 23 L.Ed.2d 219; <em>cf. </em>Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Indiana R. R., <em>supra </em>(minor dispute). That a major goal of the Railway Labor Act is the prevention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of work stoppages in the transportation industry should not require reiteration. <em>See, e. g., </em>Texas &amp; New Orleans R. R. v. Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; Steamship Clerks, 1930, 281 U.S. 548, 561, 50 S.Ct. 427, 74 L.Ed. 1034; United Industrial Workers, etc. v. Board of Trustees of Galveston Wharves, <em>swpra, </em>400 F.2d at 329. \u201c[The] procedures of the Act are purposely long and drawn out, based on the hope that reason and practical considerations will provide in time an agreement that resolves the dispute.\u201d Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; Steamship Clerks, etc., v. Florida East Coast Ry., 1966, 384 U.S. 238, 246, 86 S.Ct. 1420, 1424, 16 L.Ed.2d 501; <em>accord, </em>Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen v. Akron &amp; Barberton Belt R. R., <em>supra, </em>385 F.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">By striking, the Union unquestionably altered the <em>status quo. </em>To effectuate the policies of the Railway Labor Act, the District Court had jurisdiction to provide temporary injunctive relief until the disputants had exhausted the Act\u2019s procedures. Piedmont Aviation, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Association, 4 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 633, 636, cert. denied, 1970, 397 U.S. 926, 90 S.Ct. 924, 25 L.Ed.2d 105; <em>see </em>Long Island R. R. v. System Federation No. 156, 2 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 50, 52-53; Flight Engineers' International Association, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. American Airlines, Inc., 5 Cir. 1962, 303 F.2d 5, 11; Pennsylvania R. R. v. Transport Workers Union, E.D.Pa.1962, 202 F.Supp. 134, 137-138; <em>cf. </em>R. R. Yardmasters of America v. Pennsylvania R. R., 3 Cir. 1955, 224 F.2d 226. Undeniably, when the Union struck, the parties had exhausted none of the Act\u2019s procedures. Discussions concerning the bargainability of Notice No. 3 were not a satisfactory substitute for negotiations concerning the merits of that notice. Consequently the validity of the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction does not hinge upon classification of the dispute as either \u201cmajor\u201d or <em>\u201cminor.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> See, e. g., </em>Piedmont Aviation, Inc. v. Airline Pilots Association, <em>supra. </em>In either event, under the circumstances of this case, the District Court properly assumed jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The Union, however, argues that although the court may have had jurisdiction, it had no power to provide temporary injunctive relief. Relying on Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen, Enterprise Lodge No. 27 v. Toledo, Peoria &amp; Western R. R., 1944, 321 U.S. 50, 64 S.Ct. 413, 88 L.Ed. 534, and United Industrial Workers, etc., v. Board of Trustees of Galveston Wharves, <em>supra, </em>the Union contends that the carriers lacked the \u201cclean hands\u201d necessary to gain an injunction. Thus section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act precluded such a remedy. To substantiate its claim, the Union avers that the railroads\u2019 agreement with the Brotherhood of Lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>comotive Engineers regarding \u00e1n apprentice-engineer program<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was a unilateral change in the terms or conditions of the firemen\u2019s employment which violated section 6 of the Railway Labor Act. Moreover, this agreement was a manifestation of the carriers\u2019 efforts to destroy the Firemen\u2019s Union, a violation of section 2, Third, of the Railway Labor Act. If either of these observations was factually supportable, the union arguments might have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In <em>Enterprise Lodge No. 27, supra, </em>a union struck after negotiation and mediation had failed and the railroad had refused to arbitrate. The Supreme Court held that section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibited an injunction to terminate the strike: \u201cArbitration under the Railway Labor Act was available, afforded a method for settlement Congress itself had provided, and until [the railroad] accepted this method it had not made \u2018every reasonable effort to settle\u2019 the dispute, as Section 8 requires.\u201d 321 U.S. at 65, 64 S.Ct. at 421. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">[Section 8] imposes two conditions. If a complainant has failed (1) to comply with any obligation imposed by law or (2) to make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute, he is forbidden relief. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">* * * Section 8 is not limited to railway labor disputes. But it includes them. And its very terms show they were used in explicit contemplation of the procedures and machinery then existing under the Railway Labor Act and with the intent of making their exhaustion conditions for securing injunctive relief, not singly or alternatively, but conjunctively or successively, when available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 56-58, 64 S.Ct. at 417 (footnote omitted). To fortify its holding, the Court relied partly on congressional debates preceding passage of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Representative La-Guardia, who sponsored the bill in the House, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">[T]here is [a] tie-up between the provisions of the railroad labor act and the necessity of exhausting every remedy to adjust any difference which might arise. The workers could not and would not think of going on strike before all of the remedies provided in the law have been exhausted. If the railroads have complied, they would not * * * be deprived of any relief which they may have in law or equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">75 Cong.Rec. 5504. Crucial to the Court\u2019s rationale is the fact that at the time the railroad sought to enjoin the strike, it was also refusing to arbitrate. Thus the union had exhausted every available avenue to agreement and was free to resort to self-help, whatever the consequences. <em>See </em>Brotherhood of R. R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 377-380, 89 S.Ct. 1109; Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; Steamship Clerks, etc., v. Florida East Coast Ry., <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. at 243-244, 86 S.Ct. 1420; Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R., 1963, 372 U.S. 284, 289-291, 83 S.Ct. 691, 9 L.Ed.2d 759; Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Ry. v. Burley, 1945, 325 U.S. 711, 725, 65 S.Ct. 1282, 89 L.Ed. 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">In Order of R. R. Telegraphers v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry., 1960, 362 U.S. 330, 80 S.Ct. 761, 4 L.Ed.2d 774, the Court upheld a district court\u2019s decision that section 8 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act had deprived it of the power to permanently enjoin a strike. The district court had found that the complainant railroad was engaged in a continuing refusal to bargain concerning the subject matter of a section 6 notice. Furthermore, the union had exhausted every procedure available under the Railway Labor Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">To the extent that the Union relies on <em>Galveston Wharves, supra, </em>to buttress its section 8 argument, it is mistaken. Judge Wisdom, writing for this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>concluded that the Norris-LaGuardia Act was inapplicable to the <em>Galveston Wharves </em>controversy. 400 F.2d at 331 n. 33. Moreover, with regard to the Railway Labor Act, <em>Galveston Wharves </em>does not deviate from the rationale of <em>Enterprise Lodge No. 27, supra, </em>and its progeny. It is true that even though bargaining had not begun, this Court upheld a union\u2019s right to strike pending the carrier\u2019s compliance with the Act. Nevertheless, the factual underpinning for this decision cannot be overlooked: the carrier had leased facilities and discharged employees without notice, thereby destroying the <em>status quo </em>in violation of the Act. Consequently, \u201cunder the Act, the Union had the right to strike; that right continues until the Act is complied with by the Carrier, and thereafter ceases during and until exhaustion of the procedures set up by the Act.\u201d 400 F.2d at 333; <em>see </em>Detroit &amp; Toledo Shore Line R. R. v. United Transportation Union, <em>supra, </em>396 U.S. at 150-155, 90 S.Ct. 294. In National Airlines, Inc. v. International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, <em>supra, </em>this Court again noted that the union\u2019s right to strike is terminable when the carrier has complied with the Act. Applying the <em>Galveston Wharves </em>rationale to the facts in that case, Judge Thornberry wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj22\">[I]t is conceivable that the strike at the time of the first hearing was lawful. The Union, however, did not contest the initial strike injunction. In any event, the Carrier promptly complied with the January 18 temporary restraining order, issued contemporaneously with the strike injunction, and was therefore in compliance with the Act. The strike, however, continued and was, therefore, even under the <em>Galveston Wharves </em>rationale, in violation of the Act and properly enjoina-ble from that point forward, if not before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8\">416 F.2d at 1003 n. 4; <em>see </em>Rutland Ry. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 2 Cir. 1962, 307 F.2d 21, 39 n. 11, cert. denied, 1963, 372 U.S. 954, 83 S.Ct. 949, 9 L.Ed.2d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we fail to discern why section 8 of the NorrisLaGuardia Act should have deprived the District Court of power to issue a temporary injunction. Application of section 8 would have contributed nothing, under these circumstances, to reconciliation between the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the Railway Labor Act. Instead, it would have served merely to emasculate the latter. Neither <em>National Airlines, supra, </em>nor <em>Galveston Wharves, supra, </em>demands, or sanctions, such disregard for the legislative goals of the Railway Labor Act. Indeed, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the railroads alone were culpable for the four year delay between delivery of Notice No. 3 and their offer to bargain, that they were ready to negotiate at the time the Union struck remains uncontroverted. Since the disputants had not exhausted the procedures established by the Railway Labor Act, <em>Galveston Wharves, supra, </em>and <em>National Airlines, supra, </em>required that the strike be enjoined. The District Court, cognizant of its duty, refused to shirk the responsibility: its <em>quid pro quo </em>injunction ensured not only that the work stoppage would end but also that the railroads would negotiate in good faith. The court\u2019s order did not foreclose future self-help, once the Act\u2019s procedures were exhausted or a violation of the Act occurred.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Furthermore, we fail to perceive how the railroads\u2019 agreement with the Engineers concerning an apprentice-engineer program changed the terms or conditions of the firemen\u2019s employment, and thus justified the strike. At the time they exercised self-help, the Firemen had not even begun to negotiate concerning the merits of their proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>program, nor had the Engineers tried to include firemen in their program. Therefore, it was too early to speculate as to what effect the Engineers\u2019 agreement would have on the firemen\u2019s traditional expectation of promotion to the job of engineer. For the moment, Rule 37 of the Firemen's collective bargaining agreement with the carriers protected their promotional interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It follows that there could have been no provable change in the <em>status quo. </em>Until the Firemen have negotiated their own training agreement with the railroads, it is even conceivable that the brotherhoods can discard sibling rivalries and implement an apprentice-engineer program satisfactory to all concerned. Such accommodation may not be possible, but it is conceivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Finally, it would be ludicrous to hold that the railroads\u2019 undertaking of a statutory duty to bargain with the Engineers constituted an attempt to \"interfere with, influence, or coerce\u201d firemen, a violation of the Railway Labor Act, section 2, Third. The record shows that the carriers negotiated with the Engineers in response to a section 6 notice. To say that the performance of this legal obligation was illegal is a <em>non sequitur </em>to which we cannot subscribe. That the railroads may have been derelict in their duty to bargain with the Firemen concerning a similar section 6 notice is irrelevant to our resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Concurring in Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. National Mediation Board, <em>supra, </em>Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">Today\u2019s result places the carriers in the unhappy position of having to deal simultaneously with two rival unions whose bargaining demands will very likely conflict if a high order of union statesmanship is not forthcoming. Moreover, since both Unions have now been given the right to serve Section 6 notices, the disappointed Union will have the right to strike once the statutory procedures are exhausted. The Carriers will be able neither to avoid nor to resolve a strike by agreeing with the striking union without the risk of violating its obligation not to depart unilaterally from its agreement with the other Union. Although I consider this to be a wholly unsatisfactory resolution I can find nothing in the statute which permits the Court to impose a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">410 F.2d at 1035; <em>of </em>Transportation-Communication Employees Union v. Union Pacific R. R., 1966, 385 U.S. 157, 87 S.Ct. 369, 17 L.Ed.2d 264; Slocum v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. R., 1950, 339 U.S. 239, 70 S.Ct. 577, 94 L.Ed. 795; Order of Ry. Conductors of America v. Pitney, 1946, 326 U.S. 561, 567, 66 S.Ct. 322, 90 L.Ed. 318. The Railway Labor Act and <em>National Mediation Board, </em>supra, have impaled the carriers on the horns of a bargaining dilemma.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Now the Union asks us to inform these railroads that one horn is legally more comfortable than the other. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>This we refuse to do. While <em>National Mediation Board, supra, </em>vindicated the Union\u2019s right to bargain with regard to Notice No. 3, it did not give the Firemen an exclusive right to negotiate an apprentice-engineer program, nor did it authorize self-help prior to exhaustion of the Act\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it preliminarily enjoined the strike in question. <em>See </em>Piedmont Aviation, Inc. v. Air Lines Pilots Association, <em>supra; </em>Flight Engineers\u2019 International Association v. American Airlines, Inc., <em>supra, </em>303 F.2d at 11; <em>cf. </em>Seaboard World Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers Union, 2 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 1086, 1091-1092. On November 15, 1969, neither party had the right to resort to self-help to resolve this dispute. <em>See </em>Flight Engineers\u2019 International Association v.

They are derived from the terminology of railway industrial relations and are used judicially merely as a shorthand way of referring to a distinction incorporated in the structure of the Railway Labor Act.
