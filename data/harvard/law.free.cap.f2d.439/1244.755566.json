We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-20\">THE INVENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-21\">The methods recited in claims 9 and 10 for making the products recited in claims 4 and 5 comprise the reaction of specified polyisocyanates and specified polyhydroxy compounds. The foams and the methods for making them are said to distinguish over the prior art solely in the composition of the polyisocyanate reactant, which is the subject of claim 12. Accordingly, we reproduce only claim 12<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as adequately exemplificative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>for purposes of this appeal (rewritten in independent form as explained in footnote 1, subparagraphing supplied by us):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-4\">A mixture of diisocyanates, triiso-cyanates, and higher molecular weight polyisocyanates</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-5\">produced by the phosgenation of. the mineral acid-rearranged product of condensation of aniline and formaldehyde in proportions to give a product</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-8\">with from 50 to 55 parts of said mixture being a diisocyanate and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4S_\">with a combined amount of diiso-cyanate and triisocyanate being from 60 to 75 parts per hundred parts of the mixture; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACVg\">with the remainder of the mixture being of sufficiently high molecular weight that the number average molecular weight for the mixture is at least 381;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azh\">said mixture having</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Sk\">a viscosity of less than about 1090 centipoises at 25 \u00b0C. and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adc-dedup-0\">an isocyanate equivalent of 127 to not higher than 140.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">Use of this particular polyisocyanate mixture in a process conceded to be old for the production of polyurethane foams except for the specific polyisocyanate ingredient is said to result in rigid foams.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1Y\">* * * which [,] over periods of continued exposure to relatively high temperatures of about 400 \u00b0F., are characterized by retention of rigidity or nonflexibility, of high compressive strength and[,] in the case of our improved foams that have been cured at relatively high temperatures, good dimensional stability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-10\">Since, additionally, the specific polyiso-cyanate ingredient is quite close to poly-isocyanate ingredients disclosed in the prior art as useful for the production of polyurethane foam, appellants have attempted to rebut the inference of obviousness to be drawn from this similarity by filing Rule 132 affidavits comparing certain properties of polyurethane foams made according to their disclosure with polyurethane foams made according to the disclosures of the references. These affidavits, they argue, demonstrate the superiority of their invention to the prior art, which suggests that their invention would have been made sooner if it had been obvious in view of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">THE REJECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">The examiner rejected all claims over various combinations of eight references. The board affirmed the rejections on the basis of only four of the eight, stating that the other art rejections were \u201ccumulative, at best,\u201d and the parties have agreed that the additional references and the rejections based thereon \u201crequire no further consideration herein.\u201d Accordingly, the references here are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-13\">Seeger et al. Abbotson et al. (Australia) French Patent Chapman et al. (Great Britain) 2,683,730 221,411 1,233,854 874,430 July 13, 1954 May 15, 1958 May 9, 1960 Aug. 10, 1961<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-23\">Additionally, the examiner rejected claims 1, 6, and 11 under 35 U.S.C. 132 as \u201ccontaining new matter by the insertion of the recitation \u20181090\u2019 for \u20181000\u2019 in the specification\u201d and claims 6-10 as \u201cmerely reciting an obvious method of preparing a polyurethane foam,\u201d citing In re Farkas, 368 F.2d 1016, 54 CCPA 845 (1966), In re Larsen, 292 F.2d 531, 49 CCPA 711 (1961), and section 706.03 (q) of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure. The board affirmed both rejections insofar as they still applied after appellants\u2019 withdrawal from issue of most of the claims, reading the new matter rejection as applying to claims 4, 5, 9, 10, and 12 as well as 1, 6, and 11 be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>cause all are dependent from the rejected claims and thus incorporate the challenged language by operation of law. 35 U.S. C. 112. Our resolution of the first issue renders unnecessary consideration of the second and third issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">THE REFERENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Abbotson discloses how to make polyurethane foams by reacting a polyester with a polyisocyanate mixture \u201ccomprising a major proportion of diphenylme-thane diisocyanate and at least 5% by weight of polyisocyanate of functionality greater than two * * It will be recalled that claim 12 recites a mixture of polyisocyanates \u201cwith from 50 to 55 parts of said mixture being a diisocyanate and with a combined amount of diiso-cyanate and triisocyanates being from 60 to 75 parts per hundred parts of the mixture,\u201d indicating that the percentage of triisocyanate in the mixture would be between 5 and 25 percent. Abbotson states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-7\">The method whereby the polyisocy-anate of functionality greater than two is introduced into the polyisocyanate composition is not critical, provided the content thereof is between 5% and 50% by weight of the composition (preferably between 15% and 40%).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">Additionally, one of the four methods disclosed by Abbotson for preparing the requisite polyisocyanate mixture is the \u201cphosgenation of crude diaminodiphenyl-methane\u201d to produce diphenylmethane diisocyanate, during which process \u201ctriamines and other polyamines are also phosgenated and give rise to polyiso-cyanates of functionality greater than two.\u201d It will also be recalled that claim 12 recites the production of the polyiso-cyanate mixture \u201cby the phosgenation of the mineral acid-rearranged product of condensation of aniline and formaldehyde * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Chapman is similar to Abbotson except that it discloses the use of a poly-ether rather than a polyester as the other reactant. Specifically, it discloses how to produce a rigid polyurethane foam using a diphenylmethane diisocy-anate composition \u201cprepared by phosgen-ating crude diaminodiphenylmethane, containing about 15% of polyamines (mainly triamines) obtained by condensing formaldehyde with aniline in the presence of hydrochloric acid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Seeger teaches how to make polyiso-cyanate mixtures \u201cwhich contain a controlled maximum amount of the diisocy-anate.\u201d Thus, it is directly relevant to claim 12 and relevant to the other claims on appeal (1) by virtue of the disclosure in Abbotson and Chapman that mixtures of polyisocyanates may be used in the preparation of rigid polyurethane foams and (2) by virtue of its own statement that the polyisocyanate mixtures there disclosed \u201cmay be used to advantage in polymeric reactions with compounds containing reactive hydrogens,\u201d which statement generally describes the reactions of claims 9 and 10. It teaches that such polyisocyanate mixtures may be prepared by reacting an aryl mono primary amine (such as aniline) with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde (such as formaldehyde) or ketone to yield a mixture of secondary polyamines which are then \u201csubjected to rearrangement to primary polyamines by means of a mineral acid,\u201d the primary polyamines in turn being \u201cphosgenated to the polyisocyanates.\u201d We note a remarkable similarity between what is stated in the previous sentence and the first subparagraph following the preamble in claim 12, supra. However, it must be conceded that Seeger teaches that the aryl mono primary amine reactant and the aldehyde or ketone reactant must be present \u201cin controlled molecular amounts\u201d different from appellants\u2019 amounts. This is because Seeger\u2019s invention</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-12\">* * * is concerned with the formation of mixtures of polyisocyanates in which the <em>diisocyanate portion is present in an amount not to exceed approximately b0% by weight of the mixture. </em>This is accomplished by controlling the molecular ratio of amine to aldehyde or ketone in a range of from 4:2.5 to 4:3.5 with the amine being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>present in the larger molecular amount. A ratio of 4:2.5 yields a mixture of polyamines containing approximately 40% diamine by weight, while increasing the aldehyde or ketone to a ratio of 4:3.5 yields a mixture containing approximately 15% diamine by weight, with the balance in each case being the triamine, and higher amines. The polyamine mixtures are reacted with phosgene, as indicated, to obtain a mixture of polyisocyanates. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Appellants argue that Abbotson and Chapman do not really teach how to make polyisocyanate mixtures in which the percentage of diisocyanate is lower than about 70% and that Seeger does not teach how to make mixtures in which the percentage of diisoeyanate is higher than 40%. \u201cWhat bridges this no-man\u2019s-land?\u201d appellants ask, answering that only their disclosure does and that, particularly in view of their Rule 132 affidavits showing the superiority of polyurethane foam made from a polyisocy-anate mixture containing 50-55% diiso-cyanate, they are entitled to a patent in return for their disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Appellants\u2019 arguments concerning Ab-botson and Chapman attack the opera-tiveness of the first three methods disclosed by the patentees for preparing polyisocyanate mixtures containing less than 70% diisocyanate. Since the fourth method in both patents is essentially their method, they do not challenge its operativeness, but they do argue that the broad terms in which it is there disclosed refer only to the manner in which diphenylmethane diisocyanate is \u201ctraditionally\u201d made, which they assert yields a product containing about 85% diisocy-anate. The board rejected that argument, stating that it agreed with the examiner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-8\">* * * that method 4 must be read in the general context of a polyisocy-anate composition with a 5 to 50% content of higher isocyanates and that the art at that time was aware of how to vary the relative proportions of the isocyanate compounds, as evidenced by Seeger et al.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">We agree with the board. Seeger was available to the art well before the filing date of either Abbotson or- Chapman and there is nothing in either to suggest that the patentees intended to limit their disclosure to what appellants now say was \u201ctraditional.\u201d Similarly, while See-ger expressly teaches only the preparation of polyisocyanate mixtures with a diisocyanate content no greater than 40%, there is nothing in Seeger to suggest that similar techniques would, not work for the preparation of polyisocy-anate mixtures with a greater diisocy-anate content. Accordingly, we conclude that appellants\u2019 claim 12 is at least prima facie obvious in view of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">To overcome the inference of obviousness arising from the close similarity of the subject matter of claim 12 to the prior art, appellants filed two Rule 132 affidavits comparing polyurethane foams made from polyisocyanate mixtures meeting the terms of claim 12 with polyurethane foams made according to the disclosures in Abbotson and Chapman. Essentially, these affidavits indicate (1) that appellants\u2019 foams exhibit both greater compressive strength and less proportionate reduction in compressive strength at elevated temperatures than do the foams with which they were compared and (2) that appellants\u2019 foams char at still higher temperatures, whereas the foams with which they were compared melt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">The board discounted appellant\u2019s Rule 132 affidavits for two reasons, first, \u201cbecause they do not take cognizance of possible variation in method 4 of the references,\u201d and, second, because they do not indicate that the properties of the composition are \u201cstrikingly altered\u201d as compared with the prior art. Since the \u201cpossible variations\u201d to which the board referred would have resulted, in the board\u2019s own words, in the appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>\u201cmerely * * * comparing the claimed subject matter with itself,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the question really is whether making those variations would have been obvious at the time appellants made them to others having ordinary skill in the art of polyurethane foam making.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Appellants have argued that their polyurethane foam is \u201cmarkedly superior to anything disclosed in the references or the tested variations thereof,\u201d which, if true, would suggest that preparation of appellants\u2019 foam must have been un-obvious or it would have been done sooner. On the other hand, the solicitor has vigorously supported the board\u2019s assessment that the properties of appellants\u2019 foam are not \u201cstrikingly altered,\u201d which, if true, would greatly weaken if not destroy the inference of nonobviousness to be drawn from the lack of earlier development. Unfortunately, we do not have the evidentiary wherewithal to evaluate either position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">The evidence shows that appellants\u2019 foam chars at elevated temperatures, whereas the foam \u201cdisclosed in the references * * * [and] the tested variations thereof\u201d melt. Appellants\u2019 brief baldly states that \u201cA product which gives a \u2018solid char\u2019 as opposed to melting and cavitation [when the prior art foams melted, it left cavities in the test materials where melting occurred] is definitely a superior product,\u201d the implication being that if others in the art could have come up with a product which would char instead of melt, they certainly would have done so. Similarly, the affidavits show that appellants\u2019 foams exhibit both greater compressive strength at room temperature and less proportionate reduction in compressive strength at elevated temperatures than do the foams <em>with which they were compared.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Accepting these facts as true, they do not establish that the claimed mixtures were unobvious in view of the prior art. All this record definitely establishes is that appellants\u2019 foams have <em>different </em>properties from the reference foams tested. Whether this difference was \u201cstriking\u201d depends, not alone on the numerical ratio of the quantified value of the property being compared, but on the significance of that difference. In this case, there has been no showing that either of the asserted differences between appellants\u2019 foams and the prior art foams is of any practical advantage, and appellants\u2019 attempt to rebut prima facie obviousness by the method sanctioned in In re Papesch, 315 F.2d 381, 50 CCPA 1084 (1963), therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">If the polyisocyanate mixture claimed in claim 12 was obvious in view of the prior art, as we find, so were the polyurethane foams of claims 4 and 5 and the processes for their manufacture of claims 9 and 10, for it has been conceded that their sole point of novelty was the polyisocyanate composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">. Appellants withdrew claims 1-3, 6-8, and 11 at the hearing before the board, leaving for consideration only dependent claims. Appellants shortly thereafter and long before the decision of the board was handed down offered to amend the remaining claims to eliminate the dependency on withdrawn claims. Their proposed amendment was not entered, for some unexplained reason, but, nonetheless, the board\u2019s opinion reproduces two of the amended claims as illustrative, apparently treating them as if they had been entered. On appeal here, the transcript of record contains only the rejected claims in their original, dependent form. We recently affirmed the rejection of a dependent claim on the ground that appellant\u2019s failure to have the allowed claim from which it depended printed in the record prevented us from evaluating the correctness of the obviousness rejection there in issue. In re Andrews, 435 F.2d 1322, 58 CCPA (1971). However, appellant\u2019s action there was clearly contrary to Rule 26(3) of this court, while the action of appellants here was not, and appellants here have included .in their brief the withdrawn claims upon which the appealed claims depend. The solicitor\u2019s brief calls our attention to three small errors in appellants\u2019 printing of one of the withdrawn claims, but otherwise does not object to appellants\u2019 procedure. Accordingly, no harm apparently having been done by appellants\u2019 omission of the withdrawn claims in the transcript, we will consider the rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>dependent claims in conjunction with the withdrawn claims printed in appellants\u2019 brief as modified by the solicitor\u2019s corrections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1299-25\">. The British specification, published after the filing date of this application\u2019s parent, was used below and is used here simply as a convenient translation of the French patent, which is the true reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">. Appellants have not argued that modifying the disclosure of Abbotson or Chapman in accordance with Seeger\u2019s teaching of the relationship between the aniline and formaldehyde components of the initial reaction, quoted supra at page 8, to obtain a diisocyanate content between 50 and 55 percent in the polyiso-cyanate composition would not result in a polyisocyanate mixture meeting the other requirements of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
