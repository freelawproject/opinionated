At the trial, the principal controversy centered upon the degree of Harold\u2019s intoxication. The evidence on the subject ranged from \u201cdead drunk\u201d to \u201ccold sober.\u201d But the district judge, sitting in his statutory capacity as fact-finder, was persuaded and found that, although Harold \u201cwas to some extent under the influence of alcohol, plaintiff has not established by a preponderance of the credible evidence that he was intoxicated to the point of helplessness or irresponsibility.\u201d The judge further found that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s accident and resulting injuries were not proximately caused by negligence, gross negligence, recklessness or wanton misconduct of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">The findings are supported by substantial evidence and we are not convinced, from our review of the entire record, that they are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">. Since we approve the district judge\u2019s resolution of the fundamental issue against plaintiffs, we do not reach their remaining points concerning his further findings on contributory negligence and last clear chance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
