He pleaded guilty to the latter charge, the former charge was dismissed, and he was sentenced to two to six years imprisonment. The sentence was suspended, and he was placed on probation with the condition that he \u201cutilize any alcoholic facility as designated by his Probation Officer.\u201d Appellant did not move for a reduction of sentence in the District Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor did he attack his plea of guilty in that court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, he filed a notice of appeal, and now requests this Court to appoint counsel to conduct that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-23\">In view of the recurrence of appeals like this on our docket, it is appropriate to note the limited nature of review that may properly be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">This Court has authority when there is illegality or impropriety in a sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But appellant makes no such claim, and indeed, the disposition was favorable to appellant in its provisions for probation. This appeal from the sentence is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\"> As to the appeal from the conviction, the authority of this Court is also limited. A defendant\u2019s voluntary plea of guilty entered after receiving advice of counsel waives objections to nonjuris-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>dictional defects in his conviction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and no jurisdictional infirmity is either set forth by appellant or discernible from the record. Where a defendant claims error in the taking of his plea, the District Court will consider whether he should be allowed to withdraw his plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(d) or whether his conviction and sentence should be set aside under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since appellant did not allege any error in the taking of the plea, there is no basis for a remand to provide such consideration in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied. We dismiss the appeal <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to raise a nonfrivolous issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-15\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2801 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-16\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 3501(a) (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-17\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b603-26\">. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1964); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-28\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Leach v.
