KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Vincent Alo, appealing from his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 for obstructing the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s administration of the federal securities laws, asserts three primary grounds for reversal: that, although the government may have proved other crimes not charged, its evidence did not support a conviction under \u00a7 1505; that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial; and that the indictment upon which he stood trial was unduly vague. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Alo\u2019s conviction was based on his testimony at an investigative proceeding conducted by the SEC on May 25-26, 1966. The object of the investigation was to determine the beneficial ownership of several large blocks of securities, valued at $7.6 million, which constituted approximately one-third of the total issued shares of Tel-A-Sign, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appearing pursuant to a subpoena, Alo was questioned about a series of meetings which he had attended at the Warwick Hotel in New York in late 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">About one year prior to the meetings, a Miami Beach attorney, Alvin Malnik, organized Scopitone, Inc. to exploit in the United States a French variant on the familiar juke box: in addition to playing the chosen musical selection the Scopitone device showed a synchronized color film on a 26-inch screen. Ownership of Scopitone was evenly divided between Malnik and his associates and the \u201cUchitel group,\u201d which consisted of four business men from the New York area: Maurice Uchitel, a restaurant and real estate owner, Alfred Miniaci, Irving Kaye, and Abe Green, all involved in various aspects of the coin-operated machine industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">On July 29, 1964, Malnik, using powers of attorney executed by the Scopi-tone shareholders, transferred an eighty percent interest in the corporation to Tel-A-Sign for stock then worth $3.5 million. Instead of dividing these proceeds between himself and the Uchitel group, Malnik retained approximately nine-tenths of the Tel-A-Sign stock. Beyond this lopsided distribution of the Tel-A-Sign shares, Malnik proposed to keep the remaining twenty percent interest in Scopitone. The members of the Uchitel group objected strenuously to Malnik\u2019s division of the sale proceeds, as might well have been expected. Green protested directly to Malnik, who told him to arrange a meeting of all members of the Uchitel group. The resulting conference, the first of two at the Warwick Hotel in the latter part of 1964, was attended by Green, Miniaci, and Kaye, representing the Uchitel interests, and by Alo, who represented Malnik. Alo expressed the hope that a settlement could be reached without re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>course to litigation, but insisted that Malnik had earned his lion\u2019s share of the proceeds by dint of his greater efforts in promoting the Scopitone venture. The Uchitel group insisted on a division according to the respective shares held in Scopitone, Inc. In Uchitel\u2019s absence, no agreement was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The second conference at the Warwick was attended by Alo, Uchitel, Min-iad, and Kaye. Alo still pressed for a negotiated settlement but balked at the Uchitel group\u2019s insistence on thirty-five percent of the proceeds. A settlement was eventually reached in April 1965 when the Uchitel group agreed to accept approximately twenty-five percent. The SEC\u2019s investigation into these dealings began soon thereafter, when the Commission received information that Alo and Gerado Catena had been the real parties in interest in Scopitone, Inc. and that these two had thereby come into undisclosed beneficial ownership of large blocks of Tel-A-Sign stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">At the SEC\u2019s investigative hearings some eighteen months after the Warwick Hotel meetings, Alo claimed to remember practically nothing about them beyond his own attendance at Malnik\u2019s request and the fact that they concerned a dispute over the distribution of Tel-A-Sign stock. He had no recollection of a corporation named Scopitone, Inc., or of how the Malnik-Uchitel dispute arose. He could not recall who arranged the meetings or how he learned when and where they would be held. As to what actually transpired at these meetings, Alo testified that he had forgotten all save that the Uchitel group was dissatisfied with its allocation of Tel-A-Sign stock and that he urged an amicable resolution of the dispute. Indeed, by the government\u2019s calculation Alo pleaded a memory lapse some 134 times in one and a half hour\u2019s testimony. The 1969 indictment on which Alo was tried charged that his answers were false and evasive, and that he intended thereby to frustrate the SEC\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">Alo argues that a witness\u2019s evasive answers before an administrative agency do not \u201cobstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505. He seeks to escape the plain meaning of the broad language of \u00a7 1505 by directing our attention to a characteristic common to all of the more specific subdivisions of \u00a7 1505. That is, each of these provisions relates to tampering with sources of evidence <em>extrinsic to the actor, </em>such as the intimidation of a witness or the falsification of documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Invoking the principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>Alo argues that Congress must similarly have intended that the catchall language of \u00a7 1505 would not reach those who \u201cobstruct * * * administration of the law\u201d by suppressing their own knowledge of relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">So restrictive a gloss, however, would produce the anomalous result that concealing information recorded in one\u2019s papers would constitute, as the appellant concedes, an offense under \u00a7 1505, but concealing data recorded in one\u2019s memory would not. No rational basis for differentiating between these two types of evidence has been suggested to us, and without a clear statement of contrary Congressional intent we cannot attribute such an arbitrary distinction to the legislature. Like the specific provisions which precede it, \u00a7 1505 deals with the deliberate frustrations through the use of corrupt or false means of an agency\u2019s attempt to gather relevant evidence. The blatantly evasive witness achieves this effect as surely by erecting a screen of feigned forgetfulness as one who burns files or induces a potential witness to absent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Alo objects that such an interpretation of \u00a7 1505 will open an avenue for wholesale evasion of the so-called \u201ctwo-witness rule\u201d to which perjury convictions must conform.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree. It is true, that to convict Alo the jury had to conclude that he was lying when he professed loss of memory, but the gist of his offense was not the falsehood of his statements, but the deliberate concealment of his knowledge. The SEC was not interested in Alo\u2019s mnemonic powers, but in the details of the Warwick Hotel meetings. Alo\u2019s profession of forgetfulness was not so much false testimony as a refusal to testify at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">It is also argued that our reading of \u00a7 1505 will permit the government to circumvent the procedure set forth in \u00a7 21(c) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(c), whereby recalcitrant SEC witnesses may be taken before a federal court, advised of their duty to furnish evidence, and held in contempt if they persist in their refusal. But the same subsection provides a non-contempt misdemeanor penalty for unjustified refusal to obey an SEC subpoena, thereby negating any inference that Congress intended to make this contempt procedure the exclusive manner of dealing with stubborn witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">Lastly, we must reject the suggestion that the \u00a7 21(c) misdemeanor provision itself preempts Alo\u2019s prosecution as a felon under \u00a7 1505 because it deals more specifically with the refusal of a subpoenaed party to give evidence to the SEC. Such a reading of \u00a7 1505 would produce the ironic result that an act otherwise a felony under \u00a7 1505, such as the deliberate destruction of important documents, would become a mere misdemeanor if in addition to obstructing the agency\u2019s administration of the laws, it was in defiance of that agency\u2019s subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">Alo strongly urges that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial. He claims that the 1969 indictment merely supplanted a substantially identical sealed indictment returned in 1966. Although the government has steadfastly refused to concede the existence of a 1966 indictment, neither has it denied Alo\u2019s contention. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Both parties have argued the case on the assumption that such an indictment was returned, and we will do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there <em>was </em>a 1966 indictment, then, we agree with Alo\u2019s premise that a superseding indictment, filed for no apparent reason other than to update the earlier one, could not cure an otherwise intolerable delay between the original indictment and trial. The constitutional right to a prompt trial cannot be circumvented by such a simple expedient as reshuffling substantially identical documents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Viewing as critical the period after the filing of the 1966 indictment, we conclude that the government put off Alo\u2019s trial for approximately three years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, it has offered no justification for its dalliance. And Alo\u2019s silence cannot be considered a waiver of his speedy trial right because he had no knowledge of the sealed 1966 indictment. We are nevertheless constrained to find no unconstitutional delay. As to one of the most crucial criteria for determining impermissible pretrial delay \u2014 prejudice to the defendant \u2014 Alo\u2019s case is fatally defective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the 1966 indictment was secret, Alo suffered neither pretrial detention, nor personal anxiety and public obloquy, often the most obnoxious concomitants of an indictment. Moreover, the particular circumstances of the case made it clear that the delay did not hamper Alo\u2019s capacity to present his defense. His precise testimony before the Commission was a matter of public record, and the fading memory of witnesses to his answers could therefore not weaken his case. Alo argues, however, that if his trial had been held closer to the time of his SEC testimony, and the other participants in the Warwick Hotel meetings, if called as witnesses, had suffered a similar memory loss, this would have given greater force to his claim of bona fide forgetfulness. Whatever force this might have under other circumstances, here Alo\u2019s Warwick co-conferees could remember even at his 1970 trial such basic facts of the meetings as who arranged them, how the dispute arose, and what points of view were expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">In light of these circumstances, Alo\u2019s contention that we must \u201cpresume\u201d prejudice in his case is tantamount to advocating the elimination of prejudice as a factor to consider. The sixth amendment speedy trial clause was designed to protect criminal defendants from unfair prejudice<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than to set down a general rule of judicial administration, desirable as such a rule might be on policy grounds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And since pretrial delay may benefit as well as prejudice a defendant, it is incumbent upon him to show that he has been adversely affected.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We have not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>cited to any decision holding that a Sixth Amendment violation had resulted, where the defendant failed not only in demonstrating actual prejudice in any respect, but also in establishing the credible <em>possibility </em>of prejudice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Alo\u2019s alternative ground for dismissing the 1969 indictment requires less extended consideration. He claims that the indictment lacked the requisite specificity. In large part the indictment tracked the relevant portion of the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, reciting that Alo did \u201cunlawfully, wilfully, knowingly and corruptly obstruct and impede and endeavor to obstruct and impede the due administration of laws of the United States * * * under which a proceeding * * * before a department and agency of the United States * * * was then pending and being had * * These general allegations were fleshed out with the phrase \u201cby giving false and evasive answers to questions put to him as a witness in such proceeding,\u201d and with the appropriate specifics as to date, statute, and names of the administrative agency and proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">Alo\u2019s objection to the supposedly vague indictment is that it failed to apprise him of the \u201cnature and cause of the accusation.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Considering the fact that Alo\u2019s forgetfulness was the constant theme of his testimony before the SEC, we have little doubt that, although somewhat greater specificity would have been advisable, he understood precisely what the phrase \u201cfalse and evasive answers\u201d referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">The last traces of any lingering doubts were clearly removed when upon Alo\u2019s request the government served him with two bills of particulars, the first consisting of a transcript of Alo\u2019s entire SEC testimony with each allegedly \u201cfalse and evasive\u201d answer marked as such. The second bill of particulars specified the manner in which these answers were false, <em>viz., </em>that Alo in fact remembered the facts he claimed to have forgotten, and the manner in which they were evasive, namely that poor recollection was repeatedly invoked to avoid giving the SEC responsive answers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>After a careful review of the entire record, we find Alo\u2019s further claims of prejudicial error to be without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. Tel-A-Sign\u2019s registration in late 1965 of some 90,000 unregistered shares in the name of certain selling shareholders was the immediate occasion of the investigation. The Commission apparently had reason to believe that Alo and one Gerado Catena were the undisclosed beneficial owners of large blocks of Tel-A-Sign stock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any witness in any proceeding pending before any department or agency of the United States, or in connection with any inquiry or investigation being had by either House, or any committee of either House, or any joint committee of the Congress; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">Whoever injures any party or witness in his person or property on account of his attending or iiaving attended such proceeding, inquiry, or investigation, or on account of his testifying or having testified to any matter pending therein ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">Whoever, with intent to avoid, evade, prevent, or obstruct compliance in whole or in part with any civil investigative demand duly and properly made under the Antitrust Civil Process Act willfully removes from any place, conceals, destroys, mutilates, alters, or by other means falsifies any documentary material which is the subject of such demand ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-16\">Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of law under which such proceeding is being had before such department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exei\u2019cise of the power of inquiry under which such inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-17\">Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">.

Essex, 407 F.2d 214 (6th Cir. 1969) (interpreting 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 1503, judicial counterpart of \u00a7 1505, as not encompassing deliberate lying by witness where gist of offense was falsehood, not evasiveness, of testimony).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\">. The government\u2019s contention that the delay prior to the filing of the 1969 indictment should be considered pre-indictment delay is based upon the claim that Alo was not arrested until sometime thereafter. However, where an indictment, such as the 1966 indictment of Alo, precedes an arrest, the relevant period begins with the indictment rather than with the arrest, unless, of course, the defendant is a fugitive. See United States v. Simmons, 338 F.2d 804, 807 (2d Cir. 1904), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 983, 85 S.Ct. 1352, 14 L.Ed.2d 276 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. Three years is the approximate period between the filing of the sealed indictment sometime in the latter half of 1966 and the filing of the second indictment in October 1969. The eleven-month delay from October 1969 to the beginning of Alo\u2019s trial in September 1970 was caused by changes in Alo\u2019s counsel, pretrial motions, and adjournments either consented to or reguested by Alo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b809-13\">. See United States ex rel. Solomon v. Mancusi, 412 F.2d 88 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 936, 90 S.Ct. 269, 24 L.Ed.2d 236 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">.

In this respect the right to a speedy trial would appear distinct from the other rights secured by the sixtli amendment. Cf. Dickey v.

In particular, the opinions which speak of \u201cpresuming\u201d prejudice uniformly reveal the substantial possibility of prejudice. See Taylor v. United States, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 238 F.2d 259, 262 (1956) (two-year delay following indictment, of which defendant was not informed; loss of alibi witnesses to meet \u201cweak\u201d government case); United States v.

In any ease, <em>Lust man\u2019s </em>broad dictum that \u201ca showing of prejudice is not required,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 478, has not been followed in subsequent decisions of this court. See United States ex rel. Solomon v.

The venerable principle that a bill of particulars cannot \u201cgive life to what was dead when it left the grand jury,\u201d Foster v. United States, 253 F. 481, 484 (9th Cir. 1918), does not mean that we must ignore the relief which a bill is designed to provide and which Alo received in this ease. See also Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 770, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962); United States v. Lattimore, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 268, 215 F.2d 847, 850 (1954). That principle touches not on the defendant\u2019s notice of the case he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>will have to meet, but on his fifth amendment right to be proceeded against by grand jury indictment. Specificity in the indictment is a coi'ollary of the grand jury right because a loosely phrased accusation would allow the prosecutor to proceed at trial on a theory which the grand jury had never considered. A bill of particulars obviously is no safeguard against sueli an evasion of the fifth amendment. But no such claim is raised in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
