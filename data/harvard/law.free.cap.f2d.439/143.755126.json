They were both sentenced to a term of five years on the substantive counts, and two years on the conspiracy count, sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">We have carefully considered the contentions of appellants that there was insufficient evidence of the theft of the bills, and conclude that there is no merit to this contention. There was ample evidence that the securities were in the possession of the Marine Midland Bank in New York, and were determined to have disappeared; and that they were subsequently found in possession of the appellants in Florida, when Shipper tried to use five of them as security for a $40,000 loan at the County National Bank, using a fictitious name. The evidence as to Goldner was that five of the bills were found on his person when he was arrested after he had been seen accompanying Shipper to the bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">Assuming the admissibility of the evidence of this possession under such circumstances, we conclude there was ample evidence to convict on the substantive counts. The sentence for five years was on these counts. It is, therefore, not necessary to determine whether there was adequate evidence to support the conspiracy count. See Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774, and Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">Goldner challenges the introduction into evidence of the $50,000 in bills found on his person because he says that there was a want of probable cause for his arrest. We conclude that the arrival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>of Goldner with Shipper at the described bank in the kind of automobile described by the reliable informer and his conduct at the bank warranted his arrest. We are also convinced that the records, to the introduction of which Goldner excepts, were admissible under the business records rule, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1732.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-14\">. The bank security officer testified that a tan Cadillac automobile stopped in front of the bank. Goldner asked Shipper how long he would be, and the latter said, \u201cI\u2019m only going to be about fifteen minutes\u201d ; to which Goldner replied, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll be at the drugstore.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
