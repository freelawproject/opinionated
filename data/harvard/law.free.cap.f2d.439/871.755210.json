(hereinafter Sweetheart), plaintiff and appellant, seeks a declaratory judgment, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, that certain plastic containers, which it manufactures, do not infringe patents Nos. 3,139,213 and 3,091,360, owned by defendant and ap-pellee, Illinois Tool Works, Inc. (hereinafter I.T.W.). Both the procedural and substantive issues involved require a discussion of the previous litigation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">The patents concern plastic containers which, because of a nesting device, will not stick together when stacked one inside the other. I.T.W. has successfully charged in another suit that approximately eighty of Sweetheart\u2019s products, or about 25% of Sweetheart\u2019s total production during 1964-69 infringe these patents. Sweetheart appealed that judgment from the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) to the Seventh Circuit which, since argument in this case, affirmed. Illinois Tool Works v. Sweetheart Plastics, Inc., 436 F.2d 1180 (7th Cir. 1971). I.T.W. has also brought similar suits in the same court against other major manufacturers of similar products.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">During the course of the proceedings before the Chicago court, Sweetheart\u2019s counsel claim to have discovered some expired patents that appeared to embody a nesting device which might serve as a suitable substitute for the challenged products. Sweetheart developed sample containers, and made a token sale to one buyer of 100 cups based on one of the three designs. Sweetheart did not, however, retool its machinery or include the new containers in its regular product line.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">The litigation then took on the nature of a revolving door, with Sweetheart first vainly trying to find out through interrogatories if I.T.W. claimed that six additional items, including the three at issue here, also infringed; the court later allowing all six to be included in the case; the court still later requiring Sweetheart to answer I.T.W.\u2019s interrogatory as to the state of manufacture and sale of each of the six items; I.T.W. then moving to exclude the three items involved here; and the court finally ruling at a pretrial conference that these three items should be excluded from the litigation but that Sweetheart could at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>tempt to reinstate them during the trial. Sweetheart made no such attempt, and the containers were not mentioned in the Chicago court\u2019s opinion of September, 1969, or, despite Sweetheart\u2019s effort, in the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">After that judgment was entered, Sweetheart filed this action in the district court in Massachusetts seeking a declaration that the same three new containers did not infringe I.T.W.\u2019s patents. In the Chicago court, I.T.W. attempted to enjoin Sweetheart from proceeding with the Massachusetts suit. That court held that it had no jurisdiction to enter the injunction. But it further said that it had already determined that the status of the new containers was not justi-ciable because they presented no case or controversy and that the proper remedy for Sweetheart was to appeal this determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Having failed to stop this suit in the Chicago court, I.T.W. moved in the Massachusetts court to dismiss Sweetheart\u2019s complaint or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Northern District of Illinois. The district court granted I.T.W.\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant, I.T.W., and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because there was no case or controversy as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 and the Constitution. From that decision, Sweetheart appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (7), Sweetheart has attempted to invoke the Massachusetts long arm statute, Mass. Gen.L.Ann. ch. 223A, and has aecordingly served I.T.W. by mail. This statute is new and the relevant section has yet to be construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. <em>Cf. </em>Kagan v. United Vacuum Appliance Co., 1970 Mass.A.S. 999, 260 N.E.2d 208. We are reluctant to initiate construction of a state statute, and we decline to do so here where alternative grounds make such a construction unnecessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">Both parties have stressed primarily the issue of subject matter jurisdiction. A declaratory judgment action is not justiciable if it does not present a case or controversy. The case must be appropriate for judicial determination and not hypothetical or abstract. Aetna Life Insurance Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 239-240, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">I.T.W. claims that the Chicago court has already determined that no case or controversy exists with regard to the new containers and that its decision to exclude the containers from the trial has res judicata effect. Despite the Chicago court\u2019s subsequent interpretation of its decision, we do not feel bound to consider the matter as res judicata. The doctrine is an equitable one, <em>see </em>IB J. Moore, Federal Practice U 0.405 [12], at 787 (2d ed. 1965); and, where it is not clear from the series of rulings in the Chicago suit that the court excluded the new containers from the suit because the issue was not justiciable, an appealable ruling, or because the court exercised its discretion to narrow the issues in the case, we would find it inequitable to give res judicata effect to the Chicago court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>We reach, therefore, the merits of the justiciability issue. The distinction between those declaratory judgment actions which present a case or controversy and those which are hypothetical is \u201cnecessarily one of degree.\u201d Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941); <em>see also </em>6A J. Moore, Federal Practice |f 57.20, at 3117 (2d ed. 1966). The courts have held that a charge of infringement is a prerequisite to a finding of justiciability, but the charge required is liberally construed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Dewey &amp; Almy Chemical Co. v. American Anode, Inc., 137 F.2d 68 (3rd Cir. 1943), cert. denied 320 U.S. 761, 64 S.Ct. 70, 88 L.Ed. 454 (1943), the court found the prerequisite satisfied even though defendant had never specifically charged plaintiff with infringement, had no knowledge that plaintiff even utilized the disputed processes, but had used the patents as an economic weapon against other alleged infringers who declined to get a license and had asserted claims for the breadth of its patents that would seem to cover plaintiff\u2019s processes. <em>See also </em>Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Sales Affiliates, Inc., 105 F.Supp. 886, 897-899 (S.D.N.Y.1952). A more recent decision interpreted the charge of infringement requirement as a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-4\">\u201cwell grounded fear that should he [the plaintiff] continue or commence the activity in question, he faces an infringement suit or the damaging threat of one to himself and his customers. The touchstone is a <em>reasonable apprehension.\u201d </em>Japan Gas Lighter Association v. Ronson Corp., 257 F.Supp. 219, 237 (D.N.J.1966) (emphasis in original). <em>See also </em>our decision in Hawley Products Co. v. United States Trunk Co., 259 F.2d 69 (1st Cir. 1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">In this case the defendant, I.T.W., had indicated its willingness to bring infringement actions by doing so against almost every major non-licensed company in the field. Second, in a memorandum submitted to the Chicago court, I. T.W. state, \u201cPlaintiff [I.T.W.] has yet to charge these items as being infringements, primarily because plaintiff has not \u2018felt\u2019 the effect of the manufacture of these items.\u201d This statement is somewhat ambiguous, but it might well lead Sweetheart to believe that it would be charged with infringement as soon as it began to produce the new containers in large quantities. Furthermore, in connection with the settlement negotiations in the Chicago case, I.T.W.'s president had written a letter to Sweetheart\u2019s president suggesting that the new containers would indeed infringe I.T.W.\u2019s patents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We think that Sweetheart has shown\u2014 but barely \u2014 that it would probably face an infringement suit if it began to produce the new containers in large quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">In addition to the charge-of-infringement prerequisite, there is a second requirement which plaintiffs who seek a declaratory judgment of non-infringement must meet. The plaintiff must have actually produced or have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>made active preparation to produce the accused article. There is no justiciability if the plaintiff is merely considering the advisability of commencing production. 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice, [[67.20, at 3118 (2d ed. 1966). Whether a plaintiff has the immediate intention and ability of entering into actual manufacture, use or sale of the article in question is by no means an easy question. One court has stated, \u201cMajor stress should be placed on the \u2018definite' intention of the plaintiff to take \u2018immediate\u2019 action to utilize its potential and this intention should be \u2018evident\u2019 from the preparatory steps outlined in the complaint.\u201d Wembley, Inc. v. Superba Cravats, Inc., 315 F.2d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 1963). See also Technical Tape Corp. v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., 200 F.2d 876, 878 (2d Cir. 1952); General Electric Co. v. Refrigeration Patents Corp., 65 F.Supp. 75 (W.D.N.Y. 1946). It is our conclusion that this requirement means that the plaintiff must allege preparations for production which suggests that, but for a finding that the product infringes or for extraordinary and unforeseen contingencies, the plaintiff would and could begin production immediately.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">As of the time of the dismissal of the complaint below, and of the argument on appeal, Sweetheart\u2019s professed intention was contingent. It claimed that the three containers were its \u201canchor to windward\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that it intended to produce them if \u201ca final judgment adverse to Sweetheart is ultimately entered in Chicago.\u201d Admittedly the Chicago suit has, short of a successful pursuit of certiorari, produced such a result at this point. But, if the evidence of a threatened infringement suit is barely sufficient for justiciability, we consider the evidence of definiteness of intention as objectively manifested by prior preparatory steps to fall somewhat short of bare sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Quite apart from technical justiciability, we are also influenced by the circumstances of this litigation. The district court in Chicago and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals have already interpreted I.T.W.\u2019s patents and decided what containers infringe them. Therefore, even if the status of the new containers were a justiciable issue, it would be more expedient to tap the acquired expertise of these two courts a second time rather than compelling another court to interpret the same patents with respect to similar containers. The Chicago district court has indicated its willingness to determine if the. new containers constitute infringement \u201c[a]fter the trial, if infringement is found and an injunction is issued.\u201d Those results have now come to pass. The contingency against which Sweetheart has been holding in reserve its plans for production of the three containers has occurred. No reason appears why significantly more delay would be encountered in initiating a declaratory judgment suit in Chicago than in sending this case back to the Massachusetts district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">These considerations of judicial expediency are relevant to jurisdictional decisions under the declaratory judgment statute. The Supreme Court has held that jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment statute is discretionary with the court and that the statute does not confer on the litigant an absolute right to be heard. Public Service Commission of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 241, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952); <em>see also </em>6A J. Moore, Federal Practice [[57.20, at 3121 (2d ed. 1966). Lower courts have on several occasions refused to hear declaratory judgment actions if the same parties and issues are involved in another suit. <em>E.g., </em>American Greiner Electronic, Inc. v. Establissements Henry-Le Paute, S.A., 174 F.Supp. 918 (D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>D.C.1959); Crosley Corp. v. Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Co., 130 F.2d 474, 475 (3rd Cir. 1942), cert. denied 317 U.S. 681, 63 S.Ct. 202, 87 L.Ed. 546 (1942); F. X. Hooper Co., Inc. v. Samuel M. Langston Co., 56 F.Supp. 577, 584 (D.N.J.1944). Thus, the district court, even if it had determined that the issue was justiciable, might have been wise to have declined jurisdiction or to have transferred the case to the Northern District of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. Sweetheart did not challenge this determination in its appeal to the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. We note in passing that I.T.W. has attempted unsuccessfully to contest jurisdiction under another state\u2019s long arm statute in another action for declaratory judgment between the same two parties. . Sweetheart Plastics, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 267 F.Supp. 938 (S.D.N.Y. 1967). While long arm statutes are generally not written with declaratory judgment actions in mind, we would not wish to be understood as impliedly saying that jurisdiction by means of such statutes may not be obtained in declaratory judgment actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-21\">. We intend no criticism of the Chicago court. Apparently, as our text indicates, both parties presented the court with the facts and arguments concerning the new containers in a piecemeal fashion which caused the court to alter, on several occasions, its opinion as to the relevance to the new containers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b928-5\">. Some authorities would require no charge. \u201cBut we believe that a \u2018charge\u2019 of infringement is not an inflexible prerequisite to the maintenance of an action for a declaration of non-infringement or invalidity * * * [W]here the patent by its terms raises a reasonable doubt as to whether or not plaintiff\u2019s activities constitute an infringement, then there is a \u2018controversy\u2019. There is hence no constitutional objection to the maintenance of the action. To deny that a \u2018case or controversy\u2019 is present is to ignore the realities of business life.\u201d 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice If 57.20, at 3120-21 (2d ed. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b928-10\">.
