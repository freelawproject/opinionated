Appellant\u2019s foot was crushed when the ship\u2019s launch struck appellant as he was ascending a Jacob\u2019s ladder hanging off the starboard side of the vessel. The district court found that the appellee was not negligent and that the vessel was not unseawor-thy, 304 F.Supp. 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">On appeal, the seaman primarily contends that the district court erred in failing to find specifically upon the seaman\u2019s claim that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied. No express finding was required. Appellee presented evidence directed to the negligence and unseaworthiness issues, and the district court made express findings on both issues. Nothing in the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur compels the trier of fact to accept any inference arising from the application of the doctrine in the face of dispelling evidence. (E.g., Sweeney v. Erving (1913) 228 U.S. 233, 33 S.Ct. 416, 57 L.Ed. 815; United Fruit Co. v. Marine Terminals Corp. (9th Cir. 1967) 376 F.2d 1007; Orr v. Southern Pacific Co. (9th Cir. 1955) 226 F.2d 841.) Appellant\u2019s argument is simply an oblique attack on the adverse findings. We have examined the findings in the light of the record, and we have concluded that none is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">Appellant\u2019s last point is that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request belatedly to call a witness. We find no abuse of discretion in that refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
