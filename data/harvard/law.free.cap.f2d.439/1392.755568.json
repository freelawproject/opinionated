Having placed some articles of personal property in the trunk, defendant left and called an emergency car service. Later he returned to the car to meet the garageman and give him the key. Almost immediately after reaching the garage the garageman noticed part of a black object under the driver\u2019s seat. Later, his curiosity being aroused, he removed it and found it to be a single-barrelled shotgun wrapped in tiretape. He called the police. There was a live shell in the gun, and two more in the console or glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-25\">This is not a case of finding a package of marijuana cigarettes under the seat, which a guest could readily have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>placed there. Guevara v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 745. Suggestions that the gun might have belonged to defendant\u2019s wife, who used the car, or to his passengers or to some friend (who, perforce, took occasion to secrete shells in the console, as well as to place the gun under the driver\u2019s seat) are insufficient to require us to say that a jury could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun was the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">Finally, defendant\u2019s belated suggestion in this court (belated, because it is contrary to his testimony below) that he might have known the gun was in his car but it was only as a bailment, overlooks our ease of United States v. Palmer, 1 Cir., 1970, 435 F.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
