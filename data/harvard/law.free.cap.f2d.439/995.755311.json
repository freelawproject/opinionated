The medical evidence demonstrated, and the Hearing Examiner of the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, Social Security Administration, assumed for purposes of questioning the vocational expert, produced on the hearings, that the plaintiff-appellant was physically unable to perform the work which he had performed prior to his application for disability benefits. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) and 423. There was some conflict in the medical evidence as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>extent of the disability of the plaintiff-appellant and as to the nature of the disability of the plaintiff-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The hypothetical question submitted to the vocational expert appears as follows in the record on appeal, pages 67 and 68:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-5\">\u201cHEARING EXAMINER: The assumption at that time was that the claimant, that if the Examiner were to find that the claimant can perform only sedentary work, and that this only in an environment not exposing him to atmospheric allergens and pollutants, are the jobs in the claimant\u2019s geographical region which he can perform. This letter that the doctor submitted supplements the testimony which you provided at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-7\">\u201cDR. HYMAN: I would in supplementation add that it was my understanding that not only environmental allergants, that also the criteria of an unusual quantity of fumes and an unusual amount of oil and grease significant to respiratory conditions and in accordance with those criteria the positions listed in my letter which \u2014 are for the most part positions in the machinery and tool manufacturing industries, and they exist in substantial significant numbers in the Detroit area. There are in the manufacture of machinery some 92,000 individuals employed in the Detroit area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-8\">\u201cHEARING EXAMINER: In what line?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">\u201cDR. HYMAN: In machinery manufacture. In the manufacture of electrical equipment some 38,000, and in transportation equipment, including motor vehicles, over 250,000. These would include also the positions of sorter, engraver, machines and lock assembler which in my letter I specified as in any industry or in the engraving or hardware industry. Simply as a matter of specific designation they are found also on the general machinery and electrical manufacturing industries. The positions then that I \u2014if you \u2014 I don\u2019t have specific information relative to each type of position. They change their incidence dependent upon what they are called in a given employment situation and it is impossible to know if a given job is known by the same title in every employer\u2019s records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">After rather extensive examination, including adding of further issues to the hypothetical question, the following colloquy took place, pages 77 and 78 of the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-12\">\u201cQ. It would have a lot to do, would it not, with the product they are making?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-13\">A. And the material experience of the plant involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-14\">Q. So there could be a greater variance in this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-15\">A. Yes, it is also my observation that these are not the cleanest places in the world, which I say negatively, they are dirty industrial manufacturing plants and they certainly, I would not say for example referring to my previous testimony, that an assembler works in the same condition as a guard or a car rental clerk. Now what the specific situation is, is so variable I may want to provide a generalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-16\">Q. Most of these things that you have cited in today\u2019s testimony involve machinery, they do involve oil and grease, but it is your feeling that it does not add up to the assumption made of being unusual quantity of atmospheric allergent and pollutants, that\u2019s a subjective evaluation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-17\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-18\">Q. That\u2019s a subjective evaluation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-19\">A. That I made, understanding the Examiner\u2019s assumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-20\">Q. Now, last of all, adding a few other assumptions to the assumptions that you have have been given so far, including the original ones, the fact that the nervous condition had resulted in the tremor, adding that the claimant\u2019s testimony that he believes he cannot walk or stand for considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>ble periods of time, has trouble sitting in one place without getting up, can\u2019t walk very far, has to rest periodically, adding these assumptions and qualifications to the hypothetical, would any of these jobs be available to him under these circumstances HEARING EXAMINER: You mean could he perform any of these jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-5\">Q. Thank you, could he perform any of these jobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">A. I have to equivocate, he could perform the work, whether he could hold the job is another issue altogether. He might be able to put in 15 minutes doing the work, but whether or not this would be sufficient to hold the job is another issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-7\">Q. When I say perform the work, I mean at least seven or eight hours a day on the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-8\">A. Under those conditions, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">It should be noted that the additional assumptions included in the hypothetical questioning by counsel for the plaintiff-appellant are fully sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-10\">We recognize that judicial review on decisions of the Secretary is limited. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Rose v. Cohen, 406 F.2d 753 (6th Cir., 1969). Courts may not resolve conflicts in the evidence and decide questions of credibility. Moon v. Celebreeze, 340 F.2d 926 (7th Cir., 1965). We recognize that in order to be compensable under the 1967 Amendments to the Act, the physical impairment must result from abnormalities which are \u201cdemonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) (3) (1964 ed. Supp. III).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">The impairments from which the plaintiff-appellant is alleged to have suffered, and from which he is alleged to be suffering are by the record demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. No question is raised and no question has been raised as to the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motivation to work. There is no suggestion of malingering on the part of plaintiff-appellant. The only issue that we find is as to his ability to perform work in the manner suggested by the vocational expert, Breaux v. Finch, 421 F.2d 687 (5th Cir., 1970), and since the vocational expert concluded his testimony with the following, page 78 of the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-13\">\u201cQ. Thank you, could he perform any of these jobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-14\">A. I have to equivocate, he could perform the work, whether he could hold the job is another issue altogether. He might be able to put in 15 minutes doing the work, but whether or not this would be sufficient to hold the job is another issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-15\">Q. When I say perform the work, I mean at least seven or eight hours a day on the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-16\">A. Under those conditions, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-17\">We are forced to the conclusion that the decision of the Secretary was not supported by substantial evidence within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-18\">Reversed and remanded for entry of an order granting disability benefits in accordance with the applicable statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
