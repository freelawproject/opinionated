Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-19\">Respondent raises one legal issue. The Board concedes that the employee based his action upon an erroneous assumption that the collective bargaining agreement contained a provision regarding the chain of command on the job when in fact it did not. Respondent argues that, as a matter of law, employee activity directed to the implementation of a supposed provision of the collective bargaining agreement cannot be protected concerted activity within section 1 when there is no such provision in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-20\">The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the employee\u2019s asserted interpretation of the contract is relevant to the factual issues of the employee\u2019s good faith and the employer\u2019s motivation. We agree with the General Counsel, however, that the employee does not lose the protection of the Act as a matter of law simply because his understanding of the contract turns out to be mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-21\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
