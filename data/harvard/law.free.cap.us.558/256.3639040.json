We appointed a Special Master and referred the matter to her, together with the motions of three nonstate entities seeking to intervene in the dispute as parties. South Carolina opposed the motions. After holding a hearing, the Special Master granted the motions and, upon South Carolina\u2019s request, memorialized the reasons for her decision in a First Interim Report. South Carolina then presented exceptions, and we set the matter for argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Two of the three proposed intervenors have satisfied the standard for intervention in original actions that we articulated nearly 60 years ago in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S. 369 (1953) <em>(per curiam). </em>Accordingly, we overrule South Carolina\u2019s exceptions with respect to the Catawba River Water Supply Project (hereinafter CRWSP) and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (hereinafter Duke Energy), but we sustain South Carolina\u2019s exception with respect to the city of Charlotte, North Carolina (hereinafter Charlotte).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">We granted leave for South Carolina to file its complaint in this matter two years ago. <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>552 U. S. 804 (2007). The gravamen of the complaint is that North Carolina has authorized upstream transfers of water from the Catawba River basin that exceed North Carolina\u2019s equitable share of the river. It has done so, according to the complaint, pursuant to a North Carolina statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>requires any person seeking to transfer more than 2 million gallons of water per day (mgd) from the Catawba River basin to obtain a permit from the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. See N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 143-215.22L(a)(1) (Lexis 2007); \u00a7 143-215.22G(1)(h). Through that agency, the complaint alleges, North Carolina has issued at least two such permits, one to Charlotte for the transfer of up to 33 mgd, and one to the North Carolina cities of Concord and Kannapolis for the transfer of 10 mgd. In addition, the complaint alleges, North Carolina\u2019s permitting statute \u201cgrandfathers\u201d a 5 mgd transfer by the CRWSP, and \u201cimplicitly authorize[s]\u201d an unknown number of transfers of less than 2 mgd. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21, 22. South Carolina claims that the net effect of these upstream transfers is to deprive South Carolina of its equitable share of the Catawba River\u2019s water, particularly during periods of drought or low river flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">South Carolina seeks relief in the form of a decree that equitably apportions the Catawba River between the two States, enjoins North Carolina from authorizing transfers of water from the Catawba River exceeding that State\u2019s equitable share, and declares North Carolina\u2019s permitting statute invalid to the extent it is used to authorize transfers of water from the Catawba River that exceed North Carolina\u2019s equitable share. See generally Complaint, Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. The complaint does not specify a minimum flow of water that would satisfy South Carolina\u2019s equitable needs, but it does offer a point of reference. In a recent \u201cmultistakeholder negotiation process\u201d involving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (hereinafter FERC), Duke Energy, and various groups from both States, it was agreed, according to the complaint, that South Carolina should receive from the Catawba River a continuous flow of water of no less than 1,100 cubic feet per second, or about 711 mgd. Complaint \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>This negotiated figure may prove unattainable. According to the complaint, natural conditions and periodic fluctuations have caused the Catawba River\u2019s flow to fall below 1,100 cubic feet per second. Duke Energy, which generates hydroelectric power from a series of reservoirs on the Catawba River, developed a model to estimate the river\u2019s flow if the river were not impounded. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b68, 16. The complaint notes that according to Duke Energy\u2019s model, the Catawba River \u2014 even in its natural state \u2014 often would not deliver into South Carolina a minimum average daily flow of 1,100 cubic feet per second. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 16; App. to Motion of State of South Carolina for Leave To File Complaint, Complaint, and Brief in Support of its Motion for Leave To File Complaint 18. South Carolina contends that North Carolina\u2019s authorization of large transfers of water from the Catawba River basin has exacerbated these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Shortly after we granted leave to file the complaint, two of the entities named in the complaint \u2014 the CRWSP and Duke Energy \u2014 filed motions for leave to intervene as parties. The CRWSP sought leave to intervene as a party-defendant, asserting its interest as a \u201criparian user of the Catawba River\u201d and claiming that this interest was not adequately represented because of the CRWSP\u2019s \u201cinterstate nature.\u201d Motion of CRWSP for Leave To Intervene and Brief in Support of Motion 8, 9. Specifically, the CRWSP noted that it is a bistate entity that is jointly owned and regulated by, and supplies water to, North Carolina\u2019s Union County and South Carolina\u2019s Lancaster County. <em>Id., </em>at 9. Duke Energy sought leave to intervene and file an answer, asserting an interest as the operator of 11 dams and reservoirs on the Catawba River that control the river\u2019s flow, as the holder of a 50-year license<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> governing Duke Energy\u2019s hydroelectric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>power operations, and as the entity that orchestrated the multistakeholder negotiation process culminating in a Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement (CRA) signed by 70 entities from both States in 2006. Duke Energy\u2019s Motion and Brief in Support of Motion To Intervene and File Answer, and Answer 2, 5. This CRA set forth the terms under which Duke Energy has applied to renew its FERC license, <em>id., </em>at 5, and Duke Energy asserted that neither State would represent its \u201cparticular amalgam of federal, state and private interests,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 14. South Carolina opposed both motions, and we referred them to the Special Master. 552 U. S. 1160 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">One month later, a third entity named in the complaint, the city of Charlotte, also sought leave to intervene as a party-defendant. In its brief, Charlotte asserted an interest, both as the holder of a permit authorizing the transfer of 33 mgd from the Catawba River basin \u2014 the largest single transfer identified in the complaint \u2014 and as the potential source of the 10 mgd transfer approved for the cities of Concord and Kannapolis. Motion for Leave To Intervene of City of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Brief in Support of Motion 5, 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Charlotte argued that North Carolina could not represent the city\u2019s interests effectively because the State was dutybound to represent the interests of all North Carolina users of the Catawba River\u2019s water, including users whose interests were not aligned with Charlotte\u2019s. <em>Id., </em>at 17. South Carolina also opposed Charlotte\u2019s motion, and we referred it to the Special Master. 552 U. S. 1254 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Special Master held a hearing and issued an order granting all three motions for leave to intervene. At South Carolina\u2019s request, the Special Master set forth her findings and decision as a First Interim Report, and it is this Report to which South Carolina now presents exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Special Master recognized that this Court has exercised jurisdiction over nonstate parties in original actions between two or more States. She also recognized that in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S. 369, the Court considered the \u201cappropriate standard\u201d for a nonstate entity\u2019s motion to intervene in an original action. First Interim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138, Orig., p. 12 (First Interim Rept.). But in attempting to give context to our standard, she looked beyond intervention and considered original actions in which the Court has allowed nonstate entities to be named as defendants by the complaining State. From those examples, the Special Master \u201cdistilled the following rule\u201d governing motions to intervene in original actions by non-state entities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cAlthough the Court\u2019s original jurisdiction presumptively is reserved for disputes between sovereign states over sovereign matters, non-state entities may become parties to such original disputes in appropriate and compelling circumstances, such as where the non-state entity is the instrumentality authorized to carry out the wrongful conduct or injury for which the complaining state seeks relief, where the non-state entity has an independent property interest that is directly implicated by the original dispute or is a substantial factor in the dispute, where the non-state entity otherwise has a \u2018direct stake\u2019 in the outcome of the action within the meaning of the Court\u2019s cases discussed above, or where, together with one or more of the above circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>presence of the non-state entity would advance the 'full exposition\u2019 of the issues.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 20-21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Applying this broad rule, the Special Master found that each proposed intervenor had a sufficiently compelling interest to justify intervention. The Special Master rejected South Carolina\u2019s proposal to limit intervention to the remedy phase of this litigation and recommended that this Court grant the motions to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Participation by nonstate parties in actions arising under our original jurisdiction is not a new development. Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution expressly contemplates suits \u201cbetween a State and Citizens of another State\u201d as falling within our original jurisdiction, see, <em>e. g., Georgia </em>v. Brailsford, 2 Dall. 402 (1792), and for more than two centuries the Court has exercised that jurisdiction over nonstate parties in suits between two or more States, see <em>New York </em>v. <em>Connecticut, 4 </em>Dall. 1 (1799); <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>180 U. S. 208, 224-225 (1901). Nonstate entities have even participated as parties in disputes between States, such as the one before us now, where the States were seeking equitable apportionment of water resources. See, <em>e. g., Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S. 605, 608, n. 1 (1988); <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>343 U. S. 932 (1952); <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>279 U. S. 823 (1929) <em>(per curiam). </em>It is, thus, not a novel proposition to accord party status to a citizen in an original action between States.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">This Court likewise has granted leave, under appropriate circumstances, for nonstate entities to intervene as parties in original actions between States for nearly 90 years. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981). In <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>258 U. S. 574, 581, 598 (1922), a boundary dispute that threatened to erupt in armed hostilities, the Court allowed individual and corporate citizens to intervene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>to protect their rights in contested land. See, <em>e. g., Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>254 U. S. 609 (1920).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More recently, the Court has allowed a municipality to intervene in a sovereign boundary dispute, see <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>426 U. S. 465, 466 (1976) <em>(per curiam), </em>and has permitted private corporations to intervene in an original action challenging a State\u2019s imposition of a tax that burdened interstate commerce and contravened the Supremacy Clause, see <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>at 745, n. 21;</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In this case, the Special Master crafted a rule of intervention that accounts for the full compass of our precedents. But a compelling reason for allowing citizens to participate in one original action is not necessarily a compelling reason for allowing citizens to intervene in all original actions. We therefore decline to adopt the Special Master\u2019s proposed rule. As the Special Master acknowledged, the Court in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>set down the \u201cappropriate standard\u201d for intervention in original actions by nonstate entities. First Interim Rept. 12. We believe the standard that we applied in that case applies equally well here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In 1929, the State of New Jersey sued the State of New York and city of New York for their diversion of the Dela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ware River\u2019s headwaters. 345 U. S., at 370. The Court granted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania leave to intervene and, in 1931, entered a decree enjoining certain diversions of water by the State of New York and the city of New York. <em>Id., </em>at 371. In 1952, the city of New York moved to modify the decree, and New Jersey and Pennsylvania filed oppositions. After the Court referred the matter to a Special Master, the city of Philadelphia sought leave to intervene on the basis of its use of the Delaware River\u2019s water. <em>Id., </em>at 371-372.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">This Court denied Philadelphia leave to intervene. Pennsylvania had intervened <em>pro interesse suo </em>\u201cto protect the rights and interests of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania in the Delaware River.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 374; see also <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>283 U. S. 336, 342 (1931). In view of Pennsylvania\u2019s participation, the Court wrote that when a State is \u201ca party to a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest,\u201d it is <em>parens patriae </em>and \u201c \u2018must be deemed to represent all [of] its citizens.\u2019\u201d 345 U. S., at 372-373 (quoting <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>281 U. S. 163, 173-174 (1930)). This principle serves the twin purposes of ensuring that due respect is given to \u201csovereign dignity\u201d and providing \u201ca working rule for good judicial administration.\u201d 345 U. S., at 373. The Court, thus, set forth the following standard governing intervention in an original action by a nonstate entity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\u201cAn intervenor whose state is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not properly represented by the state.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On several subsequent occasions the Court has reaffirmed this \u201cgeneral rule.\u201d See <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>515 U. S. 1, 21-22 (1995); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>412 U. S. 534, 538 (1973) <em>(per curiam); Illinois </em>v. <em>Milwaukee, </em>406 U. S. 91, 97 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>We acknowledge that the standard for intervention in original actions by nonstate entities is high \u2014 and appropriately so. Such actions tax the limited resources of this Court by requiring us \u201cawkwardly to play the role of factfinder\u201d and diverting our attention from our \u201cprimary responsibility as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., </em>401 U. S. 493, 498 (1971); <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725, 762 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In order to ensure that original actions do not assume the \u201cdimensions of ordinary class actions,\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 373, we exercise our original jurisdiction \u201csparingly\u201d and retain \u201csubstantial discretion\u201d to decide whether a particular claim requires \u201can original forum in this Court,\u201d <em>Mississippi </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>506 U. S. 73, 76 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Respect for state sovereignty also calls for a high threshold to intervention by nonstate parties in a sovereign dispute committed to this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. Under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1251, this Court exercises \u201coriginal and exclusive\u201d jurisdiction to resolve controversies between States that, if arising among independent nations, \u201cwould be settled by treaty or by force.\u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>206 U. S. 46, 98 (1907). This Court has described its original jurisdiction as \u201cdelicate and grave,\u201d <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), and has guarded against its use as a forum in which \u201ca state might be judicially impeached on matters of policy by its own subjects,\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373. In its sovereign capacity, a State represents the interests of its citizens in an original action, the disposition of which binds the citizens. <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, supra, </em>at 22; <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 372-373. A respect for sovereign dignity, therefore, counsels in favor of restraint in allowing nonstate entities to intervene in such disputes. See <em>ibid.; </em>accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>143 U. S. 621, 643 (1892) (\u201c[Exclusive jurisdiction was given to this court, because it best comported with the dignity of a State, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ease in which it was a party should be determined in the highest, rather than in a subordinate judicial tribunal of the nation\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">That the standard for intervention in original actions by nonstate entities is high, however, does not mean that it is insurmountable. Indeed, as the Special Master correctly recognized, our practice long has been to allow such intervention in compelling circumstances. See <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>258 U. S., at 581. Over the \u201cstrong objections\u201d of three States, for example, the Court allowed Indian tribes to intervene in a sovereign dispute concerning the equitable apportionment of the Colorado River. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S., at 613. The Court did so notwithstanding the Tribes\u2019 simultaneous representation by the United States. <em>Id., </em>at 608-609, 612. And in a boundary dispute among Texas, Louisiana, and the United States, the Court allowed the city of Port Arthur, Texas, to intervene for the purpose of protecting its interests in islands in which the United States claimed title. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>426 U. S., at 466; <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>416 U. S. 965 (1974). In both of these examples, the Court found compelling interests that warranted allowing nonstate entities to intervene in original actions in which the intervenors were nominally represented by sovereign parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Applying the standard of <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>here, we conclude that the CRWSP has demonstrated a suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ficiently compelling interest that is unlike the interests of other citizens of the States. The CRWSP is an unusual municipal entity, established as a joint venture with the encouragement of regulatory authorities in both States and designed to serve the increasing water needs of Union County, North Carolina, and Lancaster County, South Carolina. It has an advisory board consisting of representatives from both counties, (\u00bfraws its revenues from its bistate sales, and operates infrastructure and assets that are owned by both counties as tenants-in-common. We are told that approximately 100,000 individuals in each State receive their water from the CRWSP and that \u201croughly half\u201d of the CRWSP\u2019s total withdrawals of water from the Catawba River go to South Carolina consumers. Reply of CRWSP to Exceptions of South Carolina to First Interim Report of Special Master 22 (hereinafter CRWSP Reply). It is difficult to conceive of a more purely bistate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In addition, the CRWSP relies upon authority granted by both States to draw water from the Catawba River and transfer that water from the Catawba River basin. The CRWSP draws all of its water from an intake located below the Lake Wylie dam in South Carolina. South Carolina licensed the CRWSP to withdraw a total of 100 mgd from the Catawba River and issued a certificate to the CRWSP in 1989 authorizing up to 20 mgd to be transferred out of the Catawba River basin. <em>Id., </em>at 6-7; Answer to Bill of Complaint \u00b6 21. Lancaster County currently uses approximately 2 mgd of this amount, Union County uses approximately 5 mgd, and the remaining 18 mgd are not used at this time. CRWSP Reply 7. The CRWSP pumps Union County\u2019s allocation across the state border pursuant to a parallel certificate issued by North Carolina authorizing a 5 mgd transfer, <em>ibid., </em>and the complaint specifically identifies this transfer as contributing to South Carolina\u2019s harm, Complaint \u00b621. Thus, the CRWSP\u2019s activities depend upon authority conferred by both States.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>On these facts, we think it is clear that the CRWSP has carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in the outcome of this litigation that distinguishes the CRWSP from all other citizens of the party States. See <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 373. Apart from its interest as a user of the Catawba River\u2019s water, the CRWSP has made a $30 million investment in its plant and infrastructure, with each participating county incurring approximately half of this cost as debt. Each county is responsible for one-half of the CRWSP\u2019s cost of operations, and the venture is designed to break even from year to year. Any disruption to the CRWSP\u2019s operations would increase \u2014 not lessen \u2014 the difficulty of our task in achieving a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d allocation in this dispute. See <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>325 U. S. 589, 618 (1945). We believe that the CRWSP has shown a compelling interest in protecting the viability of its operations, which are premised on a fine balance between the joint venture\u2019s two participating counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We are further persuaded that neither State can properly represent the interests of the CRWSP in this litigation. See <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373. The complaint attributes a portion of the total water transfers that have harmed South Carolina to the CRWSP, yet North Carolina expressly states that it \u201ccannot represent the interests of the joint venture.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. A moment\u2019s reflection reveals why this is so. In this dispute, as in all disputes over limited resources, each State maximizes its equitable share of the Catawba River\u2019s water only by arguing that the other State\u2019s equitable share must be reduced. See, <em>e. g., Colorado </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>459 U. S. 176, 186-187 (1982). It is thus likely that North Carolina, in response to South Carolina\u2019s demand for a greater share of the Catawba River\u2019s water, will take the position that downstream users \u2014 such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>as Lancaster County<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 should receive less water. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (\u201cFrom North Carolina\u2019s perspective, South Carolina is receiving much more water under this negotiated agreement than they could ever hope to achieve in an equitable apportionment action\u201d). The stresses that this litigation would place upon the CRWSP threaten to upset the fine balance on which the joint venture is premised, and neither State has sufficient interest in maintaining that balance to represent the full scope of the CRWSP\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Accordingly, we believe that the CRWSP should be allowed to intervene to represent its own compelling interests in this litigation. We thus overrule South Carolina\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We conclude, as well, that Duke Energy has demonstrated powerful interests that likely will shape the outcome of this litigation. To place these interests in context, it is instructive to consider the \u201cflexible\u201d process by which we arrive at a \u201c \u2018just and equitable\u2019 apportionment\u201d of an interstate stream. <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 183. We do not approach the task in formulaic fashion, <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>283 U. S., at 343, but we consider \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including, but not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201c \u2018physical and climatic conditions, the consumptive use of water in the several sections of the river, the character and rate of return flows, the extent of established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>uses, the availability of storage water, the practical effect of wasteful uses on downstream areas, [and] the damage to upstream areas as compared to the benefits to downstream areas if a limitation is imposed on the former.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 183 (quoting <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, supra, </em>at 618).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In performing this task, there is no substitute for \u201c \u2018the exercise of an informed judgment,\u2019\u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 183, and we will not hesitate to seek out the most relevant information from the source best situated to provide it. See <em>Maryland, </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S., at 745, n. 21 (allowing intervention of private pipeline companies \u201cin the interest of a full exposition of the issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">With these considerations in mind, we turn to Duke Energy\u2019s asserted interests. Duke Energy operates 11 dams and reservoirs in both States that generate electricity for the region and control the flow of the river. The complaint itself acknowledges the relationship between river flow and Duke Energy's operations, noting that a severe drought that ended in 2002 forced Duke Energy to \u201creduce dramatically\u201d its hydroelectric power generation from the Catawba River. Complaint \u00b6 17(c). It is likely that any equitable apportionment of the river will need to take into account the amount of water that Duke Energy needs to sustain its operations and provide electricity to the region, thus giving Duke Energy a strong interest in the outcome of this litigation. See <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>at 188 (noting the appropriateness of considering \u201cthe balance of harm and benefit that might result\u201d from a State\u2019s proposed diversion of a river). There is, moreover, no other similarly situated entity on the Catawba River, setting Duke Energy\u2019s interests apart from the class of all other citizens of the States. See <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Just as important, Duke Energy has a unique and compelling interest in protecting the terms of its existing FERC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>license and the CRA that forms the basis of Duke Energy\u2019s pending renewal application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Through its dams, Duke Energy controls the flow of the Catawba River under the terms of its 50-year FERC license, which regulates the very subject matter in dispute: the river\u2019s minimum flow into South Carolina. See Order Issuing License (Major), <em>Duke Power Co., Project No. 2232, </em>20 F. P. C. 360, 371-372 (1958) (Arts. 31 and 32). The CRA, likewise, represents the full consensus of 70 parties from both States regarding the appropriate minimum continuous flow of Catawba River water into South Carolina under a variety of natural conditions and, in times of drought, the conservation measures to be taken by entities that withdraw water from the Catawba River. These factors undeniably are relevant to any \u201cjust and equitable apportionment\u201d of the Catawba River, see <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>459 U. S., at 183, and we are likely to consider them in reaching our ultimate disposition of this case. Thus, we find that Duke Energy has carried its burden of showing unique and compelling interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We also have little difficulty in concluding that neither State sufficiently represents these compelling interests. Neither State has signed the CRA or expressed an intention to defend its terms. To the contrary, North Carolina has expressed an intention to seek its modification. Tr. of Oral Arg. 51-52. Given the importance of Duke Energy\u2019s interests and their relevance to our ultimate decision, we believe these interests should be represented by a party in this action, and we find that neither State is situated to do so properly. We believe that Duke Energy should be permitted to represent its own interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">For these reasons, we agree with the Special Master that Duke Energy should be permitted to intervene, and we overrule South Carolina\u2019s exception in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"AcO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We conclude, however, that Charlotte has not carried its burden of showing a sufficient interest for intervention in this action. Charlotte is a municipality of North Carolina, and for purposes of this litigation, its transfers of water from the Catawba River basin constitute part of North Carolina\u2019s equitable share. While it is true that the complaint names Charlotte as an entity authorized by North Carolina to carry out a large transfer of water from the Catawba River basin, the complaint does not seek relief against Charlotte directly. Rather, the complaint seeks relief against all North Carolina-authorized transfers of water from the Catawba River basin, \u201cpast or future,\u201d in excess of North Carolina\u2019s equitable share. Complaint, Prayer for Relief \u00b62. Charlotte, therefore, occupies a class of affected North Carolina users of water, and the magnitude of Charlotte\u2019s authorized transfer does not distinguish it in kind from other members of the class. See <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373, and n. (noting that Philadelphia represented half of Pennsylvania\u2019s citizens in the watershed). Nor does Charlotte represent interstate interests that fall on both sides of this dispute, as the CRWSP does, such that the viability of Charlotte\u2019s operations in the face of this litigation is called into question. Its interest is solely as a user of North Carolina\u2019s share of the Catawba River\u2019s water.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Charlotte\u2019s interest falls squarely within the category of interests with respect to which a State must be deemed to represent all of its citizens. As we recognized in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>a State\u2019s sovereign interest in ensuring an equitable share of an interstate river\u2019s water is precisely the type of interest that the State, as <em>parens patriae, </em>represents on behalf of its citizens. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>412 U. S., at 539; <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>325 U. S., at 616. That is why, in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>we required that a proposed intervenor show a compelling interest \u201cin his own right,\u201d distinct from the collective interest of \u201call other citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>zens and creatures of the state,\u201d whose interest the State presumptively represents in matters of sovereign policy. <em>Id., </em>at 373. We conclude that Charlotte has not carried that burden. Thus, respect for \u201csovereign dignity\u201d requires us to recognize that North Carolina properly represents Charlotte in this dispute over a matter of uniquely sovereign interest. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">North Carolina\u2019s own statements only reinforce this conclusion. North Carolina has said that it will defend Charlotte\u2019s authorized 33 mgd transfer. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-53. The State expressly disagrees with Charlotte\u2019s assertion that the city\u2019s interest is not adequately represented by the State. Brief for State of North Carolina in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Exceptions 22. Indeed, in response to Charlotte\u2019s motion to intervene, North Carolina wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201c[T]he State must represent the interests of every person that uses water from the North Carolina portion of the Catawba River basin. In fact, the State has a particular concern for its political subdivisions, such as Charlotte, which actually operate the infrastructure to provide water to the State\u2019s citizens.... The State has every reason to defend the [transfers] that it has authorized for the benefit of its citizens. The State cannot agree with any implication that because it represents all of the users of water in North Carolina it cannot, or will not[,] represent the interests of Charlotte in this litigation initiated by South Carolina.\u201d Brief for State of North Carolina in Response to City of Charlotte\u2019s Motion for Leave To Intervene and File Answer 1-2, \u00b6 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">These statements are consistent with North Carolina\u2019s role as <em>parens patriae, </em>and we see no reason that North Carolina cannot represent Charlotte\u2019s interest in this sovereign dispute. See <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 374 (noting that Philadelphia\u2019s interest \u201cis invariably served by the Commonwealth\u2019s position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Because we are not persuaded that Charlotte\u2019s interest is sufficiently unique and not properly represented by North Carolina to require the city\u2019s intervention as a party in this litigation, we sustain South Carolina\u2019s exception.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We thus overrule South Carolina\u2019s exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s First Interim Report with respect to the CRWSP and Duke Energy, but we sustain South Carolina\u2019s exception with respect to Charlotte.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\"> The license was issued in 1958 to Duke Energy\u2019s predecessor by the Federal Power Commission, a predecessor of the FERC.

S. C. \u00a7 1341, was not. North Carolina opposed this argument, and the Special Master did not rely on it in recommending that Charlotte\u2019s motion to intervene should be granted.

North Carolina\u2019s adequate representation of Charlotte and the heightened standard for intervention in original actions, see <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U.

The majority goes on, however, to misapply our established test in granting intervention to Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (Duke Energy), and the Catawba River Water Supply-Project (CRWSP).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The result is literally unprecedented: Even though equitable apportionment actions are a significant part of our original docket, this Court has never before granted intervention in such a case to an entity other than a State, the United States, or an Indian tribe. Never. That is because the apportionment of an interstate waterway is a sovereign dispute, and the key to intervention in such an action is just that \u2014 sovereignty. The Court\u2019s decision to permit nonsovereigns to intervene in this case has the potential to alter in a fundamental way the nature of our original jurisdiction, transforming it from a means of resolving high disputes between sovereigns into a forum for airing private interests. Given the importance of maintaining the proper limits on that jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Two basic principles have guided the exercise of our constitutionally conferred original jurisdiction. The first is an appreciation that our original jurisdiction, \u201cdelicate and grave,\u201d <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>176 U. S. 1, 15 (1900), was granted to provide a forum for the peaceful resolution of weighty controversies involving the States. \u201cThe model case for invocation of this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction is a dispute between States of such seriousness that it would amount to <em>casus belli </em>if the States were fully sovereign.\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S. 554, 571, n. 18 (1983). In determining whether to exercise original jurisdiction, we accordingly focus on \u201cthe nature of the interest of the complaining State,\u201d and in particular the \u201cseriousness and dignity\u201d of the claim asserted. <em>Mississippi </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>506 U. S. 73, 77 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Original jurisdiction is for the resolution of <em>state </em>claims, not private claims. To invoke that jurisdiction, a State \u201cmust, of course, represent an interest of her own and not merely that of her citizens or corporations.\u201d <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>346 U. S. 368, 370 (1953); see <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>533 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>U. S. 1, 8-9 (2001); <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>426 U. S. 660, 665 (1976) <em>(per </em>curiam) (It is \u201csettled doctrine that a State has standing to sue only when its sovereign or quasi-sovereign interests are implicated and it is not merely litigating as a volunteer the personal claims of its citizens\u201d). And in deciding whether a State meets that requirement, this Court considers whether the State is \u201cin full control of [the] litigation.\u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, supra, </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The second guiding principle is a practical one: We are not well suited to assume the role of a trial judge. See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., </em>401 U. S. 493, 498 (1971). We have attempted to address that reality by relying on the services of able special masters, who have become vitally important in allowing us to manage our original docket. But the responsibility for the exercise of this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction remains Ours alone under the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">These two considerations \u2014 that our original jurisdiction is limited to high claims affecting state sovereignty, and that practical realities limit our ability to act as a trial court\u2014 converge in our standard for intervention in original actions. We articulated that standard in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S. 369, 373 (1953) <em>(per </em>curiam). There, we denied the city of Philadelphia\u2019s motion for leave to intervene in an action, to which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was already a party, involving the apportionment of the Delaware River. <em>Id., </em>at 373-374. We set out the following test for intervention in an original action: \u201cAn intervenor whose state is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state, which interest is not properly represented by the state.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">This exacting standard is grounded on a \u201cnecessary recognition of sovereign dignity,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>under which \u201cthe state, when a party to a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest, \u2018must be deemed to represent all its citizens,\u2019\u201d <em>id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>372-373 (quoting <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>281 U. S. 163, 173-174 (1930)). In applying that doctrine to motions to intervene, the <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>test precludes a State from being \u201cjudicially impeached on matters of policy by its own subjects,\u201d and prevents the use of the Court\u2019s original jurisdiction to air \u201cintramural disput\u00e9is]\u201d that should be settled in a different forum \u2014 namely, within the States. 345 U. S., at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>test is also \u201ca working rule for good judicial administration.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Without it, \u201cthere would be no practical limitation on the number of citizens, as such, who would be entitled to be made parties.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, the Court observed that allowing Philadelphia to intervene would have made it difficult to refuse attempts to intervene by other users of water from the Delaware River, including other cities, and even \u201c[l]arge industrial plants.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>test, properly applied, provides a much-needed limiting principle that prevents the expansion of our original proceedings \u201cto the dimensions of ordinary class actions,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>or \u201ctown-meeting lawsuits,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 376 (Jackson, J., dissenting). See also <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., supra, </em>at 504; <em>Utah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U. S. 89, 95-96 (1969) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Applying these principles, this Court has never granted a nonsovereign entity\u2019s motion to intervene in an equitable apportionment action. The reason is straightforward: An interest in water is an interest shared with other citizens, and is properly pressed or defended by the State. And a private entity\u2019s interest in its particular share of the State\u2019s water, once the water is allocated between the States, is an \u201cintramural dispute\u201d to be decided by each State on its own. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The interests of a State\u2019s citizens in the use of water derive entirely from the State\u2019s sovereign interest in the wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>terway. If the State has no claim to the waters of an interstate river, then its citizens have none either. See <em>Hinderlider </em>v. <em>La Plata River &amp; Cherry Creek Ditch Co., </em>304 U. S. 92, 102 (1938). We have long recognized, therefore, that the State must be deemed to represent its citizens\u2019 interests in an equitable apportionment action. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nevada, </em>412 U. S. 534, 539 (1973) <em>(per </em>curiam) (\u201cFor the purposes of dividing the waters of an interstate stream with another State, [a State] has the right, <em>parens patriae, </em>to represent all the nonfederal users in its own State insofar as the share allocated to the other State is concerned\u201d). Precisely because the State represents all its citizens in an equitable apportionment action, these citizens have no claim themselves against the other State. They are instead \u201cbound by the result reached through representation by their respective States,\u201d regardless of whether those citizens are parties to the suit. <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>515 U. S. 1, 22 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">This basic principle applies without regard to whether the State agrees with and will advance the particular interest asserted by a specific private entity. The State \u201c \u2018must be deemed to represent <em>all </em>its citizens,\u2019\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 372-373 (quoting <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Indiana, supra, </em>at 173-174; emphasis added), not just those who subscribe to the State\u2019s position before this Court. The directive that a State cannot be \u201cjudicially impeached on matters of policy by its own subjects,\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373, obviously applies to the case in which a subject disagrees with the position of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">A State\u2019s citizens also need not be made parties to an equitable apportionment action because the Court\u2019s judgment in such an action does not determine the water rights of any individual citizen. We made that clear long ago in two decisions arising from the same dispute, <em>Wyoming </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>298 U. S. 573 (1936), and <em>Wyoming </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>309 U. S. 572 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>(1940). In those cases, Wyoming sought to enforce this Court\u2019s earlier decree apportioning the Laramie River. See <em>Wyoming </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>260 U. S. 1 (1922). We held that the decree controlled the allocation of water between Wyoming and Colorado, not within them. As we recognized, our decision apportioning the river did not \u201cwithdraw water claims dealt with therein from the operation of local laws relating to their transfer or ... restrict their utilization in ways not affecting the rights of one State and her claimants as against the other State and her claimants.\u201d 298 U. S., at 584. Thus, although the decree referred to particular uses of water in Colorado, we held that those individual uses could vary from the terms set out in the decree, so long as the total diversion of water in Colorado was no greater than the decree allowed. See <em>id., </em>at 584-585; 309 U. S., at 579-581. We reiterated the point in <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>325 U. S. 589, 627 (1945), observing that the apportionment of a waterway between the States has only an \u201cindirect effect\u201d on the rights of individuals within the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">All this explains our long history of rejecting attempts by nonsovereign entities to intervene in equitable apportionment actions. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>was itself an equitable apportionment suit, and we denied intervention in that case. We have also summarily denied motions to intervene in other water disputes between the States. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>514 U. S. 1081 (1995); <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>345 U. S. 914 (1953); <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>296 U. S. 548 (1935); <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>279 U. S. 821 (1929). And we have strongly intimated in other decisions (albeit in dictum) that private entities can rarely, if ever, intervene in original actions involving the apportionment of interstate waterways. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>at 538 (\u201cindividual users of water . . . ordinarily would have no right to intervene in an original action in this Court\u201d); <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>515 U. S., at 22 (\u201cWe have said on many occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>sions that water disputes among States may be resolved by compact or decree without the participation of individual claimants\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The majority contends that the result in this case is not a \u201cnew development,\u201d and that its holding is supported by \u201cnearly 90 years\u201d of precedent. <em>Ante, </em>at 264. But in support of those statements, the majority cites only four decisions in which the Court has granted a motion to intervene in an original suit \u2014 and of course none in which this Court granted the motion of a nonsovereign entity to intervene in an equitable apportionment action. The cases the majority cites demonstrate what constitutes a \u201ccompelling interest in [the intervenor\u2019s] own right, apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 873. But the intervenor interests in those cases were quite different from the general shared interest in water at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Take <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>460 U. S. 605 (1983). There we allowed several Indian Tribes to intervene in a water dispute. <em>Id., </em>at 615. As the Court in that case made clear, however, the Indian Tribes were allowed to intervene because they were sovereign entities. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court distinguished <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>on that very ground. See 460 U. S., at 615, n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The other cases relied upon by the majority are even farther afield. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>451 U. S. 725 (1981); <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>426 U. S. 465 (1976) <em>(per </em>curiam); <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>258 U. S. 574 (1922). None was an equitable apportionment action. Two involved boundary disputes in which the Court allowed nonsovereign intervenors to claim title to certain parcels of property. See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>at 466 (permitting intervention by the city of Port Arthur, Texas); <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>at 580-581 (same for private parties). A claim to title in a particular piece of property is quite different from a general interest shared by all citizens in the State\u2019s waters. And it would be particularly inapt to draw general conclusions about intervention from <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>in which the Court took the southern half of the Red River into receivership. See 258 U. S., at 580. In subsequently allowing persons to intervene to assert claims to the subject property, the Court relied explicitly on the fact that the receiver had possession and control of the claimed parcels, and \u201cno other court lawfully [could] interfere with or disturb that possession or control.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>is equally unavailing. There, several States challenged the constitutionality of Louisiana\u2019s application of a tax on natural gas that was brought into that State. 451 U. S., at 728. In two sentences within a long footnote, the Court mentioned that it was permitting a group of pipeline companies to intervene and challenge the tax. <em>Id., </em>at 745, n. 21. The Court made clear that the pipeline companies were able to intervene in light of the particular circumstances in that case\u2014 namely, Louisiana\u2019s tax was \u201cdirectly imposed on the owner of imported gas,\u201d and \u201cthe pipelines most often own[ed] the gas.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Again, an interest in a tax imposed only on discrete parties is obviously different from a general interest shared by all citizens of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Charlotte, Duke Energy, and CRWSP claim a variety of specific needs for water to justify their intervention. But all those particular needs derive from an interest in the water of the Catawba River. That interest is not exclusive, but is instead shared \u201cwith all other citizens and creatures of the state.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>345 U. S., at 373. The State\u2019s \u201ccitizens and creatures\u201d certainly put the Catawba\u2019s water and flow to different uses \u2014 many for drinking water, some for farming or recreation, others for generating power. That does not, however, make their interest in the water itself unique. And it is the respective interests of the States in the water itself that are being litigated in this original action \u2014 not the claims of particular citizens that they be allowed to put the water to specified uses. The latter subject is \u201can intramural dispute over the distribution of water within the [State],\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and is not the subject of this original proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The majority recognizes as much with respect to Charlotte, <em>ante, </em>at 274-276, but departs from these principles in granting intervention to Duke Energy and CRWSP. The majority\u2019s reasons for doing so do not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The majority initially contends that Duke Energy should be allowed to intervene because it possesses \u201crelevant information\u201d that we are \u201clikely to consider.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 272, 273. Nonparties often do, but that is not a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d justifying intervention. I have little doubt that Philadelphia possessed pertinent information in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>but we did not permit Philadelphia to intervene on that ground. Parties to litigation have ready means of access to relevant information held by nonparties, and those nonparties can certainly furnish such information on their own if they consider it in their best interests (through, for example, participation as <em>amici curiae).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The majority also states that Duke Energy has compelling interests in its hydroelectric operations along the river, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>in \u201cthe amount of water that Duke Energy needs to sustain its operations and provide electricity to the region.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 272. These are simply interests in a particular use of water or its flow. Even if Duke Energy uses water for particularly important purposes, its interests are no different in kind from the interests of any other entity that relies on water for its commercial operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Finally, the majority asserts that Duke Energy \u201chas a unique and compelling interest in protecting the terms of its existing [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)] license and the [Comprehensive Relicensing Agreement (CRA)] that forms the basis of Duke Energy\u2019s pending renewal application.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 272-273. And the majority contends that neither State represents these interests because \u201c[n]either State has signed the CRA or expressed an intention to defend its terms,\u201d and because North Carolina has even expressed its intent to challenge the terms of the CRA in this action. <em>Ante, </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Again, all this amounts to is an articulation of the <em>reason </em>Duke Energy asserts a particular interest in the waters of the Catawba. Other citizens of North Carolina doubtless have reasons of their own, ones they find as important as Duke Energy believes its to be. Weighing those interests is an \u201cintramural\u201d matter for the State. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373. In addition, the Federal Government is doubtless familiar with the pending FERC proceedings, and it sees no corresponding need for us to grant Duke Energy\u2019s motion to intervene. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">As for CRWSP, the Special Master concluded that it should be allowed to intervene, but only because its position was \u201csimilar analytically to Charlotte\u2019s.\u201d First Interim Report of Special Master, O. T. 2008, No. 138, Orig., p. 25. The Court rejects Charlotte\u2019s motion, but nonetheless allows CRWSP to intervene on a ground not relied upon by the Special Master. According to the majority, CRWSP should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>be allowed to intervene because, as a bistate entity, its full range of interests cannot be represented entirely by either North or South Carolina. See <em>ante, </em>at 268-271.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">CRWSP\u2019s motion arguably presents a different case from that of Duke Energy, one not definitively resolved by this Court in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York. </em>At the end of the day, however, I agree with the Special Master\u2019s premise\u2014 CRWSP\u2019s position is really no different from Charlotte\u2019s. I disagree with her conclusion, of course, because I agree with the Court that Charlotte should not be allowed to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A bistate entity cannot be allowed to intervene merely because it embodies an \u201cintermingling of state interests.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 271, n. 6. The same would be true of any bistate entity, or indeed any corporation or individual conducting business in both States. An exception for such cases would certainly swallow the <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>rule. Entities with interests in both States must seek to vindicate those interests within each State. Bistate entities are not States entitled to invoke our original jurisdiction, and should not be effectively accorded an automatic right to intervene as parties in cases within that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">With respect to both Duke Energy and CRWSP, the majority further relies on its conclusion that the States will not \u201cproperly represent\u201d the interests of those entities. <em>Ante, </em>at 270; see <em>ante, </em>at 273. If by that the Court means that the States may adopt positions adverse to Duke Energy and CRWSP, that surely cannot be enough. The guiding principle articulated in <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>is \u201cthat the state, when a party to a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest, \u2018must be deemed to represent all its citizens,\u2019 \u201d and may not be \u201cjudicially impeached on matters of policy by its own subjects.\u201d 345 U. S., at 372-373 (quoting <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>281 U. S., at 173-174). This case involves a \u201cmatter of sovereign interest\u201d \u2014 the equitable apportionment of water\u2014 and the States therefore \u201cproperly represent] \u201d the shared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>interests in water of \u201call\u201d their citizens, including Duke Energy and CRWSP. 345 U. S., at 372-373. An interest is \u201cnot properly represented\u201d by a State, <em>id., </em>at 373, when it is not a sovereign interest but instead a parochial one, such as the interests held to justify intervention in the cases on which the majority relies. See <em>supra, </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The majority also pays little heed to the practical constraints on this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. It is hard to see how the arguments the Court accepts today could not also be pressed by countless other water users in either North or South Carolina. Under the Court\u2019s analysis, I see \u201cno practical limitation on the number of citizens, as such, who would be entitled to be made parties.\u201d <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 373. To the extent intervention is allowed for some private entities with interests in the water, others who also have an interest will feel compelled to intervene as well \u2014 and we will be hard put to refuse them. See <em>Utah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U. S., at 95-96 (denying intervention to a corporation that sought to quiet its title to land because, \u201c[i]f [it were] admitted, fairness would require the admission of any of the other 120 private landowners who wish to quiet their title ..., greatly increasing the complexity of this litigation\u201d). An equitable apportionment action will take on the characteristics of an interpleader case, with all those asserting interests in the limited supply of water jostling for their share like animals at a waterhole. And we will find ourselves in a \u201cquandary whereby we must opt either to pick and choose arbitrarily among similarly situated litigants or to devote truly enormous portions of our energies to [original] matters.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Wyandotte Chemicals Corp., </em>401 U. S., at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Allowing nonsovereign entities to intervene as parties will inevitably prolong the resolution of this and other equitable apportionment actions, which already take considerable time. Intervenors do not come alone \u2014 they bring along more issues to decide, more discovery requests, more excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tions to the recommendations of the Special Master. In particular, intervention makes settling a case more difficult, as a private intervenor has the right to object to a settlement agreement between the States, if not the power to block a settlement altogether. Cf. <em>Firefighters </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>478 U. S. 501, 529 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">And all this for what? The Special Master, and through her the Court, can have the benefit of the views of those seeking to intervene by according them the status of <em>amici curiae. </em>\u201cWhere he presents no new questions, a third party can contribute usually most effectively and always most expeditiously by a brief amicus curiae and not by intervention.\u201d <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Viterna, </em>740 F. 2d 350, 359 (CA5 1984) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Courts often treat <em>amicus </em>participation as an alternative to intervention. See 7C C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1913, p. 495, and n. 26 (2007) (citing examples). And this Court often denies motions to intervene while granting leave to participate as an <em>amicus </em>in original actions generally, see, <em>e. g., Kentucky </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>445 U. S. 941 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>California, </em>377 U. S. 926 (1964); cf. <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>426 U. S. 363, 365, n. 2 (1976), and in equitable apportionment actions specifically, see, <em>e. g., Arizona </em>v. <em>California, </em>530 U. S. 392, 419, n. 6 (2000); <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>507 U. S. 584, 589-590 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\"><em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming </em>is particularly instructive on this point. The Court there adopted the recommendation of the Special Master to deny intervention to certain entities. See <em>id., </em>at 589-590; Second Interim Report of Special Master, O. T. 1991, No. 108, Orig., pp. 108-109. The interests of those entities in the water dispute were quite similar to the interests of the entities seeking to intervene here: One operated a powerplant and a reservoir on the Laramie River, and another was a power district seeking to protect its FERC license. See First Interim Report of Special Master, O. T. 1988, No. 108, Orig., pp. 11-14,9a. While it adopted the Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>cial Master\u2019s recommendation to deny intervention, the Court nonetheless permitted those entities to participate as <em>amici. </em>See 507 U. S., at 589-590; <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em>502 U. S. 1055 (1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority does not explain why that familiar and customary approach might be inadequate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">* <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Our original jurisdiction over actions between States is concerned with disputes so serious that they would be grounds for war if the States were truly sovereign. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>462 U. S., at 571, n. 18. A dispute between States over rights to water fits that bill; a squabble among private entities within a State over how to divvy up that State\u2019s share does not. A judgment in an equitable apportionment action binds the States; it is not binding with respect to particular uses asserted by private entities. Allowing intervention by such entities would vastly complicate and delay already complicated and lengthy actions. And the benefits private entities might bring can be readily secured, as has typically been done, by their participation as <em>amici curiae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In light of all this, it is difficult to understand why the Court grants nonsovereign entities leave to intervene in this equitable apportionment action, and easy to understand why the Court has never before done so in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">I would grant South Carolina\u2019s exceptions, and deny the motions to intervene.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\"> The majority contends that this dissent reads our precedents to establish \u201ca rule against nonstate intervention\u201d in equitable apportionment actions. <em>Ante, </em>at 265, n. 3. The number of nonsovereigns that the Court should permit to intervene in water disputes is small \u2014 indeed, it was zero until today. But that does not mean that a private entity could not satisfy the <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York </em>test by, for example, asserting water-use rights that are not dependent upon the rights of state parties. A private party (or perhaps a Compact Clause entity) with a federal statutory right to a certain quantity of water might have a compelling interest in an equitable apportionment action that is not fairly represented by the States. The putative intervenors in this case, however, do not hold rights of this sort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> No party filed exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s recommendation to deny intervention in <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Wyoming. </em>The Special Master later allowed one of the entities, Basin Electric Power Cooperative, to intervene as a party based on changed circumstances. See Addendum to Reply Brief for Duke Energy 2-5. That decision was never reviewed by the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
