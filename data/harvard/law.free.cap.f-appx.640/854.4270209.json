Prior to filing this \u00a7 3582 motion based on Amendment 782, Guyton filed a previous \u00a7 3582 motion in 2011 based on Amendment 750. In denying that motion, the district court determined, based on the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), that Guyton was responsible for between 120 and 288 kilograms of crack cocaine, and, thus, was ineligible for a sentence reduction since Amendment 750 did not change his guideline range. We vacated and remanded on appeal, concluding that Guyton had disputed the PSI fact that he was responsible for 120 to 288 kilograms of crack cocaine, and the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>therefore erred by relying on it. <em>United States v. Guyton, </em>550 Fed.Appx. 796, 799-800 (11th Cir.2013) (unpublished). On remand, the district court found that the trial evidence supported a finding of 6.0376 kilograms of crack cocaine and 4 kilograms of powder cocaine. However, the district court held that Guyton was not entitled to a further reduction of his total sentence, because, even with the lesser drug quantity, Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range. We affirmed. <em>United States v. Guyton, </em>596 Fed.Appx. 873 (11th Cir.2015) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Guyton then filed the instant \u00a7 3582 motion, which the district court denied on the ground that that his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) reflected that he had distributed 120 to 288 kilograms of crack cocaine. On appeal, Guyton argues that: (1) he qualifies under Amendment 782 for a reduction or modification of his total sentence; and (2) he has a right to be represented by an attorney. The government concedes that the district court erred in denying Guyton\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion. After careful review, we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir. 2012). We review factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s legal conclusions only for clear error. <em>Id. </em>We review the existence of right to counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s decision not to appoint counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009). A concession by the government can be considered, especially if supported by the law and facts. <em>See Lobosco v. Thomas, </em>928 F.2d 1054, 1060 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Amendment 782 revised the guidelines applicable to drug-trafficking offenses by changing how the base offense levels in the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D1.1(c) incorporate the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for those offenses. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782. In a prior version of \u00a7 2D1.1(c), a base offense level of 36 applied if the defendant\u2019s offense involved at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (2013). In the amended version of \u00a7 2D1.1(c), a base offense level of 34 applies if the defendant\u2019s offense level involved at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">In this appeal, the district court erred in denying Guyton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 782, as the government correctly notes. As the record shows, the district court relied on the finding in the PSI that Guyton distributed 120 to 288 kilograms of crack cocaine. However, in Guyton\u2019s appeal from the denial of his 2011 \u00a7 3582 motion, we rejected the district court\u2019s reliance on the disputed PSI facts regarding the quantity of crack cocaine for which Guyton was responsible. The district court subsequently made a factual finding that Guyton was responsible for 6.0376 kilograms of crack cocaine and 4 kilograms of powder cocaine, and we affirmed the denial of Guyton\u2019s 2011 \u00a7 3582 motion based on that quantity finding. Because the district court\u2019s later finding that Guyton distributed 6.0376 kilograms of crack cocaine differed from the disputed PSI fact that he was responsible for 120 to 288 kilograms of crack cocaine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the district court\u2019s reliance- on the disputed PSI fact was clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Furthermore, Guyton would be at least eligible for a reduction based on the district court\u2019s factual finding that 6.0376 kilograms of crack cocaine was involved in Guyton\u2019s offenses. While offenses involving at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of crack cocaine would previously have resulted in a base offense level of 36, currently, offenses involving that quantity of crack cocaine result in a base offense level of 34. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (2013) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3). Because Guyton received a 3-level increase for being a manager or leader of criminal activity and a 2-level increase for obstruction of justice, his total offense level under the revised Guidelines would be 39. Based on a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of III, Guyton\u2019s revised guideline range would be 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 3582 motion, and remand for resentencing. We express no opinion on whether the district court, after considering appropriate factors, should exercise its discretion to grant a reduction. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1), \u201ca court proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2018shall substitute\u2019 the amended Guidelines range for the initial range \u2018and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Despite the foregoing, the district court did not err in denying Guyton\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. In <em>Webb, </em>we held that \u201cthere is no statutory or constitutional right to counsel for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or hearing.\u201d 565 F.3d at 795. As a result, \u201cthe decision to appoint an attorney is left to the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, nothing in the statutory language of \u00a7 3582(c) requires a hearing. <em>See generally </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying him counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
