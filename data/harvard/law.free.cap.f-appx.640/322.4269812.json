Appellees removed to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Ray now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, and we REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Appellant Virgie Ray used to shop at the Stage department store in Plaquemine, Louisiana about once a month. On November 1, 2013, Ray went to the Stage store and proceeded to the \u201cMisses\u201d department. Ray found a pair of pants that she wanted to buy, but was unable to find a matching blouse. Ray asked an employee for help, and the employee walked away with the pants to locate a match. Shortly after, Ray followed the employee, taking the same path through the store. As she attempted to walk between a clothing rack and a nearby register, Ray tripped on the base of the clothing rack and fell to the ground. Ray sustained serious injuries to her knees, face, shoulder, neck, and right eye. The entire incident was captured by a store surveillance camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-18\">Ray filed a petition for damages in Louisiana state court alleging that the clothing rack was a dangerous condition that created an unreasonable risk of harm. Appel-lees removed to federal court and filed a motion for summary judgment. They argued that the clothing rack was an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard, and thus did not create an unreasonable risk of harm. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees. The court reasoned that the \u201cvideo evidence clearly show[ed] that the bottom of the rack was plainly visible and not covered or obscured by the clothes on the racks, any other clothing rack or the employees working the area.\u201d The district court also noted that Ray had made a \u201cbinding admission in which she <em>denied </em>that immediately before she tripped, she did not see the base or bottom of the clothing rack.\u201d Ray timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-20\">We review the grant of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if the record demonstrates \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party when reviewing grants of motions for summary judgment. If the record, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, then there is no genuine issue for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u201cThis dispute is governed by Louisiana\u2019s premises liability statute, which provides that a claimant must prove (1) the condition that caused the injury created an unreasonable risk of harm, (2) the merchant created or had constructive notice of the condition, and (3) the merchant failed to exercise reasonable care.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court concluded that Ray could not establish the first or the third element of her claim because the clothing rack was an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard. Under Louisiana law, an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard generally does not present an \u201cunreasonable risk of harm.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the same vein, a merchant\u2019s duty of reasonable care requires only that it protect customers from \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d hazards.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 dispute thus reduces to whether the clothing rack was an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">The Louisiana Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cthe mere presence of obstacles in a store, such as shopping carts, does not create an unreasonable risk of harm when the condition is open and obvious.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lower Louisiana courts have similarly held that stationary obstacles, such as restocking carts or displays, represent \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees urge that these cases are fully applicable here, as the clothing rack was a stationary obstacle that Ray easily could have avoided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellees, however, fail to recognize a key distinction between these cases and the facts under review. Ray does not contend that the clothing rack, as a whole, was not plainly visible. She argues that the base of the rack jutted out in such a way as to create a tripping hazard. Courts applying Louisiana law have almost uniformly concluded that an otherwise-visible obstacle that protrudes outward near ground level is not \u2014 at least as a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>law \u2014 an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The logic of these decisions is that \u201ca shopper\u2019s attention is usually directed to merchandise, not the floor.\u201d As a result, \u201c[something on the floor which may cause a shopper to trip and fall when her attention is directed toward her purchases is a hazard.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We find these cases persuasive. Though the clothing rack as a whole was quite visible, a reasonable jury could conclude that the low-lying base, which jutted outward around ankle level, was not an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, the normal risk of a protruding obstacle was exacerbated in this case by the narrowness of the pathway between the rack and the register.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And a reasonable jury could further conclude that the clothing rack was \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d under Louisiana\u2019s risk-utility balancing test.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While the clothing rack had some utility, \u201c[t]he likelihood and magnitude of harm to a customer\u201d was \u201cgreat\u201d because the obstacle posed by the base of the rack was not \u201cobvious and apparent.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2022 The cost of preventing the harm was also inconsequential \u2014 Appellees could have easily moved the rack to a different location or cordoned off the area behind the register \u2014 and Ray was not engaged in an inherently dangerous activity. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. A jury should decide whether the clothing rack was \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In reaching this conclusion, we deem it irrelevant whether Ray admitted to seeing the base of the clothing rack. The Louisiana Supreme Court recently reiterated that the relevant inquiry is whether an allegedly \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard is \u201copen and obvious\u201d <em>to all, </em>not just the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>plaintiff.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiffs knowledge may-lead to the inference that others were aware of the hazard,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but the question is one of \u201cglobal knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under this standard, evidence of Ray\u2019s knowledge is insufficient to establish that the rack was an \u201copen and obvious\u201d hazard.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We also reject the relevance of the non-Louisiana authority cited by Appellees. Most of these cases did not involve an obstacle that protruded or flared into a pathway near ground level. The only one that did, <em>Cudney v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>expressly noted that the clothing rack in question did not have \u201can unusual design that caused a tripping hazard.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The evidence here suggests that the clothing rack \u2014 which' was a restocking rack that differed from the permanent clothing racks<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 may have had such \u201can unusual design.\u201d To the extent it did not, <em>Cudney </em>has limited persuasiveness as a decision of Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
