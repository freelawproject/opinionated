As the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">Hankins is a state prisoner currently housed at SCI-Huntingdon and previously housed at SCI-Rockview. During his time at SCI-Rockview, Hankins was repeatedly placed in the Restricted Housing Unit (\u201cRHU\u201d) and on a restricted list due to his conduct. Hankins filed an amended civil rights complaint against members of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (\u201cD.O.C.\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> naming various SCI-Rockview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>administrators and staff as defendants. For brevity\u2019s sake, we will refer to these defendants as the \u201cD.O.C. Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Hankins raised numerous claims, some of which were dismissed by the District Court on motion of the D.O.C. Defendants, and others which were dismissed over the course of discovery. The District Court allowed several of'Hankins\u2019s claims to go forward, namely that:' regulations unconstitutionally prevented him from buying and/or receiving outside publications while housed in the RHU; he was subjected to retaliation for pursuing his legal remedies; and his incoming mail was interfered with. The D.O.C. defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which' the Court granted. Hankins appeals from that order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The District Court .had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Young v. Martin, </em>801 F.3d 172, 177 (3d Cir.2015). A district court may grant summary judgment only when the record \u201cshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a), When making this analysis, a district court must credit the evidence of the non-moving party, and draw all justifiable inferences in the non-movant\u2019s favor. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A mere \u201cscintilla of evidence in support of the [non-moving partyj\u2019s position will be insufficient\u201d to create a genuine issue of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. The nonmoving party \u201cmust show where in the record there exists a genuine dispute over a material fact.\u201d <em>See Doe v. Abington Friends Sch., </em>480 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir.2007). The non-moving party cannot rest on his complaint, but must point to affidavits, depositions, interrogatory answers, and/or any admissions in establishing that there are material, disputed facts. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">A. First Amendment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"A6T\">The District Court correctly entered summary judgment on Hankins\u2019s First Amendment claim. Where a prison regulation imposes restrictions on an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights, that regulation is valid only if \u201cit is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). <em>Turner </em>sets forth four factors for courts to consider when determining if a prison regulation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>in fact reasonable: (1) a valid, rational connection between the regulation and the legitimate, neutral governmental interest; (2) any alternative means of exercising the infringed right; (3) the burden that the accommodation imposes on prison resources; and (4) any readily available alternatives existing that\u2019 would fully accommodate the inmate\u2019s rights with little cost to legitimate penological interests. <em>See Sharp v. Johnson, </em>669 F.3d 144, 156 (3d Cir.2012). The prison has the burden of demonstrating the first factor, and if it meets that burden, we consider the three other factors. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the inmate bears the burden of showing that the regulation is unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Hankins specifically alleged that his First Amendment rights were violated by SCI-Rockview\u2019s restrictive publication policies. The first policy stated that books could not be purchased on the behalf of RHU prisoners, and the second required newspapers to be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. These policies were changed after Hankins filed the current lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">While the defendants changed the policies, they defended the initial, more restrictive policies as legitimate under <em>Turner, </em>and cited <em>Beard v. Banks, </em>548 U.S. 521, 126 S.Ct. 2572, 165 L.Ed.2d 697 (2006), and <em>Iseley v. Beard, </em>841 A.2d 168 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2004), to support their position. Both cases upheld a more restrictive publication policy than what Hankins challenged. Regarding the first <em>Turner </em>factor (and citing <em>Iseley), </em>the D.O.C. defendants argued that there were legitimate, neutral governmental interests regarding the publication regulations: reducing the risk of flammable materials; limiting an inmate\u2019s ability to hide or trade prison contraband; limiting available resources for potential weapons; and providing a form of non-violent behavior modification. They submitted disciplinary reports documenting Hankins\u2019s many outbursts and threats in support of these arguments. They then pointed to alternative means for Hankins and other prisoners to exercise their rights under the second <em>Turner </em>factor. .They noted that prisoners received publications from within the prison; were allowed to keep a copy of a religious text; received materials from pre-existing subscriptions; were allowed to renew newspaper subscriptions; and were allowed to have one newspaper at a, time. Regarding the third <em>Turner </em>factor, the defendants argued that the burden that Hankins\u2019s accommodation request posed a danger to correctional staff and inmates. They provided evidence documenting his history of threatening staff, throwing bodily fluids on staff, assaulting staff, and screaming obscenities. The defendants did not squarely discuss the fourth <em>Turner </em>factor. However, the District Court stated that the defendants had demonstrated that \u201cthere was an absence of available ready alternatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Hankins did not submit evidence that established a genuine dispute over any material fact. Hankins argued that <em>Beard </em>supported his position, but he read the case incorrectly. In <em>Beard, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a blanket ban of publications \u2014 a more severe policy than what Hankins challenged here. <em>See Beard, </em>548 U.S. at 525-26, 126 S.Ct. 2572. Hankins also contended, without any support, that because a prior prison and the next prison he was housed at gave him legal exemptions, that SCI-Rockview should have given him the same privilege. Ultimately, we give state prison officials deference in making such decisions. <em>See Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. As such, the defendants were entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">B. Retaliation Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The District Court correctly entered summary judgment on Hankins\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>taliation claims because he did not provide evidence to establish a causal link between the exercise of his rights and the disciplinary actions taken against him and did not show that his mail was tampered with. In order to succeed in a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must establish three elements. First, he must demonstrate that his conduct was constitutionally protected. Then, he must show retaliatory action \u201csufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights[.]\u201d <em>Fantone v. Latini, </em>780 F.3d 184, 191 (3d Cir.2015) (citing <em>Rauser v. Horn, </em>241 F.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir.2001)). Finally, he must establish a causal link between his constitutionally protected conduct and the adverse action taken against him. <em>Id. </em>In the prison context, the plaintiff has the \u201cinitial burden of proving that his constitutionally protected conduct was \u2018a substantial or motivating factor\u2019 in the decision to discipline him.\u201d <em>Rauser, </em>241 F.3d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Hankins alleged that he was retaliated against because he exercised his right to pursue legal remedies. He stated that: SCI-Rockview medical staff ignored his requests to trim his toe-nails, for sensitive toothpaste, and for replacement eyeglasses; he was denied permission to purchase or receive religious and non-religious publications; and he was prevented from receiving incoming mail and newspapers. Hankins also alleged that he was prevented from accessing his legal property and was improperly placed on total movement restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In their motion for summary judgment, the defendants most explicitly pointed to record evidence regarding causation. First, regarding Hankins\u2019s medical retaliation claims, they noted his medical requests, while delayed, were in fact complied with. The delays were due to D.O.C. bureaucratic requirements and restrictions. Next, regarding his publications retaliation claim, the defendants noted that the publication policies at issue existed before Hankins was transferred to SCI-Rockview, and so that applying the policies to him were not retaliatory. Next, the defendants argued that Hankins did not adequately define his mail retaliation claim, but all the same, pointed to record evidence showing that he received at least six letters from an attorney and letters from his sister, and that he has been able to successfully access the courts with his filings. Regarding his legal property retaliation claim, the defendants noted that under D.O.C. policy, Hankins had access on a monthly basis to his legal property, and that in practice, his requests to access that property was granted. Finally, regarding his restricted movement claim, the defendants pointed to the fact that.Han-kins had a. history of activities restrictions to establish that placing him on total movement restriction was not unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Despite all of the evidence he provided, Hankins did not establish a genuine dispute over any material fact. He did not point to any facts actually raising a genuine issue of fact regarding retaliatory motives on the part of the defendants. Accordingly, the defendants were entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">For the reasons stated above, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-12\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-20\">. Defendants Bureau of Healthcare Services; D.O.C. Secretary John Wetzel; Deputy Secretary Shirley Moore Smeal; Regional Staff Assistants Brad Newton and Jeffrey Witherite; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Grievance Officers Michael Bell and Dorina Varner; and Julie Pensiero/Koltay and Jeremy Tipton were dismissed over the course of motions practice. Hankins also named a set of Jane Doe nurses, but their identities were never clarified and so were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">. This case was initially listed for possible dismissal due to a jurisdictional defect. The District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment was entered on March 27, 2015. Han-kins filed a document on April 17, 2015, called \u201cObjections,\u201d and then filed his notice of appeal on May 18, 2015. The District Court construed the \"Objections\u201d as a motion for reconsideration and denied it on November 2, 2015. Because the document was not a clear motion for reconsideration, Hankins\u2019s notice of appeal appeared untimely, but was, in fact, timely. Hankins did not appeal from the District Court\u2019s November order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii). Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over the order granting summary judgment, but not the order denying reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\">.
