Guevara-Miranda pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine but reserved his right on appeal to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. He renews his argument that the Government' failed to prove that he voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle that revealed the narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Government is required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a detainee\u2019s consent to search was \u201cfreely and voluntarily given,\u201d which is determined from the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.3d 193, 198-99 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The reviewing court considers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACA\">(1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 199 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). All of the factors \u201care relevant, but no one [factor] ... is disposi-tive or controlling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">We review the voluntariness of a detainee\u2019s consent for clear error. <em>United States v. Tompkins, </em>130 F.3d 117, 120 (5th Cir. 1997). We find such an error only if we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2010), upholding the ruling \u201cif there is any reasonable view of the evidence to support it,\u201d <em>United States v. Massi, </em>761 F.3d 512, 520 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and are particularly deferential where the district court \u201chad the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>421 F.3d 352, 357 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Guevara-Miranda contends primarily that his consent was involuntary because a language barrier between him and the state trooper who conducted the search weighs several of the factors in his favor. Specifically, he argues that the use of English by the trooper, Christopher Wright, was coercive because of the language barrier; that Guevara-Miranda merely \u201cacquiesced\u201d to Wright\u2019s hand signals and did not \u201ccooperate\u201d with his commands in English because Guevara-Miranda could not understand them; and that the Government failed to show that he was aware of his right to refuse consent because there was no evidence that he could read the consent form written in Spanish, no evidence of prior experience with the criminal justice system, and no evidence of his educational level or intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">The claim that Wright\u2019s use of English was coercive is inconsistent with the type of coercive police conduct we have recognized in the context of obtaining a detain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ee\u2019s consent to search. <em>See, e.g., Tompkins, </em>130 F.3d at 122 (describing coercive police conduct to include placing the detainee in handcuffs, using threats or violence, or making an otherwise \u201covert display of authority\u201d). Guevara-Miranda does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, made after observing Wright\u2019s testimony and the recording of the stop, that Wright \u201cwas not overbearing\u201d and that he \u201cconducted himself in a professional manner throughout the encounter.\u201d Nor does Guevara-Miranda cite authority for his claim that it is coercive''for law enforcement to use English where a language barrier is detected. We conclude that the Wright\u2019s use of English was not coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Moreover, the record belies Guevara-Miranda\u2019s allegations concerning the language barrier and indicates that he was able to understand Wright\u2019s basic instructions and inquiries in English. For example, when Wright asked where Guevara-Miranda was going, he responded in English that he was travelling to Mississippi to visit his brother in the hospital. Although he had difficulty answering followup questions about the details of his travel plans, the difficulty was consistent with that of a suspect who is struggling to provide details of a cover story. The record shows that he moved to the United States approximately eight years before the stop,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suggesting a sufficient length of time to understand basic phrases in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Likewise, the record belies Guevara-Miranda\u2019s claim that there was no evidence that he could read the consent form in Spanish and thus no evidence that he understood his right to refuse consent. Guevarar-Miranda informed the probation officer that \u201che completed the equivalent of sixth grade\u201d in Honduras, which indicates that he can read in Spanish. He does not dispute that he responded affirmatively when Wright asked him if he could read the form. Nor does he dispute that, when Wright instructed him to read the form and to sign it only if he agreed with it, he immediately responded, \u201cokay.\u201d He also fails to challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s description of the video .as depicting him \u201cread[ing] the form, in earnest,\u201d and \u201cnodding in apparent agreement as he pored over the consent form\u201d before he signed it. He even acknowledges in his brief that the recording shows his eyes moving, back and forth across the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Considering the entirety of the record, which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, Guevara-Miranda\u2019s arguments concerning the language barrier do not leave a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. <em>See Pack, </em>612 F.3d at 347; <em>Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d at 440; <em>Gibbs, </em>421 F.3d at 357. To the extent he advocates for the adoption of a per se rule that a detainee\u2019s consent is involuntary whenever there is a languag\u00e9 barrier unless there is evidence that he was able to read and understand the written consent form, we need not reach the issue because he fails to. show that the district court clearly erred in finding that he read the form and was aware of his right to refuse consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Guevara-Miranda also contends that it was coercive that Wright sought his consent while in possession of his passport, standing beside him while another trooper stood between Guevara-Miranda and his car. He does not, however, challenge the findings by the magistrate judge that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>other trooper stood behind Guevara-Miranda only \u201cbriefly before moving away\u201d and that the presence of two officers on the scene was minimized because Wright alone conducted all of the questioning. We conclude that, under the circumstances, the troopers\u2019 actions were not coercive. <em>See Tompkins, </em>130 F.3d at 122 (providing examples of coercive police conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Finally, Guevara-Miranda emphasizes that he was not free to leave because he lacked a driver\u2019s license and that he must have known that the drugs would be found diming the search because they were easily accessible. \u201c[KJnowledge that incriminating evidence would be found does not necessarily weigh against a finding of voluntary consent,\u201d as Guevara-Miranda \u201cmight have consented in the hope that his cooperation would result in more favorable treatment.\u201d <em>Tompkins, </em>130 F.3d at 122. It is plausible here that the presence of a canine unit convinced Guevara-Miranda that the discovery of the narcotics was inevitable and encouraged him to cooperate to obtain more favorable treatment. However, even if both of these factors weigh in his favor, the two factors alone are not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Although Guevara-Miranda disagrees with the district court\u2019s weighing of the six factors, he has not overcome the particular deference owed to the district court\u2019s finding that he voluntarily consented to the search. <em>See Gibbs, </em>421 F.3d at 357. Because there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the finding* of voluntary consent, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Massi, </em>761 F.3d at 520.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. Guevara-Miranda provided this information to the probation officer, who included it in the presentence report. We may \"affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any basis established by the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Pack, </em>612 F.3d 341, 347 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
