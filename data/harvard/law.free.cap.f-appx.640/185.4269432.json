For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss this appeal in part because Dani-hel\u2019s challenge to two of those orders is time-barred. As for the remaining three orders, we will summarily affirm each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">In March 2014, Danihel filed a pro se complaint in the District Court against a host of federal and state entities and officials. \u201cCentral to Danihel\u2019s complaint [was] his allegation that the defendants ha[d] taken his property without paying proper compensation under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Danihel v. Office of the President of the U.S., </em>616 Fed.Appx. 467, 470 (3d Cir.2015) (per curiam) [hereinafter <em>Danihel I </em>]. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). In September 2014, District Judge Nitza I. Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro granted those motions and closed the case. Danihel timely appealed, and we summarily affirmed that judgment in June 2015. <em>See Danihel I, </em>616 Fed-Appx. at 471-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">While that appeal was pending, Danihel commenced the action at issue here, filing a second pro se complaint against the same defendants. Once again, the defendants moved to dismiss. On January 7, 2015, Judge Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro granted those motions and closed the case. In doing so, she explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFC\">[a] fair reading of Plaintiffs second complaint reveals that Plaintiff seeks to litigate the same claims dismissed by this Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the previous action which is pending on appeal. Because Plaintiffs complaint in this action suffers from the same jurisdictional defects as that-filed in Danihel I, Plaintiffs instant complaint is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">(Dist. Ct. Order docketed Jan. 7, 2015, at 2 n. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">Shortly thereafter, Danihel filed in the District Court documents titled \u2018Writ of Error Quae Coram Nobis Residant\u201d and \u201cMotion for Contempt,\u201d respectively. While those filings were pending, this case was reassigned from Judge Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro to District Judge Mark A. Kearney. On February 13, 2015, Judge Kearney addressed the two new filings. Judge Kear-ney liberally construed the coram nobis filing as a 'motion for relief from the District Court\u2019s January 7, 2015 judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and concluded' that such relief was not warranted. Meanwhile, Judge Kearney denied the motion for contempt \u201cas lacking any legal or factual basis other than disappointment in the Court\u2019s rulings.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Order docketed Feb. 13, 2015.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In the weeks that followed, Danihel filed two more \u201cMotion[s] for Contempt,\u201d as well as documents with the following titles: \u201cThird Judicial Notice Filed Addendum Nunc Pro Tunc,\" \u201cSecond Writ of Error Quae Coram Nobis Residant,\u201d and \u201cNotice of Reminder to Magistrate in This Court of Record.\u201d In response, some of the defendants (referred to by the District Court as the \u201cCongressional Defendants\u201d) moved for an order to show cause why a filing injunction should not be imposed against Danihel. On March 13, 2015, Judge Kear-ney denied Danihel\u2019s various requests for relief and denied the motion for a show cause order without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Kearney explained that \u201c[i]f there was any doubt before, Plaintiff is now specifically notified that any further filing related to these claims in this Court will be grounds for the consideration of civil contempt, and the narrowly tailored injunction requested by the Congressional Defendants.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Order docketed Mar. 13, 2015, at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Shortly thereafter, Danihel filed yet another \u201cMotion for Contempt\u201d and a document titled \u201cThird Writ of Error Quae Coram Nobis Residant.\u201d On April 2,2015, Judge Kearney denied these requests for relief. Undeterred, Danihel submitted a host of new filings over the next two weeks, which caused the Congressional Defendants to renew their motion for a show cause order. On April 20, 2015, Judge Kearney ordered Danihel to show cause why the District Court \u201cshould not enter a narrow pre-filing injunction prohibiting him from making any further filings in this matter or commencing any new actions concerning the same subject matters without first receiving leave of this Court to do so.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Order docketed Apr. 20, 2015.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Danihel timely filed his response to the show cause order. Thereafter, on April 30, 2015, Judge Kearney entered an order that denied five more motions from Dani-hel and imposed a filing injunction against him. The injunction order contained the following three provisions. First, the District Court Clerk was directed to \u201cnot accept any of Plaintiffs further filings in this matter without prior approval of this Court.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Order docketed Apr. 30, 2015, at 2.) Second, Danihel was \u201cenjoined from commencing any new civil matters against the named Defendants that relate, or could relate, to the subject matter of this action without leave of Court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).) If Danihel wished to file such an action, he would have to first certify that (a) \u201cthe claims being presented have never before been raised or disposed of on the merits by a federal court,\u201d (b) \u201che believes the facts contained in the Complaint to be true,\u201d and (c) \u201cthere is no reason why the claims are foreclosed by controlling law.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Third, any future actions taken by Danihel \u201cin violation of this Order notwithstanding his claim as a \u2018sovereign\u2019 citizen, may result, upon petition, in a Rule to Show Cause as to why he should not be held in civil contempt and face sanctions and other penalties caused by his disregard for this Court.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>On May 27, 2015, Danihel filed a notice of appeal, seeking to challenge Judge Qui-\u00f1ones Alejandro\u2019s January 7th order and Judge Kearney\u2019s February 13th, March 13th, April 2nd, and April 30th orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">At the outset, we must determine which of the District Court\u2019s orders are properly before us. Because some, of the parties in this case are federal entities/officials, a 60-day appeal period governs here. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). This time limit, which generally begins to run when the order in question is \u201centered,\u201d <em>see id., </em>is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 209, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (quoting <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 108 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (per curiam)). Typically, an order is deemed \u201centered\u201d when it is placed on the docket. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c). However, if the order does not satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)\u2019s separate document requirement, the order is not deemed \u201centered\u201d until 150 days after it is docketed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Here, Judge Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro\u2019s January 7th order did not satisfy the separate document requirement because it contained the reasons underlying her decision. <em>See LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass\u2019n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 224 (3d Cir.2007). Accordingly, that order was considered \u201centered\u201d on Monday, June 8, 2015, thereby giving Danihel until August 7, 2015, to appeal from that order. Because he filed his notice of appeal before that deadline, his appeal is timely as to that order. The same cannot be said for his challenge to Judge Kearney\u2019s February 13th and March 13th orders. Those post-judgment orders \u25a0 did not have to comply with the separate document requirement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a).. As a result, the deadlines for appealing from them were April 14, 2015, and May 12, 2015, respectively. Because Danihel did not file his notice of appeal until May 27, 2015, his appeal is time-barred as to those two orders. However, his appeal <em>is </em>timely as to Judge Kearney\u2019s April 2nd and April 30th orders,- as the notice of appeal was filed within 60 days of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">In light of the above, we -will dismiss Danihel\u2019s challenge to Judge Kearney\u2019s February 13th and March 13th orders. We now turn to the merits of Danihel\u2019s challenge to the three remaining orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">We begin with Judge Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro\u2019s January 7th order, which dismissed Danihel\u2019s second complaint. We review that decision under a plenary standard. <em>See Freidrich v. Davis, </em>767 F.3d 374, 377 (3d Cir.2014). Judge Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro determined that, because, Danihel\u2019s second complaint effectively reiterated the claims that he had raised in his first complaint, the second complaint was subject to dismissal for the same reasons as the first complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">We need not disturb Judge Qui-\u00f1ones Alejandro\u2019s dismissal of Danihel\u2019s second complaint. Although the causes .of action listed in that pleading are labeled differently than those in the first complaint, the two complaints effectively make the same substantive arguments. <em>See Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 184, 189 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cWe are not bound by the label <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>attached by a party to characterize a claim and will look beyond the label to analyze the substance of a claim.\u201d). We rejected those arguments in <em>Danihel I, </em>and we find no reason to take a different approach here. To the extent that Danihel\u2019s second complaint could be construed as raising new claims that fall within the scope of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction, we conclude that any such claims are barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion because he could have raised them in his first complaint. <em>See Rivet v. Regions Bank of La., </em>522 U.S. 470, 476, 118 S.Ct. 921, 139 L.Ed.2d 912 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We now turn to Judge Kearney\u2019s April 2, 2015 order, which denied Danihel\u2019s \u201cThird Writ of Error Quae Coram Nobis Residant\u201d and one of Danihel\u2019s many \u201cMotion[s] for Contempt.\u201d In support of this denial, Judge Kearney stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ant\">Mr. Danihel has now filed at least three writs of error since the Honorable Nitza Qui\u00f1ones Alejandro dismissed his case on January 7, 2015. In each of these motions Mr. Danihel challenges the authority of this Court to pass judgment on his various filings. His case has now been dismissed twice and Mr. Danihel is understandably upset that he cannot proceed in this Court. However, we have denied Mr. Danihel\u2019s prior writs of error and Mr. Danihel has not adduced additional facts in his current motion to warrant a reversal of course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">(Dist. Ct. Order docketed Apr. 2, 2015 (citation omitted).) We find no error in this analysis, and we agree -with Judge Kearney\u2019s decision to deny these requests for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Lastly, we consider Judge Kearney\u2019s April 30th order, which denied five additional motions from Danihel \u2014 four more \u201cMotion[s] for Contempt\u201d and one titled \u201cMotion to Comply\u201d \u2014 and imposed the filing injunction against him. We see no reason to disturb Judge Kearney\u2019s denial of those five motions, and we focus our discussion on the filing injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), permits district courts to issue filing injunctions \u201cto preclude abusive, groundless and vexatious litigation.\u201d <em>Brow v. Farrely, </em>994 F.2d 1027, 1038 (3d Cir.1993). However, to ensure a litigant\u2019s right to due process and access to the courts, a district court must comply with the following three requirements. <em>See id. </em>First, filing injunctions are not appropriate \u201cabsent exigent circumstances, such as a litigant\u2019s continuous abuse of the judicial process by filing meritless and repetitive actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201c[i]f the circumstances warrant the imposition of an injunction, the District Court must give notice to the litigant to show cause why the proposed injunctive relief should not issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lastly, \u201cthe scope of the injunctive order must be narrowly tailored to fit the particular circumstances of the case before the District Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s decision to impose a filing injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>See Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, </em>901 F.2d 329, 331 (3d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Judge Kearney did not abuse his discretion in imposing the filing injunction against Danihel, as each of the aforementioned requirements is satisfied. First, the filing injunction came in response to Danihel\u2019s relentless barrage of meritless filings, the vast majority of which were submitted after his second complaint was dismissed. Second, Judge Kearney gave Danihel ample notice of the possibility of a filing injunction and afforded Danihel an opportunity to show cause why such an injunction should not be imposed. Finally, the filing injunction crafted by Judge Kearney is narrowly tailored. It applies only to a small subset of cases (the present case and new civil actions brought against these same defendants that relate, or could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>relate, to the subject matter of this case) and it allows Danihel to seek the District Court\u2019s permission to file actions that fall within that subset.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s January 7, 2015, April 2, 2015, and April 30, 2015 orders.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\">. Judge Kearney took this approach because Rule 60(e) has abolished writs of coram nobis in federal civil actions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-12\"><em>. </em>Judge Kearney once again liberally construed Danihel\u2019s request for coram nobis relief as a Rule 60 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\">. We have jurisdiction over these orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may' summarily affirm them if this appeal fails to present a substantial question, <em>see </em>,3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6, and we may do so on any basis supported by the record, <em>see Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
