After reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we find that the district court did not err in enhancing Pineda-Goigochea\u2019s offense level based on his pri- or conviction for cocaine trafficking in Georgia. Despite Pineda-Goigochea\u2019s arguments to the contrary, controlling precedent holds that the Georgia crime of drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>trafficking is a qualifying predicate offense for sentence enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, we affirm Pineda-Goigochea\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2, a base offense level of eight applies to defendants convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) increases the guideline range by 16 levels if the defendant was removed after a conviction for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 define a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d to mean \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.1(B)(iv). In Georgia, a person who \u201cknowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, or brings into [Georgia] or who is knowingly in possession of 28 grams or more of cocaine ... commits the felony offense of trafficking in cocaine.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-13-31(a)(1) (2003) (amended 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">On appeal, Pineda-Goigochea, who has a prior conviction for cocaine trafficking in Georgia, argues that his guideline offense level should not have been increased by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), despite our holding to the contrary in <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228 (11th Cir.2003). In support, he avers that <em>Madera-Madera </em>has been abrogated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>569 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013). He also asserts the <em>Maderos-Madera </em>panel did not use the categorical approach required by <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and related cases. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">A. <em>Moncrieffe </em>Does Not Abrogate <em>Madera-Madera</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">In <em>Madera-Madera, </em>we considered whether a conviction for possession of methamphetamine under Georgia\u2019s drug trafficking statute constituted a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). 333 F.3d at 1229-30. We examined Georgia\u2019s three-tiered statutory scheme for punishing drug crimes and determined that Georgia considered \u201cdrug trafficking ... a more serious offense than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1231-32. We also reasoned that the Georgia statute created a dividing line of 28 grams between possession, possession with the intent to distribute, and drug trafficking that recognized that someone with possession of such a significant quantity of drugs planned on distributing \u201cand thereby \u2018trafficking\u2019 those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Lastly, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d required the statutory element of intent to distribute be actually present in the language of the statute of conviction, because the Sentencing Commission chose not to define a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d by its elements, but instead \u201cby the type of conduct prohibited by the state statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">In <em>Moncrieffe, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a conviction under a Georgia statute that made it a crime to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>possess marijuana with intent to distribute met the definition of a drug trafficking aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which defines the term as any drug trafficking offense listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). <em>See </em>133 S.Ct. at 1683-84. The Court held that, when looking at whether a state conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under the INA, a court must determine whether the state offense is comparable to *an offense listed under the INA. <em>See id. </em>at 1684. Because the conviction at issue could correspond to either a federal felony or misdemeanor, the conviction did not \u201cnecessarily\u201d involve facts that corresponded to an offense punishable as a felony and did not qualify as an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1686-87 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Moncrieffe </em>decision does not abrogate or supplant <em>Madera-Madera,' </em>because it merely determined that Georgia possession of marijuana offense was a misdemeanor and, therefore, could not be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">B. <em>Madera-Madera </em>Comports with <em>Taylor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Pineda-Goigochea next avers that, even if <em>Moncrieffe </em>did not supplant <em>Madera-Madera, </em>that decision is nevertheless not good law because it did not use the categorical approach required by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, and subsequent cases developing that approach. However, <em>Madera-Madera </em>did use, in essence, the categorical approach by performing an analysis of the elements of the Georgia drug trafficking statute. The reasoning, therefore, remains sound. Importantly, the reasoning in <em>Madera-Madera </em>has been used by this court in subsequent cases analyzing similar sentencing enhancement issues. For instance, in <em>United States v. James, </em>using the categorical approach, we determined that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction under Florida state law for \u201ctrafficking in cocaine by possession of between 200 and 400 grams of cocaine,\u201d was a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1151-52, 1154 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). We compared the case to <em>Madera-Madera </em>and concluded that the reasoning therein was controlling. <em>Id. </em>at 1154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Pineda-Goigochea\u2019s offense level based on his prior conviction for cocaine trafficking in Georgia because we previously held in <em>Madera-Madera </em>that the Georgia cocaine trafficking offense is a qualifying predicate offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). <em>Madera-Madera </em>has not been abrogated or otherwise overruled, and it is still controlling precedent. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting en banc.\u201d). Thus, the sentencing decision of the district court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
