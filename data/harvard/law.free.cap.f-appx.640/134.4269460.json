Roudabush, Jr., is a federal prisoner who was formerly confined at Fort Dix FCI. He has filed over 90 civil actions and 30 appeals oyer the years, and he has \u201cthree strikes\u201d under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). While incarcerated at Fort Dix, he filed an action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S.. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging that prison officials confined him in the Special Housing Unit and denied him medical care on account of his age and sexual orientation and in retaliation for his filing of grievances and lawsuits. (D.N.J. Civ. No. 1-15-cv-03185.) That action remains pending, and the District Court is consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ering whether to allow Roudabush to proceed in forma pauperis under the \u201cimminent danger\u201d exception to the three-strike provision of the PLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In addition to filing that <em>Bivens </em>action (and others), Roudabush filed the habeas petitions at issue here. Roudabush raised essentially the same claims in his habeas petitions as he raised in his <em>Bivens </em>action and requested \u201crelease from the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d The District Court dismissed both petitions after concluding that it lacked habeas jurisdiction over Rouda-bush\u2019s claims regarding the conditions of his confinement and that he should assert whatever non-duplicative claims he may have in that regard in another <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>See, e.g., Cardona v. Bledsoe, </em>681 F.3d 533, 537-38 (3d Cir.2012) (affirming dismissal of habeas claims premised on confinement in the Special Management Unit). Roudabush appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We will dismiss these appeals as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 because there is no arguable basis to challenge the District Court\u2019s rulings. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). The District Court properly explained why Roudabush cannot proceed with his claims by means of a habeas petition and must seek relief in a civil action under <em>Bivens </em>instead. Roudabush\u2019s claims cannot be construed as challenges to the \u00e9xecution of his sentence under \u00a7 2241 because he does not allege that his alleged treatment is inconsistent with any provision of his criminal judgment, <em>see Cardona, </em>681 F.3d at 537, and his allegations do not state a basis for release from prison. Roudabush argues on appeal that he can proceed simultaneously in habeas and under <em>Bivens </em>because the general ha-beas statute mentions \u201cconditions of confinement.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(e)(2). That provision of the habeas statute applies by its terms only to aliens, and it specifies the kinds of challenges that aliens may <em>not </em>bring in habeas. Permitting Roudabush to proceed with his claims in a habeas petition also would constitute an impermissible circumvention of the three-strike provision of the PLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">For these reasons, we will dismiss these appeals as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). We further note that Roudabush has since been transferred to a different facility, so his petitions appear to be moot to the extent that they can be read to seek \u201crelease\u201d from any particular condition of confinement at Fort Dix.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-17\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
