Heck (\u201cHeck\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case against the Appellee for its failure to consummate his purchase of real property at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale. The district court dismissed his claims, which are predicated on violations of Tex. Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.0075. (West 2009). After reviewing the district court\u2019s opinion, the record, and the applicable law, we AFFIRM. Additionally, we DENY Heck\u2019s request to cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>tify three questions to the Texas Supreme Court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In June 2014, a trustee, on behalf of CitiMortgage, Inc. (\u201cCiti\u201d), conducted a non-judicial foreclosure sale of a property in Troup, Texas. Heck was the original winning bidder. Heck asked the trustee for at least 30-40 minutes to deliver the purchase price of $63,000 in the form of a cashier\u2019s check. The trustee said \u201cI\u2019ll give you 20 minutes.\u201d When Heck did not return within 20 minutes, the auction was reopened and the property was sold to someone else for $60,227. Heck filed suit in 7th Judicial District, Smith County, Texas, and Defendant removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>motions to dismiss and motions for judgment on the pleadings. The standard is the same for both. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, a motion to dismiss or for a judgment on the pleadings should not be granted if a complaint provides \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 Moreover, the complaint must allege \u2018more than label and conclusions,\u2019 \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do,\u2019 and \u2018factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jebaco, Inc. v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co. Inc., </em>587 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">III.Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Heck raises three issues concerning the interpretation of the provision at issue. First, what is the meaning of \u201cwithout delay\u201d? Second, is a trustee required to wait a reasonable amount of time to receive payment if the parties cannot reach an agreement as to the time of the payment? And third, can a trustee condition a sale when the condition was not announced before the first sale of the day? The parties dispute the meaning of the term \u201cwithout delay\u201d in \u00a7 51.0075(f) of the Texas Property Code. <em>See </em>Tex. Prop.Code Ann. 51.0075(f) (West 2009). Specifically, they dispute whether the term means \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d as it relates to paying the purchase price at a non-judicial foreclosure sale. Because the issues are intertwined, the Court will address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Before 2007, Texas common law required trustees to give buyers a reasonable amount of time within hours of the sale to obtain and return with the purchase price \u2014 the <em>Sharp </em>rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">In 2007, the Texas Legislature enacted \u00a7 51.0075(f), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-15\">The purchase price in a sale held by a trustee or substitute trustee under this section is payable immediately on acceptance of the bid by the trustee or substitute trustee. The trustee or substitute trustee shall disburse the proceeds of the sale as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-16\">Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 903 (H.B. 2738), Sec. 4, eff. June 15,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-17\">\u00a7 51.0075(f), as enacted in 2007, had an unintended and unforeseen consequence. Tex. House Research Organization, H.B. 655 Bill Analysis, (Apr. 24, 2009), http:// www.hro.house.state.tx.us/pdf/ba81r/hb 0655.pdf# navpanes=0. Trustees, in accordance with .\u00a7 51.0075(f), were refusing to finalize a foreclosure sale if the buyer could not immediately proffer a cashier\u2019s check for the exact sale price. <em>Id. </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>proved to be an unreasonable requirement because \u00a7 51.0075(f) did not alternatively allow the parties to reach an agreement as to the time of the payment. <em>Id. </em>Some opponents of \u00a7 51.0075(f) proposed amending the statute to essentially restore the <em>Sharp </em>rule. <em>Id. </em>But ultimately, the Legislature amended \u00a7 51.0075(f) to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">The purchase price in a sale held by a trustee or substitute trustee under this section is due and payable without delay on acceptance of the bid or within such reasonable time as may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the trustee or substitute trustee if the purchaser makes such request for additional time to deliver the purchase price. The trustee or substitute trustee shall disburse the proceeds of the sale as provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Acts 2009, 81st Leg., ch. 323, \u00a7 1, eff. Sept. 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">This case is governed by the current version of the Texas Property Code. In dismissing the case, the district court held that the meaning of \u201cwithout delay\u201d was not governed by the <em>Sharp </em>rule, as Heck had argued. The district court added that 81st Texas Legislature considered restoring the <em>Sharp </em>rule into the statute, but declined to do so. We agree with his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">On appeal, Heck makes a slightly different argument: \u201cwithout delay\u201d in \u00a7 51.0075(f) means \u201cwithin the reasonable time allowed by law,\u201d as opposed to \u201cimmediately,\u201d because the Legislature deleted the word immediately in the 2009 amendment. <em>See </em>Tex. Sen. Jurisprudence Comm., Bill Analysis, Tex. 655, 81st Leg., R.S. (2009), http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/ scanned/srcBillAnalyses/81-0/HB655ENG. PDF (\u201cthe purchase price in a sale held by a trustee ... under this section is due and payable without delay, rather than immediately\u2014 \u201d). Alternatively, Heck requests that the issues raised on appeal be certified to the Texas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">In rebuttal, Citi contends that the term \u201cwithout delay\u201d means immediately because that is the term\u2019s common usage. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1739 (9th ed.2009); Tex. Govt.Code Ann. \u00a7 311.011(a) (West 2015) (The Texas Property Code \u201cshall be read in context and construed to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d). Citi adds that defining \u201cwithout delay\u201d as \u201cwithin a reasonable amount of time\u201d is nonsensical because the statute would essentially provide that the purchase price is due within a reasonable amount of time after the acceptance of the bid, or within a reasonable time agreed upon by the parties. According to Citi, this interpretation renders the trustee\u2019s discretion to reach an agreement, with the buyer superfluous; there would be no need for such discretion if the trustee was already required to give the buyer a reasonable amount of time to pay. <em>See Leordeanu v. Am. Prot. Ins. Co., </em>330 S.W.3d 239, 248 n. 35 (Tex.2010) (\u201cWe construe statutes to give effect to every provision and ensure that no provision is rendered meaningless or superfluous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Even if \u00a7 51.0075(f) no longer requires immediate payment, however, Heck\u2019s appeal still fails. Upon acceptance of the bid, Heck initially requested \u201cno more than an hour\u201d to' return with the payment. Because Heck asked for a delay, the meaning of \u201cwithout delay\u201d is irrelevant in this factual scenario. Therefore, Heck\u2019s appeals hinges on the second part of the statute \u2014 \u201c[t]he purchase price is due ... within such reasonable time as <em>may </em>be agreed upon by the [parties]____\u201d Tex.. Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.0075(f) (West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>2009) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, no agreement was reached. Heck initially asked for no more than an hour, and then asked for at least 30^40 minutes. The trustee offered no more than 20 minutes. Heck \u201csaid he couldn\u2019t be back in 20 minutes.\u201d Thus, no agreement was ever reached. Additionally, the trustee was under no obligation to reach an agreement with Heck. Consequently, Heck fails to plead a plausible violation of \u00a7 51.0075(f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">As secondary arguments, Heck first asserts that providing the purchase price within 20 minutes of the sale could not be a condition of the sale because the condition was not announced before the first sale of the day. <em>See </em>Tex. Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.0075(a) (West 2009). Heck also asserts that the only condition announced \u2014 the purchase price is due and payable without delay upon acceptance of the bid unless the purchaser and the substitute trustee agree upon a reasonable time for the purchaser to deliver the funds \u2014 is unenforceable because a question exists as to meaning of \u201cwithout delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We are unpersuaded. First, as Citi points out, the 20 minutes offered by the trustee was not a condition of the sale, but a mere offer to reach an agreement concerning the time of payment (an offer that Heck rejected). Second, Heck\u2019s \u201cunen-forceability argument\u201d is premised on his definition of \u201cwithout delay.\u201d But as stated above, the term\u2019s definition is immaterial under the present facts. Further, the \u201ccondition announced\u201d was essentially the recitation of \u00a7 51.0075(f), not an additional condition of sale set by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment and DENY Heck\u2019s request for certification to the Texas Supreme Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\">. For instance, before 4:00 p.m., if the sale ended at 4:00 o'clock. <em>See First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n of Dall. v. Sharp, </em>359 S.W.2d 902, 903 (Tex. 1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. \u00a7 311.016(1), (2) (\" \u2018May\u2019 creates discretionary authority or grants permission or a power ... 'Shall' imposes a duty.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. Heck also suggests that if no agreement is reached between the parties after a delay request, the payment becomes due \"without delay.\u201d Heck, however, does not provide any legal reasoning, or grammatical explanation, for that interpretation of the statute. M'ore-over, Heck\u2019s suggestion makes little sense. The likely reason a delay is requested is because the buyer cannot pay without delay. It is illogical to conclude that a buyer who asks for a delay is suddenly able to pay without delay once she cannot reach an agreement to delay payment. Common sense suggests that if the buyer cannot pay without delay, and cannot reach an agreement to delay payment, the bid is lost. And that is exactly what happened to Heck.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
