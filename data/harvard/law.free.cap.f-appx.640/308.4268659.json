The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>district court (1) declined to grant DeBlanc a continuance under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) in order to allow her to conduct discovery prior to ruling on the motion for summary judgment, (2) determined that DeBlanc\u2019s discrimination claim was time-barred because she failed to file an EEOC charge, within 300 days, and (3) determined that DeBlanc had failed to make a prima facie showing on her retaliation claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">DeBlanc suffers from a mild neuro-cognitive condition called \u201cchemo brain\u201d as a result of prior treatment for breast cancer, and she alleges that St. Tammany discriminated against her on the basis of that condition in violation of the ADA when it fired her from her position as a Mental Health Provider on May 20th, 2009. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of St. Tammany on DeBlanc\u2019s discrimination claim, concluding that the claim was time-barred because DeBlanc had failed to file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory action as required by statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). The district court also declined to apply equitable tolling to the claim, finding no grounds on which to do so. On appeal, DeBlanc does not dispute that she filed her EEOC charge 301 days after the occurrence of the employment action that she alleges was unlawful (her firing) \u2014 DeBlanc only argues that the district court erred in refusing to apply equitable tolling in order to save her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">We have held that \u201cfiling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Granger v. Aaron\u2019s, Inc., </em>636 F.3d 708, 711 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Taylor v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>554 F.3d 510, 521 (5th Cir. 2008)). However, equitable tolling is to be applied \u201csparingly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 712 (quoting <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 113, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002)), and \u201c[t]he plaintiff has the burden to provide justification for\u201d its application. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wilson v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>65 F.3d 402, 404 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam)). Furthermore, when a district court determines whether to apply equitable tolling as \u201ca fact-specific, discretionary matter,\u201d we review that determination only for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">In the context of an ADA suit, we have recognized at least \u201cthree potential bases for equitable tolling: (1) the pendency of a suit between the same parties in the wrong forum; (2) the plaintiffs lack of awareness of the facts supporting his claim because of the defendant\u2019s intentional concealment of them; and (3) the EEOC\u2019s misleading the plaintiff about his rights.\u201d <em>Manning v. Chevron Chemical Co., LLC, </em>332 F.3d 874, 880 (5th Cir.2003). DeBlanc asserts that the present case \u201cclearly falls into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>second justification\u201d because she \u201cdid not know why she was fired on May 20, 2009,\u201d and her supervisor \u201crepeatedly refused to tell her why in spite of his being asked several times.\u201d Thus, DeBlanc argues that she did not learn she was fired because of her disability until she received a copy of a complaint her former supervisor filed against her with the Louisiana State Board of Social Work Examiners on June 12th, 2009, and the statutory period for filing her EEOC charge should accordingly have been tolled -until that date. We have made clear, however, that equitable tolling based on an employer\u2019s concealment of facts typically only applies in circumstances where \u201cthe employer\u2019s affirmative acts mislead the employee and induce him not to act within the limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). For instance, a common factual scenario in which we have found tolling appropriate involves employer misrepresentations about the possibility of continued future employment following termination. <em>See Phillips v. Leggett &amp; Platt, Inc., </em>658 F.3d 452, 458-59 (5th Cir.2011) (discussing an earlier case in which an employer \u201cat various times told the employee it intended to rehire him but then never did\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Ab_t\">In contrast, we rejected a tolling argument similar to the one DeBlanc raises in <em>Manning, </em>where the plaintiff claimed that tolling was appropriate because \u201che was unaware that his alleged disability (his stuttering) might have affected [his employer\u2019s] decision\u201d not to reassign him to a different position \u201cuntil the company released the notes from [the plaintiffs] interview for the positions,\u201d in which \u201cnegative comments about [the plaintiffs] speech and communication skills\u201d were found. 332 F.3d at 880. In other words, the plaintiff argued that he was misled by his employer about his ADA claim because \u201cuntil these notes were released,\u201d he had \u201cno way of knowing that he might have been discriminated against based on his disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that tolling should not apply on the facts presented in <em>Manning, </em>noting that the employer had not \u201c[taken] any action that might have induced [the plaintiff] not to file a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the same way, we think that the mere failure of De-Blanc\u2019s supervisor in this case to provide DeBlanc with a reason for her firing did not constitute an \u201caffirmative act[]\u201d that \u201cmisle[d]\u201d DeBlanc and \u201cinduce[d] [her] not to act within the limitations period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to apply equitable tolling on the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">DeBlanc also alleges that the aforementioned complaint her former supervisor, Mental Health Coordinator Darryl Bruno (\u201cBruno\u201d), filed against her with the Louisiana State Board of Social Work Examiners (the \u201cBoard\u201d) constituted an act of retaliation in violation of the ADA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court concluded that DeBlanc\u2019s retaliation claim based on Bruno\u2019s complaint was timely, as the complaint was filed on June 12th, 2009 \u2014 less than 300 days prior to the filing of DeBlanc\u2019s EEOC charge on March 17, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>went on to find that DeBlanc had failed to make a prima facie showing of retaliation and St. Tammany was thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claim. On appeal, DeBlanc contends that \u201c[t]he evidence in the record\u201d establishes Bruno\u2019s complaint as a \u201cfrivolous ... preemptive effort to defend against what he thought Mrs. DeBlanc might do for discriminating against her in firing her.\u201d In support of this contention, DeBlanc refers to evidence suggesting that Bruno\u2019s complaint was filed soon after Bruno received a letter from DeBlanc\u2019s attorney requesting payment of owed wages and an explanation for DeBlanc\u2019s firing. We agree with the district court that DeBlanc failed to make a prima facie showing of retaliation under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Fennell v. Marion Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>804 F.3d 398, 407 (5th Cir.2015). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the mov-ant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). \u201cAn issue of fact is material only \u2018if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manning, </em>332 F.3d at 877 (quoting <em>Wyatt v. Hunt Plywood Co., </em>297 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir. 2002)). \u201cIn determining whether there is a dispute as to any material fact, we consider all of the evidence in the record\u201d and \u201c\u2018draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)). \u201cIf we determine, after giving credence to the facts as presented by the nonmoving party, that \u2018the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u2019 we affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">In order to avoid summary judgment on an ADA retaliation claim, \u201ca plaintiff must establish a [prima facie] case of (1) engagement in an activity protected by the ADA, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection between the protected act and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Seaman v. CSPH, Inc., </em>179 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir. 1999). In the present case, there is some dispute as to whether Bruno filed the complaint against DeBlanc before or after he received a letter from her attorney on June 18th, 2009 requesting \u201call amounts due in connection with [DeBlanc\u2019s] employment\u201d under \u201cLouisiana law\u201d and \u201can explanation of why [Bruno] fired her.\u201d The complaint itself is dated June 12th, 2009, suggesting that Bruno filed it before the letter from DeBlanc\u2019s attorney was sent. However, DeBlanc points to the notice she received from the Board on June 24th, 2009, which states that the Board received Bruno\u2019s complaint on June <em>19th. </em>Thus, DeBlanc claims that Bruno filed his complaint in retaliation for DeBlanc\u2019s attempts to pursue legal options against St. Tammany through her attorney\u2019s letter. Ultimately, we conclude that it makes no dif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ference whether Bruno filed his complaint before or after he received the letter from DeBlanc\u2019s attorney, as even \u201cgiving credence to the facts as presented by the nonmoving party,\u201d DeBlanc has failed to make a prima facie showing of \u201cengagement in an activity protected by the ADA.\u201d <em>Manning, </em>332 F.3d at 877; <em>Seaman, </em>179 F.3d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">While DeBlanc\u2019s allegations are somewhat unclear, it seems that she is claiming Bruno filed his complaint because DeBlanc had engaged in the \u201cprotected\u201d activity of \u201copposing] [an] act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a). In this regard, DeBlanc \u201cmust show that [she] had a \u2018reasonable belief that the employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. John v. Sirius Solutions, LLLP, </em>299 Fed.Appx. 308, 308 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2007)). In other words, DeBlanc must have reasonably believed that St. Tammany\u2019s actions were unlawful <em>under the ADA </em>in order to have engaged in a \u201cprotected\u201d activity for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. But as DeBlanc herself admits (and indeed argues on appeal), she did <em>not </em>have a reasonable belief that St. Tammany was engaged in an unlawful employment practice under the ADA at the time her attorney sent Bruno the letter, because she states that it was Bruno\u2019s complaint which informed her that her firing was potentially discriminatory. Thus, assuming DeBlanc is correct that Bruno filed his complaint after receiving the letter from DeBlanc\u2019s attorney, the letter itself could not constitute opposition to an act or practice made unlawful by the ADA. Furthermore, nothing in the letter suggests a contrary conclusion, as the letter merely requests \u201camounts due\u201d under Louisiana law and an explanation for De-Blanc\u2019s termination \u2014 indeed, the fact that the letter requests such an explanation suggests DeBlanc did not have a reasonable belief that St. Tammany\u2019s actions were unlawful under the ADA when the letter was sent. Accordingly, DeBlanc has not shown that hiring the attorney, sending the letter, or any other act on her part prior to the filing of Bruno\u2019s complaint was \u201cprotected activity,\u201d i.e. \u201copposing] any act or practice <em>made unlawful by [the ADA].\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a) (emphasis added); <em>see also Yount v. S &amp; A Restaurant Corp., </em>226 F.3d 641, 2000 WL 1029010, at *3 (5th Cir.2000) (unpublished table decision) (\u201c\u2018[T]he relevant question ... [is] whether the employee\u2019s communications to the employer sufficiently convey the employee\u2019s reasonable concerns that the employer has acted or is acting in an unlawful discriminatory manner.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Garcia-Paz v. Swift Textiles, Inc., </em>873 F.Supp. 547, 560 (D.Kan.1995)) (emphasis omitted)); <em>Turner, </em>476 F.3d at 349 (\u201cBecause [the plaintiff) could not have reasonably believed that [a co-worker\u2019s] conduct described in [an] email constituted an unlawful employment \u2022 practice under Title VII, this incident cannot give rise to protected activity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">DeBlanc lastly takes issue with the district court\u2019s refusal to grant her motion for a continuance under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) in order to allow her to secure counsel and conduct discovery. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 56(d) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Am. Family Life Assurance Co. v. Biles, </em>714 F.3d 887, 894 (5th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Raby v. Livingston, </em>600 F.3d 552, 561 (5th Cir.2010)). In light of the foregoing discussion, and in light of the fact that the district court had already granted two previous continuances on the motion for summary judgment, we see no abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>discretion in the court\u2019s decision to deny DeBlanc\u2019s request \u2014 indeed, as the district court noted, \u201c[i]t is unclear ... how any further discovery would reveal Plaintiffs claims to be timely or meritorious.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 894-95 (finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a Rule 56(d) motion because the requested discovery \u201cwas unlikely to ... have influenced the outcome of the summary judgment motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Having concluded that the district court (1) did not abuse its discretion in declining to apply equitable tolling to save DeBlanc\u2019s ADA discrimination claim, (2) did not err .in determining that DeBlane had failed to make a prima facie showing on her ADA retaliation claim, and (3) did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant DeBlanc\u2019s motion for a continuance, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">. There was some confusion in the district court as to whether DeBlanc alleged discrimination only on the basis of her termination or also alleged discrimination stemming from a later complaint against DeBlanc that St. Tammany's Mental Health Coordinator filed with the Louisiana State Board of Social Work Examiners. This confusion arose because DeBlanc filed an amended EEOC charge in which she alleged that the complaint \"was an act of discrimination against [her] and in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\u201d On appeal, however, DeBlanc makes clear that her \"allegations of discrimination did not arise from the complaint; the discrimination arose from [the] act in firing her.\u201d Thus, we consider only whether De-Blanc\u2019s discrimination claim stemming from her termination on May 20th, 2009 is time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">. As with DeBlanc\u2019s discrimination claim, the district court addressed retaliation stemming both from DeBlanc's May 20th, 2009 termination and Bruno\u2019s June 12th, 2009 complaint, because DeBlanc\u2019s amended EEOC charge alleged that her \u201cfiring\u201d was \u201can act of retaliation and in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\u201d However, DeBlanc\u2019s argument on appeal concerns only alleged retaliation based on Bruno\u2019s complaint, and we accordingly limit our analysis to that allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\">. St. Tammany maintains on appeal that De-Blanc\u2019s retaliation claim based on Bruno\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>complaint is time-barred because the claim was only raised in DeBIanc's amended EEOC charge, filed on March 8, 2012, and \"there is no basis to suggest that any claim for retaliation should relate back.\u201d The district court, however, determined that although DeBlanc had not checked the box for \u201cretaliation\u201d in her initial EEOC charge from 2010, allegations of retaliation included in her <em>intake questionnaire </em>were within the scope of that original charge based on the EEOC investigation that grew from it. Because St. Tammany does not argue that the district court\u2019s conclusion on this point was erroneous, we find that they have abandoned the issue by failing to brief it. <em>See Cinel </em>v. <em>Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir. 1994) (\"A party who inadequately briefs an issue is considered to have abandoned [it].\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
