App. \u00a7 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-19\">After the registrant had received an order to report for induction on November 17, 1969,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was mailed on October 23, 1969, he filed an application on Form 150 for classification as a conscientious objector (I-O) in early February 1970, alleging, inter alia, that consideration of his imminent induction in November 1969 made him realize that \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear arms against another person.\u201d His Form 150, as supplemented by his supporting letters, made out a prima facie case for a 1-0 classification. See Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970). After a nonstatutory interview was granted to Ziskowski by the Local Board on February 5, 1970, at which he \u201cadvised his feelings crystallized when he received the induction <em>order,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Board declined to reopen the case and sent him a letter dated 5 February 1970 stating, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-20\">\u201cIt is the determination of the board that there has been no change in your status resulting from circumstances over which you had no control. Your classification has not been reopened.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2, governing the reopening of a registrant\u2019s classification after the mailing of an Order to Report for Induction, provides that such reopening shall not occur \u201cunless the local board first specifically finds that there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d The language used by the Board in refusing to reopen Ziskowski\u2019s classification is consistent with at least the following reasons:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">1. A Board finding that the registrant\u2019s conscientious objector beliefs were not sincere either before or after receipt of his notice of induction on October 23, 1969,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so that there was no change in his status since he was not entitled to a conscientious objector classification in either period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">2. A Board finding that the registrant\u2019s conscientious objector beliefs were sincere both before and after receipt of his notice of induction on October 23, 1969,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> so that there was no change in his status requiring a reopening of his classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">3. A Board finding that the registrant\u2019s conscientious objector beliefs, even if they were sincere and had crystallized after receipt of the Order to Report for Induction, were not \u201cby reason of religious training\u201d (See 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j)),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> so that there was no change in his status since he was not entitled to a conscientious objector classification in either period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">4. A Board determination that even if the registrant might be entitled to a conscientious objector classification because his conscientious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>objector beliefs were sincere and \u201cby reason of religious training\u201d and had crystallized after October 23, 1969, the registrant was not entitled to a reopening of his classification because such crystallization was not \u201ca circumstance over which the registrant had no control\u201d within the meaning of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">A basic problem with the language used by the Board in refusing to reopen the registrant\u2019s classification is, therefore, that one cannot tell from this language why the Board took the action that it did. In Scott v. Commanding Officer, 431 F.2d 1132, 1137-1138 (3d Cir. 1970), this court was confronted with a similar problem, which it explained in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s Form 150 was explicit in its statement of his beliefs. Certainly, the beliefs outlined, if sincerely held, would qualify him as a conscientious objector. The only possible grounds for rejecting his claim, then, would be finding that the beliefs are not sincerely held or that they did not undergo a material change or crystallize after the induction order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201cThere is nothing in the petitioner\u2019s file to indicate that his asserted beliefs are not sincerely held, and the board made no finding of insincerity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">* * * * * -K</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201cWhy then did the board refuse to reopen his classification? We can only speculate. Perhaps, petitioner was evasive during his courtesy interview causing the board to conclude that he was insincere in his beliefs. Perhaps, the board believed him to be a sincere conscientious objector but disbelieved his account of post-induction-order crystallization. On the other hand, for all that we can tell from petitioner\u2019s file the board was completely impressed with his credibility on all issues but denied his claim because of the erroneous view that his beliefs were not sufficiently \u2018religious\u2019 (see United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965); Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970)) or that beliefs are always within one\u2019s control for purposes of the reopening regulation. We simply do not know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATy\">In <em>Scott </em>we concluded by holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzMB\">\u201cSince petitioner\u2019s file contains no statement of the reasons for the board\u2019s refusal to reopen his classification, we have no choice but to hold his induction order invalid and direct that the writ be issued.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"avn-dedup-0\">Similarly, in United States v. Neamand, 452 F.2d 25, 30 (3d Cir. 1971), this court said in reversing a conviction for refusing to submit to induction, where the local board had not indicated its reasons for refusing to reopen his classification in view of his submission of a conscientious objector claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">\u201c . . . [W]e just do not know why the board rejected this registrant\u2019s claim; on the basis of the testimony adduced at trial and the selective service file we do not know whether the board relied on an erroneous ground. Accordingly, we are persuaded that if the reasons underlying the <em>Scott </em>rule are valid and respectable, their application is justified and warranted here; findings by the board should have been mandated under the circumstances which underlie this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-15\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-16\">. We hold merely that, under the circumstances of this case, we cannot countenance a conviction which springs from bare administrative action appearing so perfunctory that reasonable review of its legitimacy is impossible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">We have concluded that the bare statement given by the Board in denying reopening in the instant case, like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>statements involved in <em>Scott </em>and <em>Neamand, supra, </em>is inadequate to permit proper review of the Board\u2019s actions in refusing to find a change in circumstances over which the registrant had no control. We therefore reverse the conviction, which will permit further proceedings by the Selective Service System consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We believe that the Government\u2019s reliance on Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971), as making unnecessary a statement of reasons for the Board\u2019s refusal to reopen in the instant case is misplaced. In <em>Ehlert </em>the Court had before it a decision of the petitioner\u2019s local board not to reopen his classification because \u201cthe crystallization of his conscientious objection did not constitute the \u2018change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u2019 \u201d 402 U.S. at 100, 91 S.Ct. at 1321. Thus, the local board had rather clearly made finding number 4 of the four possible findings set forth above at pages 482-483.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court held that in view of the assurance by the General Counsel of the Department of the Army that a \u201clate crystallizer\u201d such as Ehlert would have received an opportunity to file for conscientious objector status after entry into the Army, it was reasonable to adopt the Government\u2019s administrative interpretation of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2, employed by the local board in Ehlert\u2019s ease, that the late crystallization of conscientious objector beliefs did not constitute a circumstance \u201cover which the registrant had no control.\u201d However, the Court did not hold <em>in Ehlert </em>that a conviction for refusing induction may be sustained where, as in the instant case, the Local Board has failed to sufficiently indicate the reasons for its refusal to reopen a classification where a prima facie case for such reopening has been made. As indicated above, in Scott v. Commanding Officer, <em>supra, </em>this court indicated that such a conviction could not be sustained. That the Court did not intend to reject this holding in <em>Scott </em>is indicated by its subsequent opinion in Fein v. Selective Service System, 405 U.S. 365, 92 S.Ct. 1062, 31 L.Ed.2d 298 (1972). In this opinion the Court appeared to accept as law the Government\u2019s concession that the failure of the local board to articulate in writing its reasons for a denial of a prima facie case of a conscientious objector classification constituted \u201ca fatal procedural flaw,\u201d citing among other cases this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Scott. </em>See 405 U.S. at 380-381, 92 S.Ct. 1062 and n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Indeed, the reasoning of the Court in <em>Ehlert </em>lends substantial support to the result which we reach in the instant case. One of the primary concerns of the Court in <em>Ehlert </em>was that there not exist a \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d in which the registrant whose conscientious objector views have crystallized after receipt of his notice of induction is denied an opportunity to present his claim to either the Selective Service System or the Army. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201cIt would be wholly arbitrary to deny the late crystallizer a full opportunity to obtain a determination on the merits of his claim to exemption from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>combatant training and service just because his conscientious scruples took shape during a brief period in legal limbo.\u201d 402 U.S. at 104, 91 S.Ct. at 1323.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In <em>Ehlert\u2019s </em>case the Court found that there would have been no such \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d in view of the assurance by the General Counsel of the Army to this effect, notwithstanding the language in AR 630-20, \u00b6\u00b6 3a, b(l), which \u201cseem[ed] to look the other way.\u201d 402 U.S. 106, 91 S.Ct. 1324. However, another paragraph of AR 630-20, \u00b6 3 not cited by the Court in <em>Ehlert, </em>provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201cb. . . . Requests for discharge after entering military service will not be favorably considered when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">* * * * *X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">(2) Based solely on conscientious objection claimed and denied by the Selective Service System prior to induction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">As indicated above, the language used by the Board in refusing to reopen Zis-kowski\u2019s classification might have indicated a denial on the merits of his conscientious objection claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, even assuming that at the time that Ziskows-ki would have been inducted the Army would have construed the above-quoted AR 630-20, U 3b(2), to bar only those conscientious objector claims that had been denied by the Selective Service System on the merits (not a necessary assumption in view of the rather ambiguous language of the regulation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>), the Army might reasonably have construed the Board\u2019s action as precluding consideration of Ziskowski\u2019s conscientious objection claim in the Army.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See United States v. Shomock, 462 F.2d 338 at 344-346 and n. 17 (3d Cir., filed June 20, 1972); Baker v. Laird, 316 F.Supp. 1 (N.D.Cal.1970).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The result would have been precisely the type of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d that the Court declared in <em>Ehlert </em>would not be permitted to exist. See 402 U.S. at 104, 107, 91 S.Ct. 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction and sentence in the instant case will be reversed, without prejudice to further proceedings by the Selective Service System consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\">. This induction date was postponed several times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-13\">. This Form 150 also alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">\u201cI have expressed the view of not killing people to many friends and relatives. I expressed my views orally since Nov. 17, 1989 to my mother, and friends Ken Mariner, Carol Davis and others the night after I returned from the induction center. Previous to the induction date I never expressed any views one way or the other regarding to the 10 status, because I never thought about it very seriously until the actual situation came up that I was to be called into the Armed Service and would be required to bear arms and help to kill people. This didn\u2019t hit until the day 1 received my induction notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">There is also in the file a letter dated February 3, 1970, from one of the registrant\u2019s friends stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-21\">\u201cEver since Nov. 17, 1969, Joel Zis-kowski has told me of his beliefs concerning participation in the Armed Services. He feels that the commandment \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 should not be disobeyed in mans society even in wartime. He feels that it is against all his religious beliefs to take a human life or help to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-22\">. Subsequently a second interview was granted to registrant in March 1970 and the same decision not to reopen the case was made by the Local Board, which sent him a letter of March 13, 1970, containing similar language. Also, there is a notation in the Minutes of Action taken by the Selective Service Authorities under date of April 14, 1971, stating that the reason of the Board Members for refusing to reopen registrant\u2019s 13 March 1970 classification is \u201cThey found no change in circumstances over which he had no control. . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b576-5\">. See Scott v. Commanding Officer, 431 F.2d 1132, 1136 (3d Cir. 1970); Paszel v. Laird, 426 F.2d 1169 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. In the Summary of Information Furnished by Registrant (Form SSSP-3563A) prepared by the Board in connection with the February 5, 1970, personal interview (page 63 of Exhibit 6-1), the following statements appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201cWas asked when did he decide he was a C.O. Registrant advised his feeling erystalized when he received the induction order. Pointed out to him that he was first ordered for induction in 1968. Did not request 150 when first ordered for Apr. 1968 Call nor for the Nov. 1969 Call. . . . Acknowledged that he never did anything about his feelings until now.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b576-10\">. There was evidence in the Local Board file, contained in three letters supporting his request for conscientious objector classification from his family and friends, stating that he was conscientiously opposed to war in any form when he was in high school, several months before October and November 1969 when he received the notice of induction order requiring him to report for induction on November 17, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Further, the above-mentioned file contained statements of registrant that he had not applied for a 1-0 status before receipt of the notice of induction in the fall of 1969 \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t sure of what to do. I didn\u2019t feel that I could receive an I.O. classification\u201d (Summary of 5 February 1970 interview at 40a). On a rider to Question 1 of Form 150, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-17\">\u201cI was ignorant of the law regarding 10 status and assumed that to be classified you must be a Quaker or Meninite [sic] and all other religions or religious beliefs were not considered for reclassification.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b576-18\">. The following language appears in Summary of Information Furnished by Registrant\u201d (Form SSSP-3563-A) covering his February interview (page 63 of Exhibit 6-1) : \u201cBut you have not attended Sunday School or church in recent years. A. not regularly. Is not acquainted with the present clergy.\u201d In registrant\u2019s written summary of the interview, which he sent to the Board, the following appears as the first questions asked him (page 65 of Exhibit G-l) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-20\">\u201cDo you attend church regularly. No I haven\u2019t attended in almost 8 years. \u201cDoes your minister know the way you feel? Could he write a letter of support of your claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aob-dedup-0\">\u201cHe was transferred about 8 years ago. I don\u2019t know where he is right now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-23\">We note that Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), was decided in June 1970, more than three months after the final board action of March 1970. For the effect of <em>Welsh </em>on the review of conscientious objector claims, see, <em>e. g., </em>Aquilino v. Laird, 316 F.Supp. 1053 (W.D.Tex.1970), on reconsideration after remand, 429 F.2d 573 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b577-10\">. See Ehlert v.

That is, Ehlert\u2019s local board determined that even if Ehlert were a late crystal-lizer entitled to a conscientious objector classification, this late crystallization of his beliefs did not result from \u201ccircumstances over which the registrant had no control,\u201d so that no reopening of his classification was possible. See Ehlert v. United States, 422 F.2d 332, 333 (9th Oir. 1970), aff\u2019d, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 U.Ed.2d 625 (1971) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cIn refusing to reopen his classification, the local board advised appellant that its action was based upon its determination that \u2018the information submitted on SSS form 150 was not a change in your status which was beyond your control.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Additional support for this interpretation of the local board\u2019s actions in <em>Ehlert </em>is the apparent fact that Ehlert\u2019s request for a reopening of his classification was rejected by return mail without any grant of a courtesy interview by the local board. Compare the reaction of Ziskow-ski\u2019s Local Board in scheduling two personal appearances for Ziskowski, as set forth at pp. 481-482 and n. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b579-16\">. See the possibilities listed in paragraphs 1 and 3 on pages 482-483.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b579-17\">. On August 20, 1971, approximately 17 months after Ziskowski was finally ordered to report for induction and four months after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ehlert, </em>a Department of Defense Directive (No. 1300.6, IV) interpreting AR 635-20, U 3(b), was amended to specifically provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that the local board\u2019s denial must be \u201con the merits\u201d for such denial to render a member of the Armed Services ineligible for classification as a conscientious objector. See DOD Directive No. 1300.6, IV, A.1. (b)(2) (Aug. 20, 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b579-18\">. This interpretation of the Board\u2019s action would have been particularly reasonable in view of the fact that the Board granted Ziskowski two personal interviews before finally ordering him to report for induction.
