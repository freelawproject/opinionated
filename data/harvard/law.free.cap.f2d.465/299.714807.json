Plunkett filed two petitions in the Tax Court challenging the Commissioner\u2019s determinations regarding deficiencies in income tax, additions to tax, and alleged over-payments. The two petitions, one involving the years 1957 through 1959 and the other 1960 through 1963, were consolidated for trial and decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On Oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tober 2, 1970, the Tax Court entered its decisions sustaining a deficiency of $9,-504.96 for the taxable year 1957 and additions to tax under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of $35,141.10 for the years 1957 through 1963.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the Tax Court denied his petition for reconsideration, Plunkett appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">During the years in question, the taxpayer ran a food catering business with the assistance of Mrs. Plunkett. Both Plunkett, who has had little formal education, and his wife are allegedly untutored in the intricacies of bookkeeping and accounting. The taxpayer did not maintain any formal records for his business nor did he retain a bookkeeper or accountant to do so for him. He did, however, keep a customer order book which reflected each catering event and, in most instances, the amount charged therefor. He also separated paid bills from unpaid bills and retained them in different drawers.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Plunkett timely filed original individual income tax returns for the years 1957 through 1959 and original joint returns for the years 1960 through 1963. The original returns for 1957, 1958 and 1959 were prepared by others on the basis of information supplied by Plunkett. To compute the net income shown on those returns, the taxpayer had estimated his total expenses and deducted that amount from his estimated gross receipts or else he had deducted the total estimated expenses from the amount that he had deposited in his bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">During this period, Plunkett engaged in transactions in the stock market and in the commodity futures market. He subscribed to a security advisory service and maintained a margin account with a brokerage house, which periodically sent him information concerning his account and periodically credited cash dividends to the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Although Plunkett knew that dividends were taxable income, he failed to report such income for the taxable years 1957, 1958 and 1959. In his testimony in the Tax Court, he attributed this omission to his claimed belief at the time that dividends credited to an account need be reported only if they are withdrawn from the account. Plunkett did not withdraw any dividends during 1957, 1958 or 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">In about December 1963, the taxpayer became concerned with the manner in which he was handling his tax matters, and in early 1964, he consulted an aider-man who helped him find an attorney to advise him. Shortly after Plunkett began working with the attorney, a revenue officer conferred with Plunkett, his wife, and one of his employees about the employee\u2019s tax affairs. At this time, late June 1964, the IRS had not assigned an agent to examine Plunkett\u2019s income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">On the advice of his attorney, Plunkett decided to file amended returns for the years 1958 through 1963. (Counsel recommended that no amended return be prepared for 1957.) With the help of a CPA, Plunkett completed this task by the end of July. The returns were based on information that had been available to the taxpayer when he had filed originally. On August 6, 1964, Plunkett filed the amended returns and paid the additional taxes shown on them, plus interest. The Commissioner generally accepted the new returns as reflecting accurately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Plunkett\u2019s income, expenses and deductions for 1958 through 1963.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Subsequent to August 11, 1964, IRS agents conducted a criminal investigation of Plunkett\u2019s original and amended returns. On the basis that the amended returns \u201cspoke for themselves,\u201d Plunkett and his represenatives declined any cooperation during the course of the criminal investigation. In December 1966, a four-count indictment was returned against Plunkett and his wife for violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 with respect to their joint income tax returns for the years 1960 through 1963. The defendants entered pleas of not guilty. Plunkett later changed his pleas to nolo contendere upon his counsel\u2019s understanding that the Government would then move to dismiss the indictment as to Mrs. Plunkett. However, the Government objected to the tendered pleas and stated that it would not move to dismiss. Plunkett, by his attorney, thereupon withdrew his tender of the nolo contendere pleas and pleaded guilty. Following a colloquy between Plunkett and the district court, the court entered the guilty pleas and granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Mrs. Plunkett.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Plunkett was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation on each count of the indictment, the sentences to run concurrently on the condition that he serve 90 days of the probation in a \u201cjail type\u201d institution. He was also fined $20,000. Before the commencement of the jail term, Plunkett, then aged 73, suffered a stroke, and the court vacated the imposition of the 90 days\u2019 imprisonment. Plunkett has never appealed from the conviction or sentence in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In the civil suit in the Tax Court below, the Commissioner introduced evidence as to the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 to meet his burden of proving fraud on the part of the taxpayer. However, to sustain the fraud penalties for the years 1960 through 1963 he relied entirely on the original and amended returns and the doctrine of collateral estoppel, based on Plunkett\u2019s criminal conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Plunkett\u2019s first contention is that the Tax Court erred in finding that a part of his underpayments of income tax for the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 was due to fraud with intent to evade tax within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(b) so as to render the petitioner liable for the \u201cfraud penalty\u201d addition to tax. More particularly, Plunkett argues that the court improperly ignored his defense of voluntary disclosure and that the Commissioner failed to satisfy the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Contrary to the Commissioner\u2019s assertion, we think that the record supports Plunkett\u2019s claim that his disclosure of the inaccuracies in his original returns was voluntary. He had filed amended returns for the years 1958 through 1963 before the criminal investigation of his tax affairs was initiated. The conferences between the Plunketts and Internal Revenue Service agents pri- or to the time the amended returns were filed concerned the tax returns of one of Plunkett\u2019s employees; that is,, the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tioner was involved only as the employer of a person being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We cannot therefore conclude, however, that the United States Attorney was foreclosed from prosecuting Plunkett or that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was precluded from pursuing civil remedies, including the imposition of fraud penalties, against a taxpayer whom he believed evidence showed to have filed false and fraudulent original returns. The IRS may have an informal policy of sometimes not seeking full sanctions against an errant taxpayer who voluntarily and prior to the initiation of an IRS investigation files amended returns and pays the additional taxes due, but it is not required to follow that policy of leniency. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., 225 F.2d 394, 397-398 (7th Cir. 1955), cert. denied on the cross petition, 352 U.S. 998, 77 S.Ct. 552, 1 L.Ed.2d 544, and the decision vacated on other grounds, 355 U.S. 233, 78 S.Ct. 245, 2 L.Ed.2d 234 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Although we find that such admissions create no legal bar, we appreciate the irony that \u2014 as Plunkett points out \u2014 a taxpayer may thereby become the unintended victim of his own defensive maneuvers. An objective observer might well come to the conclusion that the combination of criminal and civil penalties visited upon Plunkett was unduly harsh under the circumstances here involved. Nevertheless, it is apparent that one of the calculated risks of tax evasion, as well as of the violation of any criminal law, is that the full measure of the law\u2019s retribution may be asserted by way of demonstrating its irrefragability.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We turn then to the second prong of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">It is well established that whether an underpayment of income is due to fraud is a question of fact. \u201c[Although . . . this is a fact which the Commissioner is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence, it, like other findings of fact, will not be upset unless clearly erroneous. . . . \u201d Archer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 227 F.2d 270, 274 (5th Cir. 1955). See also Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). To meet his burden of proof, the Commissioner need not prove the precise amount of the underpayment resulting from fraud, but only that \u201cany part\u201d of the underpayment is attributable to fraud. <em>See </em>Estate of W. Y. Brame v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 25 T.C. 824 (1956), aff\u2019d per curiam, 256 F.2d 343 (5th Cir. 1958). We are also mindful that fraud may be established by circumstantial evidence and that the taxpayer\u2019s background and the context of the events in question may be considered, <em>e. g., </em>Gano v. Commissioner, 19 B.T.A. 518, 532 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Applying these principles to the present case, we hold that the Tax Court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. The court had a sufficient basis for sustaining the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Plunkett filed false and fraudulent income tax returns for 1957, 1958 and 1959 within the purview of section 6653(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The factors that the court cited adequately support its finding that Plunkett \u201cwas more than grossly negligent. . . .\u201d29 C.C.H. Tax Ct.Mem. at 1246. Among the factors considered were: Plunkett\u2019s being a person of at least average intelligence and average business understanding; his success as a businessman; his long experience in investing in the stock market; his failure to maintain proper books and records of his business receipts; his further failure to utilize fully what information he did have at the time the original returns were prepared so as to facilitate the accurate reconstruction of his taxable income ; and his consistent and substantial understatement of income on his original tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Plunkett calls to our attention the fact, which the Commissioner does not contest, that his estimates of his business expenses on the original returns were much lower than his actual ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>penses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He argues that this belies his supposed fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We agree that this circumstance is not without significance. However, because Plunkett understated his receipts by $35,649.76 more than he understated his expenses \u2014 resulting in a concealed net profit \u2014 we cannot fault the Tax Court for finding that that element of the misreporting was insufficient to counteract the combined force of all the other factors listed above.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Our resolution of the first issue raised by Plunkett controls our disposition of the second issue: whether the Tax Court erred in finding that the statute of limitations did not bar the assessment and collection of a deficiency in income tax for 1957, where no assessment for 1957 had been made within three years from the filing of the return for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">It is true that, as a general rule, the amount of any deficiency in income tax must be assessed within three years after the return was filed. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501. But in the case of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax, the tax deficiency may be assessed at any time. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(c) (1). The Tax Court was therefore correct in holding that the statute of limitations had not run against the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">The taxpayer next urges that he was entitled to receive credit for or a refund of overpayments of tax he made for 1958 and 1959 resulting from carrying forward to those years a capital loss incurred in 1957. This carry-forward loss was not reflected in the original or the amended returns filed by Plunkett for 1958 and 1959.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commissioner contends that, because the taxpayer did not timely file a claim for refund, the statute of limitations bars him from receiving any credit or refund of the overpayments of tax. In rebuttal, Plunkett asserts that he should not be barred from recovering by any statutory limitations period because the Commissioner, having proven fraud for the years 1958 and 1959, is not restricted by any time limitation in the assessment of deficiencies and penalties for those years. \u201c[T]he years should be open for all purposes including refunds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The Tax Court did not pass on Plunk-ett\u2019s claim for a refund because it erroneously believed that the Commissioner had given the petitioner full credit for the overassessments in his recomputation of taxes and penalties for the years in question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather than remanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>case to the Tax Court, we have decided to settle the dispute since it involves a matter of law only.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Although Plunkett\u2019s proposition that \u201cthe government should not have any greater advantage than the [taxpayer]\u201d sounds appealingly evenhanded, unfortunately it has no support in the cases or in the existing statutes. Claims for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax are required to be filed within three years from the time the return respecting the overpaid tax was filed or within two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever expires the later. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(a). Generally, after the expiration of those time periods, the taxpayer is barred from receiving credit or refund unless he had timely filed his claim. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(b) (1). Plunkett cannot meet these requirements. He also cannot satisfy the conditions set out in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(c) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6512.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Finally, Plunkettt argues that the Tax Court erred in determining that his conviction in 1967 for income tax evasion for the years 1960 through 1963 collaterally estopped him in the subsequent civil proceedings from denying that the returns for those years were fraudulent. The Commissioner introduced no affirmative evidence of fraud in the Tax Court but relied on the returns and Plunkett\u2019s plea of guilty and his criminal conviction to sustain the imposition of the 50 percent \u201cfraud penalty,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Most courts faced with the question have held that a prior conviction for tax evasion after a trial on the merits operates as a collateral estoppel on the issue of civil fraud in a fraud penalty proceeding. The criminal conviction necessarily carries with it the ultimate factual determination that the underpayments of tax were \u201cdue to fraud\u201d within the meaning of section 6653(b). <em>E. g., </em>Moore v. United States, 360 F.2d 353 (4th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1001, 87 S.Ct. 704, 17 L.Ed.2d 541 (1967); Armstrong v. United States, 354 F.2d 274, 173 Ct.Cl. 944 (1965); Tomlinson v. Lefkowitz, 334 F.2d 262 (5th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 962, 85 S.Ct. 650, 13 L.Ed.2d 556 (1965); Amos v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 43 T.C. 50 (1964), aff\u2019d, 360 F.2d 358 (4th Cir. 1965). Two recent decisions of the Tax Court reiterate this principle, C.B.C. Super Markets, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 54 T.C. 882 (1970), and Rodney v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 53 T.C. 287 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Plunkett does not contest the validity of this rule, but he does maintain that it is inapplicable under the special circumstances of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">We note that there is strong authority holding that a guilty plea is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal charge. McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">In Arctic Ice Cream Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 43 T.C. 68 (1964), a corporate taxpayer was held to be collaterally estopped from denying fraud in a civil proceeding by its previous conviction for tax evasion based upon a guilty plea. In upholding the imposition of a civil fraud penalty, the court declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">\u201cIt is not material that Arctic\u2019s conviction was based upon a guilty plea, because for purposes of applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as well as for other purposes, there is no difference between a judgment of conviction based upon such a plea and a judgment of conviction rendered after a trial on the merits. . . . Arctic\u2019s plea of guilty to this indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>was therefore a conclusive judicial admission that its return for 1946 was false and fraudulent and that the deficiency in tax which was the necessary result of its being filed was due to fraud with intent to evade tax.\u201d 43 T.C. at 75.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><em>See also </em>Otsuki v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 53 T.C. 96 (1969) (dicta).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In oral argument before this court, Plunkett conceded that perhaps there may be convictions based on pleas of guilty that should operate as estoppels. He stoutly contended, though, that his conviction requires different treatment. He urges us \u201cto look behind [his] conviction\u201d and to conclude that \u201cwhere the circumstances of the plea, such as coercion induced by his wife\u2019s indictment and failure by the trial court to inquire as to whether, in fact, he evaded taxes, indicate that the plea might have been involuntary, the government should not be allowed to use that plea to collaterally es-top the appellant in a civil case.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Worcester v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 370 F.2d 713 (1st Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The judge presiding at the criminal proceeding informed Plunkett of the offenses charged against him in the indictment and of the consequences of his pleading guilty. Plunkett then acknowledged that he was fully aware of the charges against him and of the consequences of his plea. When the court inquired, \u201c[Have] there been any representations of any kind made to you as to what disposition of your case would be, in view of your plea of guilty here, Mr. Plunkett?,\u201d he answered, \u201cNo, your Hon- or.\u201d This colloquy does not substantiate the appellant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was coerced as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We concur in the opinion of the court below that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">\u201c[t]he stated understanding of counsel, that the government would move to dismiss charges against Mrs. Plunk-ett if petitioner would plead guilty to the charges against him, does not vitiate petitioner\u2019s otherwise voluntary plea of guilty where the agreement was fully performed in conformity with the petitioner\u2019s expectations. Petitioner did not misunderstand the terms or the immediate consequences of the agreement and his plea of guilty. Hence, the existence of the agreement does not affect the volun-tariness of his plea.\u201d 29 CCH Tax Ct.Mem. at 1247.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">We find ample support for this holding in United States ex rel. Cunningham v. Follette, 397 F.2d 143 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1058, 89 S.Ct. 699, 21 L.Ed.2d 699 (1969); Cortez v. United States, 337 F.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 953, 85 S.Ct. 1811, 14 L.Ed.2d 726 (1965); and Kent v. United States, 272 F.2d 795 (1st Cir. 1959). <em>See also </em>United States v. Carlino, 400 F.2d 56 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 1013, 89 S.Ct. 1630, 23 L.Ed.2d 39 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Plunkett also complains that the judge who accepted his guilty plea was not informed of any evidentiary foundation to support the criminal charge. Consequently, the provision of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that \u201c[t]he court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea\u201d was allegedly violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Plunkett relies heavily on McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), where the Supreme Court admonished federal district courts to adhere rigorously to Rule 11. It held that if a district court does not comply fully with the rule, the defendant\u2019s guilty plea must be set aside and his case remanded for another hearing at which he may plead anew. The Court carefully noted that its holding was not based upon constitutional grounds. In Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969), the Court decided that <em>McCarthy </em>should be applied only to guilty pleas accepted after the date of that decision, April 2, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">The alleged defect in the proceedings against Plunkett was not of constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>al dimensions. The petitioner took no appeal directly attacking his conviction or sentence, and he has paid the fine imposed upon him. In light of these circumstances and the restrictions placed on <em>McCarthy </em>by <em>Halliday, </em>we can see no justification for sustaining Plunkett\u2019s collateral attack on the conviction and for voiding the consequences of that conviction in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In sum, we agree with the Tax Court below that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s conviction for tax evasion in the years 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1963, pursuant to a plea of guilty, collaterally estops the petitioner from denying fraud for those years.\u201d 29 CCH Tax Ct.Mem. at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We conclude that the decision of the Tax Court (as supplemented herein as to the point not reached by that court) should be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-19\">.

$10,862.47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">. For the years 1957, 1958 and 1959, Plunkett understated his business expenses by a total of $326,294.78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">. The record shows that the sizable understatements of income resulted from taxpayer\u2019s total failure to report his dividend income as well as from his understating the receipts and profits of his catering business. From 1957 through 1959, Plunkett received $37,203.60 in cash dividends which were credited to his margin account and of which he was notified by his stockbrokers. Although the Tax Court decided that it did not need to consider whether petitioner\u2019s omission of this dividend income was due to fraud with intent to evade taxes, the Commissioner argued in his appellate brief that the omission of such income was further evidence of Plunkett\u2019s fraudulent intent, citing Irolla v. United States, 390 F.2d 951, 954, 82 Ct.Cl. 775 (1968), and Lusk v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 250 F.2d 591, 594-595 (7th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 357 U.S. 932, 78 S.Ct. 1376, 2 L.Ed.2d 1375 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b398-16\">. In its investigation of Plunkett\u2019s returns for the years 1957 through 1959, the Internal Revenue Service had determined that Plunkett had incurred capital losses that were not reflected in the returns. It advised him of this in the notice of deficiency dated July 11, 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\">. The Commissioner did in reality carry forward the 1957 capital losses in arriving at the figure to which the 50 percent penalty under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(b) would be applicable. Thus, the amended return for 1958 showed income tax of $19,512.43, which was paid. In effect, this figure, however, was reduced by (a) the amount paid in the original return and (b) the amount of the 1957 carryover applicable to 1958. The penalty was based on the remaining balance of $13,117.80 and not on the tax actually paid. The same procedure was followed for 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>It is also to be noted that while the Tax Court referred to \u201crecomputation of taxes and penalties\u201d for 1958 and 1959, no deficiency of tax was assessed for those years ; the recomputation was only for the purpose of determining the correct income tax liability to which the penalty would be applicable. The determination here was not whether the taxpayer owed more or less tax for 1958 and 1959 but involved the amount of the penalty for those years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
