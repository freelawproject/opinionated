In substance, students living in the relatively integrated neighborhoods of central Little Rock would attend schools in their own neighborhoods. Fourth grade children living in the predominantly white, western section of the city and those living in the predominantly black, eastern section would attend desegregated classes in the western section of the city. Fifth grade students living in both these sections would attend desegregated classes in the eastern section. Black students would comprise from 29.7 to 53.5 percent of the 4th or 5th grade students assigned to each school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">2) Desegregate grades 1 through 3 in the central section of the city by assigning children to schools in their own neighborhoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-13\">3) Purport to desegregate grades 1 through 3 in the western and eastern sections by assigning students in these grades to schools in their own neighborhoods. Classes in these first three grades in the western section would be nearly all white and in the eastern section nearly all black.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-14\">4) Require the school board to provide free transportation for all students living more than two miles from the school to which they are assigned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-15\">We approve the district court\u2019s plan insofar as it provides for the integration of grades 1 through 5 in the central section of the city. We do so because this aspect of the plan preserves the neighborhood school in relatively integrated neighborhoods,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and there is nothing to suggest that students in these grades will not be placed in fully desegregated classrooms and school buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>We cannot approve the plan, however, insofar as it provides that approximately four thousand students in grades 1 through 3 living in the segregated neighborhoods of eastern and western Little Rock will continue to attend segregated classes during these important primary grades.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">It is argued that the plan for grades 1 through 3 in the eastern and western sections should be approved because students attending the segregated classes in these grades will be doing so in school buildings that will house integrated 4th or 5th grades. This argument is without merit. <em>See </em>Jackson v. Marvell School District No. 22, 425 F.2d 211 (8th Cir.1970). <em>Cf. </em>Moses v. Washington Par. Sch. Bd., 456 F.2d 1285, (5th Cir. 1972), petition for cert. filed, 41 U.S.L.W. 3056 (U.S., July 18, 1972, No. 72-41). It flies in the face of the clear mandate of Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist., 449 F.2d 493 (8th Cir.1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 954, 30 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972) <em>(Clark 1971), </em>which requires the desegregation process to apply fully to all elementary grades. The argument appears to be a last ditch effort to retain a segregated school system in the primary grades contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate that segregation be eliminated \u201croot and branch.\u201d Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 437-38, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968). <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Tex. Edu. Agcy., 467 F.2d 848, (5th Cir., 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">Under these circumstances, we have no alternative but to remand this matter once more to the district court. In doing so, we Order:</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-13\">1) That the district court\u2019s plan for the 4th and 5th grades be implemented at the beginning of the 1972-73 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">2) That the district court\u2019s plan for grades 1 through 3 in the central section of the city be implemented at the beginning of the 1972-73 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-15\">3) That the school board\u2019s proposal relating to students attending the first three grades in the eastern and western sections of the city be disapproved for failure to meet constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-16\">4) That the school board submit to the district court, before January 1) 1973, a detailed plan applicable to these students which requires their attendance at desegregated classes in a desegregated school. The board is directed to make the assignment of pupils to schools in a manner similar to that utilized in desegregating the classes and schools for students living in the eastern .or western sections of Little Rock and attending grades 4 or 5. Transportation shall be furnished to these students in accordance with the criteria previously established by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-17\">5) That the district court hold hearings on the detailed plan at the earliest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>possible date and issue its decision promptly so that any possible appeal can be taken in sufficient time to implement the plan at the beginning of the 1973-74 school year. The present plan for assignment of pupils of these first three grades in the eastern and western sections of Little Rock, as approved by the district court, of necessity will apply until the beginning of the 1973-74 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">We recognize that our order is quite specific, but it needs to be. We had requested the school board to produce a plan for these grades a year ago. It failed to meet that responsibility. That failure was just one in a series. The plaintiffs-appellants had suggested a different plan for desegregating the elementary grades. The district court did not accept that plan. We advise, however, that if the parties themselves can come to an agreement on an alternative plan for students attending the elementary grades, such plan will be acceptable if it meets the criteria set forth in <em>Clark 1971, supra, </em>449 F.2d 493, and in this case, and receives the approval of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">The additional year\u2019s delay in integrating some of the primary grades is regrettable but we feel that fairness to the children requires that the parties be given an opportunity to work out the practical details for implementing the plan that we have suggested, or to develop an alternative plan. This appeal reached us too late for the parties to have such an opportunity before the beginning of the present school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF TEACHERS</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">The school board in a cross-appeal asks us to reverse that part of the district court\u2019s order requiring the majority of the teachers in each elementary school to be of the race (black or white) different from that of the majority of the students.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">Appellants do not resist this request but concede that this aspect of the district court\u2019s order \u201cdoes not serve any useful purpose * * The appellants in their own appeal relating to teacher assignments assert that the school board has failed to promulgate any proper standards for reassignment of teachers in connection with efforts to desegregate the faculty in the elementary schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-14\">We consider each of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-16\">The record shows that the faculty of the Little Rock School District consists of 70 percent white and 30 percent black teachers. Appellee school board notes in its brief that it is committed to providing a desegregated faculty which is no less than 18 percent nor more than 45 percent black at each school in Little Rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-17\">Since the appellants do not dispute the constitutional validity of this aspect of the school board\u2019s plan, which seeks to assign black and white teachers to each school in a manner substantially proportionate to the ratio of black to white teachers in the school system as a whole,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we believe the district court\u2019s modification of the board\u2019s plan to be inappropriate and set aside that part of the court\u2019s order which requires assignment of faculty so that \u201celementary schools with a greater number of students of one race will have teachers of a greater number of the other race for that particular school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-19\">We comment briefly upon plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the school district has promulgated vague and uncertain standards for reassigning individual faculty members. The school board\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>concerning employment, retention, assignment, and discharge of teachers is governed in part by provisions of an agreement with the Classroom Teachers\u2019 Association. This agreement provides for objective as well as subjective guidelines for evaluating a teacher\u2019s quality and performance. In the area of assignment of teachers within a school or reassignment of teachers from one school to another, the personal preference of an individual teacher appears to carry substantial weight. The agreement sets out no standard accommodating this preference with constitutional requirements for a desegregated faculty at each school. Appellants argue that these faculty reassignment criteria are \u201cvague and uncertain * * * do not contain enlightenment as to weight accorded each; nor * * * when they apply and how they may be implemented.\u201d [Appellants\u2019 Brief at 15]</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">We agree that these regulations governing assignment and reassignment provide no clear guidelines for achieving a desegregated faculty in each school on a fair and racially nondiscriminatory basis. However, no adequate record has been developed demonstrating particular constitutional inadequacies in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">We think it premature for us either to approve or to disapprove these standards in these proceedings and upon the present record. For the present, we believe this matter is one that should be subject to further study and review of the board as it proceeds with the disestablishment of the dual system in the Little Rock School District. Should appellants have specific constitutional objections to the nature or effect of the criteria used in the assignment or transfer of teachers within the school system, and suggestions for remedying such deficiencies, they may present such matters to the district court for its consideration at an appropriate time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">REQUEST FOR STAY</p>\n<p id=\"APqc\">Appellant school board requests a stay of implementation of any order in these proceedings which requires \u201ccross-town busing of elementary students. [Appellants\u2019 Brief at 24].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The school board argues that such a stay is required by \u00a7 803 of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318 (June 23, 1972), 86 Stat. 235. That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6R\">Notwithstanding any other law or provision of law, in the case of any order on the part of any United States district court which requires the transfer or transportation of any student or students from any school attendance area prescribed by competent State or local authority for the purposes of achieving a balance among students with respect to race, sex, religion, or socioeconomic status, the effectiveness of such order shall be postponed until all appeals in connection with such order have been exhausted or, in the event no appeals are taken, until the time for such appeals has expired. This section shall expire at midnight on January 1, 1974.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">The explicit language pertinent here refers to a court order \u201cwhich requires the transfer or transportation of any student * * * from any school attendance area prescribed by competent local authority * * This section specifically does not require us to delay desegregation of grades 4 and 5. The attendance zones for students in these grades have been prescribed by the school board. The order of the district court now appealed approved the school board\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-17\">While the school board had developed its plan<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in compliance with the man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>date of this court in <em>Clark </em>1971,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it also had proceeded to exhaust all avenues of appellate review of that mandate. The Supreme Court denied the board\u2019s application for certiorari on February 22, 1972. Board of Education of Little Rock School District v. Clark, 405 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 954, 30 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Since the transfer of students to grades 4 and 5 in the eastern and western sections of Little Rock comes about through a proposal of the school board, approved by the federal courts, such transfer falls outside those court orders reached through \u00a7 803. Accordingly, we deny any stay of implementation of these particular desegregation procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">We think it obvious that \u00a7 803 cannot apply to the present mandate to be issued in this case by this court, which will require the desegregation of the first three grades in primary schools located in the eastern and western sections of Little Rock. This part of the mandate will not require full implementation until the beginning of the 1973-74 school year. Thus, even if the term \u201call appeals,\u201d as used in \u00a7 803, should be construed to include an application to the Supreme Court for a grant of certiorari, the board will have ample time to test our action in the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. Our mandate shall issue without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">Costs shall be taxed against the school board, and appellants are allowed counsel fees on this appeal of $1,000.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1139-18\">. A history of the prior litigation may be found in Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist., 426 F.2d 1035, 1037 n. 1 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 952, 91 S.Ct. 1608, 29 L.Ed.2d 122 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"amp-dedup-1\">.

The defendant has stressed the cost of this transportation. We think it clear, however, that \u201c[e]qual educational opportunity must be provided despite cost and inconvenience.\u201d United States v. Tex. Edu. Agcy., 467 F.2d 848, 875, (5th Cir., 1972). The school board has not demonstrated that transportation between the eastern and western sections of Little Bock would either risk the health of the children in the primary grades or significantly impinge on the educational process. <em>See </em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 30-31, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). In <em>Swann, </em>the Supreme Court approved a desegregation plan which included provisions for transportation of elementary students in grades 1 through 4 for as long as thirty-five minutes. The record in the present case indicates that transportation time would be similar, thirty to forty-five minutes. Moreover, this time factor is the same as in the plan which the school board adopted and the district court approved for those students requiring transportation in grades 4 and 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1140-17\">. <em>See </em>Clark v. Board of Education of Little Rock School Dist., 449 F.2d 493, 499 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 954, 30 L.Ed.2d 812 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), the Supreme Court stated that segregation is particularly damaging to children in grade school and high school because it generates a feeling of inferiority \u201cthat may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.\u201d The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-8\">\u201cSegregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpret-ted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial [ly] integrated school system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">If Little Rock\u2019s children have an opportunity for an integrated education in the primary grades, then they will be better prepared to compete effectively in the already desegregated higher grades. <em>See </em>Johnson v. San Francisco Unified School District, 339 F.Supp. 1315, 1332 (N.D.Cal.1971); Swann v.
