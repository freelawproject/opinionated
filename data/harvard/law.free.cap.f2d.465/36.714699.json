Keresty, 334 F.Supp. 461 (W.D.Pa.1971), and this appeal followed. The question presented is whether the Act as construed and applied to appellants is a permissible exercise by Congress of its powers under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Appellants were convicted for engaging in extortionate credit activities subsequent to a gambling incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the facts are in some dispute, the following appears to have transpired. On August 18, 1969, appellant Keresty and one Louis Capo were engaged in a game of dice in New Brighton, Pennsylvania. At the end of the game, Keresty claimed that Capo owed him $8,000 and demanded payment. Capo disputed the debt<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and indicated that in any event he did not have such a sum on hand. No threats were made at this time. Keresty made the demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>again the next day, was similarly rebuffed and thereafter resorted to a series of rather bizarre strategies to secure payment. Thus, four days later, he arrived at Capo\u2019s used car dealership and introduced appellant Phillips as \"Tony from the syndicate,\u201d \u201cTony from Chicago\u201d and \u201ca syndicate enforcer,\u201d although the record indicates that Phillips was neither a representative of any \u201csyndicate\u201d nor from Chicago.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Demands for payment, coupled with blatant threats were then made, but to no avail, and appellants departed empty-handed. Keresty appeared a few days after this incident driving a car with Ohio license plates and promptly informed Capo that \u201cthis [was] a syndicate car.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He. again demanded payment, making further references to \u201csyndicate\u201d involvement in financing his stake in the crap game as well as its \u201cdispleasure\u201d that he (Capo) had not as yet been particularly cooperative. Capo again stated that he was unable to settle the debt without additional time and the debt was deferred to allow Capo sufficient time to raise the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In order to settle the debt, sundry arrangements were entered into by the parties with Capo finally agreeing, <em>inter alia, </em>to pay Keresty $2,000 in cash. A scheme of payment was outlined involving a fourth individual, whereby Keresty permitted Capo to repay part of the debt, while \u201cextending credit\u201d for the remainder. Although no interest payments were involved, the unpaid portion was apparently to be paid in specified amounts and at stated intervals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After the agreement was finalized, appellants departed, warning Capo in no uncertain terms what would happen if he did not live up to his bargain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Capo was able to meet the first few installments he subsequently was unable to continue the payments and his life was once again threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">Against the background of this unsavory conduct appellants wisely do not argue insufficiency of the evidence. Rather, they contend that in enacting the Extortionate Extension of Credit Provisions, Congress simply did not intend to cover this type of \u201clocal gambling debt\u201d and that the Act\u2019s proscription should be interpreted as extending only to transactions involving that class of underworld species colloquially referred to as \u201cloan sharks.\u201d Specifically, they argue that the Act should be held inapplicable to the facts at hand since there was allegedly no \u201cextension of credit\u201d as contemplated by the Act, that a \u201cdebt\u201d rather than a \u201cloan\u201d was at issue and that there were no interest payments ever added to the amount claimed due. Alternatively, they contend that if their activities were covered by the Act, the Act must be held unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">We conclude that the credit transactions here at issue were, in fact, violative of Title II of the Act. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>plain language of Section 891(1) defines an \u201cextension of credit\u201d as \u201cto make or renew any loan, <em>or to enter into any agreement, </em>tacit or express, <em>whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim, </em>whether acknowledged or disputed, valid or invalid, and <em>however arising, may or will be </em>deferred.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, Section 891(6) defines an \u201cextortionate extension of credit\u201d as <em>\u201cany extension of credit </em>with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debt- or at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, Section 892 states that its terms encompass <em>\u201cwhoever makes any </em>extortionate extension of credit. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Our reading of the legislative history<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> supports the conclusion that Congress intended to attack the economic base of organized crime and therefore did not restrict its efforts to those financial dealings which necessarily included each of the various attributes of a loan shark transaction. In a section entitled \u201cGeneral Applicability\u201d Congress stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cThe full utility of chapter 42 as a weapon in the war on organized crime obviously cannot be assessed until it has been tested in battle. Some general observations, however, appear to be in order at this point. <em>As noted above, it is not, and is not intended to be, a Federal usury law, nor does it have anything to do with interest rates as such. </em>It is, rather, a deliberate legislative attack on the economic foundations of organized crime. <em>Most of the business of the underworld, whether in loan sharking, gambling, drugs, \u2018protection,\u2019 or other activities, involves extensions of credit as refined in section 891 at one or more stages. </em>The methods used in the enforcement of such obligations are notorious. Thus, a very large proportion of underworld financial transactions fall within the ban of one or more of the provisions of chapter 42. It may very well develop that this chapter will find as much usefulness in the investigation and prosecution of transactions entirely within the world of organized crime as it does in connection with transactions between those within that world and those who are otherwise outside it. <em>Be that as it may, the conferees wish to leave no doubt of the congressional intention that chapter is a weapon to be used with vigor and imagination against every activity of organized crime that falls within its terms.\u201d </em>1968 U.S. Cong. &amp; Adm.News, p. 2029. (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Finally, had Congress intended to limit the Act to loan sharks, it could have easily so provided. For example, loan sharking has often been considered solely in terms of the interest rates charged \u2014namely, \u201cvigorish\u201d \u2014 as in the report of a New York State Commission which defined the practice as \u201cthe charge of unconscionably high and onerous rates of interest on loans of money.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, after extensive hearings, Congress did not choose to attack the problem as so defined. Rather, the federal crime relates to \u201cextortionate credit transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tions,\u201d \u201chowever they may arise,\u201d <em>supra </em>n. 1, and the Act recites express congressional findings that <em>\u201cextortionate credit transactions </em>are characterized by the use, or the express or implicit threat of the use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to person, reputation, or property as a means of enforcing repayment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the very approach of the Act is to define extortionate credit transactions in terms of this express finding rather than imposing a requirement that the prosecution prove each of the elements of a loan shark transaction qua loan shark transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In brief, both the statutory language and legislative history support a broad interpretation of \u201cextortionate extension of credit.\u201d While Congress was perhaps primarily concerned with the loan shark threat, we can conclude \u201cwith certainty sufficient to justify a criminal conviction\u201d that Congress intended to proscribe the conduct here in issue. <em>Cf. </em>Re-wis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 811, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">We now reach the question of whether the Act is constitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">In earlier criminal statutes enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause, Congress traditionally included in the definition of the crime a requirement that a specific connection be demonstrated between the defendant\u2019s activities and interstate commerce.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With respect to the Extortionate Extension of Credit Provisions, Congress in its \u201cFindings and Declaration of Purpose\u201d determined that extortionate extensions of credit <em>intrinsically </em>affect interstate commerce.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As a result, the prosecution has been relieved of the burden of alleging and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>proving that the particular activity involved in each individual case has affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The validity of this approach in general and of the Act in particular was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971), <em>followed </em>by United States v. DeCarlo, 458 F.2d 358 (3d Cir. January 12, 1972). See also United States v. Riehl, 460 F.2d 454 (3d Cir. May 9, 1972). Although the defendant in <em>Perez </em>was undisputedly a \u201cloan shark,\u201d the Court held that <em>\u201cextortionate credit transactions </em>though purely intrastate, may in the judgment of Congress affect interstate commerce,\u201d <em>supra, </em>402 U.S. at 154, 91 S.Ct. at 1361, and that Congress\u2019 prohibition of <em>extortionate credit transactions </em>was within the realm of federal power under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Relying on the \u201cclass of activities\u201d test employed, for example, in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964); and Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258, the Court then concluded that <em>Perez </em>was \u201cclearly a <em>member of the class </em>which engages in <em>\u2018extortionate credit transactions\u2019 \u201d </em>as defined by Congress, 402 U.S. at 153, 91 S.Ct. at 1361, and where the \u201cclass of activities\u201d is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power \u201c \u2018to excise as trivial individual instances\u2019 of the class,\u201d 402 U.S. at 154, 91 S.Ct. at 1361, citing Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 193, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968). Thus, the constitutionality of the Act is settled as to its application to a purely intrastate extortionate extension of credit \u2014 albeit one involving a \u201ctypical\u201d loan shark.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Appellants, while conceding that it is unnecessary to show an <em>actual </em>effect on interstate commerce in a loan shark prosecution such as <em>Perez, </em>nevertheless contend that Congress had no authority to even proscribe the type of extortionate credit transaction at issue here. Specifically, they contend that the class is not rationally defined and question their very inclusion within that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The <em>Perez </em>decision, while concluding that there was an adequate basis for the congressional finding that <em>\u201cloan sharking\u2019\u2019 </em>had a substantial adverse effect on interstate commerce, did not, of course, refer to any other subclass of extortionate credit transactions. Further, it is true that Congress did not break down its findings and did not recite any specific conclusions regarding the precise type of extortionate credit transaction involved here. However, <em>Perez </em>explicitly rejected the argument advanced by appellants, that Congress must, in fact, do so: \u201cWe have mentioned in detail the economic, financial, and social setting of the problem as revealed to Congress. <em>We do so not to infer that Congress need make particularized findings in order to legislate.\u201d </em>402 U.S. at 156-157, 91 S.Ct. at 1362 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Although the fact that Congress has stated that a particular activity affects interstate commerce, that determination does not preclude further examination by the Courts, Katzenbach v. McClung, <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 298, 85 S.Ct. 377. However, our inquiry is carefully circumscribed and we need only address ourselves to two questions: (1) Was there a rational basis for Congress\u2019 findings that extortionate extensions of credit affect interstate commerce; and (2) If it had such a basis, whether the means it selected to eliminate that evil are reasonable. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc., <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 258-259, 85 S.Ct. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Our answer to the first question must be in the affirmative. As to the second, it is equally clear that the means employed are indeed reasonable in light of Congress\u2019 efforts to attack the economic base of organized crime through the proscription of extortionate credit transactions. It is sufficient that Congress has defined a limited class of credit transactions, <em>i. e., </em>those involving extortionate means of extension and collection, as having a substantial effect on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>interstate commerce. That this particular transaction cannot be directly tied to organized crime, does not affect the validity of the congressional approach employed here. So long as the goal is within the power of Congress, we will not substitute our judgment for the judgment of Congress as to the wisdom of this particular statutory scheme. <em>See </em>United States v. Reihl, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pABL\">The judgments will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">.

Its activities involve many billions of dollars each year. It is directly responsible for murders, willful injuries to person and property, corruption of officials, and terrorization of countless citizens. A substantial part of the income of organized crime is generated by extortionate credit transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">\u201c(2) <em>Extortionate credit transactions </em>are characterized by the use, or the express or implicit threat of the use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to person, reputation, or property as a means of enforcing repayment. Among the factors which have rendered past efforts at prosecution almost wholly ineffective has been the existence of exclusionary rules of evidence stricter than necessary for the protection of constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-19\">\u201c(3) <em>Extortionate credit transactions are earned on to a substantial extent in interstate and foreign commerce and through the means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where extortionate credit transactions are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate and foreign commerce.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">\u201c(4) Extortionate credit transactions directly impair the effectiveness and frustrate the purposes of the laws enacted by the Congress on the subject of bankruptcies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-21\">\u201c(b) On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of chapter 42 of title 18 of the United States Code [this chapter] are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform and effective laws on the subject of bankruptcy.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-22\">A similar determination was made by Congress in passing the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. There, too, Congress imposed criminal sanctions upon certain classes of activities without requiring proof that the particular activity against which the sanction was imposed had an effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b137-14\">.
