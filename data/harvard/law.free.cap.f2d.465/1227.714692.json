Sosa brought this action to rescind a consumer credit transaction in which she had transferred a security interest in her principal residence. She alleged that defendant had failed to make certain disclosures required by Title I of the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (Truth-in-Lending), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq., </em>and contended that \u00a7 1635<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> guaranteed her the right to rescind the transaction. The district court first concluded, citing \u00a7 1633<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that inasmuch as the State of Texas has disclosure requirements similar to those provided for in the Act, and provided adequate enforcement thereof, Sosa\u2019s transaction was exempted from coverage under the Act; it further concluded that, in any event, the federal court was without jurisdiction under the provisions of \u00a7 1640<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and consequently could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>not entertain the claim. Being unable to agree with either of these conclusions, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">The Act does not leave it to the judiciary to determine whether any given state\u2019s transactions are exempted from the federal disclosure requirements. Under \u00a7 1633, such an exemption can be granted only by the Federal Reserve Board and then only after proper application has been made to and reviewed by that agency. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.12. No such action has been taken regarding any class of transactions in the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">A more difficult issue, and one we need not reach, is that of whether the Act itself affords the federal court the authority to grant rescission. Though language in several recent cases<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> indicates that \u00a7 1640, the only explicit jurisdictional grant within the Act, empowers the court to vindicate at least all rights protected in the credit transaction portion of the Act, \u00a7 1635-44, we decline to follow these indications. Nor do we agree with the lower court that Sosa\u2019s jurisdictional claim must necessarily be grounded under the Act, if at all. Though it is true that general jurisdictional statutes do not confer jurisdiction where an applicable regulatory statute otherwise precludes it, Schilling v. Rogers, 363 U.S. 666, 80 S.Ct. 1288, 4 L.Ed.2d 1478 (1960); Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950); United Electrical Contractors Association v. Ordman, 258 F.Supp. 758 (S.D.N.Y.1965), there is nothing in \u00a7 1640(e) which indicates either that it was designed to bar access to other jurisdictional grants or to be the exclusive entree to federal judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-11\">We therefore consider Sosa\u2019s invocation of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1337, and find it to be well-taken. That section provides that the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce. This Act plainly qualifies as a jurisdictional base. It, like Title II of the same Act, was the result of an exercise of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, <em>see </em>Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971), and was designed to enhance economic stabilization and strengthen competition among institutions and firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601. Further, there can be no question that the \u201carising under\u201d tests are met. Sosa\u2019s claim is a direct assertion of a federal statutory right, and a construction of the statute and its accompanying regulations will have a direct bearing on recovery. Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service, 417 F.2d 569 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">Our decision in no wise passes on the merits of Sosa\u2019s claim, her motion for summary judgment, or the motions and contentions of certain would-be intervenors. We hold only that the court below had jurisdiction to hear Sosa\u2019s complaint, and we remand the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">. \u00a7 1635.
