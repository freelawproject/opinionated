After exhausting State remedies, he filed the present \u00a7 2254 application for writ of habeas corpus which was denied by the District Court.

The first of these, the <em>Wither-spoon</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issue, need not be confronted because recent Supreme Court pronouncement makes clear that his second contention, the assertion that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment in contravention of the Eighth Amendment, requires reconsideration of the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus by the District Court. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for reconsideration in light of Furman v. Georgia, 1972, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 and companion cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-16\">. Witherspoon v.
