Appellant contends that under the common law \u2014 which was received into the District of Columbia for the governance of criminal trials<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 there is a presumption against the testimonial capacity of children under 14, and that their testimony cannot be received unless the trial judge conducts a voir dire as to the capacity of the child witness before he begins his testimony. There was not such preliminary voir dire in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"pAGGb\"> The matter is not governed by express statute, and decisions indicative of a common law rule of a presumption against capacity for children under a certain age<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not necessarily indicate a requirement of preliminary voir dire. More significantly, common law doctrines are not frozen for criminal cases<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> any more than civil cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the courts charged with voicing the common law of the District of Columbia take account of the evolution of common law principles in the light of current perceptions and needs. If we were faced with need to consider a specific age rule, we should take into account not only how modern life apparently leads to earlier development of many children, but also how legislatures have responded to that consideration by creating a presumption that a child is competent as a witness at age 10.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The sound common law rule, however \u2014 and one set forth in decisions of the Supreme Court and this court \u2014 establishes that the common law does not retain absolute disqualification of young witnesses at any particular age.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither does sound common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>doctrine fix any particular age as raising a presumption of lack of capacity, or requiring a preliminary voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The ultimate test of competence of a young child is whether he has the requisite intelligence and mental capacity to understand, recall and narrate his impressions of an occurrence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The decision of the trial judge may not be upset on appeal unless clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This applies not only to his ultimate decision on testimonial maturity but also to the examination he chooses to conduct to appraise capacity. Of course, with children of tender years, a trial judge properly conducts a preliminary voir dire, and we have indicated our concern that such questioning be handled in a way that is meaningful, and not by inquiry that borders on the casual and uses leading questions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABd\">In respecting the discretion of the trial judge as to what kind of examination to use, we take into account that we cannot review the appearance in the courtroom.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">In the case at bar, the 12-year-old complainant was immediately identified as a student in the sixth grade of a junior high school. The judge observing her appearance and manner saw no need for a voir dire. No objection or request was made by defense counsel,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> though there was no doubt of the problem posed by the youth of the prosecution witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The transcript reveals intelligible comprehension in terms of answering the questions that were asked. We see no basis for a claim that the trial judge was clearly erroneous either in proceeding without a preliminary voir dire or in accepting the testimony of the young witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\">. In Hill v. United States, 22 App.D.C. 395 (1903), the court referred to the Act of Congress of February 27, 1801, declaring the common law of crimes, as existing in Maryland at the time of the cession of the District, in force in the District, to be of continuing effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Recent decisions illustrating the incorporation of common law doctrine into criminal jurisprudence are the rulings that gross negligence resulting in homicide constitutes the crime of involuntary manslaughter, as at common law, under the D.C.Code provision punishing \u201cmanslaughter\u201d without further definition.

As many of these matters cannot be photographed into the record, the decision of the trial judge will not be disturbed on review unless from that which is preserved it is clear that it was erroneous.\u201d <em>See also </em>United States v.
