Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, 390 U.S. 238, 88 S.Ct. 1005, 19 L.Ed.2d 1071 (1968), and decide whether the Federal Maritime Commission\u2019s instant order is in accordance with relevant law and supported by substantial evidence. Answering these questions in the affirmative, we affirm the order under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">This is a petition for review of an order of the Commission amending a dual rate contract system to permit ocean shippers and receivers to separately contract for the carriage of goods under preferential rates in each of five trade areas served by petitioner, the Latin America/Pacific Coast Steamship Conference. Petitioners\u2019 existing exclusive patronage dual rate contract requires shippers, in order to obtain lower rates, to give their exclusive patronage to petitioners in all three outbound trades served by petitioners, and similarly requires receivers, in order to obtain lower rates, to do likewise with reference to petitioners\u2019 two inbound trades.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">I. <em>History of Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"a6q-dedup-0\">\n<em>A. Phase One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">The long procedural tangle in the instant case had its beginning in January of 1962 when petitioner, pursuant to section 15 of the Shipping Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter the \u201cAct\u201d), filed for approval of Agreement No. 8660 which created the Latin America/Pacific Coast Steamship Conference, superseding ten previously independent conferences serving inbound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and outbound trade between the Pacific Coast of the United States and Latin America. Dividing the trade into five areas, the agreement provided that, although all members of the conference had a vote with reference to general matters, only those carriers actively serving a particular trade area could participate in the establishment of rates and related matters affecting that area. While the Commission was considering Agreement No. 8660, petitioners filed proposed dual rate contracts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for Commission approval under section 14b of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these contracts, shippers of goods in any of the outbound trade areas were committed to exclusive use of conference vessels in all three outbound trade areas, while receivers were obligated to exclusive use of conference vessels in both inbound trade areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">After consideration of the record, the Commission rendered its decision in The Dual Rate Cases, 8 F.M.C. 16 (1964), which approved petitioners\u2019 Agreement No. 8660 and the dual rate contracts <em>subject </em>to the condition that petitioners offer their dual rate contracts to merchants on a <em>separate </em>basis in <em>each </em>of the five trade areas. The Commission expressed its concern stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">if the conference is permitted to offer a single dual rate contract which includes all five of the trade areas, merchants will be forced to obligate themselves to exclusive conference patronage in trade areas not desired in order to obtain contract rates in a trade area where they feel the dual rate contract meets their needs. This seems to us neither necessary nor fair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Petitioners and two other conferences filed petitions for review of the Commission\u2019s decision in the Ninth Circuit, which, although remanding for certain procedural infirmities, affirmed the Commission with respect to its section 14b actions. Pacific Coast European Conference v. United States, 350 F.2d 197 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 958, 86 S.Ct. 433, 15 L.Ed.2d 362 (1965). On petition for rehearing, however, the Ninth Circuit, in an unpublished <em>per curiam </em>opinion, set aside the five-contract separability condition imposed by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">B. <em>Phase Two</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">Following remand, the Commission instituted a rule making proceeding to determine whether the \u201cone trade-one contract\u201d requirement should be reimposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of petitioners\u2019 challenge to the rule making format, a full evi-dentiary hearing was held, at the conclusion of which, the examiner, in an initial decision, upheld petitioners\u2019 dual rate contracts under section 14b. However, upon exception, the Commission once again imposed the condition that the conference offer its dual rate contract in <em>each </em>of the five trade areas,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relying upon the failure of petitioner to meet the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard promulgated by the Commission in Investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>tion of Passenger Travel Agents, 10 F. M.C. 27 (1966), and affirmed by the Supreme Court in Federal Maritime Comm. v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 243, 88 S.Ct. at 1009 wherein the Court upheld the Commission\u2019s test that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">conference restraints which interfere with the policies of antitrust laws will be approved only if the conferences can \u201cbring forth such facts as would demonstrate that the [restraint] was required by a serious transportation need, necessary to secure important public benefits or in furtherance of a valid regulatory purpose of the Shipping Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">C. <em>Phase Three</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The Conference, again protesting the decision moved the Commission to reopen the proceeding to afford it an opportunity to meet the new burden of proof imposed by <em>Svenska. </em>The Commission, acquiescing in a reopening, nevertheless, reaffirmed its previous \u201cone trade-one contract\u201d decision rejecting the examiner\u2019s initial decision once again. The Commission, noting that \u201cthe exclusive patronage tying arrangement embodied in a dual rate contract would clearly run counter to the antitrust laws,\u201d (J.A. 177-78) concluded, that, under <em>Svenska, </em>this fact standing alone rendered petitioners\u2019 dual rate contracts \u201ccontrary to the public interest,\u201d and shifted the burden to petitioners of introducing \u201cother evidence in the record [which] fairly detracts from the weight of this factor [antitrust conflict]\u201d by demonstrating \u201cthe necessity for this restraint in terms of legitimate commercial objectives.\u201d Federal Maritime Comm. v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 244, 246, 88 5. Ct. at 1009. Examining petitioners\u2019 evidence, the Commission \u201cremain[ed] unconvinced . . . that the present so-called single-contract system is required by some serious transportation need, necessary to secure important public benefits or in furtherance of any valid regulatory purpose of the Shipping Act.\u201d (J.A. 178). The Commission concluded that much of petitioners\u2019 evidence confused advantages attributable to the conference format with those resulting from the dual rate contracts and accordingly ruled against petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">Before turning to the specific arguments advanced and issues raised on appeal, it will, in our view, facilitate matters to briefly examine the nature of the antitrust-regulatory conflict and cursorily survey the vagaries of the ocean shipping industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">II. <em>Accommodation of Regulatory and Antitrust Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"As7q\">Forced to steer a course between a regulatory Scylla and an antitrust Charybdis, we pause for a moment to reflect upon the rhyme and reason of our voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">Although the policies underlying the antitrust laws<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the regulatory agency statutes are conflicting,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> their purposes \u2014 -service to the public \u2014 are complementary. As we indicated in Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 130 U.S.App.D.C. 220, 226, 399 F.2d 953, 959 (1968), they both attempt to \u201cachieve the most efficient allocation of resources possible\u201d and to \u201cestablish an atmosphere which will stimulate innovations for better service at a lower cost.\u201d <em>See also </em>Symposium on \u2018Regulated\u2019 Industries and Antitrust, 32 A.B.A. Antitrust L.J. 239-41 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">It is all too clear that \u201c[t]he general objective of the antitrust laws is promotion of competition in open mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>kets.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As Justice Black has eloquently observed, \u201c[the antitrust laws were] designed to be a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade. [They rest] on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our .economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.\u201d Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 4, 78 S.Ct. 514, 517, 2 L.Ed.2d 545 (1958). The Supreme Court has \u201clong recognized that the antitrust laws represent a fundamental national economic policy . . .,\u201d Carnation Co. v. Pacific West-bound Conference, 383 U.S. 213, 218, 86 S.Ct. 781, 784, 15 L.Ed.2d 709 (1966), and often commented upon the \u201cindispensable role of antitrust policy in the maintenance of a free economy.\u201d United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 348, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 1733, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963). <em>See </em>Marine Space Enclosures, Inc. v. Federal Maritime Comm., 137 U.S.App.D.C. 9, 420 F.2d 577 (1969); Pacific Seafarers, Inc. v. Pacific Far East Line Inc., 131 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 237, 404 F.2d 804, 815 (1969). Indeed, they have been deemed important enough to be denominated the \u201cMagna Charta of free enterprise.\u201d United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610, 92 S.Ct. 1126, 1135, 31 L.Ed.2d 515 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">There are, on the other hand, particular economic or social objectives sought by Congress which are unattainable through the free forces of competition. In seeking these goals Congress has therefore established regulatory agencies to supervise certain industries. \u201cRegulation of a specific industry . \u2018evidences congressional recognition that competition can assure protection of the public interest only in an industrial setting which is conducive to a free market and can have no place in industries which are monopolies because of public grant, the exigencies of nature, or legislative preference for a particular way of doing business.\u2019 \u201d S. S. W., Inc. v. Air Transport Ass\u2019n of America, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 276, 191 F.2d 658, 661 (1951). \u201cOf course, the fact that there is substantial regulation does not preclude the regulatory agency from drawing on competition for complementary or auxiliary support. Satisfactory accommodation of the peculiarities of individual industries to the demands of the public interest necessarily requires in each case a blend of private forces and public intervention.\u201d Federal Communications Comm. v. RCA Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 93-94, 73 S.Ct. 998, 1003, 97 L.Ed. 1470 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">In those areas in which Congress has felt that competition is less appropriate, it has exempted the industries from the operation of the antitrust laws. <em>See </em>C. Kaysen &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Policy 41-43 (1959). The reasons generally advanced for these exemptions are: 1) disparity of economic power; 2) assistance for American businessmen against foreign competition; 3) incentives for research and development; 4) national defense needs; 5) maintenance of favorable federal-state relations; 6) the inherent nature of the activity; and 7) tradition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Various tests have been proposed for determining when antitrust exemptions should be granted. The better school of thought is that no exemptions should be permitted unless necessary to carry out the purpose of the statute. Thill Securities Corp. v. New York Stock Exchange, 433 F.2d 264, 268 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 994, 91 S.Ct. 1232, 28 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971) <em>quoting </em>Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963). <em>See also, </em>Comment, Accommodations of Antitrust Law and Ocean Shipping Regulation, 4 Texas Int\u2019l L. Forum 393, 409-12 (1968). An opposing school of thought is that once a regulatory agency has intervened in an industry, the antitrust laws should not apply unless the agency cannot effectively regulate the industry. Hale &amp; Hale, Competition or Control VI: Application of Antitrust Laws to Regulated Industries, 111 U.Pa.L.Rev. 46, 58-59 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Some of the antitrust exemptions have been explicitly set forth in regulatory statutes. <em>E. g., </em>Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814; Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 221(a), 222(c) (1); Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1384; Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5(11), 5b, 9; Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 62. These exemptions must in any event be narrowly construed. Maryland &amp; Virginia Milk Producers Association, Inc. v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 80 S.Ct. 847, 4 L.Ed.2d 880 (1960); United States v. McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc., 351 U.S. 305, 316, 76 S.Ct. 937, 100 L.Ed. 1209 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Where the exemptions are not express, they must of course be inferentially gleaned, if at all, from the statute. However, we cannot overemphasize that \u201cimmunity from antitrust laws \u2018is not lightly implied.\u2019 \u201d United States v. First City National Bank of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 368, 87 S.Ct. 1088, 1093, 18 L.Ed.2d 151 (1967) <em>quoting </em>California v. Federal Power Comm., 369 U.S. 482, 485, 82 S.Ct. 901, 8 L.Ed.2d 54 (1962). <em>See </em>Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 456, 65 S.Ct. 716, 89 L.Ed. 1051 (1945). This cardinal rule of construction disfavoring lacunae in the application of antitrust laws has been applied to a myriad of industries faithfully catalogued in the following cases. Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm., <em>supra, ISO </em>U.S.App.D.C. at 226-227, 399 F.2d at 959-960; Alabama Power Co. v. Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc., 394 F.2d 672, 682-683 (5th Cir. 1968) (Godbold, J., dissenting). Indeed, there is a presumption that antitrust principles apply unless a contrary intent appears expressly or by necessary implication. Cities of Statesville v. Atomic Energy Comm., 142 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 297, 441 F.2d 962, 987 (1969) (en banc) (Leventhal, J., concurring). <em>See also </em>Sabre Shipping Corp. v. American President Lines, Ltd., 285 F.Supp. 949, 953 (S.D.N.Y.1968), cert. denied sub nom., Japan Line Ltd. v. Sabre Shipping Corp., 395 U.S. 922, 89 S.Ct. 1774, 23 L.Ed.2d 239 (1969). As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \u201c[r]epeals of the antitrust laws by implication from a regulatory statute are strongly disfavored, and have only been found in cases of plain repugnancy between the antitrust and regulatory provisions.\u201d United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, <em>supra, </em>374 U.S. at 350-351, 83 S.Ct. at 1734 (footnotes omitted) and authorities cited therein. <em>See </em>S. S. W., Inc. v. Air Transport Ass\u2019n. of America, <em>supra, </em>89 U.S.App.D.C. at 276, 191 F.2d at 661 (1951). Even where the agency\u2019s particular statutory standard requires that it override antitrust principles, this \u201cdoes not compel unawareness of antitrust policies, and the agency may well be able to harmonize diverse and even competing policies.\u201d Cities of Statesville v. Atomic Energy Comm., <em>supra, </em>142 U.S.App.D.C. at 297, 441 F.2d at 987 (Leventhal, J., concurring). <em>See </em>McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67, 79, 64 S.Ct. 370, 88 L.Ed. 544 (1944). In essence then, the duty of the agencies and courts is to accommodate or harmonize antitrust and regulatory principles. <em>See </em>Seaboard Airlines R. R. v. United States, 382 U.S. 154, 156, 86 S.Ct. 277, 15 L.Ed. 2d 223 (1965) <em>quoting </em>Minneapolis &amp; St. L. Ry. v. United States, 361 U.S. 173, 80 S.Ct. 229, 4 L.Ed.2d 223 (1959). Indeed, regulatory agencies have long used the antitrust laws to give \u201cunderstandable content to the broad statutory concept of \u2018the public interest\u2019 \u201d often found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>in their statutory charters.

Federal Power Comm., 99 U.S.App.D.C. 113, 237 F.2d 741 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">With this background we now proceed to an examination of the ocean shipping industry in light of the relevant criteria including \u201cthe specific language of the congressional statute involved, any legislative history which would throw light on the congressional intent, the relative importance of the governmental action which is asserted to override antitrust policy, whether the governmental agency is required to take into consideration the possible anticompetitive effect of its actions, whether the agency is required to adhere to a clearly defined and restricted statutory directive, and to what extent the agency\u2019s actions are subject to judicial review.\u201d Hecht v. Pro-Football Inc., 144 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 60, 444 F.2d 931, 935 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">III. <em>The Ocean Shipping </em>Industry\u2014 <em>Statutory Framework and Svenska</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">A. <em>The Shipping Act of 1916 </em>\u2014 Ration<em>ale and Content</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Shipping conferences, organizations of steamship lines whose members regularly transport cargo, were organized to limit the competition which would otherwise exist between its members and to insulate member carriers from non-member carrier competition. Conferences were found necessary to combat the cutthroat competition and resulting business failures among shipping lines which often depressed the rates charged by the carriers to the cost of the voyage itself.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Once established, the conference members agreed among themselves upon matters such as rates, market quotas and sailing dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The six economic factors most frequently cited to justify the existence of the conference system are: 1) ease of market entry; 2) the industry\u2019s rigid fixed and operating cost structure; 3) the absence of any governmental control over the level of ocean freight rates; 4) the difference in operating costs of similar vessels flying different flags; 5) the almost invariable imbalance between inbound and outbound cargo; and 6) over-tonnaging.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In the early part of the twentieth century these conferences came under close scrutiny by the British Royal Commission on Shipping Rings which published a report in 1909. After extended study the Commission concluded that conferences should be permitted to continue since they encouraged regular dependable service at relatively stable rates. Several years after the report of the Royal Commission the House Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries, of which Representative J. W. Alexander was chairman, undertook an exhaustive inquiry into the practices of shipping conferences. The Committee\u2019s findings, contained in what has become known as the Alexander Report,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> resulted in the conclusion that while certain conference practices needed correcting, the confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ence system as a whole was a worthwhile device.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Among the advantages listed were those such as \u201cgreater regularity and frequency of service, stability and uniformity of rates, economy in the cost of service, better distribution of sailings, maintenance of American and European rates to foreign markets on a parity, and\" equal treatment of shippers through the elimination of secret arrangements and underhanded methods of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Report concluded that these advantages could only be preserved \u201cby permitting the several lines in any given trade to cooperate through some form of rate and pooling arrangement under Government supervision and control.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The basic recommendations of the Alexander Report were enacted into law by Congress in the Shipping Act of 1916.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 15 of the Act required certain conference agreements to be filed with an appropriate governmental body for approval.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Approved agreements were exempted from the antitrust laws. Other sections of the act prohibited certain prevalent anticompetitive<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and discriminatory practices.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Act did not, however, speak to another anticompetitive device \u2014 dual rates \u2014 subsequently adopted by many conferences.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">The dual rate system was successfully employed by conferences until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., 356 U.S. 481, 78 S.Ct. 851, 2 L.Ed.2d 926 (1958), where the Court held that such agreements were illegal \u201cwhere they [were] employed as predatory devices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 78 S.Ct. at 862. The Court\u2019s decision, casting a pall over dual rate contracts, prompted the Congress to enact interim legislation to neutralize the Court\u2019s holding by preserving the legality of dual rate contracts in effect at the time of the <em>Isbrandtsen </em>decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Following an extensive three year investigation, the Congress enacted permanent legislation, the 1961 amendments to the Shipping Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">B. <em>The 1961 Amendments to the Shipping Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">Three subcommittees of Congress \u2014 the Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, the Subcommittee on Steamship Conferences of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>and the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee \u2014 conducted exhaustive investigations into the operations of shipping conferences in international trade. The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee concluded that dual rate contracts were necessary to ensure strong conferences, which, although not flawless, did offer certainty of rates and scheduling redounding to the benefit of all.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary, naturally more antitrust oriented, placed greater emphasis upon the predatory anticompetitive devices of the conferences.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cThe Bill which was finally passed in the House reflected the fundamental conflict in approach to the regulation of the industry pursued and adopted by the two committees.\u201d American Export Isbrandtsen Lines v. Federal Maritime Comm., 127 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 70, 380 F.2d 609, 617 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">The Senate hearings were primarily concerned with reconciling some of the contradictory provisions in the House bill. The bill as reported out by the Senate<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> was more antitrust exemption oriented than that which passed the House.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The bill as finally reported out by the House-Senate Conference and enacted into law adopted essentially the Senate approach.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As we have said it was \u201clargely a triumph for the conference interests in that most of the antitrust aspects of the legislation were deleted and dual rate contracts were legalized.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> American Export Isbrandtsen Lines v. Federal Maritime Comm., <em>supra, </em>127 U.S.App.D.C. at 70, 380 F.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">The 1961 amendments made for our purposes several relevant changes in the law. Section 15 was amended to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>vide considerably broader Commission authority by permitting disapproval of-any conference agreement found to be-\u201ccontrary to the public interest.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Section 14b, the heart of the 1961 amendments, was added to provide that\"</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANR\">the . . . Commission shall . . . permit [dual rate agreements] . . . unless the Commission finds that the contract . will be detrimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the public interest, or unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from the United States and their foreign competitors.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In addition to the above requirements, Congress provided that in order to obtain Commission approval under \u00a7 14b, dual rate agreements must meet eight other specific requirements as well as a ninth requirement that the contract shall contain \u201csuch other provisions not inconsistent herewith as the Commission shall require or permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">C. <em>Svenska</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The 1961 amendments came before the Supreme Court for the first time in <em>Svenska. </em>In that case the Court upheld the Commission\u2019s requirement that conference restraints which interfere with the policies of the antitrust laws be approved only if the conference can bring forth such facts as would \u201cdemonstrat\u00e9 that the [restraint is] required by a serious transportation need, [or in order] .to secure important public benefits.\u201d The Court concluded that the 1961 amendments did not confer absolute antitrust immunity on conferences and that the test formulated by the Commission was an appropriate refinement of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard added to \u00a7 15 by the 1961 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">IV. <em>The Issues and their Resolution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">On appeal petitioners advance several theories for setting aside the Commission\u2019s order. Distilled to the essence, these theories number two. First, petitioners urge that the Commission committed error in relying upon the rationale and standards of <em>Svenska </em>in that the \u201cprinciples were intended to apply only to \u00a7 15 of the Act, not \u00a7 14b. Further-more, they urge that the unique factual circumstances in <em>Svenska </em>bar its application to the instant case. Petitioners\u2019 second contention is that even if we should find that the Commission\u2019s simulated <em>Svenska </em>test used in the case <em>sub judice </em>is proper, the Commission misapplied it and improperly evaluated the evidence in arriving at its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">A. <em>Commission Properly Found that the Rationale and Standards of Svenska Apply</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVK\">The Commission relied upon <em>Svenska </em>in two ways. First, it used <em>Svenska </em>to find that under \u00a7 14b incompatibility with the antitrust laws is a sufficient reason for denying immunity from these laws. Second, it relied upon <em>Svenska </em>to justify placing the burden of proof upon petitioners. Although not without difficulty, we must conclude that these dual applications of <em>Svenska </em>are neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">1. <em>Svenska: Antitrust Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the purpose of the statutory scheme would be defeated if incompatibility with the antitrust laws can be a sufficient reason for denying immunity from these laws is untenable. As the Court recognized in Federal Maritime Comm. v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 242-243, 88 S.Ct. 1005, the Shipping Act of 1916 conferred only <em>limited </em>antitrust immunity upon the shipping industry. We have recently made mention of this very fact in Seatrain Lines, Inc. v. Federal Maritime Comm., 460 F.2d 932 at 940 (D.C. Cir. March 23, 1972) where we observed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARr\">that Congress intended to tolerate only the <em>minimum </em>anticompetitive be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>havior necessary to preserve an essentially competitive structure in the maritime industry by striving to avoid either the failure or consolidation of independent steamship lines by the method of government supervision of anticompetitive working arrangements. While Congress recognized that in order to accomplish this result a measure of competition might have to be sacrificed, such as permitting agreement on rates or pooling of earnings, it did not intend thereby to remove <em>all </em>effective competition. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The 1961 amendments were not intended to do away with this limited immunity. As the Senate Report indicated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">The hearings of the committee have made it quite clear that our traditional antitrust concepts cannot be <em>fully </em>applied to this aspect of international commerce. Your committee has concluded that any attempt to effect regulation of this commerce in a measure <em>comparable </em>to that applied to our domestic commerce would be highly detrimental to our essential American-flag merchant marine. (Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The House Report similarly commented that \u201c[t]he committee believes that the present bill represents a <em>minimum </em>but necessary deviation from the concepts of the antitrust law.\u201d (Emphasis supplied) <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">It is noteworthy that the 1961 amendments articulated a \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard couched in substantially similar language in both sections 15 and 14b.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Svenska </em>indicated that the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard embodied in section 15 included antitrust considerations. We see no reason to reach a different conclusion with regard to section 14b in light of the legislative history and rules of construction cited above. We feel that the ambiguities, if any, should be resolved in favor of free competition. McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>321 U.S. at 94, 64 S.Ct. 370 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">2. <em>Svenska: Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">Petitioners assert that the mandatory language and legislative history of section 14b preclude imposing the burden of proof upon them. Admittedly, section 14b appears mandatory. The statute provides that the \u201cCommission . . . <em>shall . . </em>. permit [dual rate contracts] . . . <em>unless </em>the Commission finds that the contract . . . will be detrimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the public interest, or unjustly discriminatory or unfair . . '. . \u201d (Emphasis supplied). However, the language of section 15 is no less mandatory. Section 15 provides that the \u201cCommission <em>shall . </em>disapprove . . . any agreement , it finds to be unjustly discriminatory or unfair . . . , or to operate to the detriment of the commerce of the United States, or to be contrary to the public interest . . . , and <em>shall </em>approve all other agreements.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Despite this mandatory language in section 15, the Supreme Court has permitted imposing the burden of proof upon conferences in section 15 proceedings. We see no reason to differ with respect to section 14b, despite petitioners assertions that the legislative history dictates an opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-21\">Petitioners also rely upon a change in the statutory language of \u00a7 14b. As introduced in the House, the bill required the Commission to make an affirmative finding that \u00a7 14b contracts would be in the public interest. However, as enacted, the positive finding requirement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>deleted from \u00a7 14b.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Petitioners intimate that this evinces an intent to place the burden of proof upon the Commission. In rejecting such an analysis, we again refer to <em>Svenska </em>where the Court interpreted \u00a7 15, which similarly requires no affirmative showing by the-Commission, as susceptible of placing the burden of proof upon petitioners.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Furthermore, the excision of the affirmative showing requirement may have been thought useful, as the Senate Report observes, in that it allows easy cases to be disposed of quickly without building an extensive record.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\">Turning from the language of the statute to the legislative history of \u00a7 14b, we candidly admit that our statutory exegesis is not without difficulty, however, in light of the general rules of construction cited herein, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s approach to \u00a7 14b and <em>Svenska </em>is not arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">Petitioners, asserting that the legislative history of \u00a7 14b indicates that Congress did not intend to place the burden of proof upon the proponents of dual rate contracts, place particular reliance upon the following passage in the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">Your committee believes that if the [nine] specific requirements set forth in its amendments are met by the proposed contract, it should be entitled to Commission approval unless the Commission finds that the contract would be detrimental to the commerce of the United States, or contrary to the public interest or unjustly discriminatory or unfair. <em>We believe that any contract which contains the [nine] safeguards expressly required by the amended bill makes out a prima facie case that the contract is not detrimental to our commerce, or contrary to our public interest, or unjustly discriminatory or unfair. </em>(Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Even assuming this passage is as important as petitioners would have us believe, they have overlooked what the Ninth Circuit has denominated an \u201call-important proviso,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> section 14b(9), which states the Commission shall approve contracts filed provided that the contract expressly \u201ccontains such other provisions not inconsistent herewith as the Commission shall require or permit.\u201d Assuming the passage in the Senate Report is as noteworthy as petitioners contend, we conclude, mindful of the maxims of construction herein cited, that the Commission was empowered to include consideration of antitrust principles under \u00a7 14b (9) thereby requiring petitioners to surmount antitrust hurdles prior to taking advantage of the \u201cprima facie\u201d language in the Senate Report. We do not find such an interpretation to be inconsistent with the Shipping Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Although the legislative history of \u00a7 14b(9) is not free of doubt, we believe it supports an expansive reading. Enacted in substantially the same form as introduced,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> \u00a7 14b(9) was intended to confer upon the Commission a \u201cbroad rulemaking mandate.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Despite opposition to \u00a7 14b(9) from the shipping industry on the ground that it would give the Commission too much discretion,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Congress enacted the clause. Its purpose was to provide flexibility in the hands of the Commission.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Indeed, it was referred to as a \u201ccatchall\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> during the hearings.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Furthermore, the legislative history indicates that the Commission was empowered to \u201cestablish minimal standards, for dual rate contracts <em>beyond </em>those set forth in Public Law 87-346.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">In our view the imposition of the <em>Svenska </em>burden does not pose an insurmountable obstacle for petitioners. As we have said, \u201cparties alleging anticom-petitive conditions in proceedings before other agencies are frequently afforded the benefit of generous presumptions and shifts in burden of proof once they have demonstrated the existence of non-frivolous antitrust questions.\u201d Hale v. Federal Communications Comm., 138 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 133, 425 F.2d 556, 564 (1970) (Tamm, J., concurring). Many scholars have also approved placing the burden of proof upon those seeking antitrust limitations.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court indicated in <em>Svenska, </em>placing the burden of proof upon the conference does not make the limited antitrust immunity conferred by the Shipping Act illusory because actions which would violate antitrust laws may still be approved if sufficient justification for them exists. Furthermore, the Commission must, of course, adduce substantial evidence to support its finding of a statutory <em>reason </em>\u2014 &lt;e. <em>g., </em>contrary to public in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>terest \u2014 for disapproving the contract, \u201cbut once an antitrust violation is established, this alone will normally constitute substantial evidence that the agreement, is \u2018contrary to the public interest/ unless other evidence in the record fairly detracts from the weight of this factor.\u201d Federal Maritime Comm. v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. 245-246, 88 S.Ct. 1010. It is to this end which we now turn our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">B. <em>Commission Properly Found that Petitioners Failed to Meet Their Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Our function on appeal is to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusions reached by the Commission. Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm., 383 U.S. 607, 618-621, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966); Swayne &amp; Hoyt Ltd. v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 57 S.Ct. 478, 81 L.Ed. 659 (1937). In so doing we must recall that the Commission is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. Federal Maritime Comm. v. Aktiebolaget Svenska Amerika Linien, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 248, 88 S.Ct. 1005. Pursuing our statutory duties we must defer, as we do in the primary jurisdiction doctrine,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> to agency expertise where appropriate, American Export Isbrandtsen Lines v. Federal Maritime Comm., <em>supra, </em>127 U.S.App.D.C. at 93, 380 F.2d at 620, however, we must be wary for \u201cthe deference owed to.an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into a judicial inertia.\u201d Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Federal Maritime Comm., <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 272, 88 S.Ct. at 935 <em>quoting </em>American Ship Building Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965). Our scope of review has only recently been summarized by the Fifth Circuit in Port of New York Authority v. Federal Maritime Comm., 429 F.2d 663, 666 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 909, 91 S.Ct. 867, 27 L.Ed.2d 806 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">It is to be noted preliminarily that this review is in the frame of reference of a review involving the expertise of an administrative agency. . . . As to fact questions, we must consider whether the order in question is supported by substantial evidence. We are not to review the matter de novo nor are we to substitute our discretion for that of the Commission. Congress created the Commission to provide a forum for the solution of the technical and complex matters involved in the shipping industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">At the outset, we note that this is not the first time we have upheld a Commission finding that a dual rate contract violated the Shipping Act where the contract obligated the shipper to more than one trade area. <em>See </em>U.S. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Australia-New Zealand Conference v. Federal Maritime Comm., 124 U.S.App.D.C. 303, 364 F.2d 696 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">In light of our conclusion that the burden of proof rests upon petitioners, not the Commission, we must consider whether petitioner did in fact meet this burden. Eleven witnesses, including conference officials, carrier representatives and freight forwarders, testified on petitioners\u2019 behalf. Basically, all the testimony<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> favored petitioners\u2019 dual rate contract proposal.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tions advanced for the proposal included increased rate stability, better service and increased investment incentive. However, petitioners were unable to demonstrate either that these advantages were due to the two-contract system or that these advantages would cease upon enactment of a five-contract system. As the Commission indicated after a thorough review of the evidence, the witnesses often confused and were unable to distinguish advantages derived from conference amalgamation and the dual rate contract system.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Indeed, some witnesses assumed the choice was between petitioners\u2019 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>posed contract and no contract, which,.of course, was not the case.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> What the Commission sought were specific answers to the following questions: What are the legitimate commercial objectives achieved by the present contract system, which objectives fairly detract from the weight of the loss of freedom of choice by the shipper ? What transportation need is served by the present system? What important public benefits are secured by it? Is the present system imposed in furtherance of some valid regulatory purpose of the Shipping Act ? J.A. 177. Petitioners, however, as the Commission noted, failed to provide satisfactory non-speculative answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We should bear in mind that the Commission did not disapprove of the dual rate contract concept, but merely placed limitations upon its use. Such action is clearly in accord with our national policy that only the least restrictive inroads into free competition will be tolerated.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Absent the protection of section 14b, the exclusive patronage tying system embodied in a dual rate contract would clearly run counter to the antitrust laws. Having failed to present sufficient evidence which detracts from the weight of this antitrust factor, we find the Commission\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 proposed dual rate contracts are contrary to the public interest to be based upon substantial evidence and, accordingly, affirm the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"AE5F\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">\n<em>Section 14b of the Shipping Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWMb\">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, on application the Federal Maritime Commission (hereinafter \u201cCommission\u201d), shall, after notice, and hearing, by order, permit the use by any common carrier or conference of such carriers in foreign commerce of any contract, amendment, or modification thereof, which is available to all shippers and consignees on equal terms and conditions, which provides lower rates to a shipper or consignee who agrees to give all or any fixed portion of his patronage to such carrier or conference of carriers unless the Commission finds that the contract, amendment, or modification thereof will be detrimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the public interest, or unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from the United States and their foreign competitors, and provided the contract, amendment, or modification thereof, expressly (1) permits prompt release of the contract shipper from the contract with respect to any shipment or shipments for which the contracting carrier or conference of carriers cannot provide as much space as the contract shipper shall require on reasonable notice; (2) provides that whenever a tariff rate for the carriage of goods under the contract becomes effective, insofar as it is under the control of the carrier or conference of carriers, it shall not be increased before a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>able period, but in no case less than ninety days; (3) covers only those goods of the contract shipper as to the shipment of which he has the legal right at the time of shipment to select the carrier: <em>Provided, however, </em>That it shall be deemed a breach of the contract if, before the time of shipment and with the intent to avoid his obligation under the contract, the contract shipper divests himself, or with the same intent permits himself to be divested, of the legal right to select the carrier and the shipment is carried by a carrier which is not a party to the contract; (4) does not require the contract shipper to divert shipment of goods from natural routings not served by the carrier or conference of carriers where direct carriage is available; (5) limits damages recoverable for breach by either party to actual damages to be determined after breach in accordance with the principles of contract law: <em>Provided, however, </em>That the contract may specify that in the case of a breach by a contract shipper the damages may be an amount not exceeding the freight charges computed at the contract rate on the particular shipment, less the cost of handling; (6) permits the contract shipper to terminate at any time without penalty upon ninety days\u2019 notice; (7) provides for a spread between ordinary rates and rates charged contract shippers which the Commission finds to be reasonable in all the circumstances but which spread shall in no event be more than 15 per centum of the ordinary rates; (8) excludes cargo of the contract shippers which is loaded and carried in bulk without mark or count except liquid bulk cargoes, other than chemicals, in less than full shipload lots: <em>Provided, however, </em>That upon finding that economic factors so warrant, the Commission may exclude from the contract any commodity subject to the foregoing exception; and (9) contains such other provisions not inconsistent herewith as the Commission shall require or permit. The Commission shall withdraw permission which it has granted under the authority contained in this section for the use of any contract if it finds, after notice and hearing, that the use of such contract is detrimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the public interest, or is unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from the United States and their foreign competitors. The carrier or conference of carriers may on ninety days\u2019 notice terminate without penalty the contract rate system herein authorized, in whole or with respect to any commodity: <em>Provided, however, </em>That after such termination the carrier or conference of carriers may not rein-stitute such contract rate system or part thereof so terminated without prior permission by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Senator Kefauver offered the following definition in the Senate debates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">What is a dual-rate contract? Essentially, it is an exclusive patronage contract whereby a shipper \u2014 or consignee \u2014 promises to transport all of the cargo under his control, between ports within the scope of a steamship conference agreement, aboard vessels belonging to that conference. Shippers who do not sign such an agreement are assessed a rate, called the noncontract rate, substantially above the so-called contract rate which is available to signatories. In its most elemental terms, the dual-rate contract is nothing but an exclusive dealing arrangement in which signatory shippers are given preferential treatment while those unwilling to be bound are penalized by higher rates.

The bill as it passed tlie Senate eliminated the prohibition language and affirmatively permitted the use of dual rate, or exclusive patronage, contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">(2) The bill as it passed the House made it mandatory that all criteria be affirmatively met before the use of exclusive patronage contracts would be permitted and conference agreements approved by the Commission. The Senate version would permit the use of exclusive patronage contracts unless the Commission made findings to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-17\">(3) The bill as it passed the House contained several major provisions intended to protect the status of independent carriers who might choose not to join a conference but which would, at the same time, give the conferences full and fair opportunity to operate with effective dual-rate systems. The bill as it passed the Senate, for the most part eliminated all such provisions of an antitrust nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-18\">(4) The bill as it passed the House provided that conferences of carriers or individual carriers operating in the foreign commerce of the United States must designate persons upon whom service of process may be made within the United States and provide records or other information, wherever located, required by any order of the Commission. These features were stricken from the bill in the Senate version.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-19\">As agreed upon, by the conferees, the bill in major respects conforms with the Senate approach on the foregoing points.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfL\">Index to Legislative History, <em>supra, </em>note 2, at 444.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b644-20\">. <em>See </em>Antitrust Exemptions: Ocean Shipping Conferences, 33 A.B.A. Section of Antitrust Law 56, 61 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b645-20\">. \u00a7 2, 75 Stat. 763, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"AjN\">. \u00a7 1, 75 Stat. 762, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 813a (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">.

Mr. Flook, you have been a party to, signatory to the dual rate contract since 1961?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsV0\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqY7\">Q. And you indicate in your written testimony that it has been your experience that the rate agreement covering the three southbound and two northbound has resulted in improved service; is that correct? [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auu\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac4\">Q. On the part of the Conference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANBq\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyW3\">Q. What are you comparing that to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3G\">A. Well, we are comparing that to the previous system where there were 10 individual rate agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqYO\">Q. So since the Federal Maritime Commission\u2019s approval of the super conferences, we might call it, you have gotten better service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agkt\">A. We have, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ9\">Q. In your opinion, is this attributable to the amalgamation of separate conferences into one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHT\">A. Yes, it is an ability by the Conference, I feel, to better structure rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMJu\">Q. I don\u2019t understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtC\">A. Well, with the Conference controlling the five different trade areas, three southbound and two northbound, we feel that it offers the lines a greater opportunity through the participation of the European lines that do service the area, to offer better service both north and southbound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW0H\">Q. When you say better service, can you be a little bit more specific there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_z\">A. Well, as you perhaps know, there are sevex-al European lines which are carrying cargo from Europe to the Pacific Coast and they stop in on the way to Central America.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avf\">Q. And those European lines are members of the Conference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATK\">A. Yes, and they bring cargo up to the United States, so we have the additional sailings which offer us more flexibility in bringing us cocoa beans at the time we need it, up to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A50\">Q. And prior to the approval of the super conference, the Eui'opean lines were precluded from stopping into those Central American areas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK8\">A. They were not precluded that I recall, but they did not offer it on a scheduled basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbB\">Q. More specifically, how has the imposition of the dual rate agreement increased the service to you? The dual rate agreement is completely apart from the approval of the Conference rate? [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aal-dedup-0\">A. No, no. The dual rate agreement, in my opinion, offers to the line the opportunity to be assured of sufficient patronage which would justify the scheduling of vessels at regular intervals, and the receivers benefit through this scheduling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHD_\">Q. Has service increased from the time when the dual rate agreement was initially imposed on all areas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">A. It would be very difficult to answer that question because the service is dictated by the amount of cargo offerings. It may have decreased in the number of sailings both to the United States and from the United States on the Pacific Coast, but that might be due to the overall reduction in the volume of cargo moving and not attributable to the difference in the Conference structure today on what it was previously, [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7K\">Q. Has there, in fact, been a diminution of service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aid\">A. Not within the last two or three year's I would say. Previous to that, I think, there were more sailings, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayo-dedup-0\">Q. And what has accounted for the diminution of service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWLj\">A. As I said before, I think it is due to the lesser volume of cargo moving into these areas. I think there has been a greater industrialization in Latin America, and as a result it has affected some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of the movement from the Pacific Coast of manufactured items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATGZ\">J.A. 167-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">.
