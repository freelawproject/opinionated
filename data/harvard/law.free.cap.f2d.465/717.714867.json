The order is predicated upon careful and detailed findings of the trial examiner, who concluded that the employer had refused to bargain in good faith in violation of Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1). The trial examiner\u2019s decision and the board\u2019s decision and order appear at 186 NLRB No. 14, and this opinion assumes familiarity with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">In essence, the employer argues that the trial examiner\u2019s findings, adopted by the board, are not \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d (\u00a7 10(e) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e)), in two major respects. It argues, first, that, at most, the record shows permissible hard bargaining, in good faith, not a refusal to bargain, and second, that its insistence on a termination date for the proposed contract that was only seven weeks away was based on a good faith doubt as to whether the union still represented a majority of the employees in the unit, and that it therefore selected the end of the certification year as the termination date. We cannot accept either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\"> 1. Because the good faith of the employer \u2014 a subjective matter \u2014 is involved, the trier of fact must look to the employer\u2019s actions to determine whether it acted in gpod faith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">The union was certified as the employees\u2019 representative on July 12, 1968. Thereafter proposed contracts and proposed modifications were exchanged. There were at least 10 bargaining sessions, beginning August 19 and ending January 30. There was indeed hard bargaining by the employer. If this were all, we might agree with the employer\u2019s position. But there is more.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">The parties met again on April 3, and the union announced that it was withdrawing its demands and agreeing to the employer\u2019s proposals. It presented a signed contract, which did indeed accept all of the employer\u2019s proposals, and asked the employer to sign. The employer, however, in addition to stating that it wished to review the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>also repeated what had been said before \u2014that it reserved the right to withdraw its proposals or to modify them at any time. The next meeting was on April 30, and the employer listed its objections to the contract. They were almost all stylistic or typographical, except for reference to an alleged conflict between two articles, both of which tracked the employer\u2019s original proposals. The union proposed a contract of a year\u2019s duration. The employer, for the first time, said that it doubted the union\u2019s majority status, and that the contract should therefore extend only to July 12. Another meeting was held on May 22. The employer presented a redraft of the contract, expiring July 12, and offered to sign if the union would agree to one modification that the employer had inserted. The union said that a contract expiring only seven weeks away was no contract at all. The employer\u2019s response was that the union no longer represented a majority of the employees in the unit. Four days later, the employer filed a decertification proceeding, which the board\u2019s regional director properly dismissed as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">This kind of cat and mouse game is not good faith bargaining; it is its exact opposite, a negation of the employer\u2019s duty . . to enter into discussion with an open and fair mind, and a sincere purpose to find a basis of agreement. . . . \u201d NLRB v. Herman Sausage Co., 5 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 229, 231. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Insurance Agents\u2019 Intern. Union, 1960, 361 U.S. 477, 485, 80 S.Ct. 419, 4 L.Ed.2d 454; NLRB v. Mrs. Fay\u2019s Pies, 9 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 489, 492; NLRB v. Stanislaus Implement &amp; Hardware Co., 9 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 377, 380; NLRB v. Shannon, 9 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 545, 548. This duty does not require reaching an agreement, but it does prohibit \u201cmere pretense at negotiation with a completely closed mind and without [a] spirit of cooperation and good faith. . . .\u201d NLRB v. Wonder State Mfg. Co., 8 Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 210, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Sections 8(a) (5) and (d) do not require that a party make concessions or yield any position fairly maintained. H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 1970, 397 U.S. 99, 106, 90 S.Ct. 821, 25 L.Ed.2d 146; NLRB v. American National Insurance Co., 1952, 343 U.S. 395, 404, 72 S.Ct. 824, 96 L.Ed. 1027. This does not mean, however, that the Board is prohibited from examining the contents of the proposals put forth. The Board \u201cmust take some cognizance of the reasonableness of the position taken by an employer in the course of bargaining negotiations\u201d if it is not to be \u201cblinded by empty talk and by the mere surface motions of collective bargaining. . . .\u201d NLRB v. Reed &amp; Prince Mfg. Co., 1 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 131, 134. <em>See </em>Kayser-Roth Hosiery Co. v. NLRB, 6 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 701, 702-703; <em>see also </em>Vanderbilt Products, Inc. v. NLRB, 2 Cir., 1961, 297 F.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">In judging a party\u2019s compliance with Sections 8(a) (5) and (d), the \u201cBoard has been afforded flexibility to determine . . . whether conduct at the bargaining table evidences a real desire to come into agreement.\u201d NLRB v. Insurance Agents\u2019 Union, <em>supra, </em>361 U.S. at 498, 80 S.Ct. at 432. This determination is made by \u201cdrawing inferences from the conduct of the parties as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The question is one of \u201cmixed fact and law, [and] a court will not lightly disregard the over-all appraisal of the situation by the Labor Board \u2018as one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge. . . .\u2019\u201d NLRB v. Reed &amp; Prince Mfg. Co., <em>supra, </em>205 F.2d at 134, quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. <em>See also </em>Kellwood Co. v. NLRB, 8 Cir., 1970, 434 F.2d 1069, 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">2. We cannot agree with the employer\u2019s contention that its insistence on the July 12 termination date was the result of a good faith doubt as to the union\u2019s majority status rather than bad faith bargaining. A union\u2019s majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>status is irrefutably presumed for a year following its certification by the Board. Brooks v. NLRB, 1954, 348 U.S. 96, 103-104, 75 S.Ct. 176, 99 L.Ed. 125; NLRB v. Holly-General Co., 9 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 670, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Even if this were not the law, we find little, if any, evidence in the record to support respondent\u2019s claim of a good faith doubt. Respondent\u2019s General Operations Manager, Parker, testified that 29 employees approached him in early 1969, and requested his advice on how to get out of the union. This testimony was discredited by the hearing examiner. But assuming its veracity, the record shows that the bargaining unit contained approximately 70 employees. These figures provide no support for the employer\u2019s contention. They do, however, provide support for the Board\u2019s finding that the employer\u2019s demand for a July 12 termination date was further proof of bad faith bargaining. NLRB v. Bagel Bakers Council of Greater New York, 2 Cir., 1970, 434 F.2d 884, 888; Solo Cup Co. v. NLRB, 4 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 447, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The Petition for Enforcement is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-12\">. Because the charge in this case was filed on July 11, 1969, all events prior to January 12, 1969, may be considered only as background, to cast light on those events within the Section 10(b) six-month period. Local Lodge No. 1424 v. NLRB, 1960, 362 U.S. 411, 416, 80 S.Ct. 822, 4 L.Ed.2d 832. This the trial examiner did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
