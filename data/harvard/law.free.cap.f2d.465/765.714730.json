New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 92 S.Ct. 1670, 32 L.Ed.2d 234 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">Since the above judgment disposes of relator\u2019s contention that the New Jersey order finding him in contempt and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>manding him to custody until such time as he answered the questions asked of him pursuant to N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:9M-1 ff. (1970), violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, there is only one remaining contention of relator which requires consideration, namely, that the statute creating the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, both on its face and as applied to relator,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - for failure to provide minimal due process safeguards for witnesses appearing, before the Commission. The following practices and procedures of the Commission form the basis of relator\u2019s challenge. The Commission is to refer evidence of crime and misconduct of public officials to the proper prosecutorial authorities,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to cooperate with federal officials in the investigation of violations of federal laws within the state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission is to keep the public informed as to the operations of organized crime and problems of criminal law enforcement in the state, as well as to its \u201cother activities,\u201d \u201c[b]y such means and to such extent as it shall deem appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Witnesses summoned to testify before the Commission have the right to be accompanied by counsel, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his rights, but this advisorial right is \u201csubject to reasonable limitations to prevent obstruction of or interference with the orderly conduct of the hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At public hearings, counsel for a witness may submit proposed questions to h asked of the witness relevant to the mat ters upon which the witness has been questioned, but the Commission need ask the witness only \u201csuch of the questions as it may deem appropriate to its inquiry.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A witness has no right to cross-examine other witnesses; and he has no right to call witnesses, although he may at the conclusion of his examination file a sworn statement relative to his testimony for incorporation into the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">In Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960), the Supreme Court held that persons whose conduct is under investigation by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, a purely investigative and fact-finding governmental agency, which does not adjudicate, are not entitled, by virtue of the due process clause, to know the specific charges that are being investigated or the identity of the complainants, or to have the right to cross-examine those complainants and other witnesses. The Court reasoned that due process did not require rights such as apprisal, confrontation and cross-examination in the proceedings of the Civil Rights Commission because of the purely investigative nature of that Commission\u2019s proceedings, the burden that such rights would place on those proceedings, and the traditional procedure of investigating agencies in general. In Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969), which presented a challenge to the Louisiana Labor-Management Commission of Inquiry, the Court reaffirmed its decision in <em>Hannah, </em>and elab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>orated further on the distinction between investigative agencies and adjudicatory or accusatory agencies. The thrust of these decisions is that the requirements of due process vary with the type of proceeding involved. Fewer procedural safeguards are required by the due process clause in hearings before purely investigative agencies or agencies conducting purely investigative hearings. But when an agency is adjudicatory or accusatory in the sense that it is used to find named individuals guilty of crimes or to make similar determinations finally and directly affecting substantial personal interests, the due process clause requires the full panoply of procedural safeguards traditionally required in adjudicatory proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Jenkins </em>require us initially to determine the nature and function of the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, and then to decide whether, in light of the nature and function of the Commission, the procedures complained of violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The New Jersey statute confers on the Commission the duty and power to conduct investigations in connection with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">a. [t]he faithful execution and effective enforcement of the laws of the State, with particular reference but not limited to organized crime and racketeering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">b. [t]he conduct of public officers and public employees, and of officers and employees of public corporations and authorities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">c. [a]ny matter concerning the public peace, public safety and public justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">At the direction of the Governor or by concurrent resolution of the legislature, the Commission has the duty to conduct investigations or otherwise assist in connection with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-16\">a. [t]he removal of public officers by the Governor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-17\">b. [t]he making of recommendations by the Governor to any other person or body, with respect to the removal of public officers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-18\">c. [t]he making of recommendations by the Governor to the Legislature with respect to changes in or additions to existing provisions of law required for the more effective enforcement of the law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">In addition, at the direction or request of the legislature by concurrent resolution, or of the Governor, or of the head of any department, board, bureau, commission, authority, or other state agency, the Commission has the duty to investigate the management or affairs of such agency.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As noted above, the Commission also has the duty to cooperate with state and federal law enforcement officials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, the Commission is required to make a report and recommendations to the Governor and the legislature at least once a year, and the Governor and the legislature have the explicit authority to require interim reports.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">In determining the nature and character of the Commission in <em>Zicarelli, </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey considered these powers and duties of the Commission and held that the statute created a body the purpose of which, in the words of <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Jenkins, </em>is \u201cto find facts which may subsequently be used as the basis for legislative and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ecutive action.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That court. further held that the function of the Commission was \u201c[not] to decide whether an individual has committed a crime and to publicize the verdict,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and emphasized that the Commission \u201cis in no sense an \u2018accusatory\u2019 body.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While we are not bound by the resolution of the federal constitutional questions by the Supreme-Court of New Jersey, we are bound by that court\u2019s construction of the statute creating the Commission. The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that the statute created a commission with an investigative function, but not with aceusato-ry or adjudicatory functions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"akq-dedup-0\">We agree with that court\u2019s application of the constitutional standards of <em>Hannah </em>and Jenkins,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Commission has a purely investigative character and purpose, the due process clause does not require the full panoply of judicial procedures in hearings before the Commission. We conclude that the procedures of the Commission, which so closely parallel the procedures of the Civil Rights Commission upheld in <em>Hannah,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>comport with the requirements of due process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Relator alleges that he is confined pursuant to an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey which directs that he remain incarcerated until he purges himself of contempt by answering the propounded questions. He argues that the failure otherwise to provide an expiration date for the incarceration violates the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, which the decision in Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), clearly indicates is made binding on the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. We have doubts that this issue is ripe for adjudication. By seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, relator sought to have his federal constitutional claims adjudicated in a federal forum. This has now been accomplished. Under these circumstances, relator may now decide to purge himself of contempt by answering the propounded questions. In any event, relator has not exhausted his state remedies on this question.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">We have examined the other contentions made by relator, and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The opinion is filed in support of this court\u2019s order of July 26, 1972, affirming the March 20, 1970, district court order denying relator\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">Relator objects to six procedures employed by the New Jersey Commission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The following comparison of the chai-lenged procedures to the procedures employed by Civil Rights Commission at the time of the decision in <em>Hannah </em>reveals their similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">1. Witnesses summoned to appear before the New Jersey Commission have the right to be accompanied by counsel, \u201cwho shall be permitted to advise the witness of his rights, subject to reasonable limitations to prevent obstruction of or interference with the orderly conduct of the hearing.\u201d N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:13E-3 (1970). Likewise, witnesses summoned before the Civil Rights Commission had the right to be \u201caccompanied by their own counsel for the purpose of advising them concerning their constitutional rights.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975a(c). As in the case of the New Jersey Commission, this right was subject to reasonable limitations, for the chairman could \u201cpunish breaches of order and decorum and unprofessional ethics on the part of counsel, by censure and exclusion from the hearings.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975a(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">2. Counsel for any witness who testifies at a public hearing of the New Jersey Commission may submit proposed questions to be asked of the witness relevant to matters upon which the witness has been questioned, and the Commission \u201cshall ask the witness such of the questions as it may deem appropriate to its inquiry.\u201d N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:13E-3 (1970). The rules of procedure of the Civil Rights Commission did not assure a witness that his counsel had the right to submit proposed questions to be asked of the witness, but its rules did make clear that all \u201c[\u00a1Interrogation of witnesses at hearings shall be conducted only by members of the Commission or by authorized staff personnel.\u201d Rule 3(i) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">3. Counsel for persons who might be adversely affected by testimony given at a public hearing of the New Jersey Commission do not have the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. An identical rule prevailed with respect to hearings before the Civil Rights Commission. <em>See </em>Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960); Rule 3(i) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">4. The procedures of the New Jersey Commission do not afford persons who believe that they may be or were adversely affected by evidence given before the Commission the right to call witnesses on their behalf. The rules of the New Jersey Commission do provide, however, that \u201c[n]othing in this act shall be construed to prevent [the Commission] from granting to witnesses appearing before it, or to persons who claim to be adversely affected by testimony or other evidence adduced before it, such further rights and privileges as it may determine.\u201d N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:13E-7 (1970). The procedures of the Civil Rights Commission likewise did not grant to persons who believed that they might be or were adversely affected by evidence given before the Commission the right to call witnesses on their behalf, but the rules did provide that \u201cthe Chairman shall receive and the Commission shall dispose of requests to subpena additional witnesses.\u201d 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1975a(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">5. Witnesses who testify before the New Jersey Commission \u201chave the right at the conclusion of [the] examination to file a brief sworn statement relevant to [the witness\u2019] testimony for incorporation in the record of the investigatory proceeding.\u201d N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:13E-5 (1970). Witnesses who testified before the Civil Rights Commission could \u201c[i]n the discretion of the Commission, submit brief and pertinent sworn statements in writing for inclusion in the record,\u201d with the Commission serving as \u201cthe sole judge of the pertinency of testimony and evidence adduced at its hearings.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975a(h). Once the Civil Rights Commission exercised its discretion to grant permission to submit such statements, inclusion of the statement in the record was not automatic, for the Commission also had the power to \u201cdecide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>written statements or documents submitted to it shall be placed in the record of the hearing.\u201d Rule 3(h) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">6. The rules of the New Jersey Commission provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">[a]ny person whose name is mentioned or who is specifically identified and who believes that testimony or other evidence given at a public hearing or comment made by any member of the [Commission] or its counsel at such a hearing tends to defame him or otherwise adversely affect his reputation shall have the right, either to appear personally before the agency and testify in his own behalf as to matters relevant to the testimony or other evidence complained of, or in the alternative at the opinion of the agency, to file a statement of facts under oath relating solely to matters relevant to the testimony or other evidence complained of, which statement shall be incorporated in the record of the investigatory proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:13E-6 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">This rule confers on persons who in their own judgment feel that they have been adversely affected by evidence given before the Commission, or by comment made by a member of the Commission or its counsel, an absolute right at minimum to file a statement which shall be incorporated in the record. The rules of the Civil Rights Commission provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">[i]f the Commission determines that evidence or testimony at any hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person, it shall (1) receive such evidence or testimony in executive session; (2) afford such person an opportunity voluntarily to appear as a witness; and (3) receive and dispose of requests from such person to subpena additional witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975a(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The rights conferred by this rule were conferred only in the event that the Commission determined that evidence might tend to be defamatory, degrading, or incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Another significant procedure of the New Jersey Commission, apparently not challenged by the relator, requires that a copy of the rules of procedure of the Commission and a general statement of the subject of the investigation be served on witnesses prior to the time they are required to appear. N.J.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 52:13E-2 (1970). In proceedings before the Civil Rights Commission, the subject of the hearing need not have been announced until the opening of the hearing, and there was no requirement that the rules of the Commission be made available to witnesses in advance of the hearing date. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975 a(a) \u2014 (b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-18\">. See United States ex rel. Catena v. Elias, 449 F.2d 40 (3d Cir. 1971), which explains the background of this ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-4\">. Although relator attempts to challenge the constitutionality of the statute creating the Commission as applied to him, as well as on its face, there is no evidence in the record on which this court can base an assessment of the presence or absence of the harms decried in Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969), in the application of this statute to relator or to others similarly situated. The only evidence in the record consists of the grant of immunity to relator and his l'efusal to testify; there is no evidence in the record regarding extra-statutory practices and procedures of the Commission. If, despite the decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey in In re Zicarelli, 55 N.J. 249, 261 A.2d 129 (1970), relator fears unconstitutional practices similar to those decried in <em>Jenkins, </em>he may seek appropriate protective relief in the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b861-13\">.

There is a suggestion in the opinion that the statute was construed to accommodate the constitutional requirements of <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Jenldns </em>and thereby save the Commission from constitutional interment. <em>See </em>55 N.J. at 260, 261 A.2d at 135. Regardless of whether the statute was construed in order to avoid a difficult constitutional determination, <em>Ziem-elli </em>clearly indicates that the role of the Commission is investigatory, and that the Commission is not required by statute, and indeed cannot constitutionally, make and publicize findings with respect to the guilt of specific individuals. 55 N.J. at 260, 261 A.2d at 135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\">. Two aspects of the statutory practices and procedures of the Commission initially appear to raise troubling questions about the nature and function of the Commission in light of <em>Jenkins, </em>despite the fact that <em>Jenkins </em>involved the rather extreme case of a commission \u201cexercising] a function very much akin to making an official adjudication of criminal culpability\u201d and \u201cempowered to be used and allegedly . . . used to find named individuals guilty of violating the criminal laws of Louisiana and the United States and to brand them as criminals in public.\u201d 395 U.S. at 427-428, 89 S.Ct. at 1852. Upon close examination, however, it is apparent that these duties are not inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s character as an investigative body.</p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">First is the Commission\u2019s statutory mandate to refer evidence of crime and misconduct of public officials to the proper prosecutorial authorities, to cooperate with law enforcement officials, and to cooperate with federal officials in the investigation of violations of federal laws within the State of New Jersey. See N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 52:9M-5, -6, -8 (1970). Although the United States Commission on Civil Rights did not have a similar statutory mandate, its 1959 Annual Report, which was a part of the record before the Court in <em>Hannah, </em>indicates that the transcript of all its hearings, at which violations of state and federal laws were probed, were printed and made available to the public generally. 1959 U.S.Civ. Rights Comm\u2019n Ann.Rep. v, xiv. And the three-judge district court had noted in its opinion in that case that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aop-dedup-1\">42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1975c (b) requires the Commission to submit to the President a final and comprehensive report of its findings. Since the Commission is required to make this report to the President, the Chief Executive Officer of the land, it is fair to presume that a prime purpose of this report is to secure execution and enforcement of the laws presently in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9O\">Larche v. Hannah, 177 F.Supp. 816, 823 n. 16 (W.D.La.1959) (three-judge court).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">In addition to the fact that evidence of crime was made available to prosecutorial authorities by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, it is clear from other decisions of the Court that such a practice is not inconsistent with an investigative character. In Anonymous Nos. 6 and 7 v. Baker, 360 U.S. 287, 79 S.Ct. 1157, 3 L.Ed.2d 1234 (1959), the Court upheld, on the ground that it was an investigative proceeding, the constitutionality of a state judicial inquiry into alleged improper practices at the local bar, from which inquiry counsel for witnesses were excluded, despite the fact that the justices could refer the matter to the district attorney for prosecution, in which event the records of the proceeding would be deemed public records. In In re Groban, 352 U.S. 330, 77 S.Ct. 510, 1 L.Ed.2d 376 (1957), the Court upheld, on the ground that it was an investigative proceeding, an inquiry by the Ohio State Fire Marshal into the causes of a fire while excluding counsel of subpoenaed witnesses on whose premises the fire had occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>despite the fact that the Fire Marshal had authority, after questioning a witness, to arrest him if he believed there was sufficient evidence to charge him with arson. The precedential value of <em>Anonymous </em>and <em>Groban </em>was not affected by <em>Hannah. See </em>Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 451 n. 31, 491, 493, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960). Regardless, the concern surrounding grants of immunity and the scope thereof is based in part on the assumption that the compelled evidence will fall into the hands of the prosecutorial authorities and thereby jeopardize the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"abt-dedup-0\">The second aspect of the Commission\u2019s mandate that is initially troublesome is its duty, \u201c [b] y such means and to such extent as it shall deem appropriate,\u201d to \u201ckeep the public informed as to the operations of organized crime, problems of criminal law enforcement in the State and other activities of the commission.\u201d N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 52:9M-11 (1970). The Supreme Court of New Jersey made clear in <em>Zicarelli </em>that this mandated a general program of public education on \u201cthe state of affairs in a criminal area, to the end that helpful legislation may be proposed and receive needed public support,\u201d and emphasized that the Commission could not \u201cmake and publicize findings with respect to the guilt of specific individuals.\u201d 55 N.J. at 260, 261 A.2d at 135. In undertaking a broad program of public education, this Commission will strongly resemble the United States Commission on Civil Rights. <em>See, e. g., </em>1959 U.S.Civ. Rights Comm\u2019n Ann.Rep. ix; Rule 3(k) of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure (permitting the televising of hearings before the United States Commission on Civil Rights and assuring other communications media access to the hearings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b864-14\">. For a comparison, see the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b864-15\">. Once the purely investigative character of a commission is established, fine distinctions in the type of procedures involved do not make significant constitutional differences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b864-16\">. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) \u2014(c) (Supp. IV, 1969), amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1964). Relator has not demonstrated that application to the state courts for relief would be futile. The very recent af-firmance of the decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey in In re Zicarelli, 55 N.J. 249, 261 A.2d 129 (1970), rendered exhaustion of state remedies unnecessary only with respect to the questions decided in that case, and the court in <em>Zicarelli </em>did not resolve the cruel and unusual punishment question. See Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 92 S.Ct. 1670, 32 L.Ed.2d 234 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
