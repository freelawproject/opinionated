On direct appeal the Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed. State v. Dilworth, 83 S.D. 363, 159 N.W.2d 795 (1967). The parole authority of the State of South Dakota granted Dilworth parole after service of a portion of his sentence. By virtue of the interstate compact between South Dakota and Florida, appellant was permitted to return to Florida.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>tion for the writ of habeas corpus was filed with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The district court, relying on Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963) and Rodgers v. State of Louisiana, 418 F.2d 237 (5th Cir., 1969), denied the petition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-5\">\u201cThere is doubt that a state prisoner who has been placed on parole is in \u2018custody\u2019 as that word is used in Title 28, U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, et seq. Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236 [83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285] (1963). Because petitioner is subject to having his parole revoked by either the parole authorities of South Dakota or Florida, F.S. 942. 6F, it could be argued that both this Court and the appropriate South Dakota Federal District Court would be a proper court to consider the petition and have concurrent jurisdiction to hear this matter. However, this Court has jurisdiction over only the Florida Parole and Probation Commission, which if called before this Court to show cause why petitioner is in custody, could not be expected to argue as to the merits of, petitioner\u2019s allegations. Inasmuch as the proper party who is capable of responding to the allegations is the South Dakota Parole Commission, a party not subject to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, this cause should' be dismissed, to be raised before the appropriate District Court in South Dakota. Rodgers v. State of Louisiana, 418 F.2d 237 (5th Cir. 1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">We agree with the district court\u2019s unstated conclusion that jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attaches by virtue of custody imposed on Dillworth within the district by the Florida Parole and Probation Committee. Jones v. Cunningham, <em>supra; </em>Ex parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243 (1944); Reed v. Henderson, 463 F.2d 485 (5th Cir., 1972) [Rehearing Denied July 25, 1972]. Cf. Strait v. Laird, 406 U.S. 341, 92 S.Ct. 1693, 32 L.Ed.2d 141 (1972); Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.S. 487, 91 S.Ct. 995, 28 L.Ed.2d 251 (1971). We also agree that the exercise of this jurisdiction may be withheld in these circumstances for reasons of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>Reed v. Henderson, <em>supra. </em>Where the receiving state does no more than enforce a sending state\u2019s parole, it makes little sense to burden the district court for that district, or the attorney general of the receiving state with the defense of a collateral constitutional challenge to the sending state\u2019s conviction. Differing considerations immediately arise, however, in circumstances where a receiving state makes extrinsic use of the prior conviction; e. g., for enhancement of its own sentence. Cf. Craig v. Beto, 458 F.2d 1131 (5th Cir., 1972). A direct corollary of this holding is, however, that should appellant return to the district court after an unsuccessful attempt to invoke the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the sending jurisdiction, dismissal on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds would be manifestly inappropriate. Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968); Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335, 88 S.Ct. 962, 19 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-18\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">. F.S.A. 949.07, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"A9u4\">949.07 Compacts with other states</p>\n<p id=\"AK2\">The governor is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a compact on behalf of the State of Florida with any state of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Ajqz\">A eompact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatories hereto, with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled \u201cAn act granting the consent of Congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes.\u201d 1</p>\n<p id=\"alm-dedup-0\">1. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 420. See History and Source of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"atc-dedup-1\">The contracting states solemnly agree :</p>\n<p id=\"A7Kh\">(1) That it shall be competent- for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called \u201csending state\u201d)to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called \u201creceiving state\u201d) while on probation or parole, if</p>\n<p id=\"AC6\">(a) Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there</p>\n<p id=\"axb-dedup-1\">(b) Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.</p>\n<p id=\"Au4K\">A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"ASm4\">(2) That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.</p>\n<p id=\"ajx-dedup-0\">(3) That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"AM_B\">(4) That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.</p>\n<p id=\"A0ZE\">(5) That the governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary more effectively to carry out the terms of this compact.</p>\n<p id=\"apk-dedup-2\">(6) That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its ratification by any state as between it and any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>state or states so ratifying. When ratified, it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of ratification to be in accordance with the laws of the ratifying state.</p>\n<p id=\"akk-dedup-1\">(7) That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each ratifying state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which ratified it, by sending six months\u2019 notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.
