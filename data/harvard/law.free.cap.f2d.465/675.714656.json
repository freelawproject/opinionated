BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b770-20\">As this appeal from denial of habeas corpus percolates to us the substantive question is whether petitioner-appellant had counsel at the time he withdrew his former plea of not guilty and entered a guilty plea to an Alabama charge of burglary. The Federal District Court, although going to the brink of squarely holding absence of counsel, stopped short by his determination that petitioner had failed to exhaust his state remedies. We hold the Judge erred in this assessment which brings into play the question of what should now be done. In this roundabout fashion we determine that the record which needs no more amplification compels a finding of the absence of counsel so the Writ must conditionally issue. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-21\">\n<em>How The Case Got Here</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-22\">Petitioner pleaded guilty on March 20, 1963, to burglary in the first degree. No direct appeal was taken to an appropriate Alabama court of review. Subsequently, Petitioner filed for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis claiming, inter alia, that he was denied effective representation of counsel. Relief was denied by the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama, on May 26, 1970. No appeal was taken from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">On May 24, 1971, Petitioner filed a pro se petition for Federal Habeas Corpus relief. The District Court appointed counsel and an amended petition was filed. The sole ground for relief asserted in the amended petition was the absence of counsel when petitioner pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-24\">After the state replied to the Show Cause order, an evidentiary hearing was held. The sole issue at the hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>whether or not Defendant was represented by counsel at his pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">\n<em>No Counsel Present On Guilty Plea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">For reasons we point out, the evidence that he was not represented is not merely substantial \u2014 it is overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">An attorney did appear for Defendant at a February 1, 1963, arraignment, where the Defendant pleaded Not Guilty, but this attorney testified that he did <em>not </em>represent Defendant at the March 20, 1963, hearing where Defendant withdrew the original plea and pleaded guilty. The docket sheet shows the appearance of counsel at arraignment, but none at the March 20 hearing. In fact, the docket sheet shows no other attorney to have appeared for Defendant at any time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The official minute entry of the judgment gave no indication that Defendant was represented by counsel. To the contrary, the entry reads, \u201cThis day in Open Court came the State of Alabama by its solicitor and the Defendant <em>in his own proper person </em>* * * .\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Petitioner\u2019s court files show no order appointing counsel to represent him. Additionally, the Defendant testified affirmatively that he was not represented by counsel at the hearing where he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-17\">In fact, the only evidence to suggest even faintly the slightest whisper of a hint that Defendant might have been represented by counsel is a hearsay carbon copy of a pay voucher authorizing payment of $100 to another attorney for allegedly representing the Defendant on the day in question. That attorney was not called by the State at the Federal evidentiary hearing and not even so much as an affidavit from him was introduced into evidence. As already explained, the docket sheet does not reflect this attorney\u2019s presence \u2014 or any other\u2019s. There is no order appointing him \u2014 only the hearsay carbon copy of the pay voucher.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">On that evidence we would be required as a matter of law to declare clearly erroneous any pronouncement that Defendant was represented by counsel at this \u201ctrial\u201d held only two days after Gideon v. Wainwright<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was decided. Difficult as it is to establish a negative proposition, Petitioner has adequately done so, for he has shown, as a matter of law, that he was not represented by counsel at the March 20 hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ing. Indeed, as we discuss later the District Judge, although denying habeas, declared that it \u201cwas questionable whether Petitioner was represented by counsel\u201d (note 6, <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In many respects the case is markedly similar to Craig v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1972, 458 F.2d 1131. In <em>Craig, </em>the only evidence offered to contradict the petitioner\u2019s allegation that he did not waive his right to counsel before pleading guilty to a burglary charge was a copy of the docket sheet of the 1951 proceeding which asserted, \u201cDefendant stated that he did not desire Counsel and wanted to plead.\u201d This Court held that evidence insufficient to support a finding of intelligent and understanding waiver of counsel, particularly because \u201cthe evidence relied upon to controvert Craig\u2019s direct testimony is in the nature of hearsay.\u201d 458 F.2d 1136. On that approach, we are compelled to conclude that Hairston has sustained his burden of demonstrating that he was not represented by counsel when he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">\n<em>Obstacles To Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ahn-dedup-0\">Only three impediments to relief are available or urged, one going in indigency<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the other two being branches of failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">\n<em>Failure To Exhaust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A4R\">There are two aspects to the exhaustion contention. One is the failure ever to assert non-representation, now urged by the State as its sole ground. The other, adopted by the Federal habeas corpus Court is the failure to appeal the coram nobis decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">(i) Does <em>Mis </em>Include Nora-Representation?</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Alabama\u2019s sole contention on appeal \u2014unfortunately never presented to the Court below \u2014 -is that Petitioner has never sought coram nobis relief in the Alabama Circuit Court on the precise claim urged here \u2014 absence of counsel at his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">Admittedly, the previous cor-am nobis petition specifically alleged <em>ineffective </em>representation of counsel \u2014 not denial of counsel. Nevertheless and despite the fact that Petitioner\u2019s pro se application for coram nobis relief might have characterized his claim inartfully by phrasing it in terms of ineffective representation of counsel,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a resolution of that claim adverse to Petitioner nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>essarily presupposes a rejection of a denial of counsel claim. If Alabama is convinced that counsel was effective, it must be satisfied that counsel was provided for the indigent defendant. A determination that representation by counsel was effective necessarily determines that there was representation in fact. Having considered the effectiveness of counsel, the Alabama courts certainly had the opportunity \u2014 in fact the responsibility \u2014 to make an initial determination of whether or not petitioner was in fact represented by counsel. The exhaustion principle and the comity concept require no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">(ii) Failure To Appeal Coram Nobis</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">As we stated, the Federal habeas corpus Court, after declaring that it was \u201cquestionable whether Petitioner was represented by counsel,\u201d aborted any further consideration of the case, by dismissing instead for failure to exhaust state remedies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is apparent this action was based on Petitioner\u2019s failure to take an appeal from the Alabama Court\u2019s denial of coram nobis. Here the District Court erred. Bell v. Alabama, 5 Cir., 1966, 367 F.2d 243; Lizana v. Alabama, 5 Cir., 1968, 394 F.2d 512; Harris v. Alabama, 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">In the first place, the exhaustion principle is one of comity, not jurisdiction. Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837; Whippler v. Balkcom, 5 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 388, 390; Bell v. Alabama, <em>supra. </em>Although this Court is committed to the proposition that the responsibility for determining compliance with constitutional standards ought first to be on the state concerned so that state post-conviction facilities should be fully exploited,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with Alabama having been afforded the opportunity of testing out the claim of <em>mis </em>and wow-representation in her own Courts there is no need to go back again. \u201cNeither the statute nor the spirit of needed comity behind it requires such a formalistic waste of precious judicial energy, state or federal. Adaptation in efficient judicial administration suggests no less.\u201d Reed v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 723, 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">Secondly, as was made crystal clear in Fay v. Noia, <em>supra, </em>the \u201conly remedies which must be exhausted are those effective<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> state remedies which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>are presently available * * *.\u201d Bell v. Alabama, <em>supra, </em>367 F.2d at 248. We are convinced that Appellant is now without any effective remedy in the State courts of Alabama.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We can borrow fully what \u2022 Judge Tuttle has written for us in Bell v. Alabama, <em>supra. </em>\u201cUnder Alabama law, an appeal from a criminal conviction must be taken within six months. Code of Ala., Title 15, Section 368. * * * A denial of a petition for cor-am <em>nobis </em>relief may be appealed in Alabama. Ex parte Keene, 275 Ala. 197, 153 So.2d 631 (1963). Here again, the appeal must be taken within six months, and \u2018the matters adjudicated on hearing of a <em>coram nobis </em>application are <em>quasi res judicata, </em>i. e., repeated applications or petitions merely resting on the same allegations should not be entertained.\u2019 Allen v. State, 42 Ala.App. 9, 150 So.2d 399,401 (1963). * * * The right of appeal is considered a creature of statute in Alabama, and the statutes granting it are strictly construed. The insistence of the appellate courts of that state upon meticulous observance of procedural niceties (including time limits) in the taking of appeals is well demonstrated in Albert v. State, 274 Ala. 579, 150 So.2d 198 (1962), and Relf v. State, 267 Ala. 3, 99 So.2d 216 (Ala.1957). * * Thus, it is apparent that once the six month time limit for appealing the denial of [appellant\u2019s] first <em>coram, nobis </em>petition expired, there was no way to obtain appellate review of the contentions presented therein in the courts of Alabama. Since the findings of such proceedings are <em>\u2018quasi res judicata\u2019 </em>in Alabama, an appellate court would not reach the merits in an appeal from the denial of a subsequent <em>coram nobis </em>petition based on the same grounds alleged in the first. The Court of Appeals of Alabama has indicated that the failure to appeal the first such denial constitutes grounds for refusal of appellate review in subsequent proceedings. Ex parte Allison [42 Ala.App. 507], 169 So.2d [436], at 437 (1964)\u201d 367 F.2d at 248-249.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">Thus the issue of <em>non-re </em>presentation has been presented to the Alabama Courts and by the operation of Alabama\u2019s doctrine of <em>\u201cquasi res judicata\u2019\u2019, </em>Petitioner was without any effective state remedy at the time he filed his federal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-17\">Consequently, the guilty plea must be vacated. And unless the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>commences prosecution of the case within 90 days<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Writ shall issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">.

The official minute entry was read into the record by the County Clerk.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-21\">\u201cThis day in open Court came the State of Alabama by its solicitor and the Defendant in his own proper person and the Defendant in open Court on this day withdrew his plea of not guilty to the indictment in this case and plead guilty to burglary in the second degree. Thereupon in open Court on this day, the Defendant being asked by the Court if he had anything to say as to why the judgment and sentence of the law should not be passed upon him replied that he had not, enquote. It is therefore considered and adjudged by the Court that the Defendant is guilty as charged in the indictment and that the State of Alabama, for the use of Mobile County, have and recover of the Defendant the cost of this prosecution and the Defendant be imprisoned in the State of Alabama for the term of five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-22\">. Gideon v. Wainwright, 1963, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. Although essential to the claim is Petitioner\u2019s indigency, Kitchens v. Smith, 1971, 401 U.S. 847, 848, 91 S.Ct. 1089, 1090, 28 L.Ed.2d 519, 521, we find ample justification in the record to establish this. In fact, the State does not now and never has suggested to the contrary. Indeed, the State\u2019s whole theory below was based on the contention that Defendant was represented by <em>appointed </em>counsel. Its only evidence was a pay voucher purporting <em>to indicate that </em>the State of Alabama, not the Defendant, had paid for this representation. The attorney who represented Defendant at arraignment testified affirmatively that he did not receive a fee. Additionally, appointed counsel specifically explained in his opening statement at the Federal habeas evi-dentiary hearing that Petitioner was relying on and invoking \u201cthe guidelines and mandates of the Supreme Court case of Gideon versus Wainwright.\u201d The State made no effort whatever to contradict this contention. \u201cNo part of its case went to the issue of indigency.\u201d <em>Kitchens, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 848, 91 S.Ct. at 1090, 28 L.Ed.2d at 521. Rejecting, as did the Supreme Court, \u201crigid rules of testimonial construction\u201d in these cases, <em>Id., </em>we must conclude that Defendant\u2019s indigency was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">Thus under the principles enunciated in <em>Kitchens, supra, </em>it is apparent that Petitioner is entitled to appropriate relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-15\">. Since absence of counsel might well appear to the defendant to be the most \u201cineffective\u201d representation possible, it is understandable how a pro se petitioner may have sought to raise the denial of counsel point by phrasing it in terms of \u201cineffective representation.\u201d At all events, and particularly in view of the principle allowing prisoner petitions to be construed with great liberality, (see, e. g., Birchfield v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 296 F.2d 120) the Alabama courts, in passing upon Petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective representation of counsel, were certainly obliged to consider whether or not defendant was in fact represented by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">. The District Court\u2019s entire order was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201cThis matter comes on to be heard on the petition of Julius Hairston for writ of habeas corpus. The Court received testimony at a hearing on July 20, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">While it is questionable whether petitioner was represented by counsel at the time lie entered his plea of guilty on March 20, 1963, this Court is unable to act on the evidence heard because petitioner apparently has not exhausted his state remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">The petitioner was adjudged guilty of second degree burglary on March 20, 1963, from which no appeal was taken. Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis was denied by the Mobile County Circuit Court on May 26, 1970, from which no appeal was taken. In this case the appellate courts of the State of Alabama have not been given the opportunity to review the action of the trial court.

We do not have a question of deliberate by-pass. Of course, \u201cthe federal habeas corpus judge may in his discretion deny relief to an applicant who has deliberately by-passed the orderly procedure of the state court and in so doing has forfeited his state court remedies.\u201d Fay v. Noia, <em>supra, </em>372 U.S. at 438, 83 S.Ct. at 849, 9 L.Ed.2d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">\u201cBut we wish to make very clear that such a deliberate by-pass. And although discretion is permitted under the following Fay v.

If a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures, then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief if the state courts refused to entertain his federal claims on the merits \u2014 though of course only after the federal court has satisfied itself, by holding a hearing or by some other means, of the facts bearing upon the applicant\u2019s default.

The appropriate relief in this case, by analogy to Boykin v. Alabama, 1969, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, would be the opportunity to plead anew, this time represented by counsel.

Although the Court in <em>Boyd </em>remanded for an evidentiary hearing to develop more facts surrounding the petitioner\u2019s alleged waiver of counsel, the Court\u2019s very strong pronouncement that an accused \u201chas an unconditional and absolute constitutional right to a lawyer\u201d at a guilty plea convinces us that the record in this case simply cannot support a finding that counsel was provided or present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
