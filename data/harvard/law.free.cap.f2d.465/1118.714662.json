CARTER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1212-23\">Appellant was convicted in a court trial and sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment for knowingly failing to keep his local board advised of an address where mail would reach him for the period of May 9, 1968 to June 8, 1970, in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462 and 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1641.3. His appeal raises only the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-24\">The Selective Service file, received into evidence, showed that appellant registered with Local Board No. 2, Seattle, Washington, on or about June 28, 1967. The initial questionnaire, filled out by appellant, advised him that the law required him to advise the board in writing of every change of address within ten (10) days. At that time appellant gave as his address, 1917 Eastlake, Apt. K, Seattle, Washington, and listed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>mother as always knowing his address. On August 29, 1967, appellant advised his board that his current address was 4416 Sunnyside North, Seattle. This was an address of a girlfriend. He continued to also list his mother as a person who would always know of his address. He listed his occupation as \u201cTransient\u201d and in parentheses noted that he could not be sure of his mother knowing where he was at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">On February 12, 1968, appellant advised his board that his current address was 1401 Boat Street. He deleted his mother\u2019s name and substituted one Ken Fries as the person always knowing his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">Hans von der Hofen, landlord of the residence shown in appellant\u2019s Selective Service file as his address on February 12, 1968, was called as a witness. He testified that his records reflected that appellant rented a moorage from him on November 27, 1967 and left the 9th of May, 1968. The address was 1401 Northwest Boat Street. His records reflect no forwarding address was given when appellant left May 9th and that appellant never returned to that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">The Selective Service file also showed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">On June 4, 1968, an order to report for a physical examination was mailed to appellant at the Boat Street address. The letter was returned by the Post Office, marked \u201cMoved, left no address.\u201d On July 2, 1968, the board wrote Ken Fries, the one listed by appellant in February 1968 as the person always knowing his address. The Fries letter was returned marked \u201cAddress unknown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">On July 26, 1968, the board sent a delinquency notice to the appellant at the Boat Street address and on September 23, 1968, an order to report for induction was mailed to appellant at the Boat Street address. Both were returned, marked \u201cMoved, left no address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">On October 1, 1968, the board wrote to appellant\u2019s mother, Mrs. Owens, requesting information as to her son\u2019s address, indicating his current address in the board\u2019s file was the Boat Street address. She replied, \u201cI do not know his current address.\u201d The defendant was thereafter, on October 25, 1968, referred to the United States Attorney as delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-12\">After his arrest, appellant, on May 27, 1971, gave the board a current address as 4456-27th Avenue West, Seattle, the first change since February 12, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-13\">Appellant testified at the trial. He confirmed generally that the addresses he listed were accurate at the time given and that Hofen\u2019s testimony was correct in that he ceased to live at the Boat Street address May 9, 1968. He testified he left Seattle, and traveled for awhile to Canada, California, New Mexico, and \u201call around.\u201d He testified that \u201cno one was ever sure of my address as far as that goes during that time (June-December 1968) because, like I say, I went to New Mexico and Canada and actually then during that time I wasn\u2019t actually seeing my mother because of my stepdad. I wasn\u2019t having anything to do with my family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-14\">He testified he was back in Seattle, Washington, early in 1969, and then on Oreas Isl\u00e1nd in the summer. In September 1969 he went to New York but returned in November. In January 1970, he moved to Bellingham, Washington, for several months. He got employment and food stamps there. After that he hitchhiked back and forth across the mountains getting jobs and finally back to Bellingham. During the winter of 1970 and on into spring, 1971, he was in Colorado, where he was arrested in March 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-15\">Appellant testified he never advised the draft board of his address between February 12, 1968 and May 27, 1971. Appellant admitted he knew the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking for him in the spring of 1970, but did nothing about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-16\">On this record the trial court made a finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1213-17\">\u201cBeginning on or about May 9, 1968, and continuing thereafter to on or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>June 8, 1970, the defendant knowingly-failed to keep his local board advised at all times of the address where mail would reach him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Appellant contends that the evidence fails to prove the elements of intent and fails to show appellant did not make a good faith attempt to keep a mail line open from his draft board through his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Appellant relies on Bartchy v. United States, 319 U.S. 484, 63 S.Ct. 1206, 87 L.Ed. 1534 (1943); Ward v. United States (5 Cir. 1952) 195 F.2d 441, reversed per curiam, 344 U.S. 924, 73 S.Ct. 494, 97 L.Ed. 711 (1953); and Venus v. United States (9 Cir. 1961) 287 F.2d 304, reversed per curiam, 368 U.S. 345, 82 S.Ct. 384, 7 L.Ed.2d 341 (1961). The cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">In <em>Bartchy </em>the registrant was convicted of failing to keep his board advised of his address for a short period in February and March. The registrant, in anticipation of receiving mail from his board, made arrangements to have his mail forwarded through his employer. The employer\u2019s address was supplied the board but the employer was amiss in handling registrant\u2019s mail. It was not forwarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">The court stated that a registrant\u2019s duty is met when \u201c. . . [T]he registrant, in good faith, provides a chain of forwarding addresses by which mail, sent to the address which is furnished the board, may be by the registrant reasonably expected to come into his hands in time for compliance.\u201d 319 U.S. at 489, 63 S.Ct. at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">In <em>Ward, supra, </em>the period involved was from March 30, 1951 to May 31, 1951. The court noted the record did not support the charge that during this period \u201cthere was deliberate purpose on the part of Petitioner not to comply with the Selective Service Act or the regulation issued thereunder.\u201d The facts (from the circuit opinion) show that Ward had moved his residence during this period but had given the boajjd his employer\u2019s address. He presented evidence that mail did reach him at his employer\u2019s address during the period in question and apparently contended the board\u2019s notices would also have reached him, had the board inquired or sent the notices in care of his employer. The court thus found no evidence of a deliberate purpose not to comply with the Act, in substance no bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">In <em>Venus, supra, </em>the registrant was convicted of failing to keep his board advised of his address on <em>one day </em>in February 1955. He testified he mailed a change of address to the board in February 1955, but the board\u2019s record showed no receipt of it. No evidence was presented refuting his claim. Moreover, no mailings were made to him by the board in February 1955. But other mail to his parents\u2019 address, listed by him as the place where he would always be reached, was received even after they moved to another address in the middle of February.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-12\">The Ninth Circuit has summarized the Supreme Court cases, <em>supra, </em>and United States v. Ebey (10 Cir. 1969) 424 F.2d 376 by quoting the above passage from <em>Bartchy </em>concerning a claim of forwarding addresses. United States v. Munns (9 Cir. 1972), 457 F.2d 271. See, Kokotan v. United States (10 Cir. 1969) 408 F.2d 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-13\">Although appellant was charged only with failing to keep the board advised of his address where mail would reach him, for the period of May 1968 to June 8, 1970, the total period running from February 12, 1968 to May 27, 1971 was in excess of three years. The time beyond that alleged in the indictment could have been considered by the trial judge as additional evidence on the issues of appellant\u2019s willful failure to comply and whether he had made a good faith mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-14\">The trial court\u2019s finding of appellant\u2019s knowing failure to keep his board advised of an address where mail would reach him was fully supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
