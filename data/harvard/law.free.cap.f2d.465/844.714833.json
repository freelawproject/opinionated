Appellant, acting <em>in propria persona, </em>complained that the Government\u2019s consolidated statement, entitled \u201cCombined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures and Balances of the United States Government,\u201d fails to show monies received and expended by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He alleged that the Central Intelligence Agency Act relieving the Secretary of the Treasury from publishing such figures was repugnant to the Constitution and void. He sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Treasury to publish an accounting of the receipts and expenditures of the CIA and to enjoin any further publication of the Combined Statement which did not reflect them. His application for a three judge court was denied by the district court which subsequently dismissed the complaint on grounds of standing and justiciability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">We will vacate the order and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">After oral argument, this court deemed the issues raised by the case of sufficient importance to necessitate the appointment of amicus curiae, Professor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Ralph S. Spritzer of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, formerly Acting Solicitor General of the United States. He has submitted a thoughtful brief to which all parties have responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY CONTEXT</p>\n<p id=\"AmC\">Because appellant sought to challenge the system by which the Federal Government accounts for funds spent by the Central Intelligence Agency, a brief explanation of that system is necessary to put his action in appropriate context.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The Federal Government\u2019s spending powers, enumerated in article I, section 8 of the Constitution, are regulated by article I, section 9, clause 7, which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-6\">No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">In accordance with this mandate, all federal agencies except the CIA receive an annual specific appropriation from the Congress. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 696. The Secretary of the Treasury then prepares an annual statement by \u201chead of appropriation\u201d for the use of the Executive, the Congress and the public reflecting how much each agency has spent during the previous fiscal year. 31 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 66b(a), 1029. Since there is no specific appropriation for the CIA, its receipts and expenditures are not listed in the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 208, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403a et seq. (1970), established a unique procedure for funding the CIA. Section 403f(a) permits the CIA to transfer and receive funds from other agencies with the approval of the Bureau of the Budget (now Office of Management and Budget) \u201cwithout regard to any provisions of law limiting or prohibiting transfers between appropriations.\u201d Once the money has been spent, the CIA need not disclose its functions or personnel, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403g, and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-10\">[t]he sums made available to the Agency may be expended without regard to the provisions of law and regulations relating to the expenditure of Government funds; and for objects of a confidential extraordinary, or emergency nature, such expenditures to be accounted for solely on the certificate of the Director and every such certificate shall be deemed a sufficient voucher for the amount therein certified. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403j(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">This procedure creates a two-step system for disbursement of the Treasury\u2019s monies to the CIA. First, Congress appropriates money to some other agency, and then that agency transfers the funds to the CIA. The only accurate accounting for the funds is the certificate rendered by the Director of the CIA, but it does not appear that this certificate or its contents are made available to the public. Presumably the money actually spent is reflected in the Treasury Department\u2019s annual statement as a disbursement by the original agency to which Congress made the appropriation, although it may not be reflected at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Appellant Richardson, a citizen and taxpayer residing in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, wrote the Treasury Department, inquiring about the annual expenditures of the CIA. He was informed by defendant Sokol, the Treasury officer in charge of the publication of the annual statement, that the Treasury Department did not receive information on the CIA because of the congressional determination that such information should not be made public. He further stated that neither he nor the defendant Secretary of the Treasury had access to the information appellant desired. There was no further administrative relief available.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">Appellant then brought this action alleging that the appellees have a constitutional and statutory obligation to set forth an accurate accounting of the expenditures of the United States. He contended that the Central Intelligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Agency Act of 1949, which creates an exception for the CIA, is repugnant to the Constitution because its prohibition against reporting the CIA\u2019s expenditures contravenes the mandate of article I, section 9, clause 7. He asked that a three judge court be convened to determine the constitutionality of the Central Intelligence Agency Act, and that a mandamus issue against the defendants requiring them to publish a financial statement which complies with the commands of the Constitution and the remaining acts of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">Appellant also alleged that the constitutional duty to provide a regular account of receipts and expenditures of public money is one owed to the citizen and taxpayer, for its obvious design is to provide members of the electorate with information lying at the core of public accountability in a democratic society.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Appellant alleges several grounds for jurisdiction, only one of which is proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is the relatively new Mandamus and Venue Act, 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1361, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-7\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-8\"> The legislative history of the mandamus statute reveals that the statute\u2019s construction turns upon traditional mandamus law. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1970 Supplement) \u00a7 23.10. In order for mandamus to issue, a plaintiff must allege that an officer of the Government owes him a legal duty which is a specific, plain ministerial act \u201cdevoid of the exercise of judgment or discretion.\u201d Clackamas County, Or. v. McKay, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 108, 219 F.2d 479, 489 (1954). ICC v. New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. R., 287 U.S. 178, 204, 53 S.Ct. 106, 77 L.Ed. 248 (1932), Wilbur v. United States ex rel. Kadrie, 281 U.S. 206, 218, 50 S.Ct. 320, 74 L.Ed. 809 (1930), United States v. Walker, 409 F.2d 477, 481 (9th Cir. 1969). An act is ministerial only when its performance is positively commanded and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt. United States v. Walker, supra. Additionally, plaintiff must have exhausted all other available means of relief. Carter v. Seamans, 411 F.2d 767, 773 (5th Cir. 1969) cert. denied, 397 U.S. 941, 90 S.Ct. 953, 25 L.Ed.2d 121 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">What is the nature of the duty which appellant charges was breached? The duty alleged here arises under article I, section 9, clause 7 as implemented by the Congress under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 66b(a) and 1029.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s position is that save for the existence of the Central Intelligence Agency Act, Congress would be required to appropriate money specifically for the CIA, and the Secretary of the Treasury would be required to give an accounting to the President, the Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>and the public for that agency\u2019s expenditures by that head of appropriation, as mandated by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The Government argues that no specific duty exists because the Congress has, by the Central Intelligence Agency Act, relieved the Secretary of the Treasury of the obligation to publish a statement pertaining to funds received and expended by the CIA. It also contends the Secretary cannot be under such an obligation because he does not possess the CIA\u2019s accounts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\"> We do not decide the constitutionality of the Central Intelligence Agency Act. However, for the purpose of determining whether mandamus will lie against him in the federal courts, an officer of the Government cannot deprive the court of jurisdiction to compel performance of an otherwise clear statutory duty by invoking the authority of what is challenged as an unconstitutional law. In re Ayers, 123 U.S. 443, 506, 8 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.Ed. 216 (1887); Board of Liquidation v. McComb, 92 U.S. 531, 541, 23 L.Ed. 623 (1875); National Association of Government Employees v. White, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 290, 418 F.2d 1126, 1129 (1969); cf. Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 701-702, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949). As a practical matter, this rule avoids the multiplicitous litigation that would arise if a party were first required to litigate the constitutionality of a statute in a separate action and then later secure specific relief in another proceeding by mandamus. More importantly, if a law is unconstitutional, it is void and of no effect, and it cannot alter an otherwise valid obligation of a governmental officer to a citizen. To permit a defense based upon an unconstitutional law would prevent a plaintiff, such as appellant, from using the mandamus remedy to enforce his rights even though the Government has not otherwise shown the court a valid reason to deny the relief demanded. Such a defense would have the effect of sustaining the very statute which the court is asked to strike as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Therefore, the Government may not rely on the CIA Statute to preclude jurisdiction of this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Except for the CIA Statute, the Secretary of the Treasury is under a clear command of Congress to account for all monies as they are actually expended by the different federal agencies. In fulfilling that duty, he has no discretion. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Nor are we persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury is not spefically owed to the appellant. The debates at the Constitutional convention in 1787 and the state ratifying conventions reveal that those who proposed the present language of the clause believed that the citizenry should receive some form of accounting from the Government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The use of the word \u201cpublished\u201d in article I, section 9, clause 7 emphasizes that intention. Article II, section 3 requires the President \u201cfrom time to time [to] give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union,\u201d and presumably the Framers could have utilized the same informal procedure with regard to the accounting if they had so wished. Instead, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>chose to have the statement \u201cpublished,\u201d indicating that they wanted it to be more permanent and widely-circulated than the President\u2019s message. The connotation must be that the statement was for the benefit and education of the public as well as coordinate branches of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">This constitutional obligation to account to the public is supported by the Congressional enactment of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 66b(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-6\">The Secretary of the Treasury shall prepare such reports for the information of the President, the Congress, and <em>the public </em>as will present the results of the financial operations of the Government. . . . (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In furtherance of this general duty, Congress enacted 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1027-1030,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provide for various specific reports, including the Combined Statement of Receipts and Expenditures provided for in Section 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Thus Congress\u2019 own language indicates that the Secretary\u2019s duty to present financial reports runs not only to the President and the Congress, but also to the public at large. If these reports are misleading and inadequate, there is no reason why Richardson, as a taxpayer, should not be able to require the appropriate executive officer to perform his obligations. The right of the taxpayer to receive reasonably complete reports of governmental expenditures is within the \u201czone of interest[s] . . . protected ... by the statute . . . in question\u201d and one for which he may suffer a cognizable injury. Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); <em>accord, </em>Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Finally, appellant has exhausted his avenues for administrative relief, he has no other remedy, and his only recourse now is judicial redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">Appellant\u2019s case meets all the considerations required for mandamus. While mandamus should be construed liberally in cases charging a violation of a constitutional right, <em>cf. </em>Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee v. Hoover, 327 F.Supp. 238, 243 (S.D.N.Y.1971), even under principles of strict construction appellant has set forth a clear duty owed to him by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">The appellant must also have sufficient standing in order to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court.<footnotemark>6A</footnotemark> Article III, section 2 limits the judicial power of federal courts to consideration of \u201ccases\u201d or \u201ccontroversies.\u201d Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, supra, 397 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. 827, Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 101-102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed. 2d 947 (1968). When a plaintiff does not have a stake in the outcome of the litigation to assure a sufficient adverseness in the proceedings to make it a true \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy,\u201d we have no jurisdiction to entertain his request. Flast v. Cohen, supra, at 101-102, 88 S.Ct. 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\"><em>Flast </em>established a two prong test to ascertain whether a plaintiff, such as appellant, who is a taxpayer, has the requisite adversary interest: (1) the plaintiff must establish a nexus between his status as a taxpayer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>the challenged Government activity to give him a personal stake in the action; and (2) his claim must relate to a specific constitutional prohibition so that the issues may be sharpened and focused sufficiently for proper judicial resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Although the district court did not specify its reasons for finding that appellant lacked standing, we assume that it applied <em>Flast </em>and found his case deficient thereunder. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The decision in <em>Flast </em>breached the absolute barrier to taxpayer suits erected by an earlier Supreme Court decision. Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). <em>Frothingham </em>absolutely barred a taxpayer from objecting to a Government spending program as a violation of the tenth amendment and the due process clause of the fifth amendment, on the theory that taxpayer was affected by the law only to the extent that the public in gen-' eral was affected by increased taxes. <em>Id., </em>at 487, 43 S.Ct. 597. The Court feared a contrary decision would have opened the floodgates of litigation, and would have permitted people to litigate issues even though they did not have an adequate incentive for a vigorous prosecution because of the miniscule and remote nature of their interests. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\"><em>Flast </em>did not completely overrule <em>Frothingham. </em>Chief Justice Warren\u2019s decision distinguished the latter case on the ground that a taxpayer could not properly object under the due process clause to general increases in his tax bill, but a taxpayer could object to any program provided under article I, section 8 that exceeded specific constitutional limitations on the taxing and spending powers of Congress. The Chief Justice believed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-7\">Under such circumstances, we feel confident that the questions will be framed with the necessary specificity, that the issues will be contested with the necessary adverseness and that the litigation will be pursued with the necessary vigor to assure that the constitutional challenge will be made in a form traditionally thought to be capable of judicial resolution. We lack that confidence in cases such as <em>Frothingham </em>where a taxpayer seeks to employ a federal court as a forum in which to air his generalized grievances about the conduct of government or the allocation of power in the Federal System.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">392 U.S. at 106, 88 S.Ct. at 1955.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">A taxpayer could object to such outlays because there was a sufficient link between his status as a taxpayer and the act to assure a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. That. stake would provide \u201c \u2018the concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\u2019 Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).\u201d 392 U.S. at 99, 88 S.Ct. at 1952. Although the connection in <em>Flast </em>is concededly different from the one at issue here, both taxpayers have sufficient personal stake in the litigation. Plaintiffs in <em>Flast </em>contended they were being taxed to support an unconstitutional program that was in violation of the first amendment\u2019s establishment clause. Appellant argues that he has a right under the Constitution to \u201ca Regular Statement and Account,\u201d but that he is being deprived of that right because of the Government\u2019s adherence to the allegedly unconstitutional Central Intelligence Agency Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">The Government argues that <em>Flast </em>must be limited to challenges to appropriations. That view attempts to confine the case to its facts without regard to its reasoning. <em>Flast </em>is concerned with adverseness and specificity of issues for \u201cstanding,\u201d not spending <em>per se.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Even under the Government\u2019s argument, appellant\u2019s claim is still sufficient because it is integrally related to the appropriations process and the taxpayer\u2019s ability to challenge those appropriations. Although <em>Flast </em>recognizes standing of a taxpayer to challenge expenditures, how can a taxpayer make that challenge unless he knows how the money is being spent? Without accurate official information concerning the amount and purpose of the expenditures, there could be no basis for a taxpayer suit. It would be inconsistent to affirm the viability of taxpayers\u2019 suits on the one hand but take away a necessary precondition for those suits on the other.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">The Government\u2019s position is not sound to us and we must reject it. We believe that the nexus between a taxpayer and an allegedly unconstitutional act need not always be the appropriation and the spending of his money for an invalid purpose. The personal stake may come from any injury in fact even if it is not directly economic in nature. Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, supra, 397 U.S. at 154, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184. A responsible and intelligent taxpayer and citizen, of course, wants to know how his tax money is being spent. Without this information he cannot intelligently follow the actions of the Congress or of the Executive. Nor can he properly fulfill his obligations as a member of the electorate. The Framers of the Constitution deemed fiscal information essential if the electorate was to exercise any control over its representatives and meet their new responsibilities as citizens of the Republic;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and they mandated publication, although stated in general terms, of the Government\u2019s receipts and expenditures. Whatever the ultimate scope and extent of that obligation, its elimination generates a sufficient, adverse interest in a taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">In the second prong of the <em>Flast </em>test the Court inquired whether there was a specific section in the Constitution which operated to limit the Congress\u2019 taxing and spending powers. It noted that whether there are limitations other than the establishment clause would have to be decided by future litigation. 392 U.S. at 105, 88 S.Ct. 1942. Appellant\u2019s claim raises such a limitation. While article I, section 9, clause 7 is procedural in nature, and while the establishment clause is substantive in nature, both are nonetheless limitations on the taxing and spending power. It would be difficult to fashion a requirement more clearly conveying the framers\u2019 intention to regularize expenditures and to require public accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Article I, section 9, clause 7 relates exclusively to the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the expenditure of public monies. It is unlike the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the tenth amendment, raised in <em>Frothingham, </em>which are designed to check a much broader range of possible abuses of power. Appellant does not raise any generalized complaints about the operation of his Government. He does not even complain that the CIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>should not receive the money it presently spends, provided this money is properly appropriated and reported. He only seeks an accurate statement of account for the tax money extracted from him and spent. He relies on a specific constitutional provision to protect him from what he alleges is a legislative abuse of power, the non-accounting features of the Central Intelligence Agency Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We note that if appellant, as a citizen, voter and taxpayer, is not entitled to maintain an action such as this to enforce the dictate of article I, section 9, clause 7, of the United States Constitution that the Federal Government provide an accounting of the expenditure of all public money, then it is difficult to see how this requirement, which the framers of the Constitution considered vital to the proper functioning of our democratic republic, may be enforced at all. A decision to deny standing to the appellant in these circumstances would not seem consistent with the limited scope of the standing requirement. <em>See </em>Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 740, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1368, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">The requirement that a party seeking review must allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected does not insulate executive action from judicial review, nor does it prevent any public interests from being protected through the judicial process. It does serve as at least a rough attempt to put the decision as to whether review will be sought in the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">(Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 429-430, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); N.A.A.C.P. v.

Donovan, 398 U.S. 427, 431, 90 S.Ct. 1763, 26 L.Ed.2d 378 (1970), and that the term \u201cinjunction\u201d as used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253, and presumably in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282, is to be narrowly construed. Id. A sufficiently narrow construction might serve then to bar a three judge court from hearing a mandamus action, but such a result would not be faithful to the intent of Congress. Section 2282 was enacted as a protective device to shield the Government from suits which might disrupt its operations. It was not intended for the convenience of the plaintiff. The legislative history of this section reveals that it, and its complement, \u00a7 2281, \u201cwere enacted to prevent a single federal judge from being able to paralyze totally the operation of an entire regulatory scheme, either state or federal by issuance of a broad injunctive order.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 154, 83 S.Ct. 554, 560, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">This action, while based on the mandamus statute, in substance contemplates injunctive relief. It prays, inter alia, for a permanent injunction apparently in aid of the mandamus restraining publication of the Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures and Balances. Therefore, the action is for all practical purposes substantially similar to a mandatory injunction. In ascertaining the substance of the action we are required to look beyond the prayer for relief to the substantive allegations of the complaint. Majuri v. United States, 431 F.2d 469, 473 (3d Cir.), cert denied, 400 U.S. 943, 91 S.Ct. 245, 27 L.Ed.2d 248 (1970). Since the merger of law and equity under the Federal Rules Enabling Act of 1934<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the adoption of Rule 2 of the Fed.R. of Civil Proc. (28 U.S.C.A. Rule 2) providing for only one form of action, there is little difference in substance between a mandamus and a mandatory injunction. Rolls-Royce, Inc. v. Stimson, 56 F.Supp. 22, 23 (D.D.C.1944). The Supreme Court, in discussing the distinction drawn by the Court more than a half century before, stated that \u201c[t]he distinction . . . between mandamus and a mandatory injunction seems formalistic in the present day and age,\u201d when rules of pleading are simplified \u201cand, more importantly, before the merger of law and equity.\u201d Stern v. South Chester Tube Co., 390 U.S. 606, 609, 88 S.Ct. 1332, 1334, 20 L.Ed.2d 177 (1967). Just as injunctions are effective immediately and are punishable by contempt when disobeyed, so is mandamus. <em>See </em>Denver-Greeley Valley Water Users Association v. McNeil, 131 F.2d 67 (10th Cir. 1942). Even prior to the Enabling Act of 1934, the Supreme Court observed that although the remedy by mandamus is at law, its allowance was controlled by equitable principles. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U.S. 352, 359, 53 S.Ct. 614, 77 L.Ed. 1250 (1933).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Unless we require that the instant action withstand the scrutiny of a three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>judge court under \u00a7 2282, the whole purpose and policy of the act can be aborted by allowing the appellant to initially seek only a declaration of invalidity of the CIA statute in the mandamus action before a single judge. Based on such a decision which has immediate effect, he can mount a subsequent request, if necessary, for an ancillary injunction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The ultimate effect of this action, if successful, will be to alter immediately the operation of critical features of the Central Intelligence Agency Act. Further, while based on the mandamus statute, this action contemplates injunctive relief in aid of the mandamus through restraining the publication of the Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures and Balances until it reflects the CIA\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In these circumstances we hold that the district court was required to request the convening of a three judge court, unless it appears that the constitutional issue raised by appellant in this action is insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\"> Whether the issue is insubstantial must be determined by the allegations of the bill of complaint. Mosher v. City of Phoenix, 287 U.S. 29, 53 S.Ct. 67, 77 L.Ed. 148 (1932). No question for a three judge court exists if the allegations of the complaint reveal that the \u201cquestion may be plainly insubstantial, either because it is \u2018obviously without merit\u2019 or because \u2018its unsoundness so clearly results from previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u2019 \u201d Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933). <em>See also, </em>Bailey v.

McCul-loch, 428 F.2d 396 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">All parties to this litigation concede that there is no prior decision which directly controls the outcome of this case. Nevertheless, the Government would have us conclude that the question raised is plainly without merit. The face of the complaint reveals no such infirmity. The appellant seeks to void legislation allegedly repugnant to a specific constitutional mandate. The language of article I, section 9, clause 7 could be reasonably construed in appellant\u2019s favor, and there is nothing in prior decisions of the Supreme Court which forecloses such interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">An additional reason for dismissal of this action by the district court was that the question posed by appellant in his complaint was not justiciable because it was barred by the political question doctrine. We make no comment except to state that this issue is intertwined with the merits of the case and it must be left for development at the subsequent hearing before the three judge court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">We conclude, therefore, that the complaint presents a constitutional cause of action raising a substantial question<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which requires the convening of a three judge court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On remand, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>judge will take appropriate steps to request the Chief Judge of this Court to designate a statutory three-judge court. All remaining issues not resolved in this opinion shall be adjudicated by the court so convened.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The order of the district court will be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-5\">. The procedural history of this case is confused. Appellant filed his complaint on January 8, 1970. Only eight days later his request for a three judge court was denied, and the case was ordered set down for assignment in the usual manner. Using hindsight, we can now see that the order of January 16, 1970, which presumably was based on a finding that there was no substantial constitutional question, Majuri v. United States, 431 <em>F.2d </em>469, 472-473 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 943, 91 S.Ct. 245, 27 L.Ed.2d 248 (1970), largely determined appellant\u2019s ease and made any further relevant litigation on the merits unlikely. Donovan v. Hayden Stone, Inc., 434 F.2d 619 (6th Cir. 1970). However, neither party nor the district judge so construed the action. On March 20, the Government filed a motion to dismiss and <em>on April 22 filed a motion to deny convening a three judge ctiurt. </em>On April 27 another district judge directed plaintiff to <em>file a brief on the questions of dismissal and a three judge court, </em>and on May 19, appellant <em>filed a motion to convene a three judge court. </em>On June 15 the hearing was held and on June 16 appellant\u2019s case was dismissed. A timely appeal was taken from that action. The January 16 order might have been appealable if it: (1) foreclosed future litigation and put him out of court, Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Rohan, 289 F.2d 426, 428 (2d Cir. 1961), modified on other grounds sub nom. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713, 715 n. 2, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962); (2) denied a preliminary injunction, Majuri v. United States, supra, or (3) dismissed the action at the same time, Jones v. Branigin, 433 F.2d 576, 579 (6th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, Jones v. Sullivan, 401 U.S. 977, 91 S.Ct. 1205, 28 L.Ed.2d 327 (1971). That order would clearly not have been appeal-able if there were other claims that had to be disposed of by the single judge district court to which the case had been assigned after denial of the three judge court. Cancel v. Wyman, 441 F.2d 553 (2d Cir. 1971); Lyons v. Davoren, 402 F.2d 890 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1081, 89 S.Ct. 861, 21 L.Ed.2d 774 (1969). This case is in between those two poles in that all parties believed there was further business for the district court, even though it is difficult for us to understand the basis for such a conclusion. In these circumstances we consider the order of January 16 interlocutory and not a final appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and that the appeal from the order of June 16 properly raises the question of the denial of the three judge court. Sackett v. Beaman, 399 F.2d 884, 889 n. 6 (9th Cir. 1968). In any case, we note that a single judge court\u2019s actions after an improper denial of a three judge court are of no effect, for they are taken without jurisdiction. Lyons v. Davoren, supra, 402 F.2d at 892. Therefore, even though appellant did not raise the question of the propriety of the denial of the three judge court at an earlier stage, he can still raise the question here because it goes to the jurisdiction of the single judge court to enter its order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Appellant brought an earlier suit challenging the CIA\u2019s accounting, alleging jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. That suit was dismissed because he failed to show the matter in controversy exceeded the value of $10,000. Richardson v. Sokol, 409 F.2d 3 (3d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 949, 90 S.Ct. 379, 24 L.Ed.2d 253 (1969). Because that decision was jurisdictional, he is not barred from raising the merits in this action.

In the normal procedure, once a district judge concludes that a three-judge court should be convened, it would appropriately consider, inter alia, the issue of standing. Since one of the grounds, however, for the dismissal of the case by the district court was the lack of standing, that issue is properly before us on this appeal and, in the interest of judicial efficiency, a disposition of it may avoid the necessity of additional appeals to this court. <em>See </em>Port of New York Authority v. United States, 451 F.2d 783, 785, n. 4 (2d Cir. 1971), Crossen v. Breckenridge, 446 F.2d 833, 838 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b946-8\">. Velvel v.

They reasoned that Flast permitted challenges only to spending under the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d clause of article I, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>8 and not to exercises under the specific enumerated powers, such as the right to provide for Armies and a Navy. We fail to see anything in Flast which requires a limitation of taxpayer suits to the general welfare clause. Suits challenging exercises of specific powers can certainly have the adverseness required, and there is nothing more in the Flast opinion which evinces a limitation of the taxpayer suit to certain types of subject matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">.

Whatever the interest of a citizen in knowing where his Government has spent <em>its </em>money, the interest of a taxpayer in knowing where <em>Ms </em>money has gone is more compelling and direct. Chief Judge Seitz is of the opinion that this plaintiff does not have standing as a taxpayer. <em>See, </em>Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).

STANDING AND CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">The first point of reference in determining the parameters of standing is Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-17\">\u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; \u2014 to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; \u2014 to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; \u2014 to Controversies to which the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>shall be a party; \u2014 to Controversies between two or more States; \u2014 between a State and Citizens of another State; \u2014between Citizens of different States, \u2014between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">A careful reading of Article III, Section 2 reveals that the existence of a case or controversy is mandatory before a federal court has jurisdiction, but the concept of standing is not mentioned at all. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that standing is a jurisdictional doctrine with a basis in Article III.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To determine whether a standing requirement is subsumed in the language of Article III, it is helpful to examine the state of the law at the time the Constitution was ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Professor Raoul Berger has analyzed the English and American law extant in 1787, when the Constitution was adopted, as well as the remarks of the various draftsmen and proponents of the Constitution. Based on such a review, he concluded that courts were incorrect when they relied on the practice in 1787 to read standing into the case or controversy limitation because English practice in the Eighteenth century encouraged suits by \u201cstrangers to attack unauthorized action.\u201d Berger, Standing to Sue in Public Action: Is it a Constitutional Requirement? 78 Yale L.S. 816, 827 (1969) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">From his examination of the views of the Framers, Berger determined that they assumed that the traditional English remedies would be available within the language of Article III to \u201ccurb [Congressional] excesses, particularly in light of their desire to leave all channels open for attacks on congressional self-aggrandizement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 829-830 (footnotes omitted). Nevertheless, Professor Berger was frank to admit that the evidence supporting his view is \u201cscanty\u201d and that there may well be policy considerations which justify the standing doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Although the words \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies\u201d and the phrase \u201cof a judicial nature\u201d (to use Madison\u2019s characterization) delimit the jurisdiction of the federal courts, they do not define nor are they synonymous with standing. In Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S. 44, 46, 63 S.Ct. 493, 494, 87 L.Ed 603 (1943), the Supreme Court stated that it would not determine \u201cwhether the record shows the existence of a genuine case or controversy\u201d because \u201cthe appeal must be dismissed on the ground that appellant has no standing to litigate the constitutional question.\u201d And in Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Ass\u2019n, 277 U.S. 274, 289, 48 S.Ct. 507, 509, 72 L.Ed. 880 (1928), the Supreme Court concluded that despite the plaintiff\u2019s standing, \u201cstill the proceeding is not a case or controversy within the meaning of Article 3 * *.\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[a]part from the jurisdictional requirement, [the] Court has developed a complementary rule of self-restraint for its own governance * * * \u201d, Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 1034, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953), and that the standing requirements were \u201cnot principles ordained by the Constitution, but rather rules of practice * * * \u201d, United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">II. SUPREME COURT CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">Accordingly, to determine accurately the boundaries of the doctrine of standing, reference must be made, not only to the test of the Constitution, but to the Supreme Court decisions which have discussed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>1. Frothingham v. Mellon</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The first case in which the standing requirement was explored in any depth was Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). A taxpayer had sued to enjoin expenditures under the Maternity Act, alleging that \u201cthe effect of the appropriations complained of will be to increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take her property without due process of law.\u201d 262 U.S. at 486, 43 S.Ct. at 600. The Supreme Court affirmed lower court dismissals of the action, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">\u201cThe administration of any statute, likely to produce additional taxation to be imposed upon a vast number of taxpayers, the extent of whose several liability is indefinite and constantly changing, is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern. If one taxpayer may champion and' litigate such a cause, then every other taxpayer may do the same, not only in respect of the statute here under review, but also in respect of every other appropriation act and statute whose administration requires the outlay of public money, and whose validity may be questioned. The bare suggestion of such a result, with its attendant inconveniences, goes far to sustain the conclusion which we have reached, that a suit of this character cannot be maintained.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 487, 43 S.Ct. at 601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">After elucidating these policy considerations and the scope of the power of the judiciary to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional, the Supreme Court set forth the test of standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-8\">\u201cThe party who invokes the power [to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 488, 43 S.Ct. at 601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">2. Significant Decisions Relating to Standing Subsequent to <em>Frothingham</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">In Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633, 58 S.Ct. 1, 82 L.Ed. 493 (1937), the Supreme Court was faced.with the issue of the standing of a citizen to challenge the constitutionality of the appointment and confirmation of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. In denying a motion for leave to file a petition for an order requiring the Justice to show cause why he should be permitted to serve, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-13\">\u201cThe motion papers disclose no interest upon the part of the petitioner other than that of a citizen and a member of the bar of this Court. That is insufficient. It is an established principle that to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained, or is immediately in danger of sustaining, a direct injury as a result of that action and it is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public. * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634, 58 S.Ct. at 1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">The next significant case is Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S. 44, 63 S.Ct. 493, 87 L.Ed. 603 (1943). There, a physician sued in state court for a declaration that state statutes prohibiting the use of drugs or instruments to prevent conception and the rendering of assistance or counsel in their use are unconstitutional. The state court held the statutes were constitutional, and the Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, dismissed the appeal because of the appellant\u2019s lack of standing. The Court noted that Dr. Tile-ston was not asserting his own Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>tional rights, but those of his patients, who were not parties to the action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">In Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951), three organizations that had been branded as communist by the Attorney General sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that they had suffered both pecuniary damage and a chilling effect on their First Amendment rights as a result of the defamation. In considering whether the lower courts had properly dismissed the actions, the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Burton, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">\u201cFinally, the standing of the petitioners to bring these suits is clear. The touchstone to justiciability is injury to a legally protected right and the right of a bona fide charitable organization to carry on its work, free from defamatory statements of the kind discussed, is such a right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140-141, 71 S.Ct. at 632 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Taxpayers in Doremus v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952), sought a declaration in a state court that a statute providing for the reading of the Bible in the New Jersey public schools was unconstitutional. Although the case was clouded by elements of mootness (one of the plaintiffs was no longer in school), it turned squarely on the issue of standing, which was cast by the Supreme Court in terms of \u201ccase or controversy.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the facets of the case surviving the mootness question, the Court noted that \u201c[n]o information is given as to what kind of taxes are paid by appellants and there is no averment that the Bible reading increases any tax they do pay or that as taxpayers they are, will, or possibly can be out of pocket because of it.\u201d 342 U.S. at 433, 72 S.Ct. at 397. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding, dismissing the appeal, relied, at least in terms of the language employed, on the fact that no money was at stake. <em>Id., </em>at 434-435, 72 S.Ct. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">One of the questions presented to the Supreme Court in Chicago v. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co., 357 U.S. 77, 78 S.Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174 (1958), was whether an intervenor had standing to appeal a judgment of a court of appeals. There, various railroads servicing Chicago sought to employ a new motor carrier to transfer passengers between stations. The new carrier refused to apply for a certificate required by a city ordinance, and when threatened with arrest, sued in federal court to invalidate the ordinance. The old carrier, Parmelee Transportation Co., was granted permission to intervene. Although the district court dismissed the complaint, the court of appeals reversed, and both the city and the old carrier appealed. In considering whether Parmelee had standing to secure review of the judgment, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIt is enough, for purposes of standing, that we have an actual controversy before us in which Parmelee has a direct and substantial personal interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83, 78 S.Ct. at 1067. <em>See also, </em>Norman\u2019s on the Waterfront, Inc. v. Wheatley, 444 F.2d 1011, 1012-1014 (3d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Another aspect of standing was addressed by the Supreme Court in NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). There, the state had sued the NAACP for violation of its foreign corporation registration statute, and moved for discovery of the NAACP\u2019s membership list. Although the defendant was willing to apply for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>registration, it would not disclose its general membership. In an appeal from a contempt citation, the Court held that the Association had standing to assert the Constitutional rights of its members. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\">\u201cTo limit the breadth of issues which must be dealt with in particular litigation, this Court has generally insisted that parties rely only on constitutional rights which are personal to themselves. * <em>* * </em>This rule is related to the broader doctrine that constitutional adjudication should, where possible, be avoided. * * * The principle is not disrespected where constitutional rights of persons who are not immediately before the Court could not be effectively vindicated except through an appropriate representative before the Court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">\u201c * * * Petitioner is the appropriate party to assert these rights, because it and its members are in every practical sense identical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 78 S.Ct. at 1170 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Thus, the NAACP\u2019s standing was predicated on the factual peculiarity of the case: to require the members to assert their rights not to have their names divulged would have revealed their names.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is also significant that the NAACP was already in court as a defendant when it raised the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1960), presented two standing issues to the Supreme Court for resolution:\u2019 (1) whether employees of a store who had been fined for violations of Sunday sales laws had standing to raise \u201cfree exercise\u201d constitutional questions; and (2) whether the same persons could assert \u201cestablishment clause\u201d rights as a defense to their prosecutions. With regard to the \u201cfree exercise question,\u201d the Court noted that appellants alleged only personal economic injury, not infringement of their religious freedoms, and held that they therefore had no standing to raise the issue of religious freedom.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to the \u201cestablishment clause\u201d issue, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-14\">\u201cAppellants here concededly have suffered direct economic injury, allegedly due to the imposition on them of the tenets of the Christian religion. We find that, in these circumstances, these appellants have standing to complain that the statutes are laws respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430-431, 81 S.Ct. at 1108 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">The Court distinguished <em>Doremus, supra, </em>on the ground that the complainants there failed to show direct and particular economic detriment. As in NAACP v. Alabama, <em>supra, </em>the defendants in <em>McGowan </em>were already in court, and had not sued as plaintiffs to raise the underlying substantive constitutional issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"akh-dedup-1\">3. Baker v. Carr (Formulation of the test)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), presented still another facet of the standing problem. There, qualified voters from certain Tennessee counties brought an individual and class action to invalidate the apportionment of the state general assembly. The Supreme Court first formulated the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">\u201cHave the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 82 S.Ct. at 703.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">In answering the question affirmatively, the Supreme Court noted that Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432 (1946), \u201csquarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves have standing to sue.\u201d 369 U.S. at 206, 82 S.Ct. at 704.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The injury asserted by the plaintiffs in Baker v. Carr was that the apportionment scheme then in effect \u201cdisfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality <em>visa-vis </em>voters in irrationally favored counties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207-208, 82 S.Ct. at 705. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">\u201c \u2018If such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury, they are among those who have sustained it. They are asserting a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,\u2019 Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 at 438, 59 S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385, not merely a claim of \u2018the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law. * * *\u2019 Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U.S. 126, 129, 42 S.Ct. 274, 66 L.Ed. 499 * * * \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 82 S.Ct. at 705.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap7Q\">Thus, the key to the decision in Baker v. Carr was the injury suffered by a voter whose vote was diluted by the unequal apportionment of election districts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">The Court was able to reach the merits of the equal protection claim, over the objection that to do so would be to decide a political question, because plaintiffs are entitled to relief from discrimination despite the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 82 S.Ct. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">4. School District of Abington Township, Pa. v. Schempp</p>\n<p id=\"AmbM\">Apparently, <em>Doremus, supra, </em>was overruled <em>sub-silentio </em>by School District of Abington Township, Pa. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963). <em>Schempp </em>was a taxpayer suit, brought in federal court, to enjoin the enforcement of a state Bible-reading statute. Chief Judge Biggs, writing for a three-judge court, held that the statute was violative of the First Amendment, that the school children had standing \u201csimilar to that of the minor plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 * * * \u201d, and that the parents had standing \u201cas the natural guardians of their children, having an immediate and</p>\n<p id=\"b957-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>direct interest in their spiritual and religious development * * *.\u201d 177 F.Supp. 398 (E.D.Pa.1959).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court affirmed the district court on the merits, but did not discuss the standing question at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">5. Flast v. Cohen (Frothingham reconsidered)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Eventually, every discussion of standing must come to grips with Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Whether one wishes to read that case narrowly or expansively, it must still be recognized that the issue there was \u201cwhether the <em>Froth-ingham </em>barrier should be lowered when a taxpayer attacks a federal statute on the ground that it violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 88 S.Ct. at 1944. The Court undertook to re-examine <em>Frothingham </em>because that opinion was unclear whether the standing requirement there announced was a matter of policy or constitutional doctrine. After analyzing the issue in terms of justicia-bility, the Supreme Court concluded that there was \u201cno absolute bar in Article III to suits by federal taxpayers challenging allegedly unconstitutional federal taxing and spending programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 88 S.Ct. at 1953. Thus, the constitutional basis for <em>Frothingham, </em>if it ever existed, was undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court did not go so far in <em>Flast </em>as to suggest that the concept of standing, based upon policy considerations, was no longer viable. Rather, the Court stated the issue, albeit in general terms, \u201cwhether there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1953.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Turning then to the case before it, a challenge to an appropriations measure, the Court set forth two rules governing its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The first rule, or sub-test, is a part of the general standing requirement dealing with nexus, quoted above. In order to maintain a suit, a \u201ctaxpayer must establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus,\u201d the Supreme Court explained, \u201ca taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality <em>only </em>of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art. I, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution. It will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The statement seems to make clear that taxpayer suits will be entertained only to enjoin expenditures under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, and that taxpayers as taxpayers will not have standing under any other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The second part of the test set forth in <em>Flast </em>is that \u201cthe taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-12\">\u201cUnder this requirement, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">But, this sub-test is not too meaningful when applied to taxpayer suits not challenging appropriations, and therefore can properly apply only to suits seeking to enjoin the expenditure of appropriated moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Thus, the general rule of taxpayer standing promulgated by <em>Flast, </em>as applied to eases not involving appropriations, if such a generalization is valid at all, is that in order to satisfy the requirement, a taxpayer must show: (1) the connection between his status and the enactment, and (2) the connection between his status and the right he alleged was infringed. In other words, does the enactment challenged affect the taxpayer as a taxpayer? And, if so, does it infringe upon a specific constitutional right possessed by that taxpayer as an individual?<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">As might be expected, <em>Flast </em>received extensive coverage by the commentators. The Harvard Supreme Court Review concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">\u201c[t]he <em>Flast </em>criteria provide a workable scheme for ascertaining when federal taxpayers should be permitted to sue even though not congressionally designated as proper parties to represent the public interest, but the criteria are not constitutionally compelled. The only constitutional requirement spelled out in <em>Flast </em>is that litigants seeking judicial review of congressional action, but not alleging an injury to a legally protected interest, must present some rationale distinguishing their personal interest from that of the general citizenry; any special injury rationale would seem to fulfill this requirement.\u201d The Supreme Court, 1967 Term, 82 Harv.L. Rev. 63, 230 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Apparently, the author of the Harvard note analyzed <em>Flast </em>in Hohfeldian terms, i. e., the plaintiff must show that some right of his was violated and that he was injured thereby, although the approach of the majority opinion was not so cast.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Professor Jaffe did employ Hohfeldian theory<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in his analysis of <em>Flast. </em>He reasoned that courts, including the Supreme Court, have heard suits initiated by non-Hohfeldian plaintiffs- \u2014 those not seeking a determination that they possess a right, privilege, immunity or power \u2014 and that the requirement of a Hohfeldian plaintiff is no longer justifiable from a policy point of view. <em>See, </em>Jaffe, The Citizen as Litigant in Public Actions: The non-Hohfeldian Or Ideological Plaintiff, 116 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1033 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Professor Kenneth Culp Davis criticized the reasoning of Flast v. Cohen. Davis, Standing: Taxpayers and Others, 35 U.Chi.L.Rev. 601 (1968). First, he argued that although nonconstitutional issues were before the Supreme Court, it decided neither the merits nor the standing question in terms of those issues. But more fundamentally, he controverted the statement by Mr. Justice Harlan that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-13\">\u201cThis Court has previously held that individual litigants have standing to represent the public interest, despite their lack of economic or other personal interests, if Congress has appropriately authorized such suits.\u201d Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. at 131, 88 S.Ct. at 1969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">Rather, Professor Davis asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-15\">\u201cEven though the law of standing is so cluttered and confused that almost ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ery proposition has some exception, <em>the federal courts have consistently adhered to one major proposition, without exception: One who has no interest of his own at stake always lacks standing.\" </em>35 U.Chi.L.Rev. at 617.<footnotemark>16a</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsX\">Professors Lockhart, Kamisar and Choper suggest that <em>Flast </em>and <em>Frothing-ham </em>are distinguishable because Mrs. Frothingham was, in reality, attempting to assert her state\u2019s interest in maintaining its legislative prerogatives whereas Mrs. Flast was vindicating her personal constitutional right not to be taxed for the establishment or support of a religious institution. W. Lockhart, &amp; Kam-isar &amp; J. Choper, Constitutional Law 65-66 (1970). This distinction implies that Mrs. Frothingham\u2019s right not to be taxed to support a federal program in derogation of a state\u2019s police power was not a meaningful personal right. It is apparently derived from the three holdings of <em>Frothingham </em>and the companion case of Massachusetts v. Mellon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">(1) The state\u2019s contention that the federal act in issue was an attempt to destroy its sovereignty was a non-justieiable political question because the state was under no compulsion to accept the benefits of the act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-6\">(2) The state did not have <em>parens patrie </em>standing to assert the rights of a citizen against the United States because in a federal-state dispute, it is the United States and not any given state that stands in <em>parens patrie </em>with its citizens; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">(3) The increased burden of taxation is a public rather than a private concern, and thus a citizen would not suffer any direct personal injury from an increase in taxation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Similarly, a citizen would suffer no direct personal injury if the federal government usurps the sovereignty of a state.

Cases after <em>Flast </em>(resurrection of the \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d Constitutional Consideration)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s next foray into the morass may be found in a pair of cases decided in 1970: Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184; Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192. These cases involved the issue of standing to review administrative regulations.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>Data Processing Service </em>begins with the observations that: \u201cGeneralizations about standing to sue are largely worthless as such.\u201d 397 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. at 829. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court stated that one generalization was necessary: \u201cthe question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered in the framework of Article III * * <em>Id. </em>This holds true whether the suit is by a taxpayer, as in <em>Flast, </em>or by a competitor, as in Data <em>Processing. </em>Mr. Justice Douglas, quoting from <em>Flast, </em>noted that the Article III requirement is met when the suit is \u201cpresented in an adversary context.\u201d He added that in a competitor\u2019s suit, the \u201cfirst question is whether the plaintiff alleges that the challenged action has caused him injury in fact, economic or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 90 S.Ct. at 829.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Second, where a party challenges regulatory actions, he will have standing to sue if he is arguably within the zone of interests protected by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 155-156, 90 S.Ct. 827. If these two tests are met, a plaintiff will have standing to seek judicial review of an administrative determination only if Congress has not specifically forbidden such review. <em>Id. </em>at 156-158, 90 S.Ct. 827. <em>Barlow </em>restated and reinforced these tests. 397 U.S. at 164-165, 90 S.Ct. 832.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">7. Sierra Club v. Morton (The Personal Stake Requirement)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">In Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), the Supreme Court considered whether a private organization had standing under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 (1970), to obtain judicial review of a decision of the United States Forest Service allowing development of part of a National Forest and National Game Refuge as a resort. Early in the opinion, the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-12\">\u201cWhere the party does not rely on any specific statute authorizing invocation of the judicial process, the question of standing depends upon whether the party has alleged such a \u2018personal\u2019 stake in the outcome of the controversy, Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, as to ensure \u2018the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution.\u2019 Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 101, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947.\u201d 405 U.S. at 732, 92 S.Ct. at 1364.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">Justice Stewart, speaking for the majority, stated that <em>Data Processing </em>and <em>Barlow </em>held that standing existed under the A.P.A. where the plaintiffs \u201calleged that the challenged action had caused them \u2018injury in fact,\u2019 and where the alleged injury was to an interest \u2018arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated\u2019 by the statutes that the agencies were claimed to have violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733, 92 S.Ct. at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">It is clear that the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d need not be economic injury, yet it must be an injury suffered by the plaintiff and not the public at large. <em>See id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>734, 92 S.Ct. 1365.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Only after a party establishes his personal standing may he litigate issues affecting the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 739, 92 S.Ct. 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The policy reasons underpinning the <em>Sierra Club </em>holding, as expressed by the majority decision, indicate that the Supreme Court is not yet willing to allow \u201cany individual citizen\u201d to challenge executive or congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Mr. Justice Stewart went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHC\">\u201cThe requirement that a party seeking review must allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected does not insulate executive action from judicial review, nor does it prevent any public interests from being protected through the judicial process. It does serve as at least a rough attempt to put the decision as to whether review will be sought in the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740, 92 S.Ct. at 1368. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Because of the importance of environmental quality, Mr. Justice Blackmun would make an exception to this requirement. Id. at 741, 92 S.Ct. 1369 (Dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">The above catalog of authorities does not exhaust the list of cases in which standing was an issue. For example, as long ago as 1900 the Supreme Court insisted that only parties with an interest in the land could maintain an action bottomed on title to the land. <em>See </em>Tyler v. Judges of the Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405, 21 S.Ct. 206, 45 L.Ed. 252. Standing requirements were somewhat relaxed in Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915), to allow an employee to assert his employer\u2019s right to be free of an unconstitutional law restricting the employment of aliens. However, the plaintiff there was an alien employee, asserting rights under the Equal Protection Clause. In 1917, a Caucasian sued a Negro for specific performance of a real-estate contract; the Negro asserted a local ordinance restricting Negro residency; and the Caucasian was permitted to challenge the validity of the ordinance. Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149 (1917); <em>accord, </em>Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953). And in Pierce v. Society of the Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), private and parochial schools were allowed to argue that a state statute violated the rights of parents and guardians because the plaintiff schools themselves had property rights directly affected by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">In Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936), a preferred stockholder of a private power company sued to prevent the company from entering into a contract with the TVA on the ground that the TVA was unconstitutional. Although the Supreme Court reached the merits of the case, Justice Brand\u00e9is, joined by Justices Stone, Roberts and Cardozo dissented on the ground Ashwander did not have standing since he had not demonstrated that either he or his company would sustain loss because of the contract. And three years later, in a similar situation, a majority of the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of the TVA because it suffered no loss that could be remedied since it did not have a right to be free of competition. Tennessee Electric Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U.S. 118, 59 S.Ct. 366, 83 L.Ed. 543 (1939).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>This past term, the Supreme Court, in Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154, 1972, in deciding not to entertain the complaint of a citizen regarding claimed surveillance by Army authorities, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-4\">\u201cThe decisions in these cases fully recognize that governmental action may be subject to constitutional challenge even though it has only an indirect effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights. At the same time, however, these decisions have in no way eroded the \u2018established principle that to entitle a private individual to invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action he must show that he has sustained, or is immediately in danger of sustaining, a direct injury as the result of that action . . .\u2019 Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633, 634, 58 S.Ct. 1, 82 L.Ed. 493 (1937).\u201d 408 U.S. at 13, 92 S.Ct. at 2325.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">III. LOWER COURT CASES ON STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">There are some recent court of appeals and district court decisions which, although not binding upon us, shed some light on the problem. In Velvel v. Nixon, 415 F.2d 236 (10th Cir. 1969), a taxpayer-citizen sued for a declaration that the Vietnam War was unconstitutional and for an order enjoining further American involvement in Vietnam. The district court dismissed the action and the court of appeals affirmed, holding that the plaintiff had not demonstrated the requisite personal stake in the outcome. The crux of the decision was that <em>Flast </em>was inapplicable because the plaintiff was not challenging a congressional expenditure under Article I, Section 8, and that even if <em>Flast </em>were applicable, no specific constitutional limitation had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">In Richardson v. Kennedy, 313 F.Supp. 1282 (W.D.Pa.1970) (three-judge court), aff\u2019d, 401 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 868, 27 L.Ed.2d 800 (1971), plaintiff challenged as unconstitutional the Congressional pay raise effected by the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 351-361 (1970). The Court dismissed the complaint on three grounds. First, the appropriation sought to be enjoined did not arise as in <em>Flast </em>under Article I, Section 8, but rather Article I, Section 6. Second, Article I, Section 6 \u201cwill not qualify as a Constitutional provision restricting the taxing and spending power * * 313 F.Supp. at 1286. Third, the plaintiff did not \u201cpossess the necessary personal stake in the outcome of this controversy and therefore lacks standing to maintain this action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnoteomitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Reservists Committee to Stop War v. Laird, 323 F.Supp. 833 (D.D.C.1971), reached an opposite result.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, the Committee and individual reservists, sought an injunction ordering the executive to \u201ctake steps that will eliminate any office inconsistent with the constitutional mandate\u201d of Article I, Section 6, clause 2, forbidding \u201cMembers of either House\u201d from holding \u201cany civil Office under the Authority of the United States.\u201d Specifically, it was alleged that 117 Senators and Representatives held commissions in the various military reserves, contrary to the Constitution. The court held that plaintiffs lacked standing as reservists, since they were unable to prove any direct injury, and as taxpayers, since they were not suing to enforce a limitation on the taxing and spending power of Congress. Nevertheless, Judge Gesell found that plaintiffs did have standing to sue as citizens for several reasons: (1) the Constitution was addressed \u201cto the potential for undue influence rather than to its realization,\u201d 323 F.Supp. at 840; (2) the Constitutional clause sought to be enforced was a \u201cprecise self-operative provision,\u201d <em>id.; </em>(3) the Constitution intended to protect the interest shared by all citizens in maintaining independence among the branches of government, <em>id. </em>at 341; and (4) the adverse interests of the parties left no doubt as to the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>istence of a \u201ccase or controversy,\u201d <em>id. </em>Also important to the court was that if these plaintiffs could not obtain judicial review, \u201cthen as a practical matter no one can.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The standing of a citizen to attack the constitutionality of the Vietnam War was found to exist in another recent case. Atlee v. Laird, 339 F.Supp. 1347 (E.D.Pa.1972). In <em>Atlee </em>the district court found that standing under the specific test of <em>Flast </em>was precluded because the warmaking clause was not a \u201cspecific limitation on the manner in which Congress could make expenditures.\u201d However, the court did find standing under the more general tests of <em>Flast, Data Processing Service, </em>and <em>Barlow </em>in that the plaintiffs had alleged personal economic injury resulting from the inflation and recession caused by war spending. The court also found standing because of the non-eeonomic aspects of the war, <em>viz., </em>the toll of human life, the threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens, and the diversion of available funds from domestic needs to the war effort.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">IV. ANALYSIS OF DECISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The principles to be distilled from all the many cases dealing with standing do not lead to the formulation of an easy set of guidelines by which standing may be determined, and indeed, Mr. Justice Douglas\u2019 comment in <em>Data Processing Service, </em>quoted <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. 829, is particularly apt. The problem is compounded, not only by the various contexts in which the cases arose, but by their inconsistency with regard to their theoretical basis.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nevertheless, some helpful guidelines do emerge from the mass of decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">The threshold rule in determining standing to litigate is that the party raising the issue must have been personally and directly injured or threatened with immediate injury by a violation of a statutory or constitutional right designed to protect that party. <em>See, e. g., </em>Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972); Sierra Club v. Morton, <em>supra; </em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, supra; Barlow v. Camp, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">This element, however, is subject to certain exceptions or limitations. Thus, standing to litigate questions concerning the Establishment Clause might be found in the absence of direct injury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See e. g., </em>School District of Abington Township, Pa. v. Schempp, <em>supra; </em>McGowan v. Maryland, <em>supra. </em>And slight injury may suffice to meet the test where other constitutional rights of paramount importance are at stake. <em>See </em>Baker v. Carr, <em>supra; </em>Sierra Club v. Morton, <em>supra </em>(Blackmun, J., dissenting); <em>cf., </em>Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Another factor which becomes apparent is that standing requirements may be eased where the party asserting the constitutional right is a defendant in a criminal or civil action. <em>See </em>Griswold v. Connecticut, <em>supra; </em>NAACP v. Alabama, <em>supra. </em>The rationale for this approach appears to be three-fold; first, a defendant has been injured or threaten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>ed with injury because of the impact of the proceedings against him; second, a defendant is involuntarily in court, and thus the policy of discouraging litigation will not be furthered by preventing him from asserting the right; and third, for a court to convict or impose liability by virtue of an unconstitutional statute or action would be affirmatively to commit an unconstitutional act.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Next, suits designed to interfere with the orderly operation of the Government, particularly with regard to taxation and appropriations, will not be entertained except in narrowly-defined circumstances. <em>See </em>Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra; </em>Frothingham v. Mellon, <em>supra; </em>W. Lockhart, Y. Kamisar &amp; J. Choper 68, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ave-dedup-2\">Closely related to this principle is the admonition that a citizen who suffers equally with all other citizens will not be heard to raise generalized grievances about the conduct of the Government. <em>See </em>Sierra Club v. Morton, <em>supra; </em>Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra; </em>Baker v. Carr, <em>supra; </em>Ex parte Levitt, <em>supra; </em>Frothingham v. Mellon, <em>supra; </em>Fairchild v. Hughes, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">One district court found an exception to this precept where the constitutional provision asserted was addressed to the potential for abuse, and the provision was precise and self-operative. Reservists Committee to Stop War v. Laird, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Finally, an important although not determinative factor in deciding whether standing exists is the availability of other modes of judicial review. <em>See </em>NAACP v. Alabama, <em>supra; </em>Barrows v. Jackson, <em>supra; </em>Pierce v. Society of the Sisters, <em>supra; </em>Buchanan v. Warley, <em>supra; </em>Truax v. Raich, <em>supra. But see </em>Colgrove v. Green, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">In the quest for standing in this litigation, another analysis of the major Supreme Court cases may be undertaken. If one accepts the limitations read <em>into </em>Flast v. Cohen by Justices Stewart and Fortas, then Frothingham v. Mellon represents an absolute bar to predicating standing on plaintiff\u2019s status as a \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d absent allegations of expenditures in violation of the Establishment Clause, notwithstanding the somewhat broader language employed by the Court in <em>Flast.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Thus, our inquiry here may be narrowly focused upon cases where \u201ccitizen\u201d standing was asserted. This search can be further circumscribed by eliminating from consideration as inapposite cases brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, where Congress has authorized or at least not forbidden suits,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and eases in which standing was conferred upon defendants, where as noted above other factors apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">By this process of elimination, there is left for consideration those cases dealing with the standing of \u201ccitizens\u201d who have sued a Government official for the vindication of a constitutional right personal to such \u201ccitizen.\u201d These cases fall into two categories. In some, the Supreme Court reached the merits despite the lack of a substantial, direct, tangible personal injury. In others, the standing barrier was breached only after the plaintiff demonstrated that he, personally, had actually been harmed in some regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">Representative of the first group of cases are Baker v. Carr and School District of Abington Township, Pa. v. Schempp. In Baker v. Carr, the basis of standing was that the constitutional right asserted \u2014 the integrity of the electoral process \u2014 was considered of such paramount importance that the deprivation of the right by dilution of voting strength through unequal apportionment was deemed a sufficient injury to permit the merits to be adjudicated. Similarly, the consideration that led the Court in <em>Schempp </em>to by-pass the standing problem was the high value placed upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>rights encompassed by the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">Cases representative of the second category \u2014 where plaintiff showed or failed to show harm in some regard \u2014 are Fair-child v. Hughes, Ex parte Levitt, Chicago v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F.R. Co., Laird v. Tatum, and Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis. In <em>Fairchild </em>the Court stated that a citizen had no standing to challenge the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment because he could not demonstrate any particular injury he would suffer that would not be shared equally by all citizens. <em>Levitt </em>held that a citizen did not have standing to challenge the appointment and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice. And in <em>Atchison, </em>Parmelee was permitted to intervene because of the economic harm suffered by it. In <em>Tatum, </em>citizens attacking surveillance techniques employed by the Army were held not to have standing because there was no indication that their First Amendment rights were chilled by the Army\u2019s practices. On the other hand, the Supreme Court permitted the parties to litigate at least some of the issues in <em>Irvis </em>because the plaintiff demonstrated personal impact or injury. <em>Irvis </em>is an exeellant example of this dichotomy. There, the Court held that the plaintiff did not have standing to litigate questions involving the membership qualifications of the Moose Lodge because he had not even attempted to become a member, but that he did have standing to raise the issues surrounding the Lodge\u2019s guest policies since he was refused service while a guest.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Thus, through the use of this case-by-case evaluation, two criteria appear to be critical. Is the constitutional right asserted of such paramount importance so as to obviate the need to allege and prove direct, personal impact which is individualized as distinguished from an impact shared by every member of the body politic? If not, does the plaintiff allege a direct personal injury or impact caused by the violation of the asserted constitutional right?</p>\n<p id=\"A5b\">V. APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES TO THE PRESENT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">In this case, actual application of the precepts deduced from the various Supreme Court cases parallels the analysis undertaken above, and the same two questions must still be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">We begin with the proposition that Richardson is a plaintiff, not a defendant, and therefore cases conferring standing upon defendants are somewhat inapplicable. Because expenditures are attacked, <em>Flast </em>and <em>Frothingham </em>would appear to create a barrier, at least insofar as Richardson\u2019s standing as a taxpayer is concerned. Third, the Administrative Procedure Act cases are not controlling because the challenged executive action is in full compliance with a Congressional enactment and there have been no administrative procedural irregularities pleaded. Finally, the plaintiff has not alleged that the Congressional and Executive action at issue has violated First Amendment rights or other rights previously assigned a position of paramount importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Accordingly, we are left with the questions of the relative importance of the asserted constitutional right and the nature of the injury suffered by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">1. Historical Background of Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">The debates regarding Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, the provision relied upon by plaintiff here, that occurred during the Constitutional Convention, shed light on the relative importance of that stipulation. An authority on the debates, Max Farrand, indicates that the discussion began with a statement by George Mason that \u201che did not conceive that the receipts and expenditures of the public money ought ever to be concealed. The people, he affirmed, had a right to know the expenditures of their money.\u201d 3 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 326 (Rev. ed. 1966). James Madison disagreed only with Mason\u2019s proposal of a fixed report<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ing period, stating that reports based on short periods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-4\">\u201cwould not be so full and connected as would be necessary for a thorough comprehension of them and detection of any errors. But by giving them [the reporting officials] an opportunity of publishing them from time to time, as might be found easy and convenient, they would be more full and satisfactory to the public, and would be sufficiently frequent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Rufus King objected to a full accounting on the ground that it would be \u201cimpracticable\u201d to report \u201cevery minute shilling.\u201d 2 Farrand 618.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The argument that the duty to report the accounting runs to the public is based on a comparison of Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 with Article II, Section 3. The language of Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 mandates that \u201ca regular Statement and Account * * * shall be published * * * whereas Article II, Section 3 requires that the President \u201cshall from time to time give to the Congress- information of the State of the Union * * \u201d. Thus, the impact of the distinction between \u201cshall be published\u201d and \u201cshall from time to time give to the Congress\u201d becomes apparent. Furthermore, the Articles of Confederation, drafted by many of the same persons as the Constitution, required only that Congress inform the states of its indebtedness, as opposed to the requirement of publication of the receipt and expenditures of all public money. <em>Compare </em>U.S.Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7 <em>with </em>Articles of Confederation, Art. IX, \u00b6 5 (requiring Congress to account to the states for \u201csums of money * * * borrowed or emitted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">2. Evaluation of Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 with respect to other constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Nevertheless, without denigrating the importance of Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, it would appear fair to conclude that it does not rise to the paramount stature of other constitutional provisions, such as those contained in the Bill of Rights. History records that many of the early colonists came to the New World to avoid the inhibitions upon personal religious freedom which attend the establishment of a state church. Indeed, there is some doubt whether the Constitution would have been ratified at all without the promises of the draftsmen that it would be soon amended to provide for certain basic rights. It is no coincidence that the first clause of the First Amendment prohibits the establishment of a national religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">The right of a citizen to have his vote count equally with those of other citizens is also basic to our system of Government. The \u201cone-man-one-vote\u201d principle is the very embodiment of the concept of a participatory democracy in which each citizen is considered the equal of every other.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Accordingly, the constitutional right presently asserted by the plaintiff would not appear to be, at least in the context of this case and at this point in the development of our history, of such preeminent importance that the traditional requirements of standing should be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">3. The nature of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">Since the right asserted would appear to be not a paramount one, it is necessary to determine whether plaintiff has suffered a personal injury sufficient to enable him to litigate the underlying issue. Although the debates in the Constitutional Convention might suggest that the right conferred by Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 runs to each citizen individually, they also demonstrate that the Clause imposes a duty to report to the public generally. Because Richardson did not and could not allege that either he alone or some identifiable class of citizens has suffered an injury not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>suffered by everyone else, the conclusion would appear to follow that \u201che has merely a general interest common to all members of the public,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and therefore is not endowed with standing to litigate this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">I recognize that if the view expressed herein were to be adopted by the majority, it would be difficult to perceive how a citizen would be able to litigate the constitutional provision asserted by Richardson. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of the many cases denying standing in the face of this objection is persuasive authority that this consideration is not sufficient by itself, within the contours of this suit, to confer standing upon plaintiff.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., </em>Frothingham v. Mellon, supra; Fairchild v. Hughes, <em>supra; </em>Ex parte Levitt, <em>supra; </em>Coleman v. Miller, <em>supra </em>(Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Indeed, to create a deviation on this basis would risk impairment of a vital rule by the disintegrating erosion of particular exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ar_l\">In recent years, the Supreme Court has had several opportunities to expand the concept of standing, but has declined to do so. I have serious reservations whether we ought to take this step in the absence of Congressional authorization or in the absence of some significant development in our national life clearly indicating the necessity for such movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">The Constitution has been likened to a device designed \u201cto be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.\u201d McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat, 316, 415, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). Constitutional litigation is the vehicle by which the Constitution can be interpreted, when necessary, to insure that the practice of government comports with the ideals of the governed. The system works best and provides a solid basis for future adjustments when changes are brought about slowly in response to real need for the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">The rule of self-restraint did not develop suddenly, and it is not a manifestation of the timorousness of judges. Rather, it reflects an approach to constitutional litigation designed to avoid division among the three branches of Government in their task of social problem-solving. Before the Constitution was adopted, Alexander Hamilton, in the 78th Federalist, recognized that the judiciary was the one branch without power to enforce its will on the other branches, and that it \u201cmust ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\u201d The most respected jurists throughout our history have realized that rash decision-making by the courts could lead to the disregard of the judiciary as a decision-maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">From Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), to O\u2019Brien v. Brown, 409 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2718, 34 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972), major constitutional crises threatening important government concepts have been averted by the application of discreet judicial techniques of self-restraint. When courts exercise forbearance, they act, to use the parlance of our electronic age, as filter circuits, dampening and smoothing political oscillations, rather than as amplifiers, magnifying them out of proportion. It is this smoothing process that has enabled us, in the long run, to maintain our democratic ideals in a troubled world.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>But to allow the tool of constitutional litigation to be employed at the behest of every disgruntled citizen would dull its working edge and weaken its effectiveness. It is for this reason that the Supreme Court has adopted a rule of \u201cself-restraint,\u201d and it is for this reason that we should not be quick to abandon that precept.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Judges ALDISERT and HUNTER join in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-19\">.

In Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961), patients and a doctor botli asserted that the state statutes were unconstitutional. The Supreme Court refused to decide the case, on the ground of lack of a justiciable controversy, because the complaints did not allege a threat of prosecution, because the state had initiated only one such prosecution in 82 years (to test the constitutionality of the statute), and because the doctor\u2019s constraint in not providing contraceptive devices was not reasonably related to a fear of prosecution. The issue of standing was not discussed in the main opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b954-14\">. <em>But see </em>Barrows v.

The Supreme Court denied plaintiff standing because any wrongful acts of the named officials would be directed against election officers, not citizens, and that in any event, the plaintiff was a citizen of a state which had already amended its own constitution to permit women to vote and had ratified the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b956-17\">. <em>See </em>Neal, Baker v.

The unsatisfactory aspect of the federal law of standing is, according to Professor Davis, its inconsistency. However, the observation is put forth that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANc\">\u201cThe law of standing need not be either a \u2018complicated specialty of federal jurisdiction,\u2019 as the Supreme Court has called it, or a mass of confused logic-chopping about bewildering technicality. It can be much simpler and much clearer than it is. All that is necessary is to make some firm policy choices and then to apply them consistently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGj\">Professor Davis then states a series of propositions, some affirmative and some negative, to govern the decision whether to grant standing in a particular case. The net effect of Professor Davis\u2019 propositions would be to ease the standing requirement necessary to attack legislative enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Raoul Berger also criticized <em>Flast, </em>but from an historical basis. He examined the state of the law at the time the Constitution was adopted and concluded that our founding fathers may have contemplated that all citizens would have standing, in the constitutional sense, to attack congressional usurpations. <em>See, Berger, supra, </em>at 829-301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b959-15\">.

Of course it must be recognized that the doctrine of standing is properly a device by which courts avoid constitutional litigation when they deem it unnecessary or inappropriate to decide the underlying question.
