The case was submitted to the District Court on cross-motions for summary judgment, and the motions of the defendant Comptroller and intervenor FNB Anchorage were granted. We affirm the judgment of the District Court, 326 F.Supp. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-19\">I. BACKGROUND AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">FNB Anchorage applied to the Comptroller on September 17, 1969 for permission to establish a branch office in the downtown business district of Fairbanks, Alaska. Various supporting data accompanied the application. FNB Anchorage summarized its reasons for applying for the branch as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-21\">It is mandatory for this bank to follow the development of its customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>in the ever-expanding economy of Alaska, greatly magnified as a result of the great oil activity on the North Slope. In order to do this, this branch must be established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">JA 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All interested parties were notified of the application and invited to comment; a field investigation was made by a national bank examiner, who recommended approval of the application. Eventually the application was opposed by the State of Alaska, Division of Banking and Securities, by several Fairbanks banks and by the Alaska Association of State Chartered Banks (the Association). The Association and the Alaska State Bank requested the Comptroller to conduct a hearing on the application in order to have \u201ca full opportunity to elaborate upon the reasons .for their opposition.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> JA 107. This request was granted, and the parties were notified of the date set for the hearing and were furnished a memorandum of procedures to be followed during the hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-18\">The hearing was held in Portland, Oregon, on March 31, 1970 before the Regional Comptroller, a Regional Econo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>mist, and a Senior Attorney from the Comptroller\u2019s office in Washington, D. C. The applicant FNB Anchorage was represented by its President and by counsel. Appearing to protest the application were the President of the Alaska State Bank (speaking for both his bank and the Alaska Association of State Chartered Banks) and state Banking Director Robertson (accompanied by one of his Bank Examiners), both represented by counsel. The hearing was directed by the Senior Attorney, Mr. Polking who opened the proceedings by reviewing the procedures set forth in the Regional Comptroller\u2019s memorandum announcing the hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Mr. Polking, as senior attorney for the Comptroller, then entered into the hearing record the entire public file, including FNB Anchorage\u2019s application with its supporting exhibits and documents (excepting only material of a confidential nature, such as customer lists), and all information and documents submitted by the protestants. Tr. 6-7. FNB Anchorage chose to make only a brief opening statement through counsel, and rested on its application and supporting documents. Though the President of FNB Anchorage was present at the hearing, <em>no </em>request was made by any of the participants to examine or otherwise hear testimony from him, and no objections were raised at the hearing to the manner in which FNB Anchorage presented its case. The protestants then presented testimony from eight separate witnesses and introduced documentary evidence in addition to that which had previously been submitted to the Comp-roller and included in the public file.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Following the hearing the panel divided in its recommendations on the application. Mr. Mattersdorf, the economist member, recommended disapproval because of the \u201coverbanked\u201d condition of Fairbanks and the questionable economic outlook for the central-Alaska area. AF 88-89. Mr. Polking recommended approval in the belief that the banking market in Fairbanks could support entry by FNB Anchorage without threatening the solvency or profitability of the existing banks, and that FNB Anchorage should be permitted to follow its customers into the Fairbanks area. AF 80. Regional Comptroller Leaf cast the deciding vote against approval, but the closeness of his decision is reflected by the fact that his recommendation adopted all four of the conclusions found determinative by the other two members of the panel. AF 72. His recommendation to disapprove seemed almost inconsistent with his analysis of the arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Disagreement continued after the application was forwarded to the Comptroller\u2019s office in Washington, D. C. There the Director of the Bank Organization Division recommended approval; two Deputy Comptrollers recommended rejection; and on June 26, 1970 the Comptroller rejected the application. By letter of June 30, 1970 FNB Anchorage was informed that their application had been denied. AF 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">On September 4, 1970 FNB Anchorage requested reconsideration of the decision on the basis of the merits of the original application. No new grounds nor changed circumstances were alleged, but the argument was again advanced that FNB Anchorage \u201ccan never truly be competitive with the National Bank of Alaska [who] can continue to take customers away from this bank as long as we are denied serving the Fairbanks area. . . . \u201d JA 12, AF 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Additional comments were then solicited from those who had opposed the application at the March 31 hearing. The State Banking Director, Alaska State Bank, and FNB Fairbanks filed protests that argued, in essence, that the only significant change occurring since the initial rejection o,f the FNB Anchorage application was further deterioration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>in the economic prospects for the Fairbanks area.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A new Regional Comptroller, Mr. Sel-by, wrote an extensive letter to the Comptroller on October 13, 1970 summarizing his view of the relevant factors and recommending approval of the application. JA 151-55, AF 15-21. He, too, noted that Fairbanks seemed to have \u201can adequate number of banking offices,\u201d but he was more impressed by the facts that 83% of the commercial bank deposits in the area were held by the two Fairbanks-based national banks, that a nine-month-old branch of the other major Anchorage-based national bank had been successfully accepted in Fairbanks without any perceptible detrimental effect on the existing Fairbanks banks, and that applicant had a valid claim to protect existing customers. Mr. Selby concluded that these competitive factors weighed most heavily in favor of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">During the week of October 19 Mr. Selby visited Anchorage and Fairbanks in order to become \u201cpersonally acquainted with the banking and economic factors prevalent in [Alaska].\u201d As a result o,f this visit, he wrote the Comptroller further on October 30: \u201cI have become more fully convinced of the soundness of the arguments presented by [FNB Anchorage] in defense of its application to enter Fairbanks . . . . \u201d JA 157-58; AF 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Mr. Selby\u2019s analysis was favorably received in the Office of the Comptroller, convincing the two Deputy Comptrollers who had previously recommended against approval to change their minds. The Director, Bank Organization Division, again cast his vote for approval, which made the staff recommendation unanimous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Comptroller Camp, on November 6, joined by approving the application, JA 159-60, AF 10-11, and FNB Anchorage and the protesting parties were notified of this approval by letters dated November 10 and 12, 1970. AF 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"a5u-dedup-0\">By separate correspondence on December 1, FNB Anchorage was reminded that approval was contingent upon using a \u201cdistinctive designation\u201d to prevent the confusion inevitable from having two \u201cFirst National Banks\u201d serving the same area. FNB Anchorage replied on December 18 with a proposal to use and emphasize the name \u201cInterior City Branch\u201d in connection with their Fairbanks operation. The Comptroller approved this designation on December 23, 1970, JA 161, 164-65, AF 1-2, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">This action was filed by FNB Fairbanks against the Comptroller on December 18,1970 seeking review of the Comptroller\u2019s actions and a declaratory judgment that his approval of the application was \u201carbitrary, capricious and unreasonable and an abuse of his discretion\u201d and that the approval was therefore \u201cnull and void and of no effect.\u201d JA 15. FNB Anchorage was granted leave to intervene as a defendant, and both defendants moved to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment; FNB Fairbanks filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and this appeal followed. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">II. THE ROLE OF STATE LAW IN NATIONAL BANK BRANCH APPLICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">The appellant, FNB Fairbanks, urges as its primary grounds for reversal that the Comptroller acted arbitrarily and in abuse o,f his discretion by failing to follow the provisions of state law that are to govern his decision when acting on branch applications from national banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">The authority to approve branches of national banks was initially given the Comptroller by Section 7 of the McFadden Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and appears now, as amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ed, in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36 (1970) (Emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">(c) A national banking association may, with the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, establish and operate new branches: ... (2) at any point within the State in which said association is situated, <em>if such establishment and operation are at the time authorized to State banks by the statute law of the State in question by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively </em>and not merely by implication or recognition, <em>and subject to the restrictions as to location imposed by the law of the State on State banks. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">(e) No branch . . . shall be established . . . without first obtaining the consent and approval of the Comptroller of the Currency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">In First National Bank of Logan v. Walker Bank &amp; Trust Company, 385 U.S. 252, 87 S.Ct. 492, 17 L.Ed.2d 343 (1966), the Supreme Court found in this statute and its legislative history a congressional intent \u201cto place national and state banks on a basis of \u2018competitive equality\u2019 insofar as branch banking was concerned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 87 S.Ct. at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">The doctrine of \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d results from this country\u2019s unique \u201cdual banking system,\u201d under which wholly independent state and national chartering authority have grown up together.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In cases where conflicts of state and federal supervision arise, as here, we must pay close attention to the congressional design for resolving that specific conflict. In the context of branch banking the \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d mandated by the statute focuses on the competition for expansion opportunities within each state between individual national- and state-chartered banks. The congressional policy adopted places the competing banks on an equal footing\u2014 hence \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d \u2014 by requiring that national banks are to be subject to the same statutory restrictions on branch establishment as are the state banks in each state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Any ambiguity as to the totality of this national deference to state law was resolved in Walker Bank, <em>supra, </em>385 U.S. at 261, 87 S.Ct. at 497:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">It appears clear from this r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the legislative history of \u00a7 36(c) (1) and (2) that Congress intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>to place national and state banks on a basis of <em>\u201ccompetitive </em>equality\u201d insofar as branch banking was concerned. . . . It is not for us to so construe the Acts as to .frustrate this clear-cut purpose so forcefully expressed by both friend and foe of the legislation at the time of its adoption. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">. It is a strange argument that permits one to pick and choose what portion of the law binds him. Indeed, it would fly in the face of the legislative history not to hold that national branch banking is limited to those States the laws of which permit it, and even there \u201conly to the extent that the State laws permit branch banking.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Three years later, in First National Bank in Plant City v. Dickinson, 396 U.S. 122, 90 S.Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969), the Court repeated the same thought while dealing with the related problem of the definition of a branch in Section 36(f) of Title 12 U.S.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">The policy of competitive equality is therefore firmly embedded in the statutes governing the national banking system. The mechanism of referring to state law is simply one designed to implement that congressional intent and build into the federal statute a self-executing provision to accommodate to changes in state regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzI\">396 U.S. at 133, 90 S.Ct. at 343. Thus, the statute and these decisions establish that the Comptroller\u2019s consideration of branch applications by national banks must be guided and controlled by the appropriate state\u2019s law on branch banking.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Appellant here argues that the Comptroller did not properly consider Alaska\u2019s laws on branching when he approved FNB Anchorage\u2019s application to est\u00e1b-lish a branch in downtown Fairbanks. This argument proceeds along two separate lines: First is the contention that the opinion of Mr. Robertson, Director of Alaska\u2019s Division of Banking and Securities, constitutes an official expression of state policy, and as such is a part of the state law by which the Comptroller is bound in his decision. Thus, since Mr. Robertson repeatedly and forcefully opposed this application, appellant contends that the Comptroller\u2019s approval was arbitrary and an impermissible abuse of his discretion. Secondly, FNB Fairbanks contends that the substantive requirements of the Alaska statutes governing branch banking were arbitrarily and capriciously ignored by the Comptroller in approving this application. We will consider each of these allegations in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">A. <em>The Banking Supervisor\u2019s Opinion as State Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Appellant bases his principal argument, that the Comptroller\u2019s discretion to approve this application is constrained by Mr. Robertson\u2019s views and opposition, upon a broad reading of the language from <em>Dickinson </em>\u201cthat a \u2018branch\u2019 may be established only when, where, and how state law would authorize a state bank to establish and operate such a branch . . . .\u201d 396 U.S. at 130, 90 S.Ct. at 341. Paraphrasing this language, appellant asserts that \u201c [i] f a state bank does not qualify under state law to establish a branch bank in Fairbanks <em>\u2014a fortiori, </em>neither does a national bank qualify.\u201d Brief for appellant, at 23. Since State Banking Director Robertson has repeatedly stated that his assessment of economic and banking conditions in Fairbanks would preclude his approving a branch application from any state bank,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s argument concludes that no state bank and, <em>a fortiori, </em>no national <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>bank \u201cqualifies] under state law to establish a branch bank in Fairbanks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In its simplest terms, appellant\u2019s argument is that the opinion of the state supervisor as to the application of the state law constitutes an expression of official state policy that is as binding on the Comptroller as any other provision of the \u201cstatute law of the state,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(c). This proposition is a novel one, and neither party has been able to cite case authority precisely on point. Our reading of the most closely analogous cases, as well as our understanding of the purpose of Section 36(c), leads us to a more restrictive view of the <em>Dickinson </em>language than that urged upon us by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Appellant cites two eases in support of this argument; Nuesse v. Camp, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 172, 385 F.2d 694 (1967), and Jackson v. First National Bank of Valdosta, 349 F.2d 71 (5th Cir. 1965). Both cases involved attempts by state banking supervisors to prevent branch establishment by national banks within their respective states, and the holding of both cases was that the supervisors had standing to sue in opposition to new national bank branches. Appellant FNB Fairbanks would convert this acknowledgment of the state supervisors\u2019 <em>interest in litigation </em>contesting national bank branching into a recognition of the supervisors\u2019 <em>substantive opinion </em>on the legality of the branch application as a component of the controlling state statute law on branching. These two cases do not support such an extension of their holding. They merely hold that state banking supervisors, by virtue of their official position, have standing to oppose the establishment of branches of national banks they consider to be violative of the applicable federal and state law. To permit a state banking supervisor \u201cto appear as a party to urge the construction of the federal statute that he claims is necessary to secure the state\u2019s interests,\u201d Nuesse v. Camp, <em>supra, </em>128 U.S. App.D.C. at 179, 385 F.2d at 701, is a far different proposition than the appellant\u2019s assertion that the State Commissioner\u2019s oral opinion applying state law to a specific factual situation is binding upon the Comptroller and this court. We decline to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">To the same effect is our decision in Union Savings Bank of Patchogue v. Saxon, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 296, 335 F.2d 718 (1964) and two District Court cases. In <em>Patchogue, supra, </em>the Comptroller had authorized a national bank to establish a branch in an \u201cunincorporated village,\u201d utilizing a New York Banking Department interpretation of the meaning of that term. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Comptroller in a competing bank\u2019s suit to block the branch. We reversed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agr-dedup-0\">Since we are of the opinion that the \u00a7 36(c) reference to \u201cthe statute law of the State\u201d includes legislative enactments and not administrative interpretations of those enactments, the New York Banking Department\u2019s view of \u00a7 105 of the New York Banking Law would not be authority for the establishment of the Tinker branch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANA\">Two District Court cases also hold that state administrative views are not to be considered controlling. In South Dakota v. National Bank of South Dakota, 219 F.Supp. 842 (D.S.D.1963), aff\u2019d, 335 F.2d 444 (8th Cir. 1964), a <em>rule </em>of the South Dakota State Banking Commission prohibiting the establishment of a branch bank more than fifty miles from the home office would have precluded establishment of a branch in the location sought by the defendant national bank. This rule was found to be an \u201cinvalid . . . attempt . to exercise legislative power,\u201d contrary to the state\u2019s branching statute and it was therefore held inapplicable to the national bank since Section 36(c) incorporates only the statute law of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Similarly, Leuthold v. Camp, 273 F.Supp. 695 (D.Mont.1967), aff\u2019d per curiam, 405 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1969), rejected a formal opinion of the Attorney General of Montana, which the Superintendent of Banks of the state considered binding upon himself. The court concluded: \u201cIf the administrator of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>state law sees fit to deprive the state banks of rights which the statute law [o.f the state] gives them, the resulting inequality is created by administrative fiat and not by statute law.\u201d 273 F. Supp. at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Though in each of these cases the opinion of the state supervisor was rejected, they cannot properly be read to support appellee\u2019s proposition that the state supervisor\u2019s opinion must always yield to a contrary view held by a federal court or the Comptroller. In each instance, the rejection was based on a finding that the supervisor\u2019s views were in conflict with the statute law of the state. However, where such a conflict is found, it makes no difference whether it is the state supervisor\u2019s or the Comptroller\u2019s opinion that is involved; a fair reading of the statute law of the state, as incorporated within the National Bank Act by Section 36(c), must determine whether or not branching is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Despite <em>Walker Bank </em>and <em>Dickinson, </em>the Comptroller apparently continued to resist the notion that he, too, was bound by the statute law of the states. In both First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company v. Camp, 409 F.2d 1086 (4th Cir. 1969) and First National Bank of Catawba County v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Company, 325 F.Supp. 523 (M.D.N.C.), aff\u2019d per curiam, 448 F.2d 637 (4th Cir. 1971), the Comptroller argued that he was not bound by the \u201cneed and convenience\u201d and \u201csolvency of the branch\u201d criteria of North Carolina\u2019s banking laws. The District Court in <em>Wachovia </em>vividly expressed his displeasure at this continuing recalcitrance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">Throughout his opinion, the Comptroller argues at great length as to why the pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Walker Bank </em>case and the holdings of the district court and the Court of Appeals in the <em>First Citizens Bank </em>case are unsound law and attempts to rationalize his reasons for ignoring these decisions. ... He ends his opinion by stating that he declines to make findings with respect to \u201cneeds and convenience\u201d criteria \u201cas required of the State Banking Commissioner by Section 53-62(b) of the North Carolina General Statutes.\u201d Having arbitrarily and capriciously elected to ignore clearly defined principles of law, it follows that the opinion of the Comptroller approving the application of Wachovia is a nullity. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Taken together these cases establish only that where either the state or federal administrator\u2019s opinion conflicts with the statute law of the state that opinion must be rejected. Where the state supervisor and the Comptroller have reached conflicting opinions on a branch application because of their conflicting interpretations of the state branching statute, a situation which we believe to exist here, we are confronted with a different factual situation than in any of these other cases. We are bound by Section 36 and its policy of \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d in seeking to resolve this conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">By its express terms, Section 36 makes branch establishment by national banks contingent upon the \u201cconsent and approval of the Comptroller.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(e) (1970). Thus if our conflict of views as to the proper construction of the applicable statutes arose in the setting of a state supervisor\u2019s opinion favoring the branch and the Comptroller opposing it, presuming of course that both views were in accord with the state\u2019s statutory requirements, Section 36(e)\u2019s requirement of the Comptroller\u2019s approval for any branch of a national bank would clearly result in denial of the branch application. In part this is due to a procedural obstacle; the Comptroller could not be forced to approve the branch because his action would be within the scope of his discretion protected from mandamus or the normal standards of judicial review. Another aspect, however, is that there is authority for the view that the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of the state statute is, under Secion 36, purely a question of federal law \u2014 that for the purpose of approving national bank branches not even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>state judicial interpretations of the state statute would control the federal interpretation. Howell v. Citizens First National Bank of Ridgewood, 385 F.2d 528 (3d Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The purposes of Section 36(c) lead us to a similar result where we are faced with a conflict in which the state supervisor protests and the Comptroller approves a national bank branch application upon what we find to be a sound interpretation of federal and state law. The \u201ccompetitive equality\u201d of Section 36(c) is an equality of opportunity for expansion. Under its provisions the state statutory restrictions on branching were intended by Congress to apply equally to state supervisors in approving branches for state banks and to the Comptroller in approving branches for national banks. To accept the appellant\u2019s view would be to impose the additional restraint on national banks of a veto power in the hands of the state supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Appellant argues that since state banks must obtain the state supervisor\u2019s approval, giving him that veto power over national banks equalizes branching opportunities between the two. That would not be equality of opportunity. Moreover it is not required by the applicable federal statute. Section 36 (c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxP\">a national banking association may, with the approval of the Comptroller establish . . . new branches ... if such establishment [is] authorized to state banks by the statute law of the state in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Insofar as this provision is concerned, the authority of the Comptroller to approve any branch depends on the <em>existence </em>of a state law in which branches are \u201cauthorized\u201d; it in no way requires the additional approval of the official administering the state banking statute, even where the state statute requires such approval for branches of state banks.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\"> If the Comptroller could exercise a veto power over state bank branching similar to that here claimed for the Alaska supervisor by appellant, <em>then, </em>if competitive equality were the sole standard, both state and national banks would be equally constrained by the requirement of joint approval by both the state supervisor and the Comptroller. Such a result would achieve the equality of expansion opportunity sought by Section 36(c), but it would totally destroy the <em>competitive </em>aspect that lies at the heart of both Section 36(c) and our \u201cdual banking system.\u201d Both the statutory language of Section 36(c) and the competition component of the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\u201ccompetitive equality\u201d require that neither state nor federal administrator be empowered to veto branch authorizations of the other. The state supervisors apply their state statutes in evaluating state bank branch applications wholly independently of any federal supervision, and we hold that the Comptroller may similarly apply those same state statutes in evaluating national bank branch applications independently of control by the opinions of the state supervisor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">This interpretation satisfies the requirements of Section 36(c) and its underlying principle of competitive equality. Both the state supervisor and the Comptroller are bound to follow the state branching statute; it is the language of that statute that controls. Neither state nor federal administrators may circumvent its dictates by unsound opinions or practice. State opinions interpreting their branching laws are to be considered by the Comptroller, but whether they are to be followed depends upon their conformance with the \u201cstatute law of the state in question.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Comptroller\u2019s obligation is to weigh each branch application against the standard imposed by the statute law of the state, and to deny the application if that standard is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">B. <em>The Requirements of Alaska Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">As hereinbefore described, in order for the Comptroller\u2019s approval of FNB Anchorage\u2019s branch in Fairbanks to be valid, the requirements of the Alaska Banking Code concerning branching must be met. In this case there is no specific finding anywhere in the record that the Comptroller found that the application complies with the Alaska Banking Code.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the face of this failure to make an express finding that the application complies with the most basic requirement of Section 36(c) and the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Walker Bank </em>and <em>Dickinson </em>decisions, we have been extremely careful in scrutinizing the administrative record here for evidence that the Alaska Banking Code\u2019s requirements have been met. It is only our conviction that there is substantial evidence in this record supporting the conclusion that the \u201cstatute law\u201d of Alaska concerning branch banks has been complied with that permits us to affirm the District Court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The Alaska Banking Code imposes two restrictions on branching that the appellant contends were not met in FNB Anchorage\u2019s application for a branch in Fairbanks. These are that \u201cthe addition of the proposed facilities in the community is not detrimental to a sound banking system,\u201d and that \u201cthe name is not deceptively similar to that of another bank in the proposed community or otherwise misleading.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Each of these requirements will be considered in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>1. <em>The \u201csound banking system\u201d standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">It is evident here that the state supervisor and the Comptroller have conflicting views as to whether the \u201csound banking system\u201d criterion has been met. The parties have all conceded that there is no existing administrative or judicial interpretation of this section of the Alaska Banking Code, so that both the state and national bank administrators approached this statutory requirement with no previous interpretive gloss on the meaning of a \u201csound banking system.\u201d By enacting such a broad and subjective standard as this, the Alaska legislature obviously intended to leave a great deal of room for the exercise of administrative discretion in applying the standard. And since this provision was enacted in 1951,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the legislature was well aware that under existing federal law<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the state statute would also serve as the basis for the establishment of branches of national banks. Once a state legislature has authorized branches for state banks they have opened the door to competition between unit and branch banking for both state and national banks. It is only natural that the state and national bank administrators, with their very different responsibilities and frames of reference, might develop different perspectives on what might be determined to be a \u201csound banking system.\u201d We believe that in the context of our dual banking system, the congressional policy of competitive equality embodied in Section 36(c) requires that we respect these differing perspectives in determining whether so broadly discretionary a requirement as is here involved has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Alaska Banking Director Robertson\u2019s construction of a \u201csound banking system\u201d can be deduced from his testimony at the Regional Comptroller\u2019s hearing and his documentary submissions included in the administrative record. His principal concern with Alaska\u2019s banking system appears to be concentration of banking resources.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Of the ten commercial banks in the state at the end of 1969, the two largest, National Bank of Alaska and FNB Anchorage respectively, held nearly 60% of the state\u2019s commercial bank deposits and operated 38 of 69 banking offices. Accentuating this concentration, in Mr. Robertson\u2019s opinion, is the smallness of the remaining eight commercial banks (none of them held as much as 50 million dollars in deposits), and the fact that the size and remoteness of Alaska itself are significant obstacles to expansion for the smaller banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">It is also apparent that Mr. Robertson\u2019s interpretation of a \u201csound banking system\u201d would include a more nearly equal asset balance between the national and state banks. His initial documentary submission to the Comptroller to protest this application included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajd-dedup-0\">We recognize that many areas of Alaska are now approaching an era of unprecedented growth and expansion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We also recognize that as resource development and general business activity increases and population expansion actually occurs, the resulting financial needs must be served. We view these favorable prospects as an excellent opportunity for the chartering authorities to create a \u201cbalanced\u201d banking system and to begin to correct the imbalance between state and national banks which exist [sic] at the present time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">In making this adjustment, it would be incumbent on the chartering authorities to move cautiously considering only that development which has actually occurred, or is eminent [sic]. We believe progress toward a <em>balanced system </em>can be made by not allowing any bank to move into those areas showing only \u201cfuture promise\u201d and, in effect, pre-empting competition. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">AF 301. In his testimony at the hearing Mr. Robertson repeated this theme, while implying that the statutory requirement of a \u201csound banking system\u201d imposed on him in his official capacity the role of a promoter of state banks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">Q. Do you think that the state banks in Alaska should have an opportunity now to expand to a point where they can catch up, so to speak, with the larger National Banks in Alaska?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">A. ... I think they should not be precluded by any premature expansion by banks who feel that they are in a position to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">Q. Well, you would like to see the state banks catch up, so to speak, would you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">A. Certainly. As <em>a state supervisor concerned with promoting and maintaining a sound banking system we have to be concerned with this.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">Tr. 65-66 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Mr. Robertson\u2019s application of this rationale to the application involved here is explained by another of his general comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">State banks are studying the growth areas throughout the State and are prepared to move into those where economic justification is evident. It is our concern that they will not [sic\u2014 intended to read \u201cwill\u201d?] be precluded from doing so simply by national banks moving into \u201cpromising\u201d areas well in advance of actual development. In this connection, we believe it is important to realize that although the future appears bright, comparison of key statewide economic indicators show rather modest rates of expansion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">AF 301. Mr. Robertson\u2019s evidence on the economic prospects for Fairbanks suggests that it is indeed a \u201cpromising area,\u201d but an area whose promise is clouded by the uncertainty accompanying the unresolved questions concerning development of the Alaskan North Slope oil fields. AF 23-42, 338-47. This economic analysis, coupled with the fact that the Fairbanks area ratio of population to existing banking offices was far lower than the statewide average (Alaska\u2019s statewide average is itself one of the lowest in the nation), prompted Mr. Robertson to conclude that \u201cthere are already too many banks for the size of the city. ... I feel very strongly that [the] proposed new [branch] would seriously jeopardize all existing banks in Fairbanks and make it exceedingly difficult for them to compete there and elsewhere.\u201d Tr. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\"> Mr. Robertson, both on cross-examination and in response to questions from the hearing panel, strenuously resisted suggestions that his position implied a recommendation for placing a moratorium on national bank branch approvals. Tr. 64-70, 86-88. However, we find it difficult to understand how Mr. Robertson would accomplish his \u201ccatching-up\u201d without providing state banks with some competitive advantage in the exploitation of expansion opportunities. From his entire testimony it is apparent that he interprets the \u201csound banking system\u201d standard to mean a \u201csound <em>state </em>banking system,\u201d but that view appears to us to lead to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>result inimical to the policy of competitive equality that underlies Section 36 of the National Bank Act. The fact that state banks may be precluded by capital inadequacy or managerial weakness from exploiting expansion opportunities into \u201cpromising\u201d but not-yet \u201cdeveloped\u201d areas should not constrain national banks better able to withstand such risks from doing so. A defect, however, in Mr. Robertson\u2019s approach is that the standard of a \u201csound banking system\u201d is not necessarily related to the size of either the state or national system. The relative amount of assets in either system is not a determining factor of the soundness of the banking system where state and national banks exist and operate side by side.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of the parameters of Alaska\u2019s \u201csound banking system\u201d standard is understandably colored by considering Section 36 competitive equality and his personal responsibility for supervising national banks. He, too, is cognizant of the dominance of the two largest national banks in the Alaskan banking structure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, having previously authorized a branch of the National Bank of Alaska \u2014the larger of the two \u2014 in Fairbanks, one factor weighing heavily in favor of granting this application was to provide FNB Anchorage the opportunity to continue its head-to-head statewide competition in the Fairbanks area.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Another competitive factor was the nearly complete domination of the Fairbanks banking market by two other national banks \u2014appellant FNB Fairbanks and Alaska National Bank of Fairbanks \u2014 who together hold 83% of the commercial bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>deposits in the area. AF 17. A branch of FNB Anchorage promises to bring new competition to banking in Fairbanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Another of the Comptroller\u2019s standards for evaluating the soundness of the Alaskan banking system is his evaluation of the soundness of individual banks, and here again the scale tips in favor of this application. The economist member of the hearing panel hinted at this factor as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">The unstated case for the FNB Anchorage\u2019s proposed branches is twofold: . . . and (perhaps also) to put pressure on one or both of the established National banks in Fairbanks which have required exceptionally close supervision by the Regional Administrator because of various deficiencies in management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">AF 88. This argument was no longer \u201cunstated\u201d upon reconsideration of the application. Mr. Selby, the new Regional Comptroller, included in his recommendation for approval a comment upon the asset, managerial and capitalization problems of the two local national banks. AF 17. Following his visit to Fairbanks shortly after writing his initial comments, Mr. Selby wrote again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">The First National Bank of Anchorage will meet stiff competition from the two Fairbanks-based banks .... The First National Bank of Fairbanks and the Alaska National Bank have a definite advantage in the city, and there is no basis for sheltering them from further competition, although both have certain asset and managerial problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">AF 12. Perhaps increased competition will cause changes that resolve these problems; perhaps there will be no significant change at all and the Fairbanks market will be able to support both the stronger and weaker banks. Whatever the end result, we see illustrated here the Comptroller\u2019s concern with the soundness of management of individual national banks, which must surely be considered a reasonable component of the Alaska statute\u2019s \u201csound banking system.\u201d It is apparent that the Comptroller interprets the statute to mean a \u201csound banking system <em>for the state,\u201d </em>an interpretation which we consider to more nearly conform to the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Next, we note the record reflects that the members of the staff of the Comptroller's office who considered the branch application found that its approval would not adversely affect the Fairbanks banks. Staff members so finding included: the bank examiner who made the initial investigation, JA 145, AF 69; the Regional Comptroller', AF 72, see also JA 147; Mr. Polking, the hearing panel member, JA 135, AF 80; and Mr. Selby, the new Regional Comptroller, AF 17, AF 12. These officials weighed the relevant facts and expressed their opinions that the existing banks would not be seriously affected, adversely affected, threatened or endangered. Typical of their comments was that of Mr. Polking, the hearing panel member who had voted in favor of the application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">From the evidence presented at the hearing, it is my opinion that the present and future banking market in Fairbanks will support the entry of applicant\u2019s branch and that the solvency and profitable operation of the Fairbanks banks will not be threatened by approval of this application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">JA 135, AF 80. The repeated expressions of the Comptroller\u2019s staff of the expected compatibility of this branch and the existing banking facilities provide strong support for the conclusion that approval of the application would not, at the very least, be detrimental to the existing Fairbanks-based banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">Finally, we turn to Mr. Robertson\u2019s contentions concerning the desirability of \u201cbalance\u201d in the banking structure of the state. The Bank Examiner\u2019s Investigation Report succinctly framed the critical question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-16\">The question appears to be whether or not Alaska wants branch banking. If they want branch banking, it should be permitted on a statewide basis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the letters of protest have little merit. If they want unit banking, the letters of protest have some merit ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU3\">JA 145, AF 69. There is little question from this record that Alaska wants branching. The Alaska Banking Code permits it, both state and national branches have been authorized and despite Mr. Robertson\u2019s opinions concerning \u201cbalance\u201d he stated at the hearing that \u201cI am in favor of expansion by either state or national banks where it is justified. . . . Our position on expansion is that where expansion is justified by economic conditions, by population, and so on, we encourage it.\u201d Tr. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Mr. Selby\u2019s letter of October 30, 1970 specifically addresses this issue, and directly contradicts the \u201cbalanced\u201d banking system views of Mr. Robertson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">Alaska is an ever-expanding state with dynamic possibilities, and population growth, particularly in the Anchorage area, is assured. It will become increasingly important for all of the Alaska banks to establish branching lines to their customers as this growth continues. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Very little consideration can be given to the arguments presented at the hearings here in Portland relative to giving the smaller unit banks priorities on branch locations. <em>If the larger branch systems are stifled in their branch expansion, the viability of the banking structure in Alaska is damaged, </em>and customers of those banks suffer the consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">Since paying a personal visit to Alaska, I have become more fully convinced of the soundness of the arguments presented by The First National Bank of Anchorage in defense of its application to enter Fairbanks and to establish branches at other locations to compete with the well-defined branch system of the National Bank of Alaska.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">AF 12-13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">It is apparent from the foregoing that Mr. Robertson and the Comptroller\u2019s office differ-in their interpretation of what constitutes a \u201csound banking system\u201d in Alaska. We find, however, that the interpretation expressed by the Comptroller\u2019s office more nearly comports with the legislative intent expressed in Section 36(c) and the Alaska statute. Furthermore, we find substantial evidence in this record to support the conclusion that approval of this branch will not be \u201cdetrimental to a sound banking system\u201d in any sense other than Mr. Robertson\u2019s alleged pre-emption of expansion opportunities in one of \u201cthose areas showing only \u2018future promise.\u2019 \u201d Yet we have already stated our belief that in this specific respect Mr. Robertson\u2019s view of the \u201cbalance\u201d necessary for the soundness of Alaska\u2019s banking system does not comport with the competitive equality mandated by Section 36(c) of the National Bank Act. Accordingly, we find substantial evidence that in approving this application the Comptroller did comply with Section 36(c) and the \u201csound banking system\u201d standard of the Alaska Banking Code, and that the District Court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the Comptroller on this point was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">2. <em>The \u201cdeceptively similar\u201d name criterion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Appellant argues, and we believe properly so, that a branch of FNB Anchorage in Fairbanks could pose a serious problem under the \u201cdeceptively similar\u201d name criterion; it could be seriously misleading for FNB Anchorage to open a new \u201cFirst National Bank\u201d branch in a city which has known FNB Fairbanks as the only \u201cFirst National\u201d for more than 65 years. However, we believe it is perfectly apparent from the record that the Comptroller clearly recognized this problem at several stages of the proceedings and explicitly conditioned his approval of the application on the use of some distinctive name for FNB Anchorage\u2019s operations in Fairbanks.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Appellant makes much of the fact that the initial letter of approval of the application, dated November 10, 1970, was not qualified in this manner. We find the Comptroller\u2019s letter of December 1, 1970 self-explanatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">A review of our file indicates that our letter dated November 10, 1970, which approved the captioned application, made no express reference to the name by which this branch office will be designated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">Inasmuch as a bank with the words \u201cFirst National Bank\u201d in its title presently maintains banking operations in Fairbanks, we will require that the instant branch receive a distinctive designation which will eliminate possible confusion arising from name similarity. At your earliest convenience, please submit for the approval of this Office, a suggested branch name which will accomplish this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">AF 5. On December 23, 1970, the Comptroller approved the designation \u201cInterior City Branch\u201d for use in \u201cadvertisements and other public representations concerning this banking office.\u201d AF 1. We do not believe this belated correction of what was so clearly an administrative oversight vitiates in any degree the conclusion that the Comptroller\u2019s approval was conditioned on the use of a distinctive name.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, we believe that the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe Comptroller considered himself bound by, and did follow, the \u2018deceptive name\u2019 restriction in the Alaska statute. His determination that the use of a distinctive designation would satisfy that restriction is not improper or an abuse of discretion.\u201d JA 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">III. APPELLANT\u2019S PROCEDURAL CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">FNB Fairbanks argues as another ground for reversal that basic concepts of administrative due process were violated in the Comptroller\u2019s conduct and use of the public hearing. The argument is made in two separate allegations of error: (1) that the failure to force testimony from and to permit cross-examination of FNB Anchorage\u2019s President \u201cmade a mockery of the public hearing,\u201d and (2) that in view of the refusal of FNB Anchorage\u2019s President to testify at the hearing the Comptroller accorded too much weight to the documentary evidence submitted by applicant in evaluating its merits against the volume of testimony presented by the protestants. It is, however, clear that these two allegations are both founded on the same underlying assertion \u2014 that the protestants were improperly denied an opportunity to confront applicants\u2019 President through cross-examination and thereby \u201cprobe the veracity of the statements contained in\u201d the application.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>We believe the appellant has misconstrued the purpose and function of the public hearing in branch application proceedings in the office of the Comptroller and that this procedural complaint derives from that misunderstanding. To begin, the Comptroller at the time of this application was not required to hold any hearing on branch applications.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When such hearings are held, the proceedings are not intended to be adversary, trial-type adjudicative hearings, but rather the hearing panel \u201cis simply an investigatory or fact-gathering organ, not having any fact-finding function.\u201d First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company v. Camp, 409 F.2d 1086, 1090 (4th Cir. 1969). In this case, the hearing was granted in response to the protestants\u2019 request that they be given \u201ca full opportunity to elaborate upon the reasons for their opposition.\u201d JA 107, AF 354. The critical feature of such a \u201cfact-gathering\u201d procedure, in order to provide the protestants with their opportunity to formulate a reasoned opposition, is to enable them to \u201cknow and meet opposing evidence with explanation or rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>First-Citizens, supra, </em>409 F.2d at 1090. Neither oral testimony nor cross-examination of applicant\u2019s President is necessary for accomplishing this. By making all documents concerning the application (excepting only those considered confidential because of their proprietary nature) available in a public file, then introducing the contents of that file into evidence at the hearing, protestants were provided both the knowledge of applicant\u2019s evidence and the opportunity to explain or rebut that evidence. with either documentary or testimonial evidence of their own.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We do not find that anything more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">As for the contention that too much weight was accorded the applicant\u2019s evidence, we fail to see how appellant can possibly protest the relative weights assigned to the evidence in view of the fact that both the hearing panel and the Comptroller in his initial action found in favor of the protestants. The Comptroller\u2019s subsequent approval of the application upon reconsideration appears largely based on the analysis and recommendations provided by Mr. Selby fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>lowing his personal visit to Alaska in October 1970. Thus that approval cannot be understood as having been based on an improper weighting of applicant\u2019s evidence at the March 1970 hearing. We must also recognize that the Comptroller\u2019s office brings wide knowledge and expertise in banking to bear on decisions such as when and where to approve a bank charter or branch bank. They have been entrusted with power in this area for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We must, then, conclude that on both the procedural and substantive grounds raised by FNB Fairbanks, there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the summary judgment granted by the District Court in favor of the Comptroller and that the record reflects that the approval of the application by the Comptroller complied with both federal and state law. That judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">.

Initially branches were limited to the same locality, but in 1933 statewide branching was authorized where state law authorized such branches for state banks. Act of June 16, 1933, ch. 89, \u00a7 23, 48 Stat. 189-90.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\">. Our \u201cdual system\u201d arose largely by historical accident, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">the National Bank Acts of 1863 and 1864, and the related ten per cent \u201cdeath tax\u201d imposed by Congress in 1865 on the note issues of state-chartered banks, were intended to provide a sound and uniform national currency by (1) eliminating state-chartered banking (and thus the issuance of state-bank notes), and (2) providing for a <em>single system </em>of federally chartered national banks to issue new national bank notes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAC\">Kreps, Modernizing Banking Regulation, 31 J.Law &amp; Con temp. Prob. 648, 649 (1966) (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted). This combination of legislation did succeed in eliminating state-bank notes, but, wholly unexpectedly, demand deposits replaced bank notes as the primary means for money creation and new life was breathed into the state banking systems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b686-13\">. Congressman Luce, one of the conferees on the state-wide branching bill in 1933, stated with respect to unit and briSich banking: \u201c [T] he two ideas shall compete on equal terms.\u201d 77 Cong.Rec. 5896. In 1941 the Michigan Supreme Court expressed the same idea: \u201c[T]he thought was to place both banking systems upon an <em>equal competitive plane.\u201d </em>Rushton ex rel. State Banking Commissioner v. Michigan Nat\u2019l Bank, 298 Mich. 417, 299 N.W. 129, 134 (1941) (emphasis added). This was a quo warranto action in state court to test the authority of the Michigan National Bank to operate certain branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-18\">The significance of this deference to state law is perhaps best illustrated by the remarkable diversity between states in their approach to branch banking. In 1970 only 19 states permitted state-wide branch banking; 16 states permitted branching on a limited basis; and 15 states either prohibited branching entirely or severely restricted it. U. S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1971, at 437 (92d ed. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"A90s\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Mr. Robertson\u2019s testimony at the Comptroller\u2019s hearing in Portland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">Q.

Howell, the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking, sought to enjoin approval of a national bank branch, arguing that its establishment would violate the applicable provision of New Jersey law. The trial court invoked the abstention doctrine and entered an order staying proceedings pending initiation of an action in the ' state courts to decide the challenged question of state law. The Third Circuit reversed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">[T]he determination of the extent of the application of a state branch banking statute to a national bank under the federal Banking Act of 1933 is purely a question of federal law, a question to be decided by reading the state statute through lenses prescribed by the the Congress. A decision by the state courts as to the meaning and application of a state branch banking statute would not be conclusive on the federal courts as to this federal question and might be wholly irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">385 F.2d at 530.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b690-14\">. We do not interpret the subsequent phrase, \u201cand subject to the restrictions as to <em>location </em>imposed by the law of the State on State banks\u201d (emphasis added) as adding anything other than a requirement to comply with those provisions of the state statutes that restrict the physical location of branches. Such limitations on location are frequently woven around political subdivisions, mileage limits, \u201chome office protection\u201d of competing banks, etc. This clause of Section 36(c) merely adopts these geographical limitations for national banks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. We interpret the <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Nuesse </em>opinions as being limited to the procedural aspects raised therein. Clearly the state supervisor has an interest in the Comptroller\u2019s interpretations of the state statute, for where the Comptroller\u2019s and state supervisor\u2019s views differ an inequality of expansion opportunities may conceivably arise. To forestall this result the state supervisor must be granted a forum in which to argue that the Comptroller\u2019s view does not comport with the state statute. We hold only that where the Comptroller\u2019s view is found to be consistent with the federal and state statutory restrictions, a contrary opinion of the state supervisor does not constitute an absolute bar to the Comptroller\u2019s approval of a national bank\u2019s branch application.

The economist member of the hearing panel had written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">Other states show even greater duopoly control of the commercial banking industry (e. g. Oregon). But I question whether such high concentration ratios should be encouraged or countenanced by the Comptroller if they are only now developing. While we have no guidelines regarding the upper limits of appropriate market shares by a state\u2019s two largest banks, I believe that such limits \u2014 however undefinable \u2014 should be considered. The NBA and FNB Anchorage may, jointly, have reached them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">AF 85.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\">. Prior disapproval by the Comptroller of FNB Anchoi-age branch applications at Kenai (1967) and Fairbanks (1965, 1970), while National Bank of Alaska was successful in having branch applications approved at both locations (AF 17-18), may have indicated a prior prejudice or favoritism that the Comptroller sought to correct. Since 1960 the National Bank of Alaska has had 13 branch applications approved by the Comptroller and one disapproved ; FNB Anchorage has had 4 approved and 4 disapproved (AF 17, 19, 20).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>AF 1-2, 5, 14, 18, 24, 75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b697-11\">. FNB Fairbanks further alleges in an affidavit by its President in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction in the District Court, as evidence of a lack of good faith in fulfilling this requirement, that FNB Anchorage has already commenced advertising that is deceptive. We find this a strange complaint. The advertisement indicates only that FNB Anchorage has a branch in Fairbanks. If one were to arrive in Fairbanks and look for the \u201cFirst National Bank\u201d there, since the Comptroller has required FNB Anchorage to prominently represent its local branch as \u201cInterior City Branch,\u201d it is quite likely that the stranger would end up in the \u201cFirst National Bank of Fairbanks\u201d offices. Only one who knew in advance that the \u201cInterior City Branch\u201d he found in Fairbanks was really the FNB Anchorage branch would be able to easily find the right bank if he were responding to the advertisement. The complained of advertisement, and its \u201cdeceptiveness,\u201d would thus seem to inure to the benefit of the plaintiff, a situation that hardly \u201cadversely affects,\u201d \u201cirreparably harms,\u201d or otherwise provides plaintiff a basis for complaint. Moreover, if FNB Anchorage indulges in deceptive advertising the complaint should be addressed to the Comptroller in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b697-13\">. We note initially that these procedural complaints were first raised in the District Court. Neither appellant nor any of the other protestants present at the hearing raised any objection to the Regional Comptroller\u2019s memorandum of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>cedures to be followed, or to the conduct of the hearing itself. In another case in which procedural objections to a Comptroller\u2019s hearing on branch applications were raised for the first time in the trial court, the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alt-dedup-0\">[Plaintiff\u2019s] right to raise at the judicial level procedural objections not advanced before the administrative agency is suspect, because, ordinarily, a litigant is not entitled to remain mute and await the outcome of an agency\u2019s decision and, if it is unfavorable, attack it on the ground of asserted procedural defects not called to the agency\u2019s attention when, if in fact they were defects, they would have been correctable at the administrative level. [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ac_-dedup-0\">First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company v. Camp, 409 F.2d 1086, 1088-1089 (4th Cir. 1969). Appellant\u2019s right to raise these objections here is even more highly suspect since the initial outcome of the hearing was <em>favorable </em>to appellant\u2019s position \u2014 not only did the hearing panel recommend disapproval of the application, but the Comptroller initially concurred with that recommendation. To delay raising procedural complaints about the hearing until after the Comptroller\u2019s unfavorable decision on reconsideration heightens the objection that the complaint is not well-founded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">. <em>See </em>cases collected in note 2, supra; K.
