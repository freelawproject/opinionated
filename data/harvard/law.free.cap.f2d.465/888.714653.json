We stayed the order pending appeal. Meanwhile, the federal decisional process with respect to the merits of the application of the state prisoner for habeas has been suspended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is true despite the fact that his state remedies have been exhausted, thus making a federal forum available to him under the statute. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241. The matter is now before us on the record and briefs for final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-19\">Granting the importance to Louisiana of the question presented, we find, upon consideration of the record, that we cannot make a final determination. This is for the reason that the appeal was not timely filed within the 30 day requirement of Rule 4(a), Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-20\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-13\">. See Louisiana ex rel. McKheely v. Henderson, 1970, 256 La. 869, 239 So.2d 364, where the Louisiana Supreme Court in a somewhat similar situation affirmed the refusal of a state trial court to carry out the \u201crequest\u201d or \u201corder\u201d of a federal district court that a state evidentiary hearing be held.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
