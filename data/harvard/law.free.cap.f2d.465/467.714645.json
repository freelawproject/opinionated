Upon a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, the district court entered a judgment of conviction and sentenced Fran-ieevieh to imprisonment for a period of 42 months. Franicevich appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Franicevieh\u2019s opening brief succinctly states the issues presented by this appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201cI. Whether sufficient evidence exists in this record to sustain the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201cII. Whether the denial of appellant\u2019s Requested Jury Instructions was improper and constituted substantial prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201cIII. Whether the admission of prior guilty pleas made by the named coconspirator and three other government witnesses to the identical substantive offense charged in this indictment was erroneous and constituted substantial prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">I. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Most of the facts were established without dispute. McKinney Boat Rental, Inc., purchased new the Crew-boat MANTARAY in December, 1968, for $44,527.74. Some seven months later, on July 13, 1969, the MANTARAY was stolen from her mooring. Her two 6-71 G.M. diesel engines were thereafter removed and loaded on a boat owned by the named coconspirator, Calvin Pelas, Sr. The MANTARAY was also stripped of her radar and navigational equipment, which was abandoned and thrown in the Gulf. Holes were burned in the side of the vessel along the water line and she was incompletely sunk in the Gulf. The Coast Guard promptly found the partially sunken vessel. Within a few days the missing engines were discovered on a boat owned by the named coconspirator. Pelas, Sr., his son Calvin Pelas, Jr., and four other men were arrested and charged with the substantive offense of willfully and fe-loniously tampering with the MAN-TARAY by removing her engines and navigational instruments and by the commission of other acts to and upon the vessel in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2275. All six pleaded guilty to the substantive offense and were sentenced. Franicevich alone was charged with conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Four of the six men who had pleaded guilty to the substantive offense in connection with the sinking of the MANTARAY testified against Franice-vich. Several other witnesses also testified for the Government. No evidence was offered in behalf of Franicevich.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">The jury could determine from ample evidence that Franicevich was building a crewboat for which he needed two motors of the type stolen from the MANTARAY, and that he conspired with Calvin Pelas, Sr., to acquire such motors by theft. According to Blanchard, Pelas, Sr., \u201csaid he wanted me to help to get him some diesel 6-71 en~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>gines for his boat, and he didn\u2019t care where I got them.\u201d Pelas, Sr., testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">\u201cA. * * * I seen Mr. Franice-vich, and I asked him if he would be interested in them, so he told me he would, so I told him I needed $500 for the engines, plus I wanted a thousand dollars because I had to use my equipment to get them out, but he wouldn\u2019t give me a thousand dollars. He gave me $900.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201cQ. When you say you would have to use your own equipment, what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cA. Well, I had to use my A-frame, and all, to pull them out of the boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cQ. Did you discuss with Mr. Fran-icevich the amount of work that would be involved, in addition to the use of your A-frame, in making this thousand dollar estimate ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. I told him I would have to hire a tug to push my barge, and all, to that location.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">(App. 179.) Franicevich furnished to Pelas, Sr., the $500.00 to be paid for the motors and, according to Pelas, Sr., \u201cHe told me not to give it all to him at one time \u2014 not over half.\u201d In turn, Pelas, Sr., paid Blanchard $200.00 before the MANTARAY was stolen and $300.00 when Blanchard delivered the MANTARAY. Pelas, Sr., told Blanchard that the money came from Fran-icevich. Further, on the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination Blanchard testified that he had a conversation with one Billy Sircovich in the presence of Franicevich and that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">\u201cA. Mr. Sircovich said they were concerned with the testimony that I may have given in this ease. Motto [Franicevich] said he had a lot of money, and he showed it to me, and I said I just wanted the $500 I had coming for getting the engines, but since that didn\u2019t work out, that was that, and they said they were going to kill Pelas\u2014 Calvin Pelas and throw him in the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">\u201cBY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">\u201cQ. Who said that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-16\">\u201cA. Billy Sircovich, and he said they were going to burn Calvin Pelas\u2019 house down with his family in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-17\">\u201cQ. Did they threaten you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-18\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; not right out like that, but they told me I knew what they were talking about, and they told me not to say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-19\">\u201cQ. Who said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-20\">\u201cA. Billy Sircovich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-21\">\u201cQ. Franicevich was with him, you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-22\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, right there. They made it clear what would happen if anybody talked, if I said anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-23\">(App. 145, 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-24\">When Pelas, Sr., reported to Franice-vich that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-25\">\u201c * * * I had the engines in my boat up at Empire, and he said OK, and I said I would like to have my money, and he went in the house, and when he came back out, he gave me a check for $900, and he told me then that he.was coming up to Empire to see the engines, and so him and \u2018Junior\u2019 Buras came up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-26\">\u201cI got in my truck with Marshall Dixon and drove on back up to Empire, over to the Mosquito Control Unit, and had, a cup of coffee, and then Motto [Franicevich] and \u2018Junior\u2019 Buras got there, and they boarded my boat and looked at the engines, and then Motto said he would like to have the boat brought down to Buras, so I asked Melvin if he would tow it down to Buras for me, and he agreed to do it for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-27\">\u201cSo we went on down to Buras with it, and Motto met us in the river, and he got in the boat with us, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>told us to bring it into the slip, his slip, so we brought it into his slip, which is alongside the river, and we tied it up on the side of the slip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9x\">\u201cAfter Motto tied it up, I took my tow off, and Melvin and I went back to Empire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">(App. 186, 187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The fact that Franicevich went on the boat owned by Pelas, Sr., to view the two motors was corroborated by the testimony of Calvin Pelas, Jr., and of Arthur Buras, Jr. Franicevich\u2019s $900.-00 check to Pelas, Sr., was cashed by a merchant, Thomas Ray Langston, who testified that the bank reported insufficient funds for payment of the check and \u201cMr. Franicevich\u2019s bookkeeper brought me $900.00 all in $20.00 bills.\u201d The jury might well have taken the same view of the evidence as that expressed by Judge Christenberry when imposing sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cI think it is perfectly clear in this case that this defendant is the evil genius of this whole thing. These other people stole that $50,000 boat, stole the engines, threw the equipment overboard, and the boat was sunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cThe only thing they kept was the two motors that were taken out of the boat. In other words, this boat was stolen so that this defendant could get two new motors. I think that was established beyond any reasonable doubt, any possible doubt, and the jury found him guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">(App. 260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">While the evidence was thus ample to prove that Franicevich and Pelas, Sr., conspired together from the very beginning of the plot, some questions of law remain as to whether their conspiracy was to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2275 (quoted in n. 1) as charged in the indictment, that is \u201cby wilfully and feloniously removing the engines and navigational instruments of a vessel of the United States, with the intent to injure or endanger the safety of said vessel.\u201d Fran-icevich\u2019s counsel stipulated that the MANTARAY is a vessel of the United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-14\">\u201cMR. WHEELER: Your Honor, we will stipulate that it is a vessel of the United States. We are not making any dispute about that at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Let it be admitted then.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-16\">(App. 76).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-17\">Franicevich\u2019s counsel vigorously urges, however, that there is not sufficient evidence to prove the intent charged in the indictment, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cwith the intent to injure or endanger the safety of said vessel.\u201d Franicevich\u2019s position was made clear to the district court by his requested instruction No. VI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-18\">\u201cAs a necessary element of the defense for which the defendant is being prosecuted, it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he, Motto Franicevich, willfully and knowingly entered into an agreement with Calvin J. Pelas, Sr., the object or purpose of which was to commit an offense against the United States in that they were to feloniously and unlawfully remove the engines of a vessel of the United States with the intent to injure or endanger the safety of that vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-19\">\u201cI charge you that the prohibited intent must go further than a mere intent to remove the engines themselves, and that the intent required is one to injure or endanger the vessel as a whole through the removal of the engines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cIn other words, if you find that there was an agreement to merely remove the engines of a vessel of the United States with the intention only of rendering that vessel incapable of navigation under its own power, you must then acquit the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aug-dedup-0\">Franicevich\u2019s contention as to the intent required by the statute is supported by two district court decisions \u2014 United States v. Saglietto, E.D.Va.1941, 41 F.Supp. 21, 26, et seq., and United States v. Martini, S.D.Ala.1941, 42 F.Supp. 502, 510. However, the Fourth, Fifth, Third and First Circuits have decided differently. In Bersio v. United States, 4 Cir. 1941, 124 F.2d 310, cert. denied 316 U.S. 665, 666, 62 S.Ct. 1033, 86 L.Ed. 1742, Judge Parker said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">\u201cThe question then comes down to this: Was the evidence sufficient to establish intent \u2018to injure or endanger the safety of the vessel\u2019? We think that it was. In this connection, we think it clear that the language of the statute is properly interpreted as requiring intent to injure the vessel or endanger her safety; for no one speaks of injuring the safety of an object. Such interpretation is seen to be manifestly correct if the words, \u2018or endanger the safety of\u2019, be set off by commas; and the subsequent phrase of the section, \u2018whether the injury or danger is so intended to take place within the jurisdiction of the United States, or after the vessel shall have departed therefrom\u2019, shows clearly that what was contemplated as embraced within the prescribed intent was injury itself as well as danger or the impairment of safety. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-U\">\u201c * * * We have carefully considered Judge Paul\u2019s opinion to the contrary in United States v. Saglietto, D.C., 41 F.Supp. 21, but we are not convinced by it. We think that it does not give sufficient scope to the phrase of the section \u2018whether the injury or danger is so intended to take place within the jurisdiction of the United States, or after the vessel shall have departed therefrom.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">124 F.2d 314, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In Marchese v. United States, 5 Cir. 1942, 126 F.2d 671, 674, Judge Sibley wrote for this Circuit in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWJ\">\u201cAH the acts named, whether done or attempted or conspired about, must be with \u2018intent to injure or endanger the safety of the vessel, or of her cargo, or of persons on board.\u2019 There is in this specification of intent plainly an ellipsis, words left out, to be supplied from the context. The word \u2018injure\u2019 is a transitive verb, requiring an object, but none immediately follows it. Is its object to be taken to be the noun \u2018safety\u2019 in the phrase \u2018endanger the safety\u2019, or are the nouns \u2018vessel\u2019, \u2018cargo\u2019 and \u2018persons\u2019 the objects meant? \u2018Endanger the safety\u2019 is a common expression to signify jeopardy without actual injury inflicted. \u2018Injure the safety\u2019 is a most unusual expression, injury being commonly affirmed as done to a person or a concrete thing. We think the natural meaning fully expressed is this: \u2018With intent to injure the vessel, her cargo, or persons on board, or to endanger the safety of the vessel, or of her cargo, or of persons on board.\u2019 If in interpreting a criminal statute we may regard its legislative evolution, we will find confirmation of this interpretation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In United States v. Scaleggeri, 3 Cir. 1942, 126 F.2d 1023, that Circuit expressed itself as \u201cin entire agreement with the reasoning\u201d of the Fifth Circuit in <em>M\u00e1rchese </em>and also as agreeing with the Fourth Circuit in <em>Bersio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">In Giugni v. United States, 1 Cir. 1942, 127 F.2d 786, 790, Judge Woodbu-ry wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201cThere remains to be considered the question of whether or not the defendants harbored the specific criminal intent required for conviction under the statute. The intent required is \u2018to injure or endanger the safety of the vessel or of her cargo, or of persons on board\u2019. This language is not altogether clear as pointed out in the Ber-sio and M\u00e1rchese cases cited above. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>However, without attempting to add to or improve upon what was said in those cases concerning the above quoted language, we think that it is clear enough that Congress intended to penalize acts of destruction done with intent either to injure the vessel, her cargo, or persons on board or to endanger the safety of either the vessel, her cargo, or of persons on board. This is the conclusion reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the M\u00e1rchese case on reasoning which we find satisfactory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVY6\">It may be added that in United States v. Polonio, D.Or.1941, 77 F.Supp. 768, Judge Alger Fee expressed like views and more specifically wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cA ship or vessel is not the hull alone, but consists of the engines and other integral portions thereof. Therefore, according to the interpretation of the Court, an intent to injure the vessel would be satisfied by finding of an intent to injure the integral parts thereof, such as the main engines.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">77 F.Supp. 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We conclude that the evidence was clearly sufficient to sustain the conviction under the particular statute as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">II. <em>Requested Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Franicevieh\u2019s requested instruction VI has already been fully considered. The only other requested instruction urged on appeal is No. VII, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\n<em>\u201cAccessory after the fact.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201cWhoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">This, Franieevich argues, was a \u201cdefense theory\u201d on which he was entitled to an instruction. We do not agree. Franieevich may well have been guilty both of conspiracy as charged and of being an accessory after the fact. He could not restrict the Government to a prosecution for the lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">III. <em>Guilty Pleas of Government Witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">On his third point, Franicevich\u2019s sole reliance is upon United States v. Harrell, 5 Cir. 1970, 436 F.2d 606. It is obvious that Franicevich\u2019s position is an afterthought and is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\"><em>Harrell </em>contains a full discussion of certain circumstances under which pleas of guilty by a coconspirator as to either conspiracy or the substantive offense will affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights and amount to \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P. This case does not present such circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">Not only did Franieevich register no objection at the trial, but he readily recognized from the beginning to the end, from the opening statements to the final arguments, that the proper and natural way to present the evidence was to show admitted commission of the substantive offense by six other persons both as affecting the credibility of the four of those persons who testified<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and as an orderly way of narrating the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-18\">The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement to the jury disclosed, without objection,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-19\">\u201cNow, six men entered pleas of guilty in this court, ladies and gentlemen, to charges of tampering with a vessel and they were sentenced by the Court. They were George Blanchard, Calvin Pelas, Sr., Jim Boyd, Marshall Dixon, Calvin Pelas, Jr., and Pat Bowers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-20\">\u201cThe defendant in this case, Mr. Franieevich, was not charged in that indictment, because the government is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>not accusing him of tampering with that vessel, but the government is accusing him of conspiracy \u2014 with unlawfully, willfully, knowingly and felo-niously conspiring to remove the engines and navigational instruments of a vessel of the United States, with the intent to injure or endanger the safety of said vessel.\u201d (App. 70.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoL\">Franicevich\u2019s counsel in his opening statement responded in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cThat vessel was cut up and sunk by six other people. You heard counsel give you their names, and you heard him say they all pleaded guilty in this court, and they were sentenced, but on what charge? Not conspiracy \u2014no; tampering with a vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cThat\u2019s what that was all about, tampering with a vessel. Now, what about Motto Franicevich? He wasn\u2019t charged with tampering with a vessel. Why not? Because he wasn\u2019t there. He wasn\u2019t anywhere near that place when all that was done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cSo those six men pleaded guilty and were sentenced, and then what happened ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">(App. 71-72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Indeed, that the commission of the substantive offense by six other persons fitted into the strategy of Franicevich\u2019s defense appears clear throughout the record, including his counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201cThere is no question that that happened. Six men participated in it, were indicted, entered pleas, and were sentenced. Motto Franicevich was not one of them. He is not charged with doing any act on that vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">* * * -X- X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\">\u201cThe conspiracy charged in this indictment is what? Not the sinking; not the participation, not those gory details, and so on, by Motto Franicev-ich. Absolutely not. He never was there, as you have heard so often during this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\">\u201cHis first appearance on the scene is July 14, Monday morning, 1969, after all of these acts occurred- \u2014 after the boat was sunk and after these engines were stolen. Please keep that in mind, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, when you begin deliberating on the evidence in this case. The first time we hear Motto Franicevich\u2019s name mentioned is after all the action took place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">(App. 215-216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">The record discloses no reversible error. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"A0p\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-25\">.
