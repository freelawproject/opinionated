The District Court found that appellant had failed to prove that his discharge was due to racial discrimination. The findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-19\">The District Court further found that appellant\u2019s claims were frivolous and that his counsel had so vexatiously multiplied proceedings as to increase costs. It held appellees entitled to costs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 in the sum of $100. Upon this record this did not constitute abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
