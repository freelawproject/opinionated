The bid invitation was based upon 2700 square feet of chipping and cleaning eroded concrete surfaces and 2700 cubic feet of drilling and setting steel anchors and placing concrete aggregate and intrusion grout. The unit price provided in the contract for each kind of work brought the total estimated contract amount to $197,100. While the contract allowed for upward adjustments of the cost of additional units of work, it was silent on decreases in quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-17\">Appellee Patton Wrecking, the successful bidder, undertook and completed a substantial portion of the available work when it discovered that the total amount of work was far less than that specified (approximately 49% of the bid invitation quantity). Patton halted further performance and sought a declaratory judgment that the government\u2019s projected failure to supply adequate work constituted an anticipatory breach of contract freeing Patton from further performance on its part and entitling it to damages on the theory of <em>quantum meruit. </em>Tennessee Valley Authority an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>swered and asserted Patton\u2019s failure to submit the dispute to the contracting officer under the contract\u2019s dispute clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\">The district court in an opinion reported as Patton Wrecking and Demolition Co., Inc. v. TVA, 324 F.Supp. 143 (N.D., Miss.1971) sustained Patton\u2019s complaint against TVA\u2019s motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment. The district court certified TVA\u2019s interlocutory appeal and a panel of this court accepted that appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">The district court, after studiously tracing the development of the \u201cstandard\u201d dispute clause,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> found the dispute clause here at issue [for clarity hereafter called \u201camended\u201d or all disputes clause] to be ambiguous in the scope of the jurisdiction that the parties had contractually conferred upon the contracting officer. The court, therefore, construed the amended dispute clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>against its proponent TVA and <em>pro tan-to </em>held that the dispute provision was inapplicable when the claim for anticipatory relief was not redressable under some other specific contract article. United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">The presence of a \u201cstandard\u201d dispute clause in government contracts has a long history. See annotation, Government Contracts \u2014 \u201cDispute\u201d Clause, 2 A.L.R.Fed. 691. In Edward R. Marden Corporation v. United States, 442 F.2d 364 (Ct.Cl., 1971), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-5\">\u201cIt is a familiar principle in the law of Government contracts that, to the extent complete relief is available under a specific provision of the contract, a controversy is regarded as being within the standard Disputes clause, <em>i. e., </em>as arising \u2018under the contract.\u2019 Such a controversy is susceptible of initial administrative resolution under the Disputes clause, and the administrative decision is subject to judicial review under the standards of the Wunderlich Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321, 322 (1964). Judicial review is strictly limited to the record established in the administrative proceedings. United States v. Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co., 373 U.S. 709, 714, 83 S.Ct. 1409, 10 L.Ed.2d 652 (1963). A corollary principle is that, to the extent complete relief is not made available under a specific contract provision, a controversy is not subject to administrative determination via the Disputes clause and may be tried de novo in the proper court. Len Co. &amp; Assoc, v. United States, 385 F.2d 438, 442, 181 Ct.Cl. 29, 36 (1967).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">The role and meaning of the \u201cstandard\u201d clause has been extensively considered by the Supreme Court in United States v. Utah, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, 384 U.S. 424, 86 S.Ct. 1539, 16 L.Ed.2d 662 (1966) and Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, 386 U.S. 503, 87 S.Ct. 1177, 18 L.Ed.2d 256 (1966). In <em>Utah </em>the Supreme Court distinguished between claims \u201carising under\u201d the contract [contract claims] for which some other contractual article provided avenues for redress and breach of contract claims. In holding administrative remedies available only for contract claims, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-8\">\u201cThus the settled construction of the disputes clause excludes breach of contract claims from its coverage, whether for purposes of granting relief or for purposes of making binding findings of fact that would be reviewable under Wunderlich Act standards rather than <em>de novo. </em>This is not to say that the Government does not have a powerful argument for construing the disputes clause to afford administrative relief for a wider spectrum of disputes arising between the contracting parties. It can be argued, as the Government persuasively does, that the same considerations which initially led to providing an administrative remedy in those situations covered by such clauses as Articles 3, 4 and 9 of the contract also support the broader reading of the disputes clause permitting and requiring administrative fact finding with respect to all disputes arising between the contracting parties. But the coverage of the disputes clause is a matter susceptible of contractual determination, United States v. Moorman, 338 U.S. 457, 70 S.Ct. 288, 94 L.Ed. 256, subject to the limitations on finality imposed by the Wunderlich Act, and one would have expected modification of the disputes clause to encompass breach of contract disputes if the restrictive interpretation of Article 15 was thought unduly to hinder government contracting. In fact the contracting departments have not rejected the narrower judicial reading of the disputes clause nor attempted any wholesale revision of its language to cover all factual disputes. Instead they have acted to create alternative administrative remedies for some breach of contract claims and to disestablish others by fashioning additional specific adjustment provisions contemplating relief under the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>tract in specified situations not reached by such provisions as Articles 3, 4 and 9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., <em>supra, </em>384 U.S. at 412-413, 86 S.Ct. at 1553. The primacy of the role of administrative resolution of contract claims through the dispute process requires that those remedies be exhausted before suit may be brought. The remedy, however, must be an available one, as the Supreme Court in United States v. Anthony Grace &amp; Sons, <em>supra, </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-5\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that the dispute here over the decision by the Department of the Air Force to cancel respondent\u2019s commitments under the bid and letter of acceptability and to retain the deposit is one which the parties contractually provided should be heard and decided by the administrative process. Barring some compelling policy reason to disregard this provision, the contractor should be held to its contractual agreement even at this stage in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-6\">It is true that this Court has said on several occasions that the parties will not be required to exhaust the administrative procedure if it is shown by clear evidence that such procedure is \u2018inadequate or unavailable.\u2019 United States v. Joseph A. Holpuch Co., <em>supra, </em>328 U.S. [234,] at 240, 66 S.Ct. at 1003, [90 L.Ed. 1192]; United States v. Blair, <em>supra, </em>321 U.S. [730] at 736-737, 64 S.Ct. 823, 88 L.Ed. 1039. It may be that the contracting officer, H. B. Zachry Co. v. United States, 344 F.2d 352, 170 Ct.Cl. 115, or the Board of Contract Appeals, Southeastern Oil Florida, Inc. v. United States, 115 F.Supp. 198, 127 Ct.Cl. 480, so clearly reveals an unwillingness to act and to comply with the administrative procedures in the contract that the contractor or supplier is justified in concluding that those procedures have thereby become \u2018unavailable.\u2019 Similarly, there may be occasions when the lack of authority of either the contracting officer or the administrative appeals board is so apparent that the contractor or supplier may justifiably conclude that further administrative relief is \u2018unavailable.\u2019 But these circumstances are clearly the exceptions rather than the rule and the inadequacy or unavailability of administrative relief must clearly appear before a party is permitted to circumvent his own contractual agreement.\u201d 384 U.S. at 429, 86 S.Ct. at 1542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">This learning was succinctly restated in <em>Crown Coat, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-9\">\u201cIt is now crystal clear that the contractor must seek the relief provided for under the contract or be barred from any relief in the courts. In United States v. Joseph A. Holpuch Co., 328 U.S. 234, 66 S.Ct. 1000, 90 L.Ed. 1192, the question was whether a contractor\u2019s failure to exhaust the administrative appeal provisions of a government construction contract bars him from bringing suit in the Court of Claims to recover damages. The Court held that it did. According to the Court, the disputes clause</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-10\">\u2018is a clear, unambiguous provision applicable at all times and binding on all parties to the contract. No court is justified in disregarding its letter or spirit. ... It creates a mechanism whereby adjustments may be made and errors corrected on an administrative level, thereby permitting the Government to mitigate or avoid large damage claims that might otherwise be created. United States v. Blair, 321 U.S. 730, 735, 64 S.Ct. 820, 823, 88 L.Ed. 1039. This mechanism, moreover, is exclusive in nature. Solely through its operation may claims be made and adjudicated as to matters arising under the contract. And in the absence of some clear evidence that the appeal procedure is inadequate or unavailable, that procedure must be pursued and exhausted before a contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>can be heard to complain in a court.\u2019 328 U.S. 234, 239-240, 66 S.Ct. 1003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-4\">See also United States v. Blair, 321 U.S. 730, 64 S.Ct. 820, 88 L.Ed. 1039, and United States v. Callahan Walker Co., 317 U.S. 56, 61, 63 S.Ct. 113, 115, 87 L.Ed. 49, where the disputes clause procedures are described as the \u2018only-avenue for relief.\u2019 \u201d 386 U.S. at 512, 87 S.Ct. at 1182.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Applying the constructional gloss imparted by <em>Utah, Grace </em>and <em>Crown Coat </em>to the term \u201carising under\u201d in the \u201cstandard\u201d disputes clause requires that TVA make a facial showing of contract redressability before exhaustion of contractual remedies would bar this suit. But to so apply the \u201carising under\u201d jurisprudence of <em>Utah </em>to this amended disputes clause fails to properly account for the significance of the change in language. In <em>Utah </em>the standard disputes clause provided \u201c \u2018all disputes concerning questions of fact arising under this contract\u2019 shall be decided by the contracting officer.\u201d The form employed in this case provided \u201cthat any dispute arising out of or connected in any way with any obligation of the parties arising out of the performance or nonperformance of the contract, whether arising before or after completion of performance shall be decided by the contracting officer.\u201d Indeed as we previously noted, the Supreme Court in <em>Utah </em>expected that should expanded jurisdiction under a disputes clause be desired, all that need be done was to amend the contract provision. United States v. Utah, supra, 384 U.S. at 412-413, 86 S.Ct. 1545. The deliberate attempt to expand the scope of jurisdiction under this clause cannot be disregarded as merely ambiguous surplusage. Cf. Bird &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, 420 F.2d 1051, 190 Ct.Cl. 426 (1970). The parties to an agreement such as the one at bar have the power to contractually select their own remedies and forum subject to the overriding limitations of the Wunderlich Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321, 322. United States v. Gleason, 175 U.S. 588, 20 S.Ct. 228, 44 L.Ed. 284 (1900); Martinsburg &amp; Potomac R.R. Co. v. March, 114 U.S. 549, 5 S.Ct. 1035, 29 L.Ed. 255 (1885). In a different context, <em>See </em>M/S BREMEN et al. v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">The case of Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Grace Line, Inc., 135 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 416 F.2d 1096 (1969), contains the key to proper appreciation of the amendment to the \u201cstandard\u201d disputes clause. In <em>Bethlehem </em>the clause provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-8\">\u201cArticle 36. Disputes \u2014 Any action, omission, direction, decision or determination of the Board, the Owner or the Contractor under this contract may be the subject of a dispute. <em>Any dispute arising under this contract which is not disposed of by agreement of the parties to this contract, shall be decided </em>by the Chief, Office of Ship Construction, of the Maritime Administration, who shall reduce his decision to writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy thereof to the Contractor and to the Owner, which decision shall be final and conclusive and shall bind all parties to this contract unless within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such copy the Contractor or the Owner appeals from said decision by mailing or otherwise furnishing said Chief, Office of Ship Construction, a written appeal addressed to the Board.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">In comparing the effect of the change in this form from the \u201cstandard\u201d disputes form, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-11\">\u201cThe factors motivating these alterations of the disputes clause have not been presented to us. Nonetheless, it is clear that the new 1957 clause has in some respects a wider reach than the standard fact-disputes clause construed in <em>Utah Construction, </em>Bethlehem maintains that the language \u2018[a]ny dispute arising under this contract\u2019 in the second sentence embraces any matter which the first sentence describes as a potential subject of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>pute, and compels the adjustment through the administrative machinery of all disagreements between the parties concerning \u2018[a]ny action, omission, direction, decision or determination\u2019 stemming from any of the myriad provisions of the contracts. We cannot accept this construction, or attribute to the new first sentence the capability of superimposing on the second a coverage nearly so broad or radical. The first sentence purports to require consideration by the Maritime Administration of <em>administratively referable </em>disputes over matters in character either legal or factual, judgmatical or ministerial, or otherwise outside the \u2018fact\u2019 category of the standard disputes clause terminology. But the vital circumstances confronting us here is that the words \u2018arising under this contract\u2019 remain in the second sentence, as they appeared in the old, and their influence on the problem at hand must be weighed with great care. For, despite the specification in the first sentence as to what \u2018may be the subject of a dispute,\u2019 the only type of dispute the second sentence makes mandatorily subject to the administrative procedure is one \u2018arising under this contract.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-4\">\u201cThat phrase \u2014 \u2018arising under this contract\u2019 \u2014 has a lengthy history, throughout which it has commanded widespread acceptance as an unyielding limitation on administrative reference to disputes that can be fully remedied under some stipulation of the contract. As the Supreme Court very recently pointed out, \u2018[t]he \u201carising under\u201d claims subject to final administrative determination are those claims asserted under other clauses of the contract calling for equitable adjustment of the * * price or extensions of time upon the occurrence of certain events.\u2019 If indeed the Maritime Administration\u2019s purpose had been to recast its disputes clause to free it from that construction, all it had to do was to eliminate the constricting language. Instead it left it in the new formulation of the disputes clause, and we do not think the new first sentence can be understood to vitiate it. The important consideration here, no less than in <em>Utah Construction, </em>is that \u2018the restrictive meaning of the words \u201carising under this contract\u201d had long since been established when these parties used them,\u2019 and upon that meaning the parties were entitled to rely in the absence of some clear indication that the words were to take on a wholly different significance. We think the new first sentence does not import such a modification. The second sentence, we hold, excludes Grace\u2019s banana reefer claim unless it is subject to full administrative vindication under some other provision of the contracts.\u201d 416 F.2d 1102-1103.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">It is patent that the contract awarded on April 10, 1969, to Patton Wrecking was drafted in appreciation of the <em>Utah </em>and <em>Bethlehem </em>decisions. The \u201camended\u201d or all disputes clause avoided the limitation of \u201carising under\u201d clauses discussed by <em>Utah, supra, </em>and by its own terms conferred breach of contract jurisdiction to the TVA\u2019s general manager, subject to review under the Wunderlich Act. United States v. Utah Construction and Mining Co., <em>supra; </em>United States v. Moorman, 338 U.S. 457, 70 S.Ct. 288, 94 L.Ed. 256 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">The district court alternatively considered whether Patton could obtain relief through administrative channels, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-9\">\u201cLaying aside, for the sake of argument, the apparent absence of any contractual provision to which Patton can look for relief, the \u2018disputes clause\u2019 contains an express provision that Patton cannot obtain through administrative channels one feature of the relief to which Patton claims he is entitled. If TVA has anticipatorily breached the contract, Patton may treat the contract as rescinded, repudiated and renounced, and is relieved of full performance. 17A C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 472(2) (d). In stating it dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>ferently, under the provisions of the \u2018disputes clause\u2019 Patton would be required to continue with work under the contract, pending the decision of the General Manager, and, thus, would be deprived of the right to treat the contract as renounced or repudiated by TYA. The relief provided by the contract, in the opinion of the court, is not adequate, assuming Patton is correct in his position.\u201d 324 F.Supp. at 150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">The district courts, since the merger of law and equity practice in federal courts, may consider where the equities of the case lie in construing contract language. The court moreover may determine whether the contractual language provides a means of settling the dispute. The concept of the redress-ability of a dispute \u201carising under\u201d the contract however does not apply to this dispute under the amended contract language. Here the clause expressed refers to \u201cdisputes . . . arising out of performance or nonperformance of the contract, whether arising before or after completion of performance, including disputes as to any alleged violation or breach thereof <em>. \u201d </em>The Court of Claims in Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. United States, 345 F.2d 833, 170 Ct.Cl. 757, stated the controlling principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-7\">\u201cIt is acknowledged by plaintiff that complete relief on this claim was available under the terms of the contract. The claim was so presented to and treated by the IBCA. Nevertheless, plaintiff now contends that it is a claim for breach of contract. In the broad sense, every failure by the government to comply with its contractual obligations is a breach of contract; this is the basis of our jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. In this context, a claim based on the inadequacy of an equitable adjustment would be a breach of contract. But we know that this is not so. United States v. Callahan Walker Construction Co., 317 U.S. 56, 63 S.Ct. 113, 87 L.Ed. 49 (1942). Most government contracts, either by clauses contained therein or by regulations which form a part of the contract, prescribe specific remedies for certain breaches of the contract by the government.2 In such instances, the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-9\">2- It has often been argued that the failure to order the change and grant an equitable adjustment, when a change in fact has been required by the contracting officer, constitutes a breach of contract. In some instances, the boards have ordered the contracting officer to make an adjustment, treating the requirement of the contracting officer as a constructive change. See Noonan Constr. Co., 1963 B.C.A. 18282 (ASBCA 1963); Aero Service Corp., 58-1 B.C.A. 6355 (ASBCA 1958). This court has treated similar claims as a change or a changed condition and granted an equitable adjustment. Jack Stone Company v. United States, 344 F.2d 370, [170 Ct.Cl. 281,] April 16, 1965; E. H. Sales, Inc. v. United States, 340 F.2d 358, [169 Ct.Cl. 269] (1965); Hoffman v. United States, 340 F.2d 645, [166 Ct.Cl. 39,] May 15, 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-10\">procedure specified in the Disputes clause must be followed while work is continued, lest the contractor be denied a remedy in this court for failure to pursue his administrative remedies. Therefore, where complete relief is available to the contractor under the provisions of the contract on a claim arising under the Disputes clause, the action is not one for such a breach of the contract that entitles either party to a de novo trial on the factual questions decided. We think the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bianchi compels the application of these rules even when the major issue to be decided is a question of law, as well as when the decision rests upon mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded with directions to enter an order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">. 16.
