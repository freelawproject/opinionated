Marston, was injured in a collision with another car on a highway in New Mexico. Miss Wargo brought an action against Mrs. Marston in a New Mexico state court, asserting negligence. The cause was removed to the United States District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>District of New Mexico on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The principal defense was based upon the New Mexico Guest Statute, \u00a7 64-24-1, N.M. S.A., 1953. The case was tried before a jury. A verdict was returned for Mrs. Marston upon which judgment was entered. Miss Wargo has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-4\">Miss Wargo contends that the district court erred in the exclusion of evidence, in the giving of jury instructions, and in directing a verdict on the issue of heedlessness or reckless disregard for the rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-5\">We do not find merit in any of the claims of the appellant and therefore the judgment of -the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1497-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
