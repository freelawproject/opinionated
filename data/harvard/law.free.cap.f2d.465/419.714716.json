Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">This is an appeal from the denial of a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 to vacate judgment and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">On June 18, 1962 appellant, represented by counsel, pleaded guilty to charges of smuggling some 58 pounds of marijuana into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a, and with failing to register with customs officials in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1407. Appellant was charged in two additional counts of the indictment with transporting marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a, and with failing to pay the transfer tax on contraband in violation of 26 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 4744(a). These latter two counts were dismissed on the government\u2019s motion. The district court accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to serve ten years on the smuggling count, the minimum mandatory term for a second narcotics offender, and three years on the registration count. The sentences were to run concurrently. Appellant was paroled on May 5, 1967, but was recommitted as a parole violator on September 15, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-20\">Appellant maintains that his guilty plea was involuntary in that it was not knowingly, understandingly, and intelligently made and that his conviction must therefore be set aside. He alleges no facts that would justify an evidentiary hearing on the issue of voluntariness. Weaver v. Texas, 5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-21\">Appellant also claims that his plea was involuntary because it had the effect, unknown to him at the time, of waiving his Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination. This contention is without merit. Appellant is under the mistaken impression that he was convicted under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4744(a). He argues that his guilty plea waived Fifth Amendment rights which are an absolute defense to prosecutions under that section, relying on Leary v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>States, 1969, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57. Appellant\u2019s problem is that he was not convicted under \u00a7 4744(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The fact of the plea of guilty bars any claim that a search incident to appellant\u2019s arrest was illegal. Busby v. Holman, 5 Cir., 1966, 356 F.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
