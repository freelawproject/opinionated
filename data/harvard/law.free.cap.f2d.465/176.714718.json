A warrant for violation of the conditions of release under the first sentence was issued before the expiration of the 537 days. It was not executed until he had served his time under the second conviction. He claims that this was illegal. He also claims that \u201cgood time\u201d is being improperly computed under his imprisonment under the remainder of his first sentence. Neither claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">The United States Parole Board has the authority to wait until a federal prisoner has served out the term imposed on an intervening sentence before the Board executes a warrant revoking a prisoner\u2019s parole from an original sentence. Moore v. Smith, 7 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 720; Ginyard v. Clemmer, 1966, 123 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 357 F.2d 291; <em>cf. </em>Schiffman v. Wilkinson, 9 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 589. The \u201cgood time\u201d earned against the intervening sentence need not be applied against the original sentence as well. Bandy v. Willingham, 10 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 333. Hass is receiving \u201cgood time\u201d at a higher rate (8 days per month) under what is left of his first sentence, because the two sentences have been \u201caggregated\u201d for that purpose, than he would have received under the first sentence standing alone (6 days per month).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
