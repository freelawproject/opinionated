The complaint further prayed that the court require Globe to reinstate his group life insurance to the full amount of $15,000.00; to reinstate his major medical group insurance; and still further to grant him waiver of premium benefits as called for in the two $7500.00 life policies, or in the alternative to enter a judgment against Globe for $15,000.00 for its breach of contract by its failure to hon- or the provisions for waiver of premium benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Federal jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship which requires that \u201cthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Swift and Globe each moved to dismiss because the jurisdictional amount was not involved, claiming that the pension and insurance benefits claimed by Matthews did not exceed the sum or value of $10,000.00 and that the alternative claims for money damages did not suffice to invoke federal jurisdiction. The district court denied the motions to dismiss. On appeal, neither Swift nor Globe insists on its claim of lack of federal jurisdiction. We agree with the result of the district court\u2019s decision denying dismissal for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">I. The Pension Plan</p>\n<p id=\"AgHH\">Its motion to dismiss having been denied, Swift next moved for summary judgment claiming that its Pension Plan is merely a gratuity, that it confers no contractual rights, that the Pension Board alone has the discretion to grant a pension for disability and that any decision of the Pension Board is final and conclusive. Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment was supported by an affidavit of K. W. Schuberth, Secretary of Swift\u2019s five-member Pension Board, to which was attached a copy of Swift\u2019s current Pension Plan dated January 1, 1966, as amended to August 22, 1968 (App. 19-37).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Plan is financed entirely by Swift and its subsidiary corporations. Article X of the Plan provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-16\">\u201cNO CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS CONFERRED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-17\">\u201cThe establishment of this Pension Plan, the Pension Trust, or the Trust Fund, the granting of a pension, or any other action at any time taken by the Board of Directors of Swift &amp; Company, the Pension Board or by the Trustee, or by their authority, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>not constitute any contract with or confer any legal or equitable right upon any employee, pensioner or other person whomsoever, as against the Company or any of its subsidiary (covered or noncovered) or affiliated corporations * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">(App. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">A pension trust fund is provided of which Bankers Trust Company is Trustee. Administration of the Pension Plan is vested in a Pension Board consisting of five members appointed annually by Swift\u2019s Board of Directors, which Board also has power to remove any member of the Pension Board and to fill any vacancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Article III, paragraphs 5 and 6 provide in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-8\">\u201c5. The Pension Board shall have the sole power, duty and responsibility to direct the administration of the Pension Plan in accordance with the provisions herein set forth, and shall act as the majority of its members shall decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">\u201c6. All decisions of the Pension Board as to the facts of any case and the meaning and intent of any provision in this Plan or of its application to any ease shall be final and conclusive * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">(App. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The Pension Plan contains provisions establishing requirements for employees to be eligible for pensions, for the granting of pensions to widows and dependent children of employees, and for computing the amount of pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Swift\u2019s Board of Directors retains power to amend and to terminate the Plan. Among other provisions we mention two particularly pertinent to the present case. Article VIII provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-13\">PERMANENT DISABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-14\">\u201cAny employe under normal retirement age who shall become disabled, other than temporarily, so as to be unable to perform the duties of any job available for him at the unit where employed, as determined in the sole discretion of the Pension Board, shall, if such employe has completed ten (10) years or more of credited service prior to such disability, be entitled to a disability retirement pension to commence upon retirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">(App. 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">Article XVI, paragraph 1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-18\">\u201c1. The validity and construction of this Pension Plan shall be determined according to the laws of the State of New York, and all the provisions hereof shall be administered according to the laws of said State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">(App. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">Mr. Schuberth\u2019s affidavit in support of Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-21\">\u201cThe question of whether an employee is disabled is a matter within the sole discretion of the Pension Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-22\">\u201cSaid Board has not determined that the plaintiff is disabled so as to be unable to perform the duties of any job available for him at the unit where employed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAsZ\">(App. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-23\">In its order denying Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-24\">\u201cFinally, defendant Swift &amp; Company argues that its pension plan is merely a gratuity and that the Pension Board\u2019s decision with regard to disability is conclusive. While defendant\u2019s pension plan may not expressly confer any contractual rights, this Court is clear to the conclusion that an employee\u2019s rights under a non-contributory retirement plan are contractual. Furthermore, the Pension Board\u2019s finding cannot be sustained if it is arbitrary, if it is a product of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>bad faith, or if it is based on insufficient evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">(App. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">In our opinion the' district court properly denied Swift\u2019s motion for summary judgment. There has been noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">\u201can increasing trend to hold that private noncontributory pension and retirement plans create a contractual obligation in which the promise to pay benefits is made in consideration of the continued faithful service of the employee for the requisite period. These courts take the view that a retirement pension is pay withheld to induce continued faithful service, amounting to delayed compensation for services rendered. The rationale of some such holdings is that the pension plan is the offer of a unilateral contract which is accepted by full performance by the employee, whereupon his previously inchoate rights vest and become legally enforceable. The right which thus vests is the right to receive payments in an amount computed in accord with the conditions and provisions of the whole contract. * -* * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">60 Am.Jur.2d, Pensions and Retirement Funds \u00a7 74, pp. 950-951.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">As has been noted, Swift\u2019s Pension Plan provides that the laws of New York should control in determining the validity and construction of the Pension Plan and also in its administration. Alabama, along with most other states, recognizes the right of parties to choose the law of another state to govern their contractual rights and duties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such a provision in a contract will not, however, be given effect if its consequences are likely to be contrary to the law or public policy of the forum.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the absence of a showing of such conflict between the laws of New York and the law or public policy of Alabama, the laws of New York control as provided in Article XYI, paragraph 1 of the Swift Pension Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">A similar pension plan was involved in Gitelson v. DuPont, 1966, 17 N.Y.2d 46, 268 N.Y.S.2d 11, 215 N.E.2d 336. There the plan provided for no employee contributions and the fund was administered by a three-man board on which three DuPont partners sat. The Court of Appeals of New York held that \u201c * * * an employee\u2019s right to receive payment under the plan is a conditional contract right and when the plaintiff became a party to the contract by taking employment under it he was bound by these conditions.\u201d 268 N.Y.S.2d at 13, 215 N.E.2d at 338. There the Board was vested with the sole authority to determine all matters relating to an employee\u2019s right to receive retirement payments. The New York Court of Appeals held the decision of the Board to be \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d unless the claimant met the burden to show that the Board\u2019s ruling was motivated by bad faith or arrived at by fraud or arbitrary action. In short, as expressed by the New York Court of Appeals, \u201cThe rights of the plaintiff under the plan are contract rights and are limited to the provisions of the contract.\u201d 268 N.Y.S.2d at 13, 215 N.E.2d at 336, 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Article III, paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Pension Plan, heretofore quoted in pertinent part, vest in the Board \u201cthe sole power, duty and responsibility to direct the administration of the Pension Plan.\u201d They require that the Board \u201cshall act as the majority of its members shall decide.\u201d It is \u201cdecisions of the Pension Board\u201d which \u201cshall become final and conclusive.\u201d Swift failed on its motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>for summary judgment to make any showing of any decision by the Pension Board. The affidavit of Mr. Schuberth, the Board\u2019s secretary, concluded simply with the negative averment that, \u201cSaid Board has not determined that the plaintiff is disabled so as to be unable to perform the duties of any job available for him at the unit where employed.\u201d (App. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The case proceeded to trial on the merits before the court without a jury. Matthews and Swift disagreed as to the issues. Matthews\u2019 complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUgE\">\u201c6. The issue against both defendants is the same and that is, whether the plaintiff is permanently and totally disabled as a result of a myocardial infarction suffered by him on March 9, 1970.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">(App. 4.) Swift\u2019s answer claimed that the issue as to Swift was framed by Article VIII of the Pension Plan (which we have quoted) and, moreover, \u201cthat said Pension Board has not determined that the plaintiff has become so disabled as to be entitled to a pension.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (App. 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">From the filing of Swift\u2019s answer and throughout the evidentiary hearing we find no reference to any decision of the Pension Board. Without further objection, the trial apparently proceeded on what the plaintiff, Matthews, claimed to be the issue against both Swift and Globe, viz.: \u201cwhether the plaintiff is permanently and totally disabled as a result of a myocardial infarction suffered by him on March 9, 1970.\u201d At the conclusion of the evidence the district court called for briefs, stating that, \u201cThe only question left in it is whether this man was permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of these policies.\u201d (App. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">After considering the parties\u2019 briefs, the district court made findings of fact concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-9\">\u201cBased primarily upon the testimony of Dr. Cawthon and also upon the conclusions of Dr. Friedman and the unexplained severance of plaintiff\u2019s employment, this Court concludes that the plaintiff is and was at all times relevant to the case, permanently and totally disabled. The evidence affirmatively reflects that the plaintiff since his coronary thrombosis has been unable to perform the occupation that he was performing for Swift. He is further unable to perform any other task for which he is qualified or fitted, considering his age, education, training, and experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-13\">\u201cAccordingly, it is the JUDGMENT of the Court that the plaintiff is entitled to the following relief:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-14\">\u201c(1) the benefits of Swift\u2019s pension plan from and after March 9, 1970, the date of disability,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-15\">\u201c(2) reinstatement of both the plaintiff\u2019s group life insurance at the face amount of $15,000 and his major medical group insurance, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-16\">\u201c(3) waiver of premiums under life insurance policies with defendant Globe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">(App. 232, 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-18\">The plaintiff, Matthews, is clearly mistaken in his claim that there is but one simple issue against both Swift and Globe, namely, whether he is permanently and totally disabled as a result of his heart attack of March 9, 1970. As to Swift, Article VIII of the Pension Plan does not require that Matthews be permanently and totally disabled but simply that he \u201cbecome disabled, other than temporarily, so as to be unable to perform the duties of any job available for him at the unit where employed.\u201d On the other hand, the question whether Matthews is so disabled is to be \u201cdetermined in the sole discretion of the Pension Board.\u201d Construed in connection with Article III, paragraphs 5 and 6, the Pension Board\u2019s determination must be by a <em>decision </em>of the Board acting \u201cas the majority of its members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>shall decide.\u201d If there has been any such decision against the plaintiff, then it can be overturned only by the plaintiff\u2019s proof of bad faith, fraud or arbitrary action, as has heretofore been developed. See <em>Gitelson, supra. </em>Clearly Matthews has not made such showing. But, where it is unclear whether the Pension Board has considered and decided an employee\u2019s claim on the merits, should a court undertake to make such a determination? On the facts of this case we hold that it was error for the district court to have decided that Matthews was entitled to a disability pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Matthews testified that he requested Swift to put him on disability retirement and supported that request with a certificate and letter from his physician, Dr. William Cawthon (App. 91). These were mailed about August 18, 1970, to Mr. R. S. Kincheloe, Director of Personnel for Swift (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 9 and 10). A Mr. R. H. Bell, \u201cManager Benefits\u201d for Swift, secured a further examination of Matthews by Dr. Ben Friedman, whose findings were mailed to Mr. Bell on March 15, 1971 (Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 1). Meanwhile Swift had, either on September 28, 1970 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1) or on January 6, 1971 (App. 76), terminated Matthews\u2019 services by letter from Mr. Kincheloe, apparently without explanation. The only communication from the Pension Board to Matthews is a letter dated and postmarked January 6, 1971, from \u201cK. W. Schuberth, Secretary Pension Board\u201d which states that, \u201cThis letter is intended only as a source of general information.\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1.) That letter states that Matthews\u2019 services for Swift terminated on September 28, 1970, after 242/i2 years of credited service from 7/23/46 to 9/28/70, informs plaintiff of the provisions of the Swift Pension Plan for the payment of a deferred pension because of age, and calculates that \u201csuch single pension which you may be entitled to receive will amount to $145.00 per month.\u201d That letter makes no reference to plaintiff\u2019s claim for a disability pension, nor to whether any such claim has ever been considered or decided by the Pension Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The only provision for a disability pension is Article VIII of the Pension Plan which has been quoted <em>ante. </em>That provision must be construed in connection with Article III, paragraphs 5 and 6, the pertinent provisions of which have also been quoted <em>ante. </em>The discretion to be exercised by the Pension Board in an Article VIII case is, however, unique in that it involves not only a decision as to the facts of the particular case but also a resolution of the meaning, intent and application of the provisions of Article VIII. Most of the provisions of that article are reasonably definite, and those provisions were met by Matthews. He was 47 years of age, \u201cunder normal retirement age.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Matthews\u2019 heart attack undoubtedly caused him some disability. Prior to such disability, Matthews had completed more than ten (10) years of credited service. These definite standards could be applied by any fit trial body, judge or jury, perhaps as well as by the Pension Board. That is true also of the provision as to the degree of disability, viz., \u201cso as to be unable to perform the duties of any job available for him at the unit where employed.\u201d When, however, we reach the requirement that the employee \u201cbecome disabled, other than temporarily,\u201d the standard is so indefinite that a judge or jury\u2019s decision could hardly be substituted for that of the Pension Board without doing violence to the provision that all decisions as to the availability of a disability pension lie \u201cin the sole discretion of the Pension Board.\u201d What is meant by \u201cother than temporarily\u201d? Those words can have an infinite number of meanings. The only conceivable case in which both a judge and the Pension Board would necessarily conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>an employee is disabled \u201cother than temporarily\u201d is that in which disability is clearly \u201cpermanent.\u201d In all other eases the discretion of the judge cannot be substituted for that of the Pension Board without departing from the terms of the contractual obligation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">It does not appear whether the Pension Board has affirmatively decided by a majority of its members that Matthews is not entitled to the disability pension which he claims, or has only negatively failed to decide that he is so entitled. In either event, before the Judge\u2019s discretion can be substituted for that of the Pension Board under the Plan, Matthews has the burden of proving such a clear ease of permanent disability that no honest tribunal could reach any other decision and the burden of proving that any other decision is or would be arbitrary, fraudulent or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Clearly Matthews did not undertake such a heavy burden. Nor is such a burden met by the evidence in this case. Matthews\u2019 own physician, Dr. Cawthon, testified that he was totally disabled for his regular occupation but not for any occupation, that he would never be able to resume his regular work, and that he was not a suitable candidate for a rehabilitation program. (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 9. ) In answer to the Judge\u2019s question as to the \u201cextent of the infarction,\u201d Dr. Cawthon said: \u201cIt was very mild \u2014 as such things go, it would be classified as mild damage.\u201d (App. 193.) His heart was not enlarged. (App. 194.) \u201cFrom the physical standpoint\u201d Dr. Cawthon expressed the opinion that he could do some work. (App. 210.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-8\">\u201cA. <em>* * * </em>This man is disabled for psychological reasons primarily; and, in my opinion, I think his heart is in good enough shape that he could work if he had confidence and no fear. He is immobilized by anxiety and depression to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-12\">\u201cQ. Is this unreal or malingering in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think he is malingering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">(App. 211.) Dr. Friedman testified also \u201cthat there is an important element of anxiety and mental depression\u201d (App. 145); that it is quite common for a person who has suffered a heart attack similar to that of Mr. Matthews to have anxiety and mental depression.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-15\">\u201cBut most patients will get over it in the first two or three months and then resume a normal, active life and learn to live with their handicaps; but during the active acute stage, yes, it is quite common for depression, feeling of dependency to set in * * <em>*\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">(App. 146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">Under the provisions of Swift\u2019s Pension Plan, before the district court could adjudge that the plaintiff, Matthews, was entitled to disability benefits under the Plan, it must find either that a decision actually reached by the Pension Board was arbitrary, fraudulent or in bad faith, or, if the Pension Board had made no decision, that it could not fairly and in good faith decide against Matthews upon the evidence presented before the court. The court made no such finding.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">We must therefore reverse and remand for further consideration to paragraph 1 of the relief granted by the court\u2019s judgment, <em>ante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">II. The Insurance Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b915-21\">Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the judgment <em>ante </em>must be vacated and the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>against Globe remanded for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The agreement that the laws of New York should control is contained in Article XVI of the Pension Plan and relates solely to that Plan. There does not appear to be any like agreement as to Globe\u2019s insurance policies. In the absence of some such agreement, the law of Alabama controls as to Globe\u2019s liability because the policies were delivered and were to be performed in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Articles III and VIII of Swift\u2019s Pension Plan do not appear to affect Globe\u2019s liability under its policies except insofar as the Pension Plan and the policies are interrelated by some provision in one or more of the insurance contracts. Otherwise the issues to be tried and decided by the court as between Matthews and Globe are like those in the usual case brought by an insured against his insurer, and are freed from the unusually heavy burden which Matthews must sustain before the court can decide that he is entitled to a disability pension from Swift.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Finally, the provisions of the several policies differ as to the definitions of total disability, of permanent disability, of the presumption of permanent disability from disability for particular periods of time, of the duration of the benefits on account of disability, and on various other matters. Each policy of insurance is a separate contract and Globe\u2019s liability should be tried and decided in accordance with the terms of its several contracts. The issues not having been so framed or decided, it is not appropriate at this time for us to enter upon any detailed review and construction of any of Globe\u2019s policies of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">In view of Rule 39(a), F.R.A.P., it is ordered that the cost of appeal be taxed one-half against defendants-appellants and one-half against plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Reversed in part, vacated in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">. The complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdG\">\u201cAs a result of the defendant Swift terminating plaintiff\u2019s employment rather than medically retiring him as it should have done, defendant, Globe, has reduced said group policy from the face amount of $15,000.00 to $812.31 of paid up life insurance.\u201d (App. 3.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-10\">.
