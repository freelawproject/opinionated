Accordingly, we reverse in part and affirm in part the District Court\u2019s declaratory order granting full recovery to the assureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><em>1. The Facts </em>\u2014 Line <em>Security That Wasn\u2019t There</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The facts, as they emerge from what turns out to be a virtually undisputed though less than luminous record, indicate the following occurrences. In July, 1968, Mayor\u2019s Jewelry Stores, through its president (Getz) and its vice president (Shore) obtained Jeweler\u2019s Block Insurance policies from St. Paul Insurance Company (St. Paul) for six of its wholly owned stores, including Mayor\u2019s Jewelers of Ft. Lauderdale (Ft. Lauder-dale), Mayor\u2019s Jewelers of Dadeland, Dadeland Mall (Dadeland Mall) and Mayor\u2019s Jewelers of Dadeland, Sunset Drive (Sunset). The policies carried primary insurance in the amount of $300,000 each, so far as the pertinent provision \u2014 Clause 2(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">In early 1969, Shore contacted St. Paul\u2019s general agent (Schuh) seeking to increase this coverage by $200,000 on the Ft. Lauderdale policy. Schuh told Shore that he would have to check with insurer's head underwriter (Washiek), whom he called immediately. Washiek told Schuh that he would not increase the coverage to a total of $500,000, but that he would increase coverage $100,000 to $400,000 if the assured had an anti-burglary device known as \u201cADT line security.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Schuh relayed this information to Shore who replied that he did not know whether or not this particular system had been installed in the Ft. Lau-derdale location, and that he would have to call ADT to find out.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Shore called ADT and was told that the Ft. Lauderdale store did have line security and had had it since its inception. Shore then called Schuh and told him that ADT had told him that Ft. Lauderdale had the system. Upon re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ceipt of this information Schuh told Shore on February 3, 1969, that Ft. Lauderdale had the $100,000 increase on 2(A) coverage. Schuh then called and wrote Washick that on Washick\u2019s advice he had bound the additional coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The binder was confirmed by St. Paul by Endorsement No. 9, issued February 6, 1969, with an effective date of February 3, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Sometime during the weekend of March 30, 1969, the Ft. Lauderdale store was burglarized with a loss of nearly $700,000 worth of merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Unhappily, the Ft. Lauderdale store did not have protection of an ADT line security system after all, as had been thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>II. No Misrepresentation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABz\">St. Paul\u2019s first contention is that it is entitled to cancel the increase in 2(A) coverage and avoid the additional liability ($100,000) because Shore\u2019s statements about the ADT line security system amounted to a material misrepresentation of fact, substantially affecting the risk of the insurer, on which the insurer had reasonably relied in extending coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The argument can be readily disposed of. Shore simply did not misrepresent anything. All Shore told Schuh was that he did not know whether or not Ft. Lauderdale had this particular protection and that he would have to find out from ADT.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Thereafter, Shore called ADT and then reported back to Schuh <em>that ADT had told him </em>that Ft. Lauderdale was protected with line security. This was the statement on which the insurer relied. It was the inquiry which the insurer called for, and the answer as to what ADT advised was faithfully reported to St. Paul. There was no misrepresentation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Therefore, since there was actually no misrepresentation of fact, F.S. 627.-01081<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> F.S.A., is not even involved even though it is conceded that the critical fact was material to the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">St. Paul\u2019s argument that Getz\u2019 February 3 letter to St. Paul, which was not received until days after the extended coverage had been bound, materially misled the insurer is likewise without merit. Statements made after coverage has been afforded are immaterial. World Insurance Company v. Posey, Fla.App., 1969, 227 So.2d 67; Aetna Insurance Company v. Kacharos, Ala.Sup. Ct., 1933, 226 Ala. 504, 147 So. 438. Coverage had been bound days before the Getz letter could have been received. This obvious fact renders unnecessary any discussion of whether reliance on the letter could have been reasonable, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>light of Washiek\u2019s admitted knowledge that some of the information conveyed to him was erroneous,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> since coverage had already been bound and Washick could not, therefore, have been relying on statements <em>subsequently </em>made. This also makes superfluous the District Court\u2019s further finding on the basis of expert testimony that the error should have put a reasonably prudent underwriter on notice that he should obtain further verification or make some further inquiry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">We therefore accept the District Court\u2019s conclusion that coverage was not induced by any misrepresentation which Florida would regard as defeating coverage. The increased coverage under 2(A) was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>III. Association</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The second part of the case relates to off-premises coverage under 2(B)(3), note 2, <em>supra, </em>which provided $250,000 coverage for loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cin respect of property which is * * * in the custody of a dealer in property of the kind insured hereunder not employed by or <em>associated with </em>the Insured * * (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Dadeland Mall and Sunset also sustained substantial losses as a result of the burglary at Ft. Lauderdale, since these stores had sent to Ft. Lauderdale approximately $200,000 worth of merchandise which Dadeland Mall and Sunset had received under \u201call risk memos\u201d from the manufacturers and wholesalers. Sunset and Dadeland Mall claimed coverage under Clause 2(B)(3)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of <em>their </em>policies (366 HA 6584 and 655 HA 6585 respectively).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">The controversy turns on whether or not Sunset and Dadeland Mall were \u201cassociated with\u201d Ft. Lauderdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">The District Court\u2019s finding that the stores were not associated was based on the fact that each of the six Mayor\u2019s Jewelry Stores are operated as separate entities for tax purposes. On the other hand, all six corporations are owned and controlled by the same interests (primarily President Getz) and it is undisputed that negotiations for all six insurance policies were carried on by Shore and Getz for all six stores at the same time. That included the three policies at issue. The central office, located at the Sunset premises, performed centralized accounting, purchasing, hiring, property leasing, master inventory, insurance and advertising functions for all stores. Only Getz, Shore and Getz\u2019 mother were authorized to draw checks on the bank accounts of any of the stores. The stores customarily exchanged and transferred large volumes of merchandise between each other on informal terms. Regardless of the tax setup, it is evident that, as a practical matter, the stores were operated like <em>one </em>enterprise with several branch outlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">In sum, we think that the record compels a finding of a community of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>terest, a confluence of activity, a cooperation of efforts and a concentration of control \u2014 both financial and managerial. There can be no doubt that such evidence establishes that the stores are undeniably closely connected and therefore \u201cassociated,\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy. The District Court\u2019s finding to the contrary is thus \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Nor will, estoppel carry the day for the assured. The District Court further found that, \u201csince obtaining its Jeweler\u2019s Block Policies from [St. Paul], the [jewelry stores] have conducted their business relying on the fact that they were not \u2018employed by or associated with\u2019 each other within the meaning of Clause 2(B)(3); such reliance was and always has been known to [St. Paul]; and [St. Paul] is now estopped to claim or contend the contrary.\u201d This holding simply cannot be supported by the record. The experts testified that the purpose of the \u201cassociated with\u201d exclusion is to enable the insurer to limit his risk exposure at any one location. Mayor\u2019s knew that St. Paul was unwilling to insure the Ft. Lauderdale location for more than $400,000. This limitation was made very clear to Mayor\u2019s and was acceptable to it. In a setting of six related branches each of which was covered under a separate policy the interpretation underlying the District Court\u2019s hypothesis would have meant that the Mayor enterprise would be covered up to $1,500,000 at each store on inter-store transfers, while paying premiums based on maximum risk exposure of $300,000 at each store. There is no basis to estop St. Paul from asserting that its precise limitation of risk was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The result is that granting 2(B)(3) coverage for the goods of Dadeland Mall and Sunset was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">IV. <em>A Tag End </em>\u2014 Attorney <em>Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">St. Paul also complains that the $68,000 award for attorney fees is excessive. In view of our substantial reversal, adjustment is required. Accordingly, on remand the District Court is directed to redetermine the allowance of attorney fees for the recovery allowed by this opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Affirmed in part;</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">Reversed in part;</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\">.

ADT line security is an electronic device which tells ADT when the other premises protective devices have been defeated. ADT has a central system which is supposed to sound an alarm if the jeweler\u2019s premises or safes are violated. If the apparently sophisticated thieves have ways around the usual ADT devices and defeat the central alarm system, the purpose of line security is to warn ADT that the central alarm system has somehow been deactivated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b413-19\">. ADT line security is not visible. The only way one could learn whether or not line security existed at a given location is to ask ADT, because not even a qualified engineer could tell by an inspection of the premises. Apparently, that is because the line security equipment is located in the alarm company\u2019s central station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\">. Thereafter, on February 3, 1969, Getz also wrote Washick stating that \u201cwe have definitely installed this system and it has been in operation for many months.\u201d This letter, however, could not have been received by St. Paul before February 3, 1969, the date on which the extended coverage was bound.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\">. In fact, Schuh himself had suggested that Shore seek to obtain the information from ADT. And Washick testified that he knew that the information would have to come from ADT since the system could not be detected from merely going to the store and looking about.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">.

I, therefore, dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that increased coverage under 2(A) of appellant\u2019s policy of insurance was valid in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">St. Paul\u2019s representatives made it clear to the insured that the additional $100,000 of coverage would only be bound \u201cproviding we had line security.\u201d (This, of course, referred to ADT Line Security at Fort Lauderdale and the quoted clause is excerpted from the testimony of Mr. Shore, the insured\u2019s representative. See App. 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">Whether Shore informed Schuh that ADT told him there was line security is not controlling when the Getz letter of February 3 is considered. The additional risk was orally bound on February 3 and the Getz letter was not received until February 4. However, the record shows that the Getz letter was required by the insurer as <em>verification and confirmation </em>of the fact of ADT Line Security at Fort Lauderdale. The letter unequivocally states that such security has \u201cdefinitely\u201d been installed at Fort Lau-derdale. Thereafter, on February 9, St. Paul\u2019s endorsement No. 9 increasing coverage by $100,000 was issued on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>strength of the representations in Getz\u2019 letter of February 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The Court\u2019s opinion erroneously concludes that the Getz letter of February 3 is of no consequence and must be disregarded in deciding this case since coverage had been orally committed prior to receipt of the letter. But the opinion ignores the fact that the letter was sent because it was required as verification and confirmation of the fact that line security had been installed in the Fort Lauderdale store and that oral binding of the risk was conditional on the insured furnishing such a letter with <em>definite </em>assurance that ADT was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">It is clear that the insured misrepresented a material fact that there was line security at Fort Lauderdale. Whether this was unintentional is of no moment since <em>fraudulent </em>misrepresentation is not required under Florida law to vitiate the contract. See Life Insurance Company of Virginia v. Shifflet, Fla. 1967, 201 So.2d 715.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
