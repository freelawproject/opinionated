The four appellants, with twelve others, were indicted on August 23rd, 1967, for their alleged participation in a concerted effort to raise by manipulation the price of the stock of Hercules Galion Corporation (Hercules), a company listed on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm all four judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">A. <em>Events Prior to Spring of 1965</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">In September of 1963 Projansky, Brainin, and Irving Taub, the sole officers and directors of Argus Capital Corporation (Argus), an investment and finance company located outside Chicago, embarked on a program to gain control of Hercules, a manufacturer of heavy trucks. Pursuant to this program, during 1963 and 1964, approximately 275,000 of the 927,000 shares of Hercules stock then outstanding were purchased by Projansky, Brainin, Taub, and their associates. These shares, representing working control of Hercules, were deposited at Argus. Thereafter Brainin, as sole voting trustee of the shares, exercised the control they represented to elect himself, Projansky, Taub, and Charles Meyers to Hercules\u2019 nine-man board of directors and to install Meyers as president of Hercules.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Despite the general upward trend of the stock market from 1963 to 1965, the price of Hercules fluctuated moderately on low volume until the promotion here under focus took hold. This relatively poor performance of Hercules disgruntled the shareholders. They believed that Hercules was a sound investment. Moreover, the firm was developing a garbage truck expected to become dominant in the garbage truck market and building a new plant expected to increase productivity. Finally, Brainin and Pro-jansky were interested in mergers and acquisitions, and if the price of Hercules stock were higher then the firm\u2019s bargaining power in any such negotiations would be enhanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">B. <em>June-July 1965: A Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">During the spring of 1965 Projansky discussed the prospects of Hercules with Arthur Keller, president of the First National Bank of Lincolnwood, Illinois (FNBL). Projansky was chairman of the board of the FNBL. Keller, in turn, discussed Hercules with Gerald Leavitt, an acquaintance and a customer of the bank. A graduate of the University of Illinois with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics, Leavitt had recently left a firm in the ladies\u2019 garment wholesaling business with which he had been for sixteen years and was studying to become an investment advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Thereafter in June of 1965 Leavitt brought his brother-in-law, Mark Rolland, to the FNBL for a meeting with Keller and Projansky. Rolland was a 50% partner in Investment Associates, a Chicago stock factoring firm (a firm that lent money for the purchase of stock, the loans collateralized by the stock bought). Projansky expressed his and the shareholders\u2019 interest in seeing the price of Hercules stock increase. Leavitt and Rolland responded by assuring Projansky and Keller that they could be of considerable assistance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">A. Well, yes, Mr. Leavitt stated that he had been taking an examination to become a security analyst, or some kind of security dealer, and that he anticipated giving up his present occupation, whatever that was, and going into the security business, and that he could be very helpful in getting people to take an active interest in the purchase of Hercules Galion stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Further, Mr. Rolland stated that he had a particular friend who single-handedly doubled the price of a particular stock. I don\u2019t think he mentioned the name at that time. And that he, with his friends, could do an excellent job in creating sponsorship and developing the activity and raising the price of Hercules Galion stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">[Rolland]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">A. I told Mr. Projansky that I had had experience along those lines, and that I had been involved with a stock or company called Pentron Electronics where I had raised the price of this stock considerably, doubled the price of this stock, and I thought I could be helpful to him if they should decide anything along those lines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Shortly thereafter the parties met again at the FNBL. Rolland and Leav-itt brought with them Spero Furia, a registered representative and a close friend of Rdlland\u2019s. Furia was the companion of Rolland that had assisted in raising the price of Pentron.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this second meeting Projansky again explained the reasons for his desire to see the price of Hercules increase, and stated that he would like to see it rise from its then level of around 6 to 12 or 13. Speaking for Leavitt and Furia, Rolland foresaw no difficulty in meeting this objective. In consideration for their services, the \u201cRolland group\u201d asked for options to buy Hercules stock at bargain prices. They preferred this form of payment over cash because they wanted their expected income to be taxed at capital gains rather than ordinary income rates. The meeting concluded with Projansky\u2019s admonition that any deal depended on the approval of his fellow directors Brainin and Taub.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">[Furia]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">The Witness: Mr. Projansky said that he wanted the price of the stock higher for the reason that it was only selling at book value at that time, which was around $6, they wanted to acquire other companies and make acquisitions and it wasn\u2019t very practical or feasible at the price that the stock was selling at at that particular time, and he wanted to know if we were able \u2014 capable of sponsoring the stock and making it go higher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-14\">Mr. Rolland and I said that we were able to do this, . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-15\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-16\">A. Well, after Mr. Rolland introduced Mr. Furia, Mr. Furia stated that Mr. Rolland had told him about the desire for sponsorship in Hercules Galion stock and that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>studying or making some charts of the stock and that he felt it would be a very simple task to develop sponsorship and get activity in Hercules Gal-ion stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">He also then told us that he, with a few associates, had doubled the price of a stock which I don\u2019t believe he mentioned at that time \u2014 he may have, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 from one-half to three, and from the description that he had of Hercules Gabon stock, that that was a much more difficult task.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">[Rolland]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">Mr. Furia then got into a general discussion as to the Pentron Electronics, and that we had a team of brokers throughout the United States that could help raise the price of the stock.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">C. <em>August-September 1965: The Deal Is Finalized</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The agreement between Projansky\u2019s group and Rolland\u2019s group was finalized in a series of three meetings in August and early September of 1965. On the one hand were Projansky, Brainin, Keller, and Taub, representing the Hercules interests, and on the other were Rolland, Furia, and Leavitt, representing the promoters. During the first meeting Brainin repeated what Projansky had said in the earlier meetings about the soundness of Hercules and the desire to see its stock price increase to enhance Hercules\u2019 merger position. Brainin stated that there were approximately one million shares outstanding, but that 30 to 35% of these shares were held dormant at Argus and voted as a block by him. After Rolland and Furia repeated their experience in stock promotion, they eventually proposed these specific terms of agreement: the right to buy 36,000 shares of Hercules stock for themselves and the brokers who would be working with them; financing for the purchase of these shares to be provided by loans from Argus (secured by the shares purchased, the borrower incurring no personal liability);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> five thousand dollars in expense money; the right to inspect Hercules\u2019 stock transfer records; and assurance that insiders would not sell while the promoters were leading Hercules up in price.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-17\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-18\">. . . he [Brainin] stated that he is exploring, or he has explored, the area of mergers and acquisitions and it would be very advantageous to him and all of us, and the group of investors, and the Hercules Gabon Corporation, if the stock were selling at like 12 instead of in the area of 6 and a fraction, and it would be very advantageous to have mergers at that figure, and if these gentlemen who are presumably knowledgeable in the area of advancing the prices of stock could advance it to a price of 12, and hold it there for six months, it would be a service in which he might be interested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-20\">[Rolland]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-21\">A. Mr. Brainin stated, \u201cIf we do make a loan to you, how are we to know whether you are going to really promote the stock? How are we to know if you are merely going to take this stock and then run the stock up and sell it and leave us without performing the job that we are paying you for?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-22\">I indicated to him that I was only interested in a long-term capital gain, and that that means I\u2019d have to be involved in the stock for a six-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>period of time and that should make him feel at ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">Then Mr. Rolland said, \u201cAs long as we are not getting any stock or anything right now, and we are ready to start this deal off, we will need $5,000 in cash to distribute to our co-brokers to show them good will and get them to work with us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">Q. Did you [Rolland] have a conversation with Mr. Furia and Mr. Leavitt at this time about how much stock you wanted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Q. Was there any agreement reached among the three as to how much stock you were going to ask for ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">A. We agreed that we would ask for 50,000 shares [initially] of stock to be purchased somewhere either below the market or very close to the market. It was also agreed upon that I would do most of the negotiations, and that whatever I agreed upon, that would be what the arrangements would be.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">At the second meeting, attended by the same parties, the Projansky group agreed to the terms proposed by the Rolland group. The option price of the 36,000 shares was set at $7.25, but the parties agreed to execute the loan only after the price of Hercules rose above $7.25. Timing the loan in this way would not subject Brainin to criticism for making a loan equal to 100% of the value of the collateral. Rolland did demand, however, immediate payment of the $5000 in order to induce other brokers to enter the promotion. Finally, the parties agreed that Keller would coordinate the initial purchases of 10,000 shares of Hercules by himself and others and would place the orders through Furia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\">Then Mr. Rolland said it would be advisable if \u2014 no, he then said \u201cWe ought to have a kickoff order of a substantial number of shares to really start this thing off,\u201d and again Mr. Projansky and I had a discussion about the kickoff, and I said I would kick it off if Dr. Weitz and Morris Childs would join in kicking it off with me, and he said they would, they would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-15\">Then Mr. Rolland said, \u201cI believe and I feel that all orders should be funneled through Mr. Furia, that he is with Blair &amp; Co.\u201d \u2014 I believe it was\u2014 \u201cand that he will execute some of the orders and pass on or ferret out orders to his co-brokers, whoever they may be,\u201d but to leave it to him to arrange the total purchase of which he would execute only a portion thereof.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ato\">In preparation for the kickoff, Pro-jansky and Keller informed Fred Weitz, a director of the FNBL, and Eva and Morris Childs, Projansky\u2019s sister and brother-in-law, of the plan to promote the stock of Hercules. In order to give some real punch to the kickoff, Weitz took out unsecured loans of $95,000 from the FNBL and gave the proceeds to Keller to purchase Hercules stock;. the Childs borrowed $150,000 from the FNBL, half of which was unsecured, for the same purpose. On the loan committee that approved the loans were Pro-jansky, chairman, and Keller, Weitz, and Taub.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">Further fuel .for the kickoff was provided during the third Argus meeting in early September of 1965. Rolland, Furia, and Leavitt signed notes backdated to August 26, 1965, for $261,000 in loans from Argus. The proceeds took the form of four checks, which the three promoters promptly endorsed over to the sellers of the 36,000 shares of stock purchased under the option term of the agreement. The sellers were Gary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Brainin, Brainin\u2019s son, and Albert Green, Brainin\u2019s long-time business associate. On September 13, 1965, the FNBL executed a $100,000 unsecured loan to Argus to help cover the loan made by Argus to the Rolland group.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Keller delivered the expense money of $5,000 to Rolland on September 9, 1965. The $5,000 was in the form of two checks, one for $2,000 from Weitz, the other for $3,000 from the Childs. On the reverse of the Weitz check was written \u201cFee for Arranging Financial Advice.\u201d On the reverse of the Childs check was written \u201cFee for Consultation.\u201d Rolland in turn issued two checks to Leavitt and Furia, each in the amount of $1,666. Leavitt in response \u201cbilled\u201d Rolland for services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">D. <em>The Promotion in Operation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Beginning in August and continuing into early October, 1965, Keller purchased approximately 20,000 shares for himself, Weitz, and the Childs, paying for the shares with the proceeds of unsecured loans obtained at the FNBL. The bulk of the orders were placed through Furia, who executed some himself and gave the rest to other brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Two other prominent participants during this period were Harris Nagorsky and Zafe Zafer, Chicago brokers recruited by Rolland and Furia. Both brokers were promised an option to purchase 4,000 shares of Hercules at $8.00 per share for every 25,000 shares they purchased for their customers and held for six months, as well as easy loans at the FNBL. During the last months of 1965, Nagorsky and Zafer purchased 29,-000 and 19,500 shares of Hercules, respectively, for their customers. These purchases, together with 26,000 shares purchased by Furia for his customers and the purchases of other co-conspirators, represented 43% of all the Hercules shares traded on the AMEX during this period. The buying program conducted by the brokers was carefully planned and executed to produce the illusion of real and sustained interest in Hercules stock.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">A. At the beginning, Mr. Zafer and Mr. Nagorsky and I [Furia] and Mr. Rolland would get together and discuss who would in the morning open the stock and who would place orders in the afternoon and who would place orders towards the close of the market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">And we also had phone conversations during the day timing certain orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">The Witness: Well, Saturday mornings it was referred to as brokers\u2019 day because quite a few brokers would come to the bank, including Mr. Zafer, Mr. Nagorsky, myself [Furia], once in a while Mr. Bernstein, and others that I didn\u2019t know, and we would assemble towards the back end of the bank close to where Mr. Keller\u2019s desk is and then we would eventually get into the board room where there is a big desk in there and we would have short meetings or discuss our problems there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">Q. Do you [Nagorsky] recall what you and Mr. Zafer would discuss during these telephone conversations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">A. Well, we would talk about Hercules Gabon. We would discuss the opening of the market, the closing of the market, who would do the opening let\u2019s say, the opening for the following day or who would handle the closing for that particular day. We would discuss the market in sizes, how much stock was being offered, at what time of the day. I might call him to use his house to get a market or size, because maybe I was using mine too much. He would call me possibly to do the same, because he didn\u2019t want to use his wire any more that time also. We would discuss the sellers in the stock, where the selling was coming from. We would discuss the painting of the tape, in other words, how to break up orders, and if we got a large order how to handle it, whether to put it in a block or whether to put it in pieces, whether to space it out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>timewise. Mr. Zafer and. I would time our orders so as to try to get them in together, let\u2019s say, to take a block of stock that was being offered out of the market. We would have conversations concerning the closing, whether to put it in as a market order or whether to put it in as a fixed price order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Leavitt also participated in the efforts to enlist brokers who would buy Hercules stock for their customers. In late September of 1965 he assured Rolland and Furia that he was working diligently toward this end and claimed to have been successful in interesting brokers other than those recruited by Rolland and Furia. During September he recommended and purchased 11,300 shares of Hercules for himself and customers of the. brokerage firm at which he worked. These purchases constituted almost 10% of all Hercules shares traded on the AMEX during September. Duiv ing this period Leavitt also tried to interest his superior at the brokerage firm where he worked in Hercules, but the superior instructed Leavitt to cease recommending Hercules to customers and to have nothing further to do with the promotion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In October of 1965 Rolland and Furia brought George Georges, a speculator in stocks and real estate, into the promotion. After being introduced to Pro-jansky, Georges was given an $80,000 loan at the FNBL, $54,000 of which was unsecured. Georges claimed an ability to tap New York buying power, and in late November and early December, enlisted three New York brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The efforts of the promoters of Hercules were successful. From a level of 6% at the end of July (on volume of 15,-800 shares), Hercules jumped to 8% at the end of August (on volume of 38,-900 shares), and to 10% at the end of September (on volume of 123,400 shares). However, at the end of October the price had fallen back to 9% (on volume of 32,800 shares), and by the end of November to 9% (on volume of 28,000 shares).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">E. <em>In the Manner of Sisyphus</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asl\">A predictable futility increasingly characterized the promoters\u2019 efforts. While some diligently worked to increase the price of Hercules, others undercut their efforts by selling as the rewards for doing so increased. The promoters themselves were not beyond such treachery when the occasion presented itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">That they were being betrayed was a continual source of exasperation to the promoters. From the very beginning Rolland had feared that insiders at Argus or Hercules would thwart the success of any promotion effort and had sought to insure against the occurrence of such sales by insisting on the right to inspect Hercules\u2019 stock transfer list and by obtaining vows from the insiders that they would not undercut the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Yet, as the October and November figures of Hercules\u2019 price indicate, all was not right with the promotion. Someone was selling while the brokers were busy buying. Their concern over this development was so great that they followed Keller into the hospital with their complaints. Keller, on October 3, 1965, had suffered a serious heart attack.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">A. Mr. Rolland told me that Hercules Gabon is slipping because Projansky and Brainin\u2019s group are selling stock, and they can\u2019t keep supporting the market if the inventors are selling stock into them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">I said, \u201cWhat do you expect me to do here, just let me alone and go and tell Mr. Projansky and tell Dr. Weitz but don\u2019t tell me, there is nothing I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>can do about it,\u201d and that was the end of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">They came a second time a few days thereafter, and gave me the same conversation, and I told them that \u201cYou will have to go and see Irving Pro-jansky or Dr. Weitz, there is nothing I can do or want to do, and please don\u2019t come back any more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">The Witness: On this occasion, they [Rolland and Furia] stated that you fellows are selling directly \u2014 Irving Projansky and Dr. Weitz \u2014 \u201cYou fellows are selling stock into us and we can\u2019t keep the price.\u201d Irving Pro-jansky told them, \u201cWe are not selling stock into you and you fellows aren\u2019t doing your job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">Then I interjected, \u201cCarry this on elsewhere and let me alone.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">However, a few of the sellers were rooted out. Late in 1965 Rolland and Furia discovered from their inspection of Hercules\u2019 stock transfer list, that the chairman of the board of Hercules, Mr. Van Alstyne, was selling Hercules stock. They complained to Brainin, who phoned Van Alstyne (who was unaware of the promotion) and informed him that his sales were counter-productive. On another occasion, Rolland and Furia discovered that Arthur Dickholtz, a director of the FNBL, was selling substantial quantities of Hercules stock held at Argus. Rolland personally spoke to Dickholtz about his selling; as a result, Rolland obtained an option on 6,500 shares of Dickholtz\u2019 stock at $8.00 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">In December there were a series of meetings between Projansky, Keller, and the active brokers (excluding Leavitt). All sides grew increasingly suspicious of the motives and abilities of their comrades.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">A. George [Georges] stated that I [Rolland] had not been truthful with all the brokers that are involved in the promotion. He said that the most deceitful had been Spero Furia because he had not disclosed that he had an option on a block of stock.

While Georges had been vying for the leadership of the promotion with Rolland and Furia, at a meeting at the Covenant Club in Chicago in mid-January of 1966, Kozak, with promises of New York contacts, displaced Georges and became one of the leaders of the promotion with Rolland and Furia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">Q. Can you [Kozak] tell us what happened at the Covenant Club meeting, . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">A. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">Zafe Zafer was having a big argument with Mark Rolland and Spero Furia. He first was complaining about how they had taken him in in Pentron Electronics in 1964 and never paid him. Then he started screaming something in Greek to Mr. Furia that I didn\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">The Court: How do you know it was Greek? It was Greek to you, anyway ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">The Witness: It was Greek to me. They always talked Greek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-14\">A. Mr. Zafer was trying to get George to remain in the picture and to get Mr. Rolland and Mr. Furia out of the picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">He came there as the spokesman for George Georges. There was a bitter argument between Mr. Zafer, Mr. Furia and Mr. Rolland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">Mr. Keller said he was going to have to live without George Georges and that everything will go on as usual, starting the following day, . . .<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">Kozak\u2019s principal contact in New York was the broker Michael Geier. On February 5, 1966, Kozak, Rolland, and Furia met with Geier at the International Hotel at JFK Airport in New York.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-18\">[Rolland]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">A. Buddy Kozak said to Mr. Geier that he had a nice little stock that he wanted to promote. He said the people behind it control the Hercules Gal-ion Company and also the First National Bank of Lincolnwood. He mentioned Mr. Projansky, Mr. Brainin, Mr. Taub.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-20\">He asked Mr. Geier if he had ever heard of them. Mr. Geier was not familiar with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-21\">He asked, he stated, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-22\">A. Mr. Kozak stated to Mr. Geier, \u201cWhat do you think you could do with the situation where there is a total of a million shares outstanding and a free float of stock of about a quarter of a million shares ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-23\">Mr. Geier stated an issue that small he could garble [sic] up himself, there would be no problem at all putting the stock up to $16 a share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-24\">Buddy Kozak said, \u201cIf you are able to do that I can offer you an option on about 15,000 shares of stock at $8 a share. When the stock reaches 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>we will sell it and pay you the balance in cash, the difference between the 8 and the 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">Geier said, \u201cI am not interested in stock or options, I am only interested in cash.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Bud Kozak says, \u201cThat being the case we can arrange so that it is all in cash. However, you will still have to make a cross of the stock at $15 a share.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">Mike Geier says, \u201cOne other thing. When the stock gets up to about 13 I would want advance payment of about $25,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">Bud Kozak says, \u201cI think I can arrange it.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The following Monday Geier phoned Kozak and told him that his partner had agreed to the arrangements and that they were immediately proceeding in execution of their agreement. Geier quickly rounded up a team of New York brokers. Their implementation of the promotion was as methodical as that of their Chicago brethren. So ' successful was Geier that by Wednesday, February 8th, Hercules hit 13 (on volume of 20,-900 shares). He telephoned Kozak to inform him that he was coming to Chicago to pick up his $25,000. But, unfortunately, while Geier was in the air on his way Hercules closed below 13. Kozak and Keller, however, agreed to pay Geier $12,500 as a show of their faith in him. When confronted with the news of Hercules\u2019 close, Geier became furious; he phoned his partner in New York and both bitterly complained to Kozak and Rolland about the selling that had obviously taken place. Nevertheless, Geier affirmed that the deal was still on, and returned to New York to redouble his efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">On February 10, 1966, Hercules opened on a block of 10,000 shares at 13%; it closed at 14%, an all-time high. During a phone conversation Kozak told Geier that he would shortly fly to New York with the balance of the $25,000. After obtaining the money from Stuart Projansky at the FNBL, Kozak flew to New York and met Geier and Peltz at the airport. Ko-zak handed the money to Peltz, who said, \u201cGive it to the kid.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The kid (Geier) then left for the race track.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">G. <em>The Fourth and Final Quarter</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">Geier worked arduously through the first half of March on the Hercules promotion. During this period, for example, from January 28th to March 31st, Geier spoke to Kozak some 655 times coordinating the promotion. But by this time the effort to shore up Hercules became increasingly futile. The treacherous selling mounted. Keller, who was forced to return to the hospital in mid-February because of a gall bladder infection, once again became an involuntary audience for complaining participants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-18\">[Keller]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-19\">A. Mr. Kozak and Mr. Rolland, particularly, were complaining again that the investment group was selling into them, that they are absorbing a lot of stock from the investment group, and the investment group has to stop selling into them. So I said that there is nothing that really I can do, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you talk to Dr. Weitz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>about it, Dr. Weitz is here, and he is available to talk to, you can talk to Mr. Projansky, I don\u2019t see any reason for coming here talking to me. From now on talk to Dr. Weitz or Mr. Pro-jansky about whatever your problems are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">A. . Dr. Weitz, Irving Pro-jansky, and Mr. Kozak came to my room, and Mr. Kozak said that he had sold 3500 shares of Hercules Galion to a customer of his, and the customer had reneged on the purchase, he had no way of canceling the purchase, somebody is going to have to eat this purchase, and I asked again, \u201cWhy do you have to come here to tell this to me? I am not interested in it.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">But Keller himself had directed Kozak in early February to sell for him and Dr. Weitz some 12,000 shares of Hercules at the market. Kozak agreed for a \u201cfee\u201d of fifty cents a share.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">After one meeting at the hospital Kozak, Rolland, and Furia met and decided the time had arrived to salvage something for themselves from the promotion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">[Kozak]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">A. . . . After a meeting at the hospital, Mr. Rolland, Mr. Furia and myself went for a sandwich, and we had a conversation about how we were being suckered in and bagged in Hercules Galion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">I said to Mr. Furia and Mr. Rolland that we will never be able to exercise our option on the stock, the difference of the stock we had promised Mr. Geier and Mr. Peltz the additional 6,000 shares, because there was just no possible way the stock could go to $16 with all the selling in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">So I said to them, \u201cLet\u2019s try to get some money out of this thing, and then just play it by ear the rest of the way.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">The salvage operation consisted of falsely telling Projansky that they, Rolland, Furia, and Kozak, needed an additional $50,000 to pay the New York group. Projansky assented to the request; he raised the money by selling 4,500 shares of Hercules stock that he owned jointly with Taub and a friend. The amount actually given to the three was $47,000, in small bills. The three took the money to Furla\u2019s home where they divided it equally among themselves. That same day, Rolland paid Nagorsky $5,500 for his efforts in the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">The crushing blow that dashed all hopes for the promotion\u2019s revival came on March 7, 1966. The volatile Georges got into a heated argument with Geier and as a result placed an order to sell all of his 8,000 shares of Hercules at the market.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">[Kozak]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">A. Mr. Georges was in my office on March 7 or March 8, 1966, and he was having a phone conversation with a Mr. Michael Geier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">The Witness: I heard Mr. Georges yelling at somebody on the phone and threatening that if there was not some buying being made in a stock called Amico \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-20\">\u2014that he would, in turn, sell out his complete position of Hercules Galion. Mr. Georges kept yelling on the phone and then finally handed me the phone, picked up another phone and called up Mr. Zafe Zafer and told him to sell 8000 shares of Hercules Galion stock at the market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-21\">I said to Mr. Geier that Georges is going crazy, he is selling out the stock, he is going to break the market. Mr. Geier said to me, \u201cTry and stop him.\u201d Mr. Peltz said to me, who was on an extension, \u201cTry and stop him.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The sale precipitated such a drop in Hercules that trading in the stock was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">One final meeting was held, arranged by Geier, at the International Hotel at JFK on Sunday, March 13, 1966. It was attended by about 20 brokers, including Rolland and Kozak from Chicago. At the meeting Geier asked everyone to coordinate their buying. A poll was taken to determine the number of shares controlled by the brokers present. The total came to two-thirds of the Hercules stock outstanding, an obvious impossibility. For example, Geier and Peltz themselves claimed to have purchased 170,000 shares when in fact they had bought only 41,900 shares. Having failed to revive the team spirit, the team disbanded. None of the attendants purchased any Hercules thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II. Proffered Grounds For Reversal</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">A. <em>Sufficiency and Scope of the Conspiracy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Brainin, Leavitt, and Geier contend that the evidence is insufficient to link them with the conspiracy to raise the price of Hercules stock. The contention is baseless. The evidence of the appellants\u2019 partnership in the agreement to promote the price of Hercules is overwhelming. Their contentions are variously based on the mistaken premise that conspirators cannot be convicted in federal courts on the basis of the testimony of accomplices <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or that one conspirator must know all other conspirators and their acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in order to be charged as a member of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-19\">Appellants\u2019 contention that the evidence showed three conspiracies rather than one is likewise without merit. The evidence is clear that the appellants were each engaged in a scheme to raise the price of Hercules by manipulation and to hold the stock at the artificially raised price for a period of six months. From the spring 1965 meetings to the final attempt to rescue the promotion at the International Hotel at JFK, the promoters were committed to a common goal and their acts were all in furtherance of this common goal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">B. <em>Objections to the Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\"> Appellants marshal a battery of objections to Judge Lasker\u2019s charge to the jury. We consider only those to which a proper objection was made.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>First, appellants complain of Judge Lasker\u2019s reference to the \u201cunwarranted\u201d hopes for leniency in sentencing of those defendants who testified for the government at the trial.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Their argument is that this purported misstatement undermined the defense theory that the cooperating witnesses were selling out the defendants in the hope of reduced sentences on their pleas of guilty. The argument is without substance. The charge read in context clearly informed the members of the jury that <em>they </em>were to assess the credibility of the witnesses and that in so assessing <em>they </em>should evaluate the weight to be given to the defendants\u2019 contention concerning the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Appellants further object to the court\u2019s charge on the weight to be given to an admitted perjurer\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Keller admitted at trial that he had committed perjury before the grand jury. The court instructed the jury in reference to this admission that whether his testimony <em>at trial </em>was credible was solely their decision. Moreover, the court charged the jury that it should examine an accomplice\u2019s testimony with care.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not find any error in this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Finally, appellants invite us to overrule a phalanx of cases in this circuit holding that once a judge determines that the government has proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence the defendant\u2019s participation in a conspiracy independent of hearsay utterances of co-conspirators, the jury may consider <em>all </em>evidence in determining whether the defendant participated in the conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The basis for this invitation is the contention that the principle of <em>Bruton</em><footnotemark>27</footnotemark> requires that the jury determine a defendant\u2019s participation in a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt before it consider the hearsay declarations of co-conspirators linking the defendant to the conspiracy.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>We fail to perceive how <em>Bruton </em>affects the <em>Dennis </em>rule allocating between judge and jury the initial determination of whether a defendant is a member of the conspiracy for purposes of permitting the declarations of co-conspirators to be considered by the jury in assessing the defendant\u2019s guilt. To agree with the appellants would be to nullify the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, a result we do not think was intended in <em>Bruton.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We therefore decline the appellants\u2019 invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">C. <em>Objection to the Failure to Sever</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"> Leavitt and Geier contend that their prosecutions should have been severed from the prosecutions of the other defendants. Whether to grant such a motion is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Given that the evidence (1) clearly supports the charge of one conspiracy, and (2) that Leavitt and Geier were members of this conspiracy, the contention that the trial judge abused his discretion in failing to sever fails a fortiori.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">D. <em>Alleged Errors in the Prosecutor's Summation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">Appellant Leavitt objects to portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation. Specifically, he objects to the prosecutor\u2019s argument inferring from the testimony that when Leavitt met with Projansky and Keller during the spring of 1965 Leavitt told them that his brother-in-law, Rolland, could help them raise the price of Hercules stock.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even if improper, we fail to see how this inference of the prosecutor\u2019s constitutes prejudicial error. The evidence of Leavitt\u2019s participation in the conspiracy is substantial and, given that the test of such errors is whether their commission denied the defendant a fair trial,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the supposed improper inference constitutes at worst a harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">Leavitt also complains about the prosecutor\u2019s affixing the date of Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ber 9th to the third Argus meeting, rather than September 1st, which latter date Leavitt claims his counsel and the prosecutor had agreed to throughout the trial. We again fail to see the prejudice flowing from this alleged breach of agreement by the prosecution: the evidence is substantial that Leavitt joined and acted in furtherance of the conspiracy before and after September 9th and/or September 1st.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">E. <em>The Lower Court\u2019s Refusal to Grant A Motion For Change of Venue</em></p>\n<p id=\"AW2\">Appellants complain of two judges\u2019 failure to grant their motions made before and at the beginning of the trial for a change of venue to Chicago. The motion was first denied by Judge Frankel, but without prejudice to renew should events so warrant before trial. The motion was renewed before Judge Lasker. He carefully considered the motion and concluded that the events that had transpired between the time of the motion before Judge Frankel and the time of the motion before him did not warrant a different response.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">Lower court judges have wide discretion in disposing of change of venue motions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If the court applies the proper criteria the exercise of that discretion is rarely disturbed on appeal. In denying the motion Judge Lasker explicitly applied the nine criteria approved for testing change of venue motions in <em>Platt.</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We perceive no abuse of discretion in his application of these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">F. <em>Judge Lasker\u2019s Ruling on Peremptory Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">Before trial the defendants made various motions. During this session Judge Lasker informed counsel present that he had decided to grant the defendants 16 peremptory challenges and the government 8.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> One of the defendants\u2019 coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sel responded shortly thereafter as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">Mr. Londin: With respect to your Honor\u2019s ruling as to peremptory challenges, of course there is a valid reason for the defendants requesting and receiving additional peremptories above and beyond what the statute requires. There are eight defendants on trial and sixteen peremptories comes out to two peremptories per defendant. The converse of that as to the government, I don\u2019t say it applies at all. There is no valid reason for the government to require or to obtain additional challenges. They are still one party plaintiff to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">The Court: I haven\u2019t given them very many more, Mr. Londin. Two more. There is logic to what you are saying, but I think in the choice \u2014 I don\u2019t think that the only issue here is the actual number of defendants. I think it is an important case and that it is reasonable that where so many challenges are exercised on one side, a recognition be given to some extent as far as the other side is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">Mr. Londin: I did wish to point out that the government alleges a community of interest among the defendants. The defendants, by their plea of not guilty, have denied that. I think it is appropriate for us to have obtained additional peremptories, but as far as the government is concerned and for the record I would respectfully except to the government\u2019s obtaining additional peremptories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">The Court: I think our bigger problem will be finding jurors to last as long as they need to.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Appellants now claim that the grant to the government violated Rule 24(b) of the Criminal Rules, and that, while prejudice cannot be shown, their convictions must be reversed if the Rule is not to be nullified. Rule 24(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">. If the offense charged is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, the government is entitled to 6 peremptory challenges and the defendant or defendants jointly to 10 peremptory challenges. ... If there is more than one defendant, the court may allow the defendants additional peremptory challenges and permit them to be exercised separately or jointly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">We do not consider the merits of appellants\u2019 contention because the issue was not presented to the court below so as to preserve the question for review here.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> While defendants did note their objection to the grant by Judge Lasker of eight peremptories to the government, they did not urge upon the court the ground that they forcefully argue here, namely, that Rule 24(b) simply does not grant to district court judges the same discretion in permitting extra peremptories to the government as it does in permitting extra peremptories to defendants. Our reading of the relevant portion of the transcript convinces us that Judge Lasker was not made aware of the ground for the defendants\u2019 objection that is now urged on appeal. The thrust of the defendants\u2019 objection below was that whereas there were several defendants there was only one plaintiff, the government, and therefore the reason for granting extra peremptories to the defense did not exist for granting extra peremptories to the prosecution. No mention was made of the argument that Rule 24(b) grants no discretion to a district court to give the government extra peremptories. Because of this, and concluding that in the absence of a show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ing of prejudice the claimed error does not affect \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> we decline to decide the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We have considered all other grounds for reversal urged upon us and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-13\">. The indictment was brought in fourteen counts. Count one charged the sixteen defendants and six conspirators not named as defendants with conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1970)) ; the substantive offenses were alleged to be violations of sections 17(a) and 24 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q(a), 77x (1970), sections 9(a) (2) and 32(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78i(a) (2), 78ff(a) (1970), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343 (1970) (mail fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"AY3\">The sixteen defendants charged were the four appellants, Arthur Keller, Stuart Projansky (Irving\u2019s son), Fred Weitz, Mark Rolland, Spero Furia, Murray Peltz, Burton Buddy Kozak, Harris Na-gorsky, Herbert Werinan, Edward Wet-zel, Zafe Zafer, and David Zisfein. Named as co-conspirators but not as defendants were Morris and Eva Childs, George Georges, Irving Taub, the First National Bank of Lincolnwood, and Argus Capital Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac-\">Count two charged Projansky, Brainin, Leavitt, and others with violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>sections 9(a) (2) and 32(a) of the 1934 Act and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1970) for the period of August 23, 1985 to September 15, 1965. Count three charged Projansky and others with the same violations for the period of November 30, 1965 to December 9, 1965. Count four charged Projansky, Geier, and others with the same violations for the period of February 4, 1966 to February 16, 1966. Counts five through fourteen charged Projansky, Geier, and others with violations of sections 17(a) and 24 of the 1933 Act and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 for the period of July, 1965 to the date of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"AgH\">Eight of the defendants entered pleas of guilty to one or more counts of the indictment prior to trial. Several of them testified for the government at trial. Counts 7, 11, and 14 were dismissed as to all defendants at the close of the government\u2019s case. On June 5, 1971, the jury found Irving Projansky, Brainin, and Leavitt guilty on counts one and two, Geier guilty on counts 1, A-6, 8-10, and 12-13, Zafer guilty on counts one and three, and Peltz and Stuart Projan-sky not guilty on all counts. A mistrial was declared on June 7, 1971, as to Weitz when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the counts against him. Judge Lasker sentenced Projansky to one year in jail, Brainin to 3 months in jail and a fine of $20,000, Geier to 6 months in jail, Zafer to 4 months in jail, and Leavitt to a $20,000 fine. Zafer filed a notice of appeal but withdrew it on February 16, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">.

The present ratio of Chicago to New York defendants is not sufficient to grant the motion and is no different from what it apparently was at the time of Judge Frankel\u2019s decision, in spite of his statement that the number of defendants was then evenly divided between the two cities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">(2) The witnesses appear to be evenly divided between the two cities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-18\">(3) The events in issue were well distributed between Chicago and New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-19\">(4) The documents and records likely to be involved, although possibly evenly divided between the cities in the past, have now been largely collected and located in New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-20\">(5) The business of a Chicagoan standing trial in New York will undoubtedly be disturbed to some extent if trial occurs in New York, but this would be equally true of New York defendants in the event of a Chicago trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-21\">(6) Chicago defendants will undoubtedly incur expense by being required to be present in New York, as would New York defendants if required to be present in Chicago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-22\">(7) By far the greater number of counsel on both sides are located in New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-23\">(8) Both forums are equally accessible as a place for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-24\">(9) The docket conditions in both courts are substantially equivalent, but in any event the case lias already been scheduled for trial in the Southern District of New York to commence the first week of January, 1970.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b233-25\">. The Court: Gentlemen, before I am overwhelmed by your motions and forget what I wanted to tell you myself, I would like to make a few announcements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aot\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>I have determined as far as jury challenges are concerned, there will be 16 challenges for the defendants and 8 for the government on the regular1 jurors, and as to the alternates \u2014 and I propose to pick six alternates because we have accommodations for them and a long case \u2014 6 challenges for the defendants and 3 for the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMZB\">Transcript at 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b234-16\">. <em>Id. </em>at 54^55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b234-17\">.
