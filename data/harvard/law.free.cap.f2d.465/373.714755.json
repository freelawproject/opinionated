Appellant has been before the same judge five times seeking post-conviction relief. The procedure used in the district is governed by its Local Rule 6, the pertinent part of which is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">There is no merit to appellant\u2019s contention. As the District Court observed, \u201cIn these days of crowded dockets, judicial economy compels the use of any knowledge of the facts or other expertise which a judge may have acquired in his prior contacts with a litigant.\u201d The promulgation of Local Rule 6 is a proper exercise of the local rule-making authority of district courts, and conforms with the legislative mandates relative to post-conviction remedies, such as the requirement in Section 2255 cases that the petitioner\u2019s motion be made to the court which imposed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\">. <em>B. Post-Conviction Relief, Criminal. </em>Whenever a second or subsequent action seeking post-conviction or other relief by petition for writ of habeas corpus is filed by the same applicant involving the same offense, the 'action shall be transferred to the judge to whom the original proceeding was assigned. All motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 shall be assigned to the judge to whom the original criminal proceeding was assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\"><em>C. Similar. </em>Whenever an action or proceeding is filed in this Court which involves subject matter which is a material part of the subject matter of another action or proceeding then pending before this Court, or for other reasons the disposition thereof would appear to entail unnecessary duplication of judicial labor if heard by a different judge, the judges involved shall determine whether the newly filed action or proceeding should be transferred to the judge to whom the low numbered action or proceeding is assigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
