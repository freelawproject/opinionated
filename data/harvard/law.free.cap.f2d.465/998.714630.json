The hearing examiner concluded that Jackson had not shown that he was under a disability, as defined in the Act, on or before the expiration of his eligibility, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423. Upon review, the district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-24\">There was substantial evidence upon which the hearing examiner could and did find that Jackson was not suffering a disability prior to the end of his eligibility period. That is the end of the matter. <em>See </em>Harmon v. Finch, 9 Cir., 1972, 460 F.2d 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
