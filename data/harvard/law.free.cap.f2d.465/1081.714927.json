Potlatch brought this suit to have the Arkansas statute declared invalid and to have its enforcement enjoined because of the effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The District Court dismissed Potlatch\u2019s complaint. Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Hays, 318 F.Supp. 1368 (E.D.Ark.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">We agree with the District Court that Congress expressly disclaimed any general preemptive intent in enacting Title VII, and that the Arkansas statute can be held invalid only if it is in conflict with the Civil Rights Act. See, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-7 and 2000h-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">Insofar as the Arkansas statute results in discrimination against men,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we also agree with the trial court that conflict with Title VII can be avoided by requiring Potlatch to pay its male employees the same premium overtime rate which it is compelled to pay its female employees. As the trial court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-12\">\u201cDiscrimination with respect to pay between two classes of employees can be eliminated in either one of two ways. One class can be paid more or the other class can be paid less. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-14\">\u201cAs far as Act 191 of 1915 [Ark. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 81-601] is concerned, an employer can comply with it and with the Civil Rights Act by paying daily overtime to both men and women, -* * * The Arkansas statute does not say that women must be paid more than men; it simply says that they must be paid daily overtime without making a similar requirement as to men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-16\">\u201cWhile Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was not passed to raise wages generally, it certainly does not \u2018impede\u2019 or \u2018frustrate\u2019 the purpose of the Act to require an Arkansas employer to eliminate discrimination by paying its male employees more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>it would pay them ordinarily in order to equalize their pay with that of women.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Hays, 318 F.Supp. at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">In the present case, Potlatch insists that it has been paying its male employees, as well as its female employees, the same premium overtime rate. Furthermore, Potlatch has conceded that the anti-sex discrimination provisions of Title VII will compel it to continue doing so if we uphold, as we do, the validity of the Arkansas statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">There is ample support for the position that any discrimination against men resulting from the Arkansas statute is to be cured by extending the benefits of that statute to male employees rather than holding it invalid. As the District Court pointed out, this position is in accord with the express policies of the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, Shultz v. American Can Company-Dixie Products, 424 F.2d 356, 359 (8th Cir. 1970); Murphy v. Miller Brewing Company, 307 F.Supp. 829, 836-837 (E.D.Wis.1969); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 800.60 and 800.61 (1972); L. Kanowitz, Woman and the Law, 121, 147. (1969); 7 A.L.R. Fed. 707, 713, 751-753 (1971). While the Equal Pay Act is not as far reaching as Title VII, it is of considerable help in interpreting the latter act. See, Ammons v. Zia Company, 448 F.2d 117 (10th Cir. 1971); Hodgson v. Brookhaven General Hospital, 436 F.2d 719 (5th Cir. 1970); Shultz v. Wheaton Glass Company, 421 F.2d 259, 266 (3rd Cir. 1970); Kanowitz, <em>supra </em>at 133; 7 A.L.R. Fed. 707, 713 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-16\">Before the trial court, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (E.E.O.C.), appearing as amicus curiae, also took the position that the benefits of the Arkansas statute should be extended to male employees. Subsequently, the E.E.O.C. has formalized its position in its current regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>ministrative interpretation of the Act by the E.E.O.C. is entitled to great deference. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 433-434, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Company, 444 F.2d 1219, 1227 (9th Cir. 1971). In addition, the position of the E.E.O.C. finds support in recent scholarship. Kanowitz, <em>supra </em>at 120-124, 189; Developments in the Law, Employment Discrimination and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 84 Harv.L.Rev. 1109, 1188-1190 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">In arguing that the Arkansas statute must be declared invalid, Pot-latch relies on the decisions of several federal courts which have invalidated state protective statutes, regulating the number of hours women could work or the number of pounds they could lift, or prohibiting their employment in specified occupations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The invalidated statutes differ from the Arkansas statute because their effect is to prohibit the employment of all members of one sex, in certain occupations. Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Hays, <em>supra, </em>318 F.Supp. at 1373, 1375. It would place an unreasonable burden upon employers to require them to extend the \u201cbenefits\u201d of such protective laws to both sexes. <em>Cf., </em>Local 189, United Papermak. &amp; Paperwork., A.F.L.-C.I.O., CLC v. United States, 416 F.2d 980, 989 (5th Cir. 1969). See, Developments in the law, <em>supra </em>at 1186-1195; Brown, et al, The Equal Rights Amendment: A Constitutional Basis for Equal Rights for Women, 80 Yale L.J. 872, 934-936 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">In this case, no such unreasonable burdens are imposed by extending the benefits of the Arkansas statute to male employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-12\">\u201cThe financial burden thus placed upon Potlatch may seem onerous, but federal labor legislation enacted over the last thirty odd years has placed many onerous burdens on employers. It is open to Arkansas employers generally to seek repeal of Act 191 of 1915. It is open to Potlatch as an individual employer to rearrange its working schedules so that nobody works more than eight hours a day until all employees have worked their first forty hours in a workweek.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"adu-dedup-0\">Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Hays, <em>supra, </em>318 F.Supp. at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1175-16\">. Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 81-601. This case was previously remanded to the trial court for further consideration in light of Section 13 of Act 25 of the First Extraordinary Session of the Arkansas Legislature, 1968, and other related statutes. Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Arthur H. Hayes, Commissioner of Labor, No. 20,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>654 (8th Cir. May 7, 1971) (unpublished order). The trial judge held that (1) Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 81-601 was not repealed by Act 25 of 1968, (2) \u00a7 81-601 can be enforced through civil proceedings under Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 81-612, and reiterated that (3) \u00a7 81-601 was valid. Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Hays, 3 E.P.D. \u00b6 8297 (E.D.Ark.1971). None of the parties have contested holdings (1) and (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-9\">\u201c(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-10\">\u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZS\">\u201c(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1176-17\">. Potlatch contends, for the first time before this Court, that Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 81-601 is intended to limit the hours women can work, thus discouraging their employment and discriminating against them. See, Angela Rivera, et al. v. Division of Industrial Welfare of State of California, 1 CCH-EPD \u00b6 9876 (Cal.Ct.App.1968). See generally, L. KANOWITZ, WOMEN AND THE DAW, 125 (1969). We decline to consider this issue because no evidence with respect to whether the Arkansas statute results in discrimination against women was offered at trial. Moreover, the trial court made no findings in this regard. Attached to Potlatch\u2019s brief on appeal is a letter from the Arkansas Department of Dabor which states that the purpose of the statute is to limit overtime hours for women. See, Potlatch Forests, Inc. v. Hays, 318 F.Supp. 1368 (E.D.Ark.1970). Since this letter was not offered in evidence before the trial court, it will not be considered by us. Furthermore, there is no evidence in this record tending to show that the statute in fact had the stated effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-9\">\u201c(d) (1) No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, with any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex: <em>Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, rechice the wage rate of any employee.\" </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.2 (eff.

If the employer can prove that business necessity precludes providing these benefits to both men and women, then the State law is in conflict with and superseded by title VII as to this employer.
