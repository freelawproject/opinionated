Both counts charged that the defendant was employed as a shop steward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">Count 1 covered a period from November 1, 1968 to August 20, 1969 and charged that during that period the defendant threatened C. A. Gibeaut, Inc., the subcontractor for concrete form work, with work stoppages and other labor troubles, and by such extortion demanded and obtained $545.30 in checks from C. A. Gibeaut, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Count 2 covered a period from August 27, 1969 to December 26, 1969 and charged that during that period the defendant threatened C. A. Gibeaut, Inc. and its representative William Harrington with work stoppage and labor problems and did in fact slow down and delay the work by calling Union carpenters off the site and slowing down their production. Count 2 further charged that the defendant attempted to extort money by personally threatening William Harrington on December 26, 1969, in violation of the Hobbs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">The jury found the defendant guilty on both counts. After entering its judgment of conviction and denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, the court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for 10 years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">The defendant presents thirteen numbered issues for review on appeal, including the denial of a continuance, the denial of motions to dismiss the indictment, for better response to a bill of particulars, for subpoena fees and investigative costs, various evidentiary rulings, the court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury that bribery and extortion are mutually exclusive crimes, a claim that \u201cthe verdict was against the weight of the evidence,\u201d and finally that \u201can accumulation of errors deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-20\">A careful study of the record, including a typed transcript of more than 600 pages, in the light of the briefs and oral arguments has convinced us that no reversible error was committed. In our opinion, the Government\u2019s brief adequately responds, though in different order, to each of the issues presented for review by the defendant. The question of the defendant\u2019s guilt was for the jury, and the evidence was ample to support its verdict. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b469-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-15\">.
