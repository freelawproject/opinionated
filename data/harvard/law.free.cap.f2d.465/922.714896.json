We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-25\">The material composition of the handles of the imported flatware is at the center of this classification dispute. The knives are of stainless steel, and their handles are of stainless steel and plastic. The stainless steel portion of each handle is continuous along the length of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>handle, whereas the plastic portion appears to be an insert along a portion of one side of the handle. Three different types of knives are involved; two types of serrated edge dessert knives designated style 3 and style 3X, and a serrated \u25a0 edge steak knife designated style 6. Ap-pellee\u2019s sole witness at trial, a patent attorney and civil engineer, testified that he had measured the relative areas of stainless steel and plastic in the exposed surface area of each handle. The stainless steel was found to constitute 94.0% of the exposed handle area of the style. 3 knife, 45.6.% of the exposed handle area of the style 3X knife, and 51.0% of the exposed handle area of the style 6 knife. The witness did not say whether the plastic portion of the handle was hollow or solid, and as noted, his determination in each ease was based on the visible surface area of the handle. No . evidence was adduced as to other properties or the value of the respective components in their relative proportions of the handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The knives were classified as knives \u201cwith stainless steel handles\u201d under item 927.53 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Appendix to the Tariff Schedules:</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">Part 2.

Escape-Clause Actions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-12\">Knives, forks, and spoons, all the foregoing valued under 25 cents each, not over 10.2 inches In over-all length, and with stainless steel handles (provided for In Items 650.09, 650.11 * * *).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-13\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-14\">927.53 Knives and forks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apb-dedup-0\">(Items 650.09,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-15\">650.11 * * *) . .30 each + 67.5% ad \\</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">Item 927.53 is based on a 1959 Presidential Proclamation in which a quota was imposed on certain flatware \u201cwholly of metal and in chief value of stainless steel,\u201d provided for under a then-existing paragraph of the Tariff Act of 1930. When the quota is exceeded, according to the Proclamation, subsequently imported merchandise is to be assessed with duty at a higher rate. This and other temporary \u201cexcape-clause actions\u201d or modifications were incorporated into the Appendix of the TSUS. The escape-clause item refers back to the permanent tariff items of the schedules which cover the same goods. In the present case, item 927.53 refers back to items 650.09 and 650.11, among others. However, it is conceded that the knives at issue were imported after the quota was filled, and therefore, if classification under item 927.53 was correct, the higher tariff rate specified in item 927.53 would admittedly apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">The importer originally claimed that the knives should have been classified under item 650.15 as knives \u201cwith rubber or plastic handles.\u201d The Customs Court, however, concluded that since the knives had neither stainless steel handles nor plastic handles but stainless steel and plastic handles, both the original classification and the claimed classification were incorrect. The court indicated that item 650.21 providing for \u201cother\u201d knives was the proper classification. It initially overruled the importer\u2019s protest, but granted a motion to amend the protest to conform to the court\u2019s finding and a petition for rehearing based on the so-amended protest. In a decision on rehearing, the Customs Court sustained the importer\u2019s claim to classification under item 650.21. It is from that judgment that the Government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">Items 650.09 and 650.11, to which item 927.53 refers, item 650.15, which appel-lee originally claimed to be the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>classification, and item 650.21, which the Customs Court held to be the correct classification, read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-4\">Schedule 6, Part 3. \u2014 Metal Products</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-5\">* * * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-6\">Subpart E. \u2014 Tools, Cutlery, Forks and Spoons</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-7\">* * * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-8\">Knives not specifically provided for elsewhere In this subpart, and cleavers, with or without their handles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-9\">Knives with their handles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-10\">* * * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-11\">With stainless steel handles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-12\">650.09 With handles not containing nickel and not containing over 10 percent by weight of manganese <em>....................................It </em>each + 12.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-15\">650.11 With handles containing nickel or containing over 10 percent by weight of manganese ............................................li! each + 17.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-18\">With rubber or plastic handles: 650.15 Table, kitchen, and butcher knives <em>..............................2$ </em>each -f-12.5% ad val, * * * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-22\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-24\">* * * * * * * * * * 650.21 Other .....................................................1 <em>i </em>each + 17.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-26\">The Customs Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-27\">With respect to identity of merchandise covered by item 927.53 classification, the evidence in this record clearly shows that the imported knives possess handles which are composed in substantial part of a non-metallic material, a plastic. Item 927.53, the temporary provision, and items 650.09 and 650.11, the permanent provisions to which item 927.53 refers, all contain the qualifying phrase \u201cwith stainless steel handles.\u201d This latter phrase we think is incompatible with a description of a knife \u201cwith stainless steel and plastic handle\u201d \u2014 the characterization most accurately identifying the knife handles at bar, according to the evidence. And we find nothing in the tariff schedules themselves or in the Tariff Classification Study notes [footnote omitted] which indicates that the language \u201cwith stainless steel handles\u201d is to be given any construction other than a literal one. In fact, the juxtaposition of the language \u201cwith stainless steel handles\u201d in part 3E of schedule 6 of the tariff schedules with coordinate provisions for knives with handles composed of other, specifically designated materials, indicates to the contrary. Thus, under the inferior heading \u201cknives with their handles\u201d there are five (5) subdivisions of knives with handles, grouped according to the specific material of which the handle is composed, followed by a sixth or residual grouping designated only as \u201cother.\u201d Such arrangement indicates, in our opinion, that Congress intended to classify \u201cknives with their handles\u201d according to the single, specific material of which the handles were composed, or if not so made, then under a residual category.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-29\">The Government contends that the phrase \u201cwith stainless steel\u201d should not be construed to mean \u201cwholly of\u201d stainless steel, but rather either \u201cin chief value of,\u201d or \u201cpredominantly,\u201d stainless steel. The TSUS does not define \u201cwith,\u201d and the Government urges that where a provision for an article of a given ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>terial fails to indicate the extent to which that material must be present, it is sufficient if the material is that of chief value or is predominant. Various cases are cited in support of the proposition, the closest factually to the present case appearing to be Buss &amp; Co. v. United States, 6 Ct.Cust.Appls. 192, T.D. 35441 (1915), wherein the predecessor of this court held the phrase \u201cmetal buttons\u201d to include buttons composed of metal but with a base having a layer of celluloid. The court noted that metal was the predominating material and had been conceded to be the component of chief value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The Government also contends that-the holding of the Customs Court increases the scope of the \u201cbasket provision,\u201d by which the Government means the residual \u201cother\u201d provision of item 650.21. It is asserted that the intent, of Congress in enacting the TSUS was to divest the basket provisions of the 1930 Tariff Act of significant classes of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">We are of the view that the Customs Court correctly interpreted the statutory language at issue. Considering the phrase \u201ca stainless steel handle\u201d in the context of common, everyday speech, we think that a person hearing the phrase would take it to mean that the handle is composed solely of the named material except, perhaps, for insignificant or negligible quantities of other materials, and would not expect to find substantial portions of other materials. The interpretations proposed by the Government, \u201cin chief value of\u201d and \u201cpredominantly,\u201d admit of significant amounts of other materials and do not comport with what we agree with the Customs Court to be a \u201cliteral construction\u201d of the phrase. Failing to find any reason for applying a broader construction, the court below adopted the literal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">We also see no reason to apply a different interpretation. We do not agree with the Government that this construction expands the scope of the residual category in contravention of legislative intent. We find no evidence of an intent to limit the scope of the residual category involved here. All the items of Schedule 6, Part 3, Subpart E at issue relate to knives \u201cnot specifically provided for elsewhere in this subpart,\u201d and thus it appears that these items <em>together </em>constitute the \u201cbasket\u201d provisions. Finally, Congress adopted the words used in these items, not the Customs Court, and we think that the interpretations given them by the court below comports with their plain meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">We do not think that the <em>Buss </em>case, supra, stands for the general proposition that the phrase \u201ca [material] [object]\u201d means that the material need only be the predominant material or component of chief value in the object. In <em>Buss, </em>it appears that there had been a change in the language of the provision with the passage of the tariff act governing the case. The court could find no basis for concluding that buttons included under the former language, \u201cbuttons of metal,\u201d were intended to be excluded under the subsequent language, \u201cmetal buttons,\u201d and held that the two phrases were of the same scope. The <em>Buss </em>opinion indicates that there was additional evidence of legislative intent to include the imported goods in the provision for \u201cmetal buttons.\u201d Therefore, while that case may have rested on facts amenable to the result reached therein, we are unwilling to extract from it a rule of general applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">Looking to the knives involved in this appeal, we do not think it can be fairly said that they have stainless steel handles; nor do they have plastic handles. We agree with the Customs Court that the residual item, 650.21 TSUS, is the proper classification. The judgment below is accordingly affirmed. This disposition of the appeal renders consideration of certain alternative arguments advanced by appellee with respect to the legality of item 927.53 unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
