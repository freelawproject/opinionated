They were both tried for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by receiving and concealing marihuana knowing that it had been imported contrary to law. Mrs. Pratter was acquitted. The appeal from Pratter\u2019s conviction raises several questions, principally whether appellant had \u201crefused\u201d \u2014 within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 \u2014 to admit the arresting officers to his home before they admitted themselves. The answer depends on a consideration of the facts immediately preceding their entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">On April 29, 1969, an inspector for the Bureau of Customs in Indianapolis examined a suspicious-looking package and found it to contain a broken plaster of paris statue in which about a pound of a dark substance had been packed. Chemical analysis revealed, and a second analysis confirmed, that the substance was hashish, the hallucinogenic resin of the marihuana plant. The package had been shipped from Bombay, India, addressed to plaintiff at his residence near Bloomington. The agents sprayed the contents of the package with a fluorescent dust, repacked it, and then cleared it for delivery by a private carrier. Arrangements were made to transfer the package to the carrier\u2019s driver on the outskirts of Bloomington; he was then followed by three agents in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>cars; they observed the actual delivery to Mrs. Pratter in front of the Pratter home at about 12:30 P.M. on May 1. One agent then left to telephone for a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">About 45 minutes later appellant arrived home. Except for a brief exit to pick up some textbooks from his car, there was no activity around the house until agent Hulswit arrived with the warrant at about 2:45 P.M. With one agent at the back of the house, three others, with guns drawn and accompanied by an Indiana state trooper, proceeded to execute the warrant. Agent Hulswit testified that a large dog by the front door ran away as they approached. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cThen when we got to the door I knocked on the door quite loudly, and announced that I was a federal agent with a search warrant. And then I thought we would have to kick the door down\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cQ. Why did you think that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cA. Based on other cases of a similar nature that I have worked on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201cQ. What happened instead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">\u201cA. Well, I turned the door handle, like I was \u2014 so there would be less lock to go against if it was kicked, and the door came open, so the three of us walked in.\u201d (Tr. C455-456.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">On cross-examination Hulswit testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">\u201cQ. You turned it, and it opened right then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-18\">\u201cA. Well, I had to push it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-19\">\u201cQ. Right then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-20\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-21\">\u201cQ. A second or two after you said, T am a federal agent; I have a search warrant\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-22\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-23\">\u201cQ. You did that immediately after knocking ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-24\">\u201cA. Immediately after or during the time I was knocking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-25\">\u201cQ. And so from the \u2014 That was the sequence, then, from the knock to your entry, which immediately followed the door opening; would that be correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-26\">\u201cA. Well, there was some time between the events. Maybe it was a couple seconds between each event. It wasn\u2019t a long time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1E\">When the agents entered, appellant was returning to the livingroom from the rear of the house and Mrs. Pratter was in the hall, having just left the bedroom. The home was promptly searched. An examination of the bathroom with an ultraviolet lamp did not indicate the possibility that the hashish might have been flushed down the toilet. It was found in clear plastic sandwich bags stuffed between large sacks of garbage in the back of the house. A hashish pipe and debris from the unwrapped package and broken statute were found in the livingroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-27\">A motion to suppress the hashish and pipe was denied by the district court without findings of fact or an opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a trial before a jury, appellant was convicted and his wife was acquitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Section 3109 authorizes a federal officer to \u201cbreak open\u201d the door of a house if necessary to execute a search warrant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An unauthorized entry effected by the use of no more force than necessary to turn the knob and open an unlocked door is a \u201cbreaking\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3109. Sabbath v. United States, 391 U.S. 585, 589-590, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828; <em>cf. </em>Munoz v. United States, 325 F.2d 23, 26 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The Supreme Court has not yet decided what \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d if any, may excuse compliance with the statute. See Sabbath v. United States, 391 U.S. at 591, 88 S.Ct. 1755. It is settled, however, that if such circumstances are not present, evidence seized from a dwelling entered in violation of the statute is inadmissible. Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190. The question presented by this appeal is whether the agents\u2019 entry into appellant\u2019s home was justified; if not, the hashish and pipe were improperly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Under the language of the statute the issue is whether \u201cafter notice of [their] authority and purpose, [the agents were] refused admittance.\u201d Without specific reference to the statutory language, the government argues that exigent circumstances justified a prompt entry. Before considering the circumstances which the government emphasizes, we note that although the issue is one of statutory construction, rather than constitutional law, the Anglo-American tradition of respect for the privacy of the home and the dignity of the citizen even when suspected of criminal behavior forecloses a \u201cgrudging application\u201d of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 78 S.Ct. at 1197.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">' The statute applies to a critical situation which is fraught with danger for the entering officers as well as the occupants of the dwelling. Prompt action and surprise may be necessary to forestall escape, the destruction of evidence, or even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>violence; yet prompt action and surprise may also precipitate such consequences. In short, the execution of a warrant is a job for a professional,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> trained both to perform his mission and to heed the statutory command to show a decent respect for the privacy of the citizen before bursting into his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In this case, the government\u2019s brief relies on no precise justification but instead recites a variety of circumstances to portray an aura of exigency. There was a large watchdog in front of the house as the agents approached; they \u201cthought he was going to attack one of the agents as we went up to the door.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the dog meandered off before the agents reached the front door.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Presumably there was some possibility of resistance, but surveillance suggested no special risks within the apparently peaceful home of a student couple, and the presence of five armed officers was adequate protection against foreseeable risks of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Of greater significance was the risk that the evidence might be flushed down a toilet before it could be seized. Again, however, the agents had.taken the precaution of spraying the evidence with fluorescent dust and had already analyzed the hashish before permitting its delivery in order that the crime could be committed. The likelihood that criminal behavior would remain undetected or unprovable was insufficient to obviate the obligation to respect the statutory command. Indeed, the agents themselves did not believe it was necessary to make such a prompt entry and had not concluded that they had been refused admittance.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Even though special circumstances may constitute a constructive \u201crefusal\u201d to admit officers who have announced their purpose, or may otherwise excuse compliance with \u00a7 3109, such circumstances are not evidenced here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>As the government emphasizes, the record clearly establishes that the agents had announced their office. For that reason, the holdings in <em>Sabbath </em>and <em>Miller </em>are inapplicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, as the government also argues, there is conflict in the testimony relating to the time between the officers\u2019 announcement and their actual entry.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nevertheless, none testified that he considered the interval long enough to justify the inference that admittance had been expressly or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>structively refused.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On the contrary, two agents expressly testified that they had not intended to enter so soon; surprisingly, the door opened when the knob was turned and they abruptly plunged into the livingroom with guns drawn. In short, without an overly hasty purpose, the constables blundered.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The price which society must pay to forestall the repetition of such blunders is that the accused shall go free, or at least at his trial the evidence seized as a result of that invasion of his home may not be used against him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Otherwise the congressional requirement of professionalism in the execution of search warrants might not accomplish its dual purpose of protecting the privacy of the home<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and ensuring a high degree of expertise in the performance of a vital police function.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">As the parties recognized at oral argument, if the case should be retried, our decision in United States v. Castro, 438 F.2d 468, 470-471 (1971), will obviate any necessity for reference to the Marihuana Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4741, et seq., in the instructions to the jury or in the examination of witnesses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, although the mandatory five-year sentence imposed by the district court was in compliance with the statute, as we have construed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236, on retrial, the court will have discretion not available prior to May 1, 1971. See United States v. McGarr, 461 F.2d 1 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-19\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-20\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\">.

According to their testimony, Mrs. Pratter was taking a nap when appellant opened the package and placed the hashish in sandwich bags. He testified he panicked when he observed police coming up the driveway and, with no intent to defraud the United States, hastily tried to conceal the hashish in the garbage area. He also offered evidence to prove that the package was intended for a friend for whom he was receiving mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b324-6\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cThe officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">This section is a 1948 revision, 62 Stat. 820, of a statute enacted in 1917, which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201cThe officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute the warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance.\u201d 40 Stat. 229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The common law origin of the statute is reviewed in Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 306-309, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Subsequent to the search in this case, Congress provided a more liberal provision, with concomitant safeguards, for execution of warrants in drug cases in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236, \u00a7 509(b) at p. 1274 (effective May 1, 1971). Under prescribed conditions, a magistrate may provide in the warrant for execution without an announcement of authority and purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b324-17\">. \u201cWe are duly mindful of the reliance that society must place for achieving law and order upon the enforcing agencies of the criminal law. But insistence on observance by law officers of traditional fair procedural requirements is, from the long point of view, best calculated to contribute to that end. However, much in a particular case insistence upon such rules may appear as a technicality that inures to the benefit of a guilty person, the history of the criminal law proves that tolerance of shortcut methods in law enforcement impairs its enduring effectiveness. The requirement of prior notice of authority and purpose before forcing entry into a home is deeply rooted in our heritage and should not be given grudging application. Congress, codifying a tradition embedded in Anglo-American law, has declared in \u00a7 3109 the reverence of the law for the individual\u2019s right of privacy in his house. Every householder, the good and the bad, the guilty and the innocent, is entitled to the protection designed to secure the common interest against unlawful invasion of the house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\">. This point was given dramatic emphasis by the Report of the January 1970 Grand Jury, United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjM\">\u201cAt 4:45 a. m., December 4, 1969, fourteen Chicago police officers assigned to the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, executed a search warrant for illegal weapons at 2337 West Monroe in a flat rented by members of the Black Panther Party. Nine people were in the apartment. Two were killed in the gunfire which broke out: [P. 1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">The Grand Jury believes the facts show that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Police are neither trained nor equipped for such major undertakings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\u201cThe problems inherent in using the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Police in this way are readily apparent. It was never clear who was responsible for the crime scene, either its search or its security. Police department officials say the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Officers had the responsibility because it was their raid, and the police department only provided assistance as requested. The State\u2019s Attorney said that when the Police Crime Laboratory men arrived, the whole scene was their responsibility. As a result, no gun was tagged or fingerprinted, no record made of where it was found, no proper inventory was made and no record shows what ammunition was in each, if any. The scene was abandoned by 7:30 a. m. through an unexplainable series of conflicting orders. The failure to collect and systematically preserve available evidence has contributed to the Grand Jury\u2019s inability to establish what took place with legal definitiveness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">\u201cMoreover, the whole concept of going on a raid in a high crime density area to obtain weapons from known militants \u2014led by a convicted felon believed to be dangerous \u2014 with only fourteen men, in plainclothes, in the dead of night, with no sound equipment, no lighting equipment, no tear gas and no plan for dealing with potential resistance, seems ill-conceived. The Grand Jury believes that a professional police department would not have adopted such an approach but would have used a system similar to the one used by the FBI in June 1969, evacuating the entire Panther Headquarters and effecting eight arrests without firing a single shot.\u201d (Pp. 113-114.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\">.

Other officers were at the same time at the rear of the house. Before reaching the front door the officers had to pass by a bay window in the front of the Gaxiola house and as they did so were observed by Mrs. Gaxiola, mother of appellant. Agent Fahey, who was in the lead, testified that when Mrs. Gaxiola observed him she \u2018turned to run or turned and did run\u2019. When Fahey reached the front door he beat upon it and yelled, \u2018We are federal officers and have a search warrant, open up\u2019. Fahey then heard \u2018footsteps running in the wrong direction\u2019 and felt certain that the inmates were endeavoring to escape. He then kicked the door open to gain entrance. The total time spent by Fahey at the top of the stairs was four or five seconds ; as Fahey testified, \u2018long enough that I decided it was foolish to wait longer\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adsm\">\u201cWhen the entrance was made it was evident that Mrs. Gaxiola had been approaching the door because she was standing near it when the officers gained entrance.

The Ninth Circuit has also recognized the \u201cfleeing footsteps\u201d justification. Stamps v. United States, 436 F.2d 1059, 1060 (1971). Here, however, the agents neither saw anyone going away from the door nor heard any \u201cfleeing footsteps.\u201d They had no basis for concluding that they were refused admittance. Also, the mere possibility of escape may not be a sufficient justification in this circuit, absent a time lapse sufficient to justify an inference or refusal, if the door through which escape might be made is also guarded as it was in the case at bar. See United States v. Case, 435 F.2d 766, 770 (7th Cir. 1970). <em>Gf. </em>United States v. Chambers, 382 F.2d 910, 916 (6th Cir. 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\">.

Although the narrative description of the sequence of events makes it extremely unlikely that a period of as long as 30 seconds actually elapsed, our holding is not predicated on any particular assumption with respect to the precise length of the time interval. Bather, it is predicated on the undisputed fact that the entry preceded any determination by the agents themselves that action was required either by exigent circumstances or by a reasonable interpretation of the delay as constituting a refusal to admit.

United States, 335 U.S. 451, 460-461, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (Mr. Justice Jackson concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b327-24\">. Although we did not expressly discuss the \u201cintent to defraud the United States\u201d language of \u00a7 176a in <em>Castro, </em>we think it is apparent from that opinion that, when there is appropriate evidence as there is in this case, the trier of fact may legitimately infer that the \u201creceiving\u201d or \u201cconcealing\u201d of uninvoiced marihuana which is known to be uninvoiced (that is, known to be imported contrary to law) is done with an \u201cintent to defraud the United States.\u201d The \u201cfraud\u201d arises in denying the United States something to which it is entitled \u2014 to have marihuana invoiced. The United States is defrauded when such marihuana is received and concealed without invoicing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
