The proposed reimbursement was for legal advice and other services rendered by the Church to several civic associations in Texarkana, Texas in filing a petition to deny the license of KTAL-TV in Texarkana, negotiating a settlement with the licensee of KTAL, and subsequently withdrawing the petition to deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">We specifically overrule the Commission\u2019s principle of general application that in no petition to deny situation is it in the public interest to permit reimbursement, and remand this case to the Commission for a determination of whether reimbursement should be allowed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">In August of 1968, KCMC, Inc., the licensee of KTAL-TV in Texarkana, applied to the Commission for renewal of its license. On January 10, 1969, twelve civic associations in the Texarkana area filed a petition to deny renewal of the KTAL license on the grounds that KTAL had ignored Negroes, who constituted a substantial portion of the listening public in Texarkana, in the development and presentation of its programs. The appellant Church, whose work in providing technical and legal assistance to community groups is well known to this court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had at the request of several Texarkana groups provided assistance in the preparation of the petition to deny, and in responding to the licensee\u2019s opposition to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-20\">While the petition was pending, the Texarkana organizations together with the Church held a series of discussions with the licensee in an attempt to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>solve their dispute. An agreement was reached wherein the licensee undertook to assure that it would meet the programming needs of minorities, would improve the balance, scope and tone of its programs dealing with minorities, and would consult with local groups to achieve these goals. This agreement, dated June 8, 1969, was filed as an amendment to the renewal application with the Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The Texarkana organizations subsequently requested the Commission to give no further consideration to their petition to deny, and requested that it renew the license of KTAL in consideration of the specific undertakings of the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On July 29, 1969, the Commission renewed the license of KTAL in reliance on the agreement reached between the Texarkana groups and the licensee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After recounting the circumstances behind the petition to deny and the negotiations ending in agreement, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cWe believe that this Commission should encourage licensees to meet with community oriented groups to settle complaints of local broadcast service. Such cooperation at the community level should prove to be more effective in improving local service than would be the imposition of strict guidelines by the Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Shortly after the Commission\u2019s decision, Earle K. Moore, counsel for the appellant Church, submitted a request to the Commission for approval of KCMC, Inc.\u2019s agreement to reimburse the Church for its expenses incurred on behalf of the Texarkana organizations \u2014 a total of $15,137.11. The Church\u2019s request for reimbursement from KCMC, Inc. had been approved by the public groups in Texarkana, and was a term of the negotiations with KCMC, Inc. However, the Church had specifically indicated that reimbursement was not a condition precedent to any agreement on the substantive issues. When the settlement was reached, counsel for KCMC, Inc. stated that his client would reimburse the Church provided that the Commission approved the settlement agreement first, and later approved the reimbursement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The settlement agreement was therefore submitted to the Commission with no mention of reimbursement. Mr. Moore\u2019s subsequent request in October of 1969 for the Commission\u2019s approval of reimbursement was in full accord with the understanding between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Almost a year later, in September of 1970, the Commission issued its decision denying approval of the reimbursement agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Briefly, a majority of four considered that the issue raised was whether the public interest is served by permitting payment of expenses to those who file petitions to deny under 47 U.S. C. \u00a7 309<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, and subsequently seek to withdraw them after settlement. The majority recognized that the Communications Act was designed to facilitate filing of petitions to deny, and that \u201cthe settlement of the issues between the station and the petitioner listener group is generally a desirable goal.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the majority was of the opinion that reimbursement of expenses was not \u201cnecessary\u201d to effectuate either goal, and that the potential for abuse if reimbursement were allowed outweighed any benefit to the public interest. In discussing abuses, the majority mentioned two possibilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">\u201cFirst . . . overpayments (e. g. inflated fees) or even opportunists motivated to file insubstantial petitions in order to obtain substantial fees. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">Second . . . the possibility that settlement of the merits of the dispute might be influenced by the ability to obtain reimbursement of expenses from the licensee.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">In light of these dangers, the majority determined that it was in the public interest to formulate a principle of general application \u2014 \u201cnamely, that in no petition to deny situation, whatever the nature of the petitioner, will we permit payment of expenses or other financial benefit to the petitioner.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">Chairman Burch and Commissioner Johnson joined in dissent to state that the Commission had previously allowed reimbursement where it facilitated public interest goals, and there was no reason to forbid it when the settlement and withdrawal of \u201cpetition to deny\u201d litigation served the public interest. To prevent abuse, the Commissioners formulated rules to be enforced by the Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">Commissioner Cox wrote separately in dissent that permitting reimbursement in this case served still another public interest goal \u2014 namely, facilitating the participation of public interest groups in the license renewal process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">It is necessary to focus on these dissents since the Commission\u2019s initial objection to the Church\u2019s appeal is that the issues raised in this court were never presented to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Exhaustion of Administrative Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"ASh\">Appellant Church challenges the decision of the Commission primarily on the grounds that: (1) The Commission is required by statute to facilitate citizen participation in the renewal process, and denial of reimbursement to the Church is in direct violation of this mandate; (2) the Commission\u2019s decision unjustly discriminates against the Church since it has allowed reimbursement in other situations; and (3) the Commission\u2019s decision is unreasoned and lacks factual support in the record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Section 405 of the Communications Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\u201cThe filing of a petition for rehearing shall not be a condition precedent to judicial review of any ... order, decision, report, or action, except where the party seeking such review (2) relies on questions of fact or law <em>upon which the Commission . . . has been afforded no opportunity to pass.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The Commission contends that the Church raised none of these arguments before it, and did not file a petition for rehearing. Therefore, \u00a7 405 would preclude judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">It is true that the Commission decided this case only on the basis of letters from counsel outlining the facts behind the request for reimbursement, and affidavits enumerating the Church\u2019s expenses. However, the majority\u2019s decision analyzed and interpreted the Communications Act and Commission precedent as mandating a general rule that reimbursement in petition to deny situations would not serve the public interest. The Church argues to us the opposite result \u2014 that the statute and precedents mandate reimbursement in this case. This was an alternative interpretation of the authorities which was surely before the Commissioners at the time of their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">Indeed, the dissenting Commissioners Burch and Johnson raise the very argument pressed here by the Church.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would be blindly ignoring the realities of administrative decision-making to say that the majority had no opportunity to consider the objections raised by the dissenters, and to make its ruling in light of these objections.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">On its face, \u00a7 405, commands only that the Commission be afforded the opportunity to pass on issues.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is no requirement that this opportunity be afforded in any particular manner, or by any particular party. Thus to allow the Church to seek review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of issues raised by the majority and challenged by the dissenters complies with both \u00a7 405\u2019s requirements and its objectives.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In light of the record before us, the Commission\u2019s argument seems hollow indeed and we turn to the issues raised by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"Amp\">The issue posed by the Church is whether the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the public interest standard was correct. Since there is no explicit statutory provision which controls the Church\u2019s request for reimbursement,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we find guidance for our standard of review of the Commission\u2019s decision from the Supreme Court: The Commission\u2019s construction of its own statutory mandate \u201cshould be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1802, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">It is the necessary and proper task of this court to undertake a careful and deliberate scrutiny of an agency\u2019s ' decisions to insure compliance with law &gt; and the legislative mandate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-25\">We agree with appellant that the public interest standard cannot mean that the Commission may totally prohibit reimbursement in all petition to deny <em>! </em>situations. This rule cannot be sus- <em>! </em>tained in light of the policies expressed I in the Communications Act and the Commission\u2019s own interpretations of its statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-26\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-27\">Allowing Reimbursement to Facilitate Settlement of Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"Arj\">Appellant contends that the Commission must, in accordance with its statutory mandate to act in the public interest, permit voluntary reimbursement of parties seeking to settle and to withdraw litigation from the Commission if (1) the underlying agreement to withdraw is in the public interest and (2) the reimbursement sought is legitimate and prudent. We find compelling support for this contention in the Communications Act and in the Commission\u2019s own decisions. A rule which flatly prohibits reimbursement in all peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tion to deny situations<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> plainly violates this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">For primary guidance, we of course turn to the Communications Act of 1934. In \u00a7 311(c)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Congress provides for Commission approval of reimbursement agreements when one or several competing applicants for new broadcasting facilities withdraws to permit the speedy initiation of service to the public by one bi\u2019oadcaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">This is a statutory policy which has applicability to the case before us\u2014 reimbursement which facilitates withdrawal of competing or conflicting petitions is definitely in the public interest when termination of the litigation serves an overriding public interest goal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Even prior to the enactment of \u00a7 311(c) the Commission had occasionally allowed reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses to a withdrawing party. Premier Television, Inc. 9 Pike &amp; Fischer R.R. 397, 399 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The potential for abuse of reimbursement agreements through buy-outs of superior competitors or pay-offs to those filing frivolous applications was clearly recognized by this court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Congress sought to deal with these abuses through \u00a7 311(c) which required strict scrutiny by the Commission on a case-by-case basis of the bona fides of the parties and the' legitimacy of the reimbursement. Congress did not mandate an absolute bar against reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Since the enactment of \u00a7 311(c), the Commission has been asked to approve withdrawal and reimbursement agreements in situations to which the statute does not explicitly apply. In the leading case, <em>National Broadcasting Co., Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Commission reasoned that Congress must have \u201coverlooked\u201d the possibility that the Commission would have to deal with pay-offs in a variety of situations. The Commission formulated the principle that \u201cthe spirit, but not the terms, of Section 311(c) is applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In <em>National Broadcasting, </em>Philco Corporation sought to withdraw its application for a construction permit filed in competition with NBC\u2019s request for renewal of its WRCV-TV license. As part of its request, Philco asked the Commission to approve NBC\u2019s offer to reimburse it for its expenses up to $550,000. Applying the policy of \u00a7 311(c), the Commission weighed the specific detriments and benefits to the public interest resulting from withdrawal of Philco\u2019s petition. If the litigation were terminated, the public would lose the opportunity to choose between applicants. This detriment would not be offset by a public interest goal since, unlike the situation covered by \u00a7 311(c), the public was already provided with service by NBC. The Commission therefore refused permission for reimbursement and for Phil-co\u2019s withdrawal.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Philco and NBC raised other interests to justify termination of their litigation, but the Commission classified these as private, and inappropriate for it to consider. The Commission implied, however, that it would be willing to consider other genuine public interest goals which might offset the detriment of loss of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">Subsequent to the <em>National Broadcasting </em>decision, the Commission has further shown its willingness to approve reimbursement agreements to facilitate termination of litigation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In the decision below the Commission purports to rely on this \u201cline of cases\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> for the proposition that it is \u201cgenerally loath to permit payment of expenses.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> However, the Commission has clearly stated in other recent decisions that its disinclination can be overcome by public interest considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-17\">\u201c[I]n the absence of other countervailing considerations demonstrating that a grant of an agreement . is in the public interest, we in general look with disfavor upon agreements whereby an application for a new broadcast facility proposes to withdraw . . . upon reimbursement.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">The case before us is a compelling example of the obvious benefits to the public interest which result from withdrawal of certain petitions to deny. The Commission wrote that \u201cthe settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>of the issues between the station and the petitioning group is generally a desirable goal\u201d because it promotes an atmosphere of \u201cgenerous cooperation \u2014 not strife and suspicion\u201d and \u201cshould prove to be more effective in improving local service than would be the imposition of strict guidelines by the Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In permitting the Texarkana groups to withdraw their petition, the Commission cited these public benefits and mentioned no specific detriment to the public interest.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">It is therefore inexplicable that the Commission should reject the \u201cspirit\u201d of \u00a7 311(c) and its own line of cases in order to raise an absolute bar against reimbursement in all petitions to deny situations. In its opinion below, the majority revealed no reasons why the potential for abuse of reimbursement is sufficiently greater in a petition to deny situation to justify such a prohibition, and we can conceive of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We are not required in this case to consider whether there are reasons which would support a Commission policy prohibiting <em>all </em>reimbursement of expenses, since the Commission had already determined that the public interest is consistent with a policy of reimbursing some private interests, <em>e.g. </em>other applicants, who withdraw from further participation. In the context of this case, the public interest is likewise protected from abuse by the Commission\u2019s determinations that the public group seeking to withdraw is bona fide, and that the terms of its settlement with the local broadcaster serve the public interest.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Once these determinations are made,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> voluntary reimbursement of legitimate and prudent expenses of the withdrawing group cannot be forbidden. The public interest therefore requires that the Commission\u2019s per se rule prohibiting reimbursement be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Award of Reimbursement to Facilitate Public Participation</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Appellant also asserts that a second, independent public interest goal requires approval of reimbursement in this ease \u2014facilitating the financial ability of groups like the Church to increase public participation in the renewal process. The Church draws support for this position from two of this court\u2019s decisions<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> which recognized the necessity of granting standing to public organizations before the Commission. In recent years, the concept that public participation in decisions which involve the public interest is not only valuable but indispensable has gained increasing support.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">It seems to us that the goal of facilitating public participation is necessarily furthered by the rule we have established above. Precisely because the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pellant Church represented public organizations was it able to achieve a settlement with KTAL which served the public interest in Texarkana. When such substantial results have been achieved, as in this case, voluntary<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> reimbursement which obviously facilitates and encourages the participation of groups like the Church in subsequent proceedings is entirely consonant with the public interest.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> The operative principle established in Part IV thus remains \u2014 when the settlement of issues and termination of a petition to deny between the public and a broadcaster is in the public interest, voluntary reimbursement of the public group may be allowed. The Commission has already examined the underlying settlement and agreement to withdraw in this ease and found them to be in the public interest.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, the expenses submitted by the Church have not yet received the Commission\u2019s scrutiny. While it is difficult to believe that they will not be found to be \u201clegitimate and prudent\u201d in accordance with the standard of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 311(c), the Commission must be given the opportunity to pass on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Accordingly, this case is remanded to the Commission for a determination of whether the expenses submitted by appellant meet this standard.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\">.
