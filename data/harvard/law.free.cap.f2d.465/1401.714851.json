The Board cross-applies for enforcement of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-15\">In its order, the Board affirmed the findings of its trial examiner that the Association had violated sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), 158(a)(3) (1970), by certain statements made to various employees and by- actions, including discharge, taken with regard to one employee in particular. The Board therefore required the Association to cease and desist from its illegal practices, to post copies of a notice at places where they would be seen by employees, and to reinstate the discharged employee with back pay. We have carefully reviewed the record, and we find that substantial evidence on the whole record supports the Board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1495-20\">The January 17, 1972, order of the National Labor Relations Board will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1495-16\">. We find that the Association\u2019s unsupported charge of improper conduct of the trial examiner, dealing with the presence of a relative of his at the hearing, is adequately answered by the trial examiner\u2019s affidavit filed with our Clerk.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
