Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-8\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">In February 1968 the United States sued Maritime Investment Company, a small business investment company (SBIC) licensed by the Small Business Administration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking an injunction, appointment of a receiver, a money judgment, forfeiture of Maritime\u2019s license, and other relief. These remedies are available against an SBIC which has violated the Act or SBA regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court denied relief on the ground that the government had failed to discharge its burden of proving that Maritime\u2019s capital was impaired, which was the major violation charged. The court misconceived the burden of proof, necessitating reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">SBIC\u2019s are required by regulation to file each fiscal year an unaudited financial report for the six-month period ending September 30 and an audited report for the fiscal year ending March 31. Pursuant thereto Maritime filed for the six-month period ending September 30, 1967, an unaudited report signed and certified to be correct by its president and chief financial officer and single stockholder, which showed on its face that the company\u2019s capital was substantially impaired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By letter SBA declared Maritime\u2019s indebtedness to it due and payable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Maritime neither paid nor responded and SBA filed this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-20\">At trial, which did not commence until September 1970, the government introduced the September 1967 report, which was an admission against interest sufficient to establish a prima facie case of impairment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maritime was allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>introduce an audited report for the fiscal year ending March 30, 1968, in which allowances for uncollectible items had been substantially reduced from the amounts shown in the September report. Oral testimony revealed that the reductions had been made on instructions of the president (who had signed the September report). The trial court erred in denying relief on the ground the government had failed to prove that the September 1967 report was correct, and that the March 1968 report was incorrect, and that there was an impairment. Once the government introduced the September report \u2014 signed and certified and required to be filed with SBA \u2014 the burden shifted to Maritime to come forward with evidence disproving the correctness of that report or explaining errors and mistakes in preparation of it. With reference to the ultimate burden of persuasion, it is for the trial court in the first instance to determine whether assertions that the allowances for uncollectible items had been erroneously overstated in the September report are sufficient to overcome the government's prima facie case of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">.
