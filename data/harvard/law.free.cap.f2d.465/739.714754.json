Appellant contends that the Secretary\u2019s decision was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further contends that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>court should order the Secretary to award him disability payments as requested in his application. Appellee asserts that the issues raised by the application before us are res judicata because appellant unsuccessfully presented the same disability claim in two earlier applications and failed to seek judicial review of those decisions within the time provided by statute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also asserts that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reopen the earlier negative determination regarding disability is not reviewable under either the Social Security Act or the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">This court today decided these issues in Maddox v. Richardson, 464 F.2d 617 (6th Cir. 1972). We there followed our earlier decision in Gaston v. Richardson, 451 F.2d 461 (6th Cir. 1971), which held that issues raised in disability benefit applications which have been raised by earlier applications and decided adversely to the same applicant are res judicata. Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s claim for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We also decided in <em>Maddox, supra, </em>that the federal courts do have jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act to review the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reopen a previous determination which has become final. <em>Accord, </em>Cappadora v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1966); Davis v. Richardson, 460 F.2d 772 (3d Cir. 1972). In this regard, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary\u2019s action was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and we affirm his dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">Appellant first made application in 1967. That application was denied and a hearing was held at which appellant introduced six doctors\u2019 reports and two hospital reports. He did not seek review of the hearing examiner\u2019s decision denying him benefits. A second application was filed in 1969. A second hearing examiner considered the medical evidence introduced at the previous hearing, and two additional hospital reports submitted at the hearing on the second application, and determined that appellant was, during the relevant period, capable of performing light work of a sedentary nature. Appellant sought review of that decision by the Appeals Council, which denied review and informed him that he had 60 days from the date of the council\u2019s decision during which he could seek judicial review of the denial under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). He did not seek judicial review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">This application, appellant\u2019s third, was filed in 1970. When it was denied, appellant requested a third hearing. The hearing examiner dismissed the request for hearing, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-16\">A review of all of the evidence of record shows that claimant has offered no new and material evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>support of his application dated January 29, 1970, and there appears no apparent error in the prior decisions. Thus, there is no basis for a reopening of such decision or decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">Therefore, it must be concluded that there has been a previous determination or decision by the Secretary with respect to the rights of the same party, Tom H. Woods, on the same facts pertinent to the same issue, or issues, and that this determination has become final. On this basis, the Hearing Examiner must determine that the prior decision or decisions from which no appeal has been taken to the Court of proper jurisdiction constitute res judicata as to claimant\u2019s right to disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">On June 29, 1970, appellant filed a timely request for review by the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration. Then, on July 17, 1970, apparently too late for consideration by the Appeals Council before its decision, appellant submitted yet another physician\u2019s report. On July 27, the Appeals Council, without making reference to the supplemental medical report, affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s dismissal of the request for a hearing. On August 7, 1970, a member of the Appeals Council wrote a letter to appellant\u2019s attorney which stated, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">The Appeals Council has carefully considered Dr. Donaldson\u2019s report but can find no basis for changing its previous action of which Mr. Woods was informed on November 28,1969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Appellant then filed this action in the District Court. While the case was pending in that court, appellant submitted written statements by two physicians (Buchner and Willingham) to the Secretary. A hearing examiner responded to appellant\u2019s attorney by a letter dated December 7, 1970, which acknowledged receipt of additional medical evidence from Doctors Buchner and Donaldson but made no reference to receipt of an October 4, 1970, letter from Dr. Willingham which is a part of the record certified to the District Court by the Social Security Administration. The hearing examiner\u2019s letter further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">... It now appears to the undersigned that you are requesting the case be reopened and if such is the event it will be handled by one of the examiners in the office. However, I would appreciate your advice as to whether or not you wish to arrange for a reopening of the case or whether you desire to move the Court for a remand in order to introduce this evidence into the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">On January 20, 1971, appellant filed a motion in the District Court requesting that the case be remanded to the Secretary for a determination whether the application should be reopened by him. On December 10, 1971, the District Court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint but did not expressly rule upon appellant\u2019s motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Because it appears that the Secretary has never determined whether a reopening of appellant\u2019s application would be justified in light of the most recent documents of record from Doctors Willingham and Buchner, the District Court\u2019s review of the Secretary\u2019s refusal to reopen was properly limited to consideration of the report of Dr. Donaldson. We, too, have examined the record in this case and the statement of Dr. Donaldson, and we agree that the Secretary did not abuse his discretion in refusing to reopen. Accordingly, the decision of the District Court is affirmed without prejudice to appellant if he should wish to request the Secretary to reopen to consider the statements by Doctors Willingham and Buchner under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.957 and 404.958.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-17\">.
