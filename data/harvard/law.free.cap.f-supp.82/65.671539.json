The general jurisdiction of the court (its jurisdiction under Section 266 of the former Judicial Code and under Section 2281 of revised Title 28 of the United States Code, Annotated, effective September 1, 1948, aside) is alleged to be founded on the second, third and fourth Federal Civil Rights Acts, Act of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 140, Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, and Act of March 1, 1875, 18 Stat. 335, 337, R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1977, 1979, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 41, 43, 44 and 46, and upon Section 24(14) of the Judicial Code of 1911, now Section 1343 of revised Title 28 U.S.C.A., and upon Amendments I, V, VI, XIV and XIX to the Constitution of the United States. Jurisdiction is also allegedly based upon Section 24(1) of the Judicial Code of 1911, now revised Title 28, Section 1331, U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The complaints at the two numbers are quite similar in substance. The International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union (ILWU), a voluntary unincorporated association and labor union, is a plaintiff at each number; Kawano, individually and as a member of the ILWU and as president of what was the Territorial Council of the ILWU, is a plaintiff at No. 828. The no longer existent Territorial Council of the ILWU is also named as a plaintiff at this number. Rania, in his individul capacity and as president of the United Sugar Workers, ILWU, Local 142, is a plaintiff at No. 836. Both Rania and Kawano allege, as indicated, that they sue not only individually but in representative capacities on behalf of the ILWU\u2019s membership of approximately 30,000 persons in the Territory of Hawaii. The complaints assert that all other individual plaintiffs are residents of the Territory of Hawaii, members of the ILWU, and are daily wage earners in either the sugar industry or the pineapple industry of the Territory. This is found to be the fact. It is asserted that all the individual plaintiffs at both numbers, either ethnologically or as a matter of <em>mores </em>of the Islands,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are \u201cmembers of races other than the Caucasian race\u201d. The particulars of these allegations were either proved or stipulated to.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****The races of the individual plaintiffs referred to were variously alleged, and proved or -stipulated, to be the Malayan, the Polynesian and the Mongolian, sub widely varying national strains, viz., Filipino, Hawaiian, Hawaiian-Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and Puerto Rican. These facts possess significance only in relation to the challenges and motions made to the jury commissioners of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit of the Territory of Hawaii and to the motions and challenges made to the 1947 Maui County grand jury. Most of the individual plaintiffs are alleged, and proved or stipulated to be citizens of the United States. Some of the individual plaintiffs are alleged, and proved or stipulated to be aliens and citizens of the Philippine Republic, or aliens and citizens of Japan, or aliens and citizens of other nationalities. Again we deem these facts to be of significance only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>in relation to the attack on the jury commissioners or upon the grand jury of Maui County.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The defendants at both numbers are identical except that the defendant, Jean Lane, Chief of Police of Maui County, sued individually and as chief of police at No. 828, is not named as a defendant at No. 836. The defendant, Walter D. Acker-man, Jr., Attorney General of the Territory of Hawaii, is sued individually and as attorney general. The Honorable Ingram M. Stainback, Governor of the Territory of Hawaii, is sued individually and as governor. E. R. Bevins, County Attorney of the County of Maui, and Wendell F. Crockett, Deputy County Attorney of the County of Maui, \u00e1re sued individually and as County Attorney and Deputy County Attorney respectively. Judge Cable A. Wirtz, a Circuit Judge of the Territory of Hawaii, is sued individually and as one of the jury commissioners of Maui County. The jury commissioners and the 1947 grand jurors of the County of Maui are also sued individually and in their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Both complaints allege mutatis mutandis that there were strikes conducted by the ILWU in the sugar and pineapple industries in the Territory; that in furtherance of the objectives of the strikes, viz., improvement in wages, hours and conditions of employment, the individual plaintiffs engaged in \u201clawful, peaceful and constitutionally protected activities of speech, press and assemblage and of peaceful picketing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The complaint at No. 828 alleges that Lane, Chief of Police of Maui County, caused the individual plaintiffs (other than Kawano) to be arrested and charged them with violations of an act of the Territory generally known as the unlawful assembly and riot statute, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, c. 277, Sections 11570-11584; that the plaintiffs Barbosa, Maile, Degamo, Kaopuiki, Nitta, Ah Ho, Aikala, Yagi, Arruiza, Oda and Matsuura were charged in a complaint executed before a district magistrate of Maui County with violations of the same statute; .and that the plaintiffs Makekau, Siruet, Baldua, Sipe and Mendes were similarly charged in a complaint also executed before a local magistrate. It is asserted also that the defendants Acker-man, Stainback, Bevins and Crockett have sought to present criminal charges framed on the complaints to the grand jurors of Maui County; that the defendants, Pombo and Chatterton, and Judge Wirtz, as jury commissioners, chose and composed Maui County grand juries in such a manner as to violate the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and in violation of the laws of the United States and of the Territory of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">The complaint goes on to recite that certain individual plaintiffs (particularly designated hereinafter) filed motions and challenges<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the grand jury and to the methods employed in selecting its members for the reasons set out in the complaint, to be discussed hereinafter, that these charges and challenges were heard by the Honorable Albert M. Cristy, a Circuit Judge of the Territory of Hawaii, in mid-September 1947, but that he held the motions and challenges to be without merit, refusing to disqualify or to dismiss the grand jury. The plaintiffs then allege that the unlawful assembly and riot statute is unconstitutional in that it deprives them of their rights of free speech, press and assemblage and will subject them to criminal prosecutions if they exercise their constitutional rights. Agliam, Abraham Make-kau, and thirty-four other additional plaintiffs were added as parties to the complaint by stipulation and by order of the court. It is alleged that these thirty-six individuals are held to bail under a complaint charging them also with violation of the unlawful assembly and riot statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The complaint closes with the prayers, inter alia, (1) that a temporary and permanent injunction issue from this court prohibiting the enforcement of the unlawful assembly and riot act against the plaintiffs and enjoining the submission to the grand jury of facts relating to the plaintiffs\u2019 actions for indictment based on the unlawful assembly and riot act;. (2) that this court declare the statute to be unconstitutional; (3) that we adjudge the method used in selecting the grand juries of Maui County to be unconstitutional and contrary to law and order the grand jury discharged; and (4) that a three judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>court be convened pursuant to Section 266 of the Judicial Code of 1911, to determine the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The complaint at No. 836 attacks not only the unlawful assembly and riot statute referred to in the complaint at No. 828, but also attacks the conspiracy statute of the Territory of Hawaii, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, c. 243, Sections 11120-11130. It asserts inter alia that the defendants Ackerman, Stainback, Bevins and Crockett presented \u201cpurported criminal charges alleging violation of the * * * unlawful assembly and riot statute and the conspiracy statute\u201d to the grand jurors of Maui County who returned an indictment <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against the individual plaintiffs (other than Rania) based on the two statutes referred to. The complaint then makes the same allegations respecting the jury commissioners and the means employed in selecting grand juries as are set out in the complaint at No. 828 and alleges that the unlawful assembly and riot statute and the conspiracy statute are unconstitutional. The complaint then goes on to assert that the defendants in two criminal complaints entitled Territory of Hawaii v. Diego Barbosa, et al., and Territory of Hawaii v. Abraham Makekau, et al., pending in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, referred to at length hereinafter under later headings, challenged the means employed to select the grand juries of Maui County; that these challenges were heard by Judge Cristy and were disposed of unfavorably' to the defendants. It is alleged also that all the defendants in the criminal complaints referred to are plaintiffs at No. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The complaint asserts that unless the unlawful assembly and riot statute and the conspiracy statute are held to be unconstitutional and void all the plaintiffs will be deprived of their constitutional rights and \u201cthat it is necessary and imperative that this court assume jurisdiction in the matter and restrain and enjoin defendants from prosecuting or taking any further proceedings in connection with that certain indictment pending in the Circuit Court for the Second Circuit, Territory of Hawaii, entitled Territory of Hawaii v. Joseph Kaholokula, et al., being Criminal Number 2365 * * *, in order that the plaintiffs shall have an impartial, representative and democratic Grand Jury.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The complaint ends with prayers substantially identical with those of the complaint at No. 828 but the first prayer asks specifically that the defendants Ackerman, Bevins and Crockett be enjoined from prosecuting or taking any further proceedings in connection with the Kaholokula indictment, Criminal No. 2365, now pending in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Upon presentation of the complaints to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, Senior District (now Chief) Judge Metzger issued rules to show cause and restraining 'orders in the usual form. Due to circumstances over which the court had no control, delays were encountered in convening a court to dispose of the cases. Motions were filed by the defendants in both cases for more definite statements, for 'the dismissal of the actions, for summary judgments, and for dismissal of the actions as to particular defendants on the grounds of misjoinder or lack of jurisdiction. Upon the convening of a court of three judges argument was had on these motions, briefs were filed and all were considered carefully by the court. On April 19, 1948 we entered an order denying the motions to make the claims more definite and certain, for summary judgments and for dismissal of the actions. The motions for dismissal as to particular defendants on the grounds of misjoinder or lack of jurisdiction were retained by the court for further consideration. At the request of the court, counsel entered into extensive stipulations respecting many undisputed facts. Answers were filed. It was in effect agreed by the parties that the court should proceed to final hearing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendants expressly reserving all their rights, including the right to renew every objection theretofore made by them or any of them as to the jurisdiction of the court over the parties, the causes of action alleged, or in respect to any other material matter. On April 23, 1948, and on successive days thereafter, the court heard the testimony of some thirty witnesses and received a very substantial number of exhibits. On the agreement of counsel for all the parties and with the permission of the court, the already voluminous record was supplemented with further exhibits. Briefs and requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed later by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Evidence, Save as to that Relating to the Challenges to the Jury Commissioners and the Grand Juries of Maui County.</p>\n<p id=\"A-S\">For the sake of clarity we deem it desirable, if not necessary to break down the statement of facts in this opinion into two parts. The first will deal with the labor picture in Hawaii and the incidents growing out of the strikes in the sugar and pineapple industries in the Territory. We will then discuss the law applicable to those facts. The second part of the fact statement will deal specifically with the motions and challenges to the jury commissioners and to the grand juries of Maui County. The second statement of -facts will be found at a later point in this opinion and, immediately following it, a discussion of the pertinent -law.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The ILWU and the Labor Picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Hall, the Regional Director of the ILWU, testified that in 1944 the ILWU was engaged in organizing the sugar and pineapple workers in the Territory; that the ILWU, following the organizational work referred to, represented substantially all <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the sugar workers and a majority of the pineapple workers in the Islands; that the ILWU had spent about $350,000 in the organization work and that it cost between $600,000 and $700,000 to administer the union in -the course of a year and that this money was collected from dues-paying members. H-e stated also that as of 1943 the wages of the adult male workers \u2022 had been fixed at $1.84 a day by the War Food Administrator.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To this was added a 15% bonus. At the time of the trial before us the approximate daily rate of pay of plantation common laborers or plantation harvesters was \u201cwell in excess of $8.00 per day\u201d. The witness made it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>plain that in the contracts negotiated with the sugar and pineapple industries <em>by </em>the union on behalf of its members there were and are no provisions for the arbitration of wage issues and that no employer in the two industries had ever submitted a wage issue to arbitration, and that the point on which negotiations bad, ruptured, bringing on the strikes referred to&gt; was that of pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Hall testified also in substance that the enforcement of the unlawful assembly and conspiracy acts had necessitated a decision to terminate the pineapple workers\u2019 strike. He said as well that \u201c * * * during the sugar strike a considerable number of our members were charged with the violation of the Unlawful Assembly Statute, and because I was in consultation almost daily with the elected strike committee, we were informed by the workers on Maui that the charge had struck almost, you might describe it as terror into the workers involved there, because they felt that for carrying on legitimate picket activity and to face a sentence of twenty years meant that everything was being thrown at them, and the strike could not be effective.\u201d He said in respect to a contemplated strike by longshoremen, members of -the ILWU, that \u201cit would be in effect suicide for the union to attempt to strike with such a statute hanging over their heads, a statute that could easily be invoked and has been in our opinion, or where there have been minor disturbances that might have been provoked by agents provocateur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Hall\u2019s testimony stands virtually uncontradicted and we find his statements to be true. We think that we are entitled to find on this record, and we do find, that the ILWU, at all times pertinent to the instant disputes, has served and is serving as the collective bargaining agent for the sugar and pineapple workers in the Territory of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The labor picture and the sociological background of the sugar and pineapple industries in the Territory of Hawaii are indeed extraordinary. Ten owners own half of all privately owned land in Hawaii.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The tendency in both industries has been toward larger plantations and toward the elimination of the so-called \u201cadjacent planter\u201d who by his very situation has become economically dependent on the large plantation close to him. As is stated in the authority cited in footnote 9 supra and on the same page referred to in the note, \u201cThe land tenure system is quite different from that in any other part of the United States and is a legacy of the feudal system under native royalty which preceded annexation. At that time such lands as were suitable for sugar cultivation were owned in large tracts and were, therefore, leased or purchased in large tracts for plantation purposes. Nearly half of the land is still leased * * * Hawaiian sugar production from its very inception was on a larger scale than is typical of mainland farming. As the plantations have decreased in number, the output of the industry as a whole has increased in value.\u201d As the larger plantations have \u2022 pbsorbed the smaller ones, a result economically though perhaps not socially desirable, the necessity of 'the majority of the inhabitants being employed by the 'larger operating companies has increased to the point where the bulk of the population on the \u201cgrowing\u201d islands could not exist without such employment. Moreover, most, if not all, of the employees live in company houses in company towns and the tenure of their homes is dependent on their employment. Conversely, the companies cannot prosper or even operate without the labor, skilled and unskilled, of the residents of the growing islands. What has been said in respect to sugar growing is largely applicable to the pineapple industry as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The raising of sugar cane and the growing of pineapples are the two major industries of the Territory of Hawaii. A very substantial portion of the products of these industries moves in commerce to the mainland of the United States. For example the raw sugar which the Territory of Hawaii has produced and will continue to produce in such vast quantities is sent almost entirely to the mainland for proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>essing. These facts are common knowledge, of which we may take judicial notice, but see \u201cHawaii\u201d, published by the United States Department of the Interior, January .30, 1948, at pp. 8 and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The tendency in both the sugar and \u25a0pineapple industries, as the result of inexorable economic law operating against plantation owner or manager has been to compel them to get labor as cheaply as possible. To this end for over a hundred years, whether the owner or plantation manager has been native king or prince, Englishman, American or German, he has endeavored to bring into the Islands workers to cultivate his fields and harvest his crops as cheaply as possible. The nationalities imported have been Ghinese, Japanese, Koreans, Okinawans, Samoans, Filipinos, Portuguese, Spaniards and Puerto Ricans.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There are even some persons of African or Afro-American descent on the Islands. The more numerous nationalities and their several racial backgrounds 'have mixed with the Americans of Caucasian ancestry or with the native Hawaiians; they have mixed very well indeed. There is presently little, if any, purely racial strife in the Territory and most of the nationalities and their progeny have made common cause in the interest of higher wages and better working conditions against the plantation owner or operator who is generally a \u201chaole\u201d or of the haole class or group. This has not always been true. See \u201cHawaii: a History\u201d, Kuyken-dall and Day, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1948, at p. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">A satisfactory definition of the word \u201chaole\u201d is hard to encompass. It was defined by a witness<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in the instant proceedings as generally \u201ca person of mainland America[n] or of northern European, stock * * *, not a person of Portuguese, Spanish or Porto Rican descent\u201d. The word by simple dictionary definition means \u201cwhite, foreign\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Romanzo Adams, late professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii .in his book \u201cInterracial Marriage in Hawaii\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark>, put a gloss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>on the weird which we think 'is correct. Mr. Adams said that the word referred to \u201crank\u201d, rather than to \u201crace\u201d. Actually the \u201chaole\u201d group in Hawaii is not far from being co-extensive with the entrepreneur and land-owning, land-controlling group. Specifically, the \u201chaole\u201d group control the companies for which the individual plaintiffs (except Kawano and Rania) in the instant cases work. The labor relations between the land-controlling and the working groups are tense and have been so for generations. Put simply, the situation is one which calls for moderation on both sides. Extreme measures whether undertaken by the employees or by the employers have afforded and will afford no relief. Each group is dependent on the other; both must regard each other\u2019s rights and privileges.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The history of labor relations in the Territory of Hawaii has not been a happy one. On occasions that history has been bad indeed. It is certain that the 1924 strike of Filipino laborers and its attendant circumstances brought great strain to labor relations in the Territory and caused very substantial damage to them. In the eyes of the plantation owners and operators this strike was unjustifiable. It culminated in a riot at Hanapepe on the Island of Kauai in which four policemen and sixteen Filipinos were killed and a number of other persons wounded. Sixty of the seventy-six participants, who were laborers, were sentenced to prison terms, most, if not all, of them having been indicted under the unlawful assembly and riot act. Two of the defendants were sentenced to four years and eleven months imprisonment; fifty-eight were sentenced to four years imprisonment and sixteen were acquitted. See The Hawaiian Annual for 1925, and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, issues of September 9, 10, 11, 12 and 23, issues of October 10, 27 and issue of November 8, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">An extraordinary feature of the prosecutions was the fact that the territorial government was apparently without funds to conduct them and accepted the support of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters\u2019 Association to pay special prosecutors. See the Honolulu Star-Bulletin of. September 13, 1924. There was in effect an <em>arcing </em>of law enforcement from the regularly constituted territorial authorities to prosecuting attorneys employed, albeit in the name of the Territory, by the planters. The employment of special prosecutors has met with the approval of the Territorial Courts not only in cases involving labor disputes but in other criminal cases as well. It is an undesirable custom of long standing whereby on occasion the administration of public justice has in effect been brought into the hands of the private property owner. It has occurred most frequently, perhaps, in criminal cases growing out of such labor disputes as the Hanapepe incident. See Territory v. Soga, 20 Haw. 71. As to cases not involving labor disputes see Territory v. Robello, 20 Haw. 7, and Territory v. Chong Chak Lai, 19 Haw. 437, Ann.Cas. 1912B, 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The facts stated in the foregoing paragraphs are notorious and we take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>judicial notice of them since they occurred within this jurisdiction. Contemporaneous accounts may be employed by the court on analogy to refreshing recollection. See Brown v. Piper, 91 U.S. 37, 42, 23 L.Ed. 200. It is interesting to note the Territorial law on this subject. See The Estate of His Majesty Kamehameha IV, 2 Haw. 715, 718, and Bishop v. Mahiko, 35 Haw. 608, 618-624. We think that the Filipino workers\u2019 strike and its attendant circumstances resulted in the amendment to Section 4351 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1925, effected by the Act of March 15, 1929, Laws of the Territory of Hawaii, Regular Session 1929, Act 4, p. 3, whereby the term of imprisonment which could be imposed for violation of the unlawful assembly and riot act of Hawaii was raised from five years to twenty years and we so find. The sentences of the convicted strikers had expired just as the Legislature convened in 1929 and there was evident fear that when these men returned to their people on Kauai some form of demonstration or labor trouble might result. The unlawful assembly and riot act of the Territory of Hawaii is discussed at length under a later heading of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Incidents Which Led to the Instant Suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The complaints and the indictments referred to in the pleadings and evidence in the cases at bar grow out of a number of occurrences, some involving a measure of violence, which arose in turn from strikes in the sugar and pineapple industries. The first occurrence, upon which defendants in the cases at bar lay considerable emphasis, took place at Paia on the Island of Maui and is referred to by common agreement as the \u201cPaia incident\u201d. Others took place on the Island of Lanai (part of Maui County), one at 'the Kaumalapau harbor and wharf, the loading place for Lanai City, another occurring at or near Lanai City itself. These are generally described as the \u201cLanai incidents\u201d. There were other occurrences (some on the Island of Oahu) germane to the issues of the law presented by the instant cases and certain of these will be discussed hereinafter. A strike of the sugar workers in the Territory of Hawaii commenced on September 1 and lasted until November 19, 1946.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This strike in effect was won by the union. A strike of the pineapple workers of the Territory commenced on July 10 and continued to and including July 15, 1947. This strike was lost by the union primarily because of the enforcement of the unlawful assembly and riot act.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The Paia Incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">We will deal first with the Paia incident which occurred on October 16, 1946 while, the sugar workers\u2019 strike was in progress.. Maui Agricultural Company is a sugar company having its mill at Paia on the Island of Maui, Maui County. A public highway known as -Baldwin Avenue lies between the company\u2019s office and its milk Prior to October 16, 1946 there had been extensive picketing of the company\u2019s mill with but little, if any, police interference. The hour set for the commencement of mill operations on the day the incident occurred was 7:00 a. m. Before the mill whistle blew, five persons, long-time residents of' Maui and union men who had gone out on. strike, appeared on -the scene, desiring to-\u2022return to work. One of them, Moniz, on the previous day had requested of Captain. Long of the Paia police detail protection-in getting through the pickets to go- to work. After receiving this request Long-had followed Moniz across the street to-the picket line in front of the mill but the-pickets stood shoulder to shoulder and\u2019 would not let Moniz through though requested to do so both by him and by Long. Moniz then said that he was coming back \u201cto go to work tomorrow!\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Long reported this matter to Assistant Chief of Police Andrew Freitas and on the following day, the 16th, Freitas went to-the scene with additional men of the regular police force from the Wailuku District.. When the police arrived \u201corderly picket<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ing\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was going on. There was a line on the mill side of the street in double column. A few minutes after 6:45 a. m. the line at the mill entrance was increased to four columns, the' number of pickets being between three and four hundred. After certain preliminary conversations between members of the ILWU, Kealoha,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Joseph Kaholokula,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and others, respecting the entry of the five workmen to the mill it was stated by Kaholokula that if the five men tried to cross the picket line, \u201cpolice .or no police\u201d, there would be violence and bloodshed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">When the mill whistle blew the five men started across the street toward the mill entrance escorted by the police. Nelson Souza, one of the men seeking admittance, was ahead with Captain Long beside him. About two hundred of the pickets left the picket line and converged, blocking the rdad and the mill entrance. Souza tried to get through the line at the point where Awana<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was but the latter braced himself and the mass of union men, without using their hands, pushed the group seeking entrance to the mill back about five feet. At this point both Freitas and Kaholokula called out that the men should stop the fracas, be quiet and listen. Freitas then read to the crowd Section 11773 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which provides a rather substantial penalty for \u201cLoitering\u201d. Thereafter, a second attempt was made by the five men and the police to get through the line of union men and into the mill. Awana, who previously had kept his -arms on his breast, this time stretched them out to enlarge the barrier: No blows were struck but the group of five workmen and the police were pushed ten to twelve feet back across the avenue. Freitas asked the five workmen if they desired to try to get into the mill again and they replied that they did not wish to make a third attempt. Freitas then informed the union men that the attempt to put the five workmen into the mill was over, and he and Kaholokula had breakfast together and in fact exchanged congratulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that the incident had come to an end without physical injury to any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">After this occurrence picketing continued at Paia until the issuance by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit of an ex parte temporary injunction in Maui Agricultural Company, Limited v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, et al., Equity No. 325, limiting even peaceful picketing to three persons, the court stating in its opinion that picketing should be so restricted because of the territorial statute relating to unlawful assembly. See pp. 91-2 of the transcript of record in the appeal in the case of International Longshoremen\u2019s Union v. Wirtz, 9 Cir., 170 F. 2d 183, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Logically, under the provisions of the statute as they will appear hereinafter, Judge Wirtz should have restricted picketing to two persons, not three. An application was made to Supreme Court of the Territory for a writ of prohibition to issue against Judge Wirtz of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit of the Territory of Hawaii to compel him to vacate the injunction. In International Longshoremen\u2019s Warehousemen\u2019s Union et al. v. Wirtz et al., 37 Haw. 404, rehearing denied, 37 Haw. 445,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Supreme Court of Hawaii, holding that the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101\u2014 115, was not applicable to the territorial courts of Hawaii,, refused to issue a writ of prohibition against Judge Wirtz to compel him to vacate the ex parte injunction restricting picketing previously referred to. The decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii was affirmed, as we have said, by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It should be noted that Judge Wirtz\u2019 decision constitutes an important contemporaneous construction of the application of the unlawful assembly and riot act.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Following the Paia incident a complaint was sworn out before a district magistrate and subsequently seventy-eight members of the ILWU were arrested. The complaint is not in the record before us but there is evidence from which we find that it was based on the unlawful assembly and riot act. Later an indictment<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> charging seventy-eight persons<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> with violation of the unlawful assembly and riot act was returned by the 1946 grand jury of the Second Judicial Circuit of the Territory of Hawaii (Maui County) on October 30, 1946. Of these persons, at least seventy-five were members of the ILWU. Seventy-five of these defendants are plaintiffs at our No. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Benjamin Awana, one of the plaintiffs at No. 836, testified that to his knowledge four persons who were named as defendants in the 1946 indictment were not present at the time the incident occurred. He named these four as (Dondo) Tomita, Hitoshi Sera, Johnny Nishimura and Frank Matsui. His testimony in this regard is substantiated in part by the fact that three of the four individuals whom he named, viz., Tomita, Nishimura and Matsui, were not included in the subsequent indictment of December 2, 1947 returned by the Maui County grand jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We find as a fact that the three individuals last named were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>not present during the occurrence of the Paia incident. But it is to be noted that Tomka, Nishimura and Matsui were under indictment, charged with violation of the unlawful assembly and riot act for more than a year before the Supreme Court of Hawaii held the indictment to be invalid for reasons stated hereinafter. See Territory of Hawaii v. Kaholokula, et al., 37 Haw. 625. See also the facts relating to the finding of the indictment of December 2, 1947 under the next heading of this opinion. Roy Yasunaga, who also was named in the first indictment, was omitted in the second. No reason for the omission is supplied by the record. It is probable that he also, though arrested because of the Paia incident, took no part therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The facts last stated are of importance because of the very wide net which the police and prosecuting officers of Maui County threw about the workers who were on strike. This point will be amplified when the first Lanai incident is discussed. The arrests following both the Paia incident and the first Lanai incident were in fact made in mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">It is desirable to point out here that Freitas and the other police officers had no intention of invoking prosecution of the strikers under the unlawful assembly- and riot statute of the Territory at the time of the happening of the Paia incident or until they, had conferred with Deputy County Attorney Wendell F. Crockett of Maui County to determine the form which \u25a0 the complaint should take. We find Assistant Chief of Police Freitas to be a most credible witness and we accept his testimony with but one minor exception as indicated in note 25, infra. He stated that in Maui County complaints are prepared by the police and are taken to the County Attorney\u2019s office for perusal. Freitas stated that Mr. Crockett instructed him to make up the complaint in question \u201cto read unlawful assembly\u201d. W\u2019hile we recognize the duty of a prosecuting officer to determine the form and the substance of a complaint, the invocation, of the unlawful assembly and riot statute possesses unusual significance when viewed in the light of other pertinent circumstances of the cases at bar.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Facts Relating to the Testing of the Constitutionality of the Unlawful Assembly and Riot Statute by Kaholokula and Others.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The defendants named in the indictment of October 30, 1946, Joseph Kaholokula, et al., contested the validity of the unlawful assembly and riot act and the sufficiency of the indictment in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit. When these issues were decided unfavorably to them in that court they took an appeal to the Supreme Court of Hawaii. This appeal was possible by virtue of Section 9531, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, which provides for an appeal of an interlocutory order of a nisi prius court. The Supreme Court on November 26, 1947 held the statute to be constitutional but ruled also that the indictment was insufficient in that it contained no allegations of \u201cthe acts done or actually begun to be done in furtherance of the unlawful assembly.\u201d- See Territory of Hawaii v. Kaholokula et al., supra, 37 Haw. at page 642. It should be noted that the Supreme Court of Hawaii held also that a riot is an offense under the act though no order to disperse, by proclamation or otherwise, has been given or made. See 37 Haw. at pages 638, 639. Kaholokula and all of his co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>defendants in the indictment of October 30, 1946, except Pias, deceased, and four others, Matsui, Nishimura, Dondo Tomita and Yasunaga, were reindicted by the 1947 grand jury of the Grcuit Court of the Second Circuit, at No. 2365, for breach of the unlawful assembly and riot statute in count 1, and for conspiracy to, commit a felony, third degree, in count 2. Masao Sera was also named in the second indictment. It should -be noted that there had been no remittitur by the Supreme Court to the Circuit Count in the Kaholokula case referred to before Kaholokula, his former co-defendants and one additional defendant, were indicted by the 1947 Maui County grand jury for offenses growing out of the Paia incident. These facts must be referred to again at a later point of this opinion. The prosecution of Kaholokula and his co-defendants under the new indictment has not been proceeded with because of the temporary restraint issued by this court at No. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The Yamauchi Incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Mac Masato Yamauchi, a carpenter employed at the Pioneer Mill Company, Ltd. at Lahaina, was also charged with violation of the unlawful assembly and riot statute. See the two complaints against Yamauchi and others, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 5. Yamauchi\u2019s actions were a contributing, if not the primary, cause of an assault and battery upon certain other employees of Pioneer who were set upon by a large number of other strikers in order to prevent further irrigation from an irrigation ditch. The complaint states that the offenses occurred on November 6, 1946. Yamauchi and those who allegedly acted under his orders were named by the 1946 Maui County grand jury in two indictments returned on December 12, 1946. The first indictment, numbered 2379, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 6, contained three counts, \u201cRiot\u201d, \u201cConspiracy-Third Degree\u201d and \u201cAssault and Battery\u201d. The second indictment, numbered 2380 but also designated as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 6, contained similar counts. Yamauchi pleaded nolle contendere to the assault and battery charges, and the other charges, riot and conspiracy, were nolle pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The Lanai Incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">While the Kaholokula case was pending in the Supreme Court of Hawaii there occurred the incidents on the Island of Lanai referred to in the complaint at our No. 828. The individual plaintiffs at No. 828, other than Kawano, were employed by the Hawaiian Pineapple Company at or near Lanai City, Maui County, at the times when the incidents occurred. We will deal immediately with that Lanai incident which occurred first.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The Hawaiian Pineapple Company owns the Island of Lanai. The Island is entirely populated by employees of the jompany and their families, totaling about 4000 persons. See \u201cHawaii\u201d, p. 11, published by the United States Department of the Interior, supra. The company maintains a wharf at Kaumalapau Harbor about seven miles distant from Lanai City to the end that the pineapples harvested on its plantations in and about Lanai City may be shipped to market. Pineapples are brought from the fields in specially constructed bins ready to be loaded on a pineapple barge when one is brought to dock. On the day of the incident, July 14, 1947, about eleven<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> bins of pineapples, picked before the strike on the plantations of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company and brought to Kaumalapau Harbor, lay on the dock. The company intended to trans-ship them to a barge which was about to be brought into the harbor. A white line, a kapu<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> line, had been painted on the land side of the road to designate the outer boundary of the company\u2019s property.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Kapu </em>signs were posted along this line. About 3:00 P.M. there were fifteen or sixteen men near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>wharf, sitting on the sea wall. About 3 :- 30 P.M. truck loads of union men began to arrive at the wharf until there were about three hundred present. There was some picketing. About 4:00 P.M. the expected barge came in and was secured to the wharf. The picketing which had ceased temporarily began again headed by five union \u201cpicket policemen\u201d, one of whom was Diego Barbosa.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While this was going on employees of the company, who ordinarily worked in supervisory capacities and who were non-union men, -began to take positions on and about the bins, obviously with the intention of loading the pineapples on the barge. Among these employees were Harrington and Johnson. Another supervisory employee, Fernandes, started to operate the -crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">'Barbosa ran toward the pineapple, bins and across -the <em>kapu </em>line, signaling for the other men to follow him. All the men, as they crossed the <em>kapu </em>line, according to Freitas\u2019 testimony, yelled at the tops of their voices. Some of them mounted the bin on which Johnson and Harrington were working. Johnson escaped without injury but Harrington was punched and beaten about the head and body as was demonstrated by the motion picture film shown to this court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The men who mounted the bins, broke them open and threw pineapples at the men on the tug and the barge. The supervisor, Fernandes, who had started to operate the crane, ran away pursued \u25a0by at least fifteen men who punched at him. He was chased down a,stairway to a lower portion of the wharf where he fell or jumped into the water. As he swam away his attackers threw pineapples at him, though none -of these actually struck him. Another nonunion employee, Charles Marquis,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> was also forced into the water but reached the protection of the barge. Freitas had only five police officers with him. He told Bar-bosa to call off his men, saying that the work would stop. Barbosa called the men back to the sea wall or road. The incident lasted about five minutes, the barge then leaving -the pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">Motion pictures were taken at the wharf by a police officer, by an engineer and draftsman employed by the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, and by a school principal. Stills were printed in Honolulu from the motion picture negatives. Some arrests for participation in the incident were made on the basis of reports by the police officers who were present and eleven persons, including Barbosa, were named in a criminal complaint, dated July 16, 1947, based on the unlawful assembly -and riot act.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> On August 1, 1947, about two weeks after the incident, a complaint was filed against Agli-am and fifty-one additional defendants.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This complaint also was based on the unlawful assembly and riot Act<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and will be referred to' hereinafter from -time to time as the Agliam case. Before the preliminary hearing m the District Court<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> four persons were dropped <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and after the preliminary hearing, the names of twelve more defendants were removed from the Agliam complaint.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The remaining thirty-six were held for action of the Maui County grand jury. The grand jury has not yet acted in respect to the case of Barbosa, et al., due to the restraining order issued by this court at No. 828, or in respect to the case of Agliam, et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Assistant Chief of Police Freitas testified on cross-examination in this court that a number of pictures were taken at the harbor both before and after the incident as well as during it. He was asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that a large number of pictures were taken after everything was pau [finished] \u201d ? He replied, \u201cYes, there were pictures taken afterwards.\u201d We find it to be a fact that a number of persons came to the scene presumably out of curiosity after the incident was over. Freitas testified that \u201call these pictures\u201d were used in compiling the list of names in the complaint sworn to by him before the magistrate. One individual, Aki, was present during the incident but took no part in it. He was arrested nonetheless. He was not a member of the ILWU at the time. A police officer, Lieutenant Madeiros, told Aki that he was surprised that he was arrested at all as he was not a union man. Aki was quickly discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">It will be observed that sixty-three persons were subjected to criminal process by reason of the Lanai incident and that only forty-seven of them were finally held for action of a grand jury. Again the law enforcement officers of Maui County threw a very wide net.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Deputy County Attorney for Maui County as before instructed Freitas to cause the complaints to charge violations of the unlawful assembly and riot act.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Barbosa and the others named in the complaint, Exhibit D attached to the complaint at our No. 828, filed certain motions and challenges to the 1947 Maui County grand jury.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> This matter must be referred to again at a later point in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The Kalua Incident at Lanai City.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The second incident on the Island of Lanai <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> occurred early in the morning of July IS, 1947. Its' victims were Jacob Kalua Na'hinu and Sam Kalua.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Both roomed in House No. 7 in Block 33, Lanai City, and were truck drivers employed by the Hawaiian Pineapple Company. Neither had gone out on strike. Shortly after S :30 A. M. twenty to twenty-five persons, most of whom must be assumed to have been strikers since they were headed by \u201cunion police\u201d with arm bands, proceeded to administer a severe beating to Jacob and when his brother, Sam, attempted to rescue him, he too was beaten.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Jacob was caught between the house and the communal washroom. The Kalua brothers were able to identify only five persons who were arrested on a complaint made the same day. The persons arrested were Abraham Make-kau<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and four others. They were committed to await, action of the grand jury. This complaint<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> also was based upon the unlawful assembly and riot act. The prosecution of Makekau and his co-defendants has not been proceeded with by reason of the restraint issued by this court at No. 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Makekau and his co-defendants joined with Barbosa' and his co-defendants in filing the motions and challenges to the 1947 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Maui County grand jury as mentioned in the last paragraph of the preceding subheading.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Incidents Occurring in and About the City and County of Honolulu During the Pineapple Workers\u2019 Strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">There was testimony that one Sibolboro and seven others were arrested for obstructing a highway in the City and County of Honolulu on July 13, 1947. Sibolboro lay down in front of a truck, preventing it from proceeding on the highway. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment but sentence was suspended. Eighty-three other persons were also arrested as the result of another incident in the County of Honolulu on the same Sunday and charged with obstructing a highway at Turner\u2019s Switch. These charges were later nolle .pressed.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Excessive Bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In numerous instances the bail required of the defendants, plaintiffs herein, in criminal proceedings growing out of the strikes, seems to us to have been so large as to be excessive. Pedro De La Cruz testified that he was president of Local 152 and had the duty of making bail with union funds for union members charged with the violations of law hereinbefore referred to in this opinion. He testified that Makekau and the four others arrested with him and charged with unlawful assembly and riot were required to make bail in the amount of $1,000 apiece;<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> that Diego Barbosa and one of the ten other persons arrested with him for violation of the unlawful assembly and riot act were required to give bail in the amount of $1,000 apiece; three of them were granted bail in the amount of $500 apiece; and the remaining defendants were granted bail in the amount of $250 apiece.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> It should be noted that Shigeto Minami, who had nothing to do with the Kamaulapau Harbor incident, save his appearance at the scene perhaps three hours before the incident occurred, was held in bail of $100, though released after subsequent hearings.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Even in the Makekau case, growing out of the assaults on the brothers Kalua, bail set in the amount of $1,000 a defendant seems too high. The requirement of bail in such an amount for an assault and battery would seem to be unusual even on the eastern and western seaboards of the United States. There is but little chance for a defendant under bail to escape from the Territory of Hawaii or even from Maui County by reason of geographical isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The Use of the Unlawful Assembly and Riot Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">It will be observed that the unlawful assembly and riot statute has been extensively, and indeed almost continuously, invoked by the law enforcement officers of Maui County against members of the ILWU during the course of the sugar and pineapple strikes; indeed, on occasions and under circumstances, for example those in connection with the Kalua brothers and the Ya-mauchi incidents, when the invocation of the statute seems inappropriate. The record demonstrates a leaning on the part of the law enforcement authorities of Maui County toward the use of the unlawful assembly and riot act when a statute like the assault and battery act, Chapter 239, Sections 11050-11060, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, would, we think, have been employed if the motive for prosecution had been only the maintenance of good order in the community and the punishment of minor law breakers. Certainly, the penalty provisions of Chapter 239 must be deemed to be adequate for those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">Wendell F. Crockett, Esquire, the Deputy County Attorney of Maui County and a defendant at both Nos. 828 and 836, testified before this court. We found him to be a most credible and intelligent witness. He was asked<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> by the attorney for the plaintiffs, \u201cIn your experience of thirty years as deputy county attorney for the County of Maui, have you ever prosecuted any person for unlawful assembly and riot except as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>grew out of a labor dispute ? \u201d He replied: \u201cTo my recollection except for the present cases, there was only one case prosecuted in the County of Maui for unlawful assembly, and that grew out of an alleged kidnapping that took place during a labor dispute.\u201d We have found but one reported case -in which the unlawful assembly and riot act was invoked in a case which did not involve a labor dispute. This is Republic of Hawaii v. Carvalho, 10 Haw. 446, which involved a riot among Portuguese members of the island community. This case, as indicated, was prior to annexation and occurred during the life of the Republic of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">No evidence was offered by the defendants to rebut Mr. Crockett\u2019s testimony on this very important point. Since one of the major issues in the instant cases is the good faith of the prosecutions instituted against the individual plaintiffs by the Territory under the unlawful assembly and riot act, had rebutting testimony been available, assuredly it would have been brought forward by the able attorneys for the defendants ; evidence, not only as to the unlawful assembly and riot act being employed against groups other than labor groups in Maui County but in any other part of the Territory of Hawaii as well. In the absence of such rebutting testimony we a're entitled to find and we do find, that the unlawful assembly and riot act has been employed by the Territory only against lab- or groups in labor disputes, at least for the last three decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Mr. Crockett testified also that 'he would proceed with the prosecutions of the plaintiffs as soon as circumstances would enable him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The Law, Save that Relating to the Motions and Challenges to the Jury Commissioners and Grand Juries of Maui County.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The challenges to the grand jury commissioners and to the grand juries of Maui County, as we have said, will be treated under a later heading since these subjects are separated to a considerable degree from the facts and the law relating to the incidents hereinbefore referred to and to the unlawful assembly and riot act and the conspiracy statute of the Territory. We will deal first with our authority to sit as a three-judge court pursuant to the authority of revised Title 28, and then with the attacks on the constitutionality of the two territorial statutes last referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">As to Our Authority to Sit as a Court of Three Judges Under Section. 2281 of Revised Title 28 U.S.G.A., or as a Court of Three Judges Sitting En Banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\"> We state in limine that we are of the opinion that the provisions of revised Title 28 U.S.C.A., effective September 1, 1948, are applicable in the cases at bar. See Section 38 of the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646, 62 Stat. 992, Section 1 of which enacted revised Title 28. While it is true that the provisions of the revised Title were not in effect at the time the suits at bar were filed or when they were heard, we deem this fact to be immaterial. It is important only that the provisions of revised Title 28 are in force at the time of our decision. We have functioned as a three-judge revised Title 28, Section 2281 court in adjudicating the issues presented by the pleadings and the evidence in the instant cases. Congress by enactment of revised Title 28 saw fit to change the status of the United States District Court for Hawaii while the present litigations were pending by enacting revised Title 28, Sections 451, 133 and 134(a). The parties, however, cannot complain respecting the new enactment which changed the status of this court since they do not suffer \u201c * * * loss of rights, interruption of jurisdiction, or prejudice * * * \u201d in the pending matters. See Section 2(b) of the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646, 62 Stat. 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">The parties in fact do not make any complaint respecting the changed status of this court, though their arguments, both written and oral, in large part have been based upon the provisions of the Judicial Code of 1911. We can function only pursuant to the powers conferred upon us by Congress and therefore we must decide the pending cases under the provisions of revised Title 28 if we are to make the decisions. A helpful analogy is supplied, we think, by those authorities which hold that procedural amendments are to be applied to pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cases. See Schoen v. Mountain Producers Corporation, 3 Cir., 170 F.2d 707; McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U.S. 102, 19 S.Ct. 134, 43 L.Ed. 382; State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 59 U.S. 421, 15 L.Ed. 435, and Hodges v. Snyder, 261 U.S. 600, 43 S.Ct. 435, 67 L.Ed. 819. Cf. Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U.S. 506, 36 S.Ct. 202, 60 L.Ed. 409; Baltimore &amp; P. Railroad Co. v. Grant, 98 U.S. 398, 401, 402, 25 L.Ed. 231; Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Kalin, 4 Cir., 77 F.2d 50, 51, 52; and Link v. Receivers of Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co., 4 Cir., 73 F.2d 149, 151. We can find no authority strictly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">The critical language of Section 2281 of revised Title 28,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> states that no interlocutory injunction or final order restraining the enforcement \u201cof any State statute\u201d by \u201cany officer of such State\u201d shall be granted except \u201cby a district court of three judges\u201d as provided by Section 2284. Cf. the provisions of Section 266 of the old Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Code.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> It will be observed therefore that there are two barriers which must be cleared before the jurisdiction of this court, sitting as a three judge Section 2281 tribunal, becomes plain. The first is in the use of the word \u201cState\u201d in Section 2281 and in Sections 2283 and 2284. May it be said that the unlawful assembly and riot act and the conspiracy statute of the Territory of Hawaii are statutes of a \u201cState\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> or \u201cState statutes\u201d within the purview of the sections? The second barrier lies in the nature of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Is it \u201ca district court\u201d within the applicable language of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We will discuss the second question first and are aided in determining it by additional pertinent sections of revised Title 28. Section 451 provides, \u201cAs used in this title: The term \u2018court of the United States\u2019 includes the Supreme Court of the United States, * * * [and] district courts constituted by chapter 5 of\u2019this title, including the district courts of the United States for the districts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>* * * \u201d ; \u201cThe terms \u2018district court\u2019 and \u2018district court of the United States\u2019 mean the courts constituted by chapter 5 of this title\u201d ; and \u201cThe term \u2018district\u2019 and \u2018judicial district\u2019 mean the districts enumerated in Chapter 5 of this title.\u201d Turning to Chapter 5, Section 91, we find that the statute provides, \u201cHawaii constitutes one judicial district which includes the Midway Islands, Wake Island * * Section 132 provides for the creation and composition of district courts and states, inter alia, that \u201cThere shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district\u201d See subparagraph (a). Section 133 states that \u201cThe President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial districts, as follows: * * * Hawaii * * * 2 * * * [and that only] citizens of the Territory of Hawaii who have resided therein for at least three years next preceding shall be eligible for appointment as district judges \u25a0 for the district of Hawaii.\u201d Section 134 (a) provides that \u201cThe district judges, except in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, shall hold office during good behavior. The district judges in Hawaii and Puerto Rico shall hold office for terms of six and eight years, respectively, and until their successors are appointed and qualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">In view of the foregoing, whatever may have been the status of the district Court for Hawaii prior to September 1, 1948, the effective date of revised Title 28, there can be no doubt that the court is now a \u201cdistrict court of the United States\u201d in all respects pertinent to the instant question and for the application of Sections 2281, 2283 and 2284. Cf. Mookini v. United States, 303 U.S. 201, 205, 58 S.Ct. 543, 82 L.Ed. 748; Ex parte Collins, 277 U.S. 565, 567, 48 S.Ct. 585, 72 L.Ed. 990, and Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 248-254, 61 S.Ct. 480, 85 L.Ed. 800. Congress has seen fit to cover, coordinate and integrate the District Courts for Hawaii and Puerto Rico into the federal court system as far as this can be done without constitutional amendment. True, these district courts remain legislative tribunals created by Congress in the exercise of its \u201csovereign congressional faculty\u201d under Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States instead of \u201ctrue United States court\u201d authorized by Article III. See Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 312, 42 S. Ct. 343, 348, 66 L.Ed. 627. No constitutional provision limits the coordination and integration here conceived of and made operable by Congress. The District Court for Hawaii therefore must be held to be a \u201cdistrict court\u201d within the purview of the sections of revised Title 28 referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">The second question, i. e., the effect to be attributed to the use of the word \u201cState\u201d, remains for disposition, however. It is indeed a difficult one. There is no doubt that in organizing the Territory of Hawaii Congress saw fit to give to the local government broad domestic powers separating its operations from those of the federal government within the Territory, and that it bestowed upon the Territory a form of organization more like that of a State than had previously been given to any other area.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> See Alesna v. Rice, D. C. Haw., 69 F.Supp. 897, 899, citing People of Puerto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Rico v. Shell Co., 302 U.S. 253, 58 S.Ct. 167, 82 L.Ed. 235. See also Alesna v. Rice, D.C., 74 F.Supp. 865. It is also clear that Congress recognized the distinction between the territorial courts and the United States District Court for the Territory of Hawaii. See Section 86 of the Organic Act, as amended<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> by Section 8 of the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646. As early as 1901 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Wilder\u2019s S. S. Co. v. Hind, 108 F. 113, 116, perceived that distinction, stating, \u201cThe system of courts created by the [Organic] act for the territory of Hawaii differs radically from the system of courts which congress had theretofore created for any of the territories. In no other territory has there been a division of jurisdiction between cases which properly belong to courts of the United States and other cases. Congress found in the republic of Hawaii a system of courts already established, whose jurisdiction was complete, and from the highest tribunal of which there was no appeal. To that system congress, by the act, added -a district court, conferring upon it the jurisdiction which pertains to the district and circuit courts of the United States, and providing for removing to that court from the territorial courts causes which under the removal acts were removable from a state court to a court of the United States.\u201d See also Ex parte Wilder\u2019s Steamship Company, 183 U.S. 545, 22 S. Ct. 225, 46 L.Ed. 321. It is interesting to note that the general principle established by Wilder\u2019s case was early made applicable to <em>habeas corpm </em>proceedings in the District Court of the Territory by a series of cases holding that the federal rule against interference with criminal proceedings in the Territorial Courts might prevent the issuance of the writ except in cases of peculiar urgency. See In the matter of Marshall, 1 D.C.Haw. 34, 37-42; In the matter of Atcherley, 3 D.C.Haw. 404; Soga v. Jarrett, 3 D.C.Haw. 502, 504; In re Curran, 4 D.C.Haw, 730, 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The language of Section 86 of the Organic Act as amended by Section 8 of the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646, provides that, <em>\u201cThe laws of the United States relating to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>removal of causes, appeals and other <em>matters and proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the several States shall govern in such matters and proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the Territory of </em>Hawaii\u201d,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> seems to support the conclusion that a statute of Hawaii was intended by Congress to be treated as if it were a statute of a State. True, \u201cremoval of causes\u201d is included in Section 86 and it is on this phraseology that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Yeung v. Territory of Hawaii, 132 F.2d 374, can be bottomed. But the last phrase of Section 86, \u201cother matters and proceedings\u201d, is as powerfully inclusive as if the word \u201call\u201d had been expressly inserted before the word \u201cother\u201d. If the laws of the United States are to govern in all matters, both procedural and jurisdictional, it surely was the intent of Congress to treat the United States District Court for Hawaii as if, procedurally and jurisdictionally, though within the framework of the Constitution, it were in fact a district Court of the United States, and also to treat the Territory of Hawaii insofar as its relations to that court are concerned as if it were in fact a State of the United States. If this be so it would follow that a statute passed by the Legislature of the Territory of Hawaii is to be tried and tested by a three-judge Section 2281 court as if it were in fact a statute enacted by a State of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The Territory of Hawaii, like the Territory of Alaska, and perhaps in contradistinction to Puerto Rico, is a fully \u201corganized\u201d territory. Puerto Rico may possibly still retain a lingering status of a \u201cpossession\u201d or quasi territory though this is to be doubted. See Balzac v. Porto Rico, supra, 258 U.S. at page 309, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627. Cf. Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516, 25 S.Ct. 514, 49 L.Ed. 862. See also Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138, 148, 248 S.Ct. 808, 49 L.Ed. 128, 1 Ann.Cas. 697, and Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 305, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088, the concgrring opinion of Mr. Justice White. See the provisions of the Organic Act of Puerto Rico, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 731 et seq. Section 35 of the Organic Act of Puerto Rico as it stood prior to the amendment effected by Section 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 864, was comparable to Section 86 of the Organic Act of Hawaii as it is now and as it was prior to amendment. We can find no valid basis of distinction between the decision of this court in the Mo Hock Ke Lok Po v. Stainback, 74 F.Supp. 852, and that of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Benedicto v. West India &amp; Panama Telegraph Co., 256 F. 417, 418, 419. But see Munoz v. Porto Rico Ry. Light &amp; Power Co., 1 Cir., 83 F.2d 262, 264-267. Cf. Sancho v. Bacardi Corporation of America, 1 Cir., 109 F.2d 57, modified and affirmed in part and reversed in part in Bacardi Corp. of America v. Domenech, 311 U.S. 150, 167, 61 S.Ct 219, 85 L.Ed. 98. See also Territory of Alaska v. Troy, 258 U.S. 101, 42 S. Ct. 241, 66 L.Ed. 487, and Dooley v. United States, 183 U.S. 151, 22 S.Ct. 62, 46 L.Ed. 128. There is of course high authority for construing the word \u201cterritory\u201d employed in a statute under some circumstances as if it were in fact the word \u201cState\u201d. See the very recent decision of the Supreme Court in Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740, 745, 68 S.Ct. 880, See for example United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, 385, 4 L. Ed. 404; Talbott v. Board of Com\u2019rs Silver Bow County, 139 U.S. 438, 444, 11 S.Ct. 594, 35 L.Ed. 210, and Wynne v. United States, 217 U.S. 234, 30 S.Ct. 447, 54 L.Ed. 748. Cf. Alesna v. Rice, supra, and Hall v. Hawaiian Pineapple Co., D.C.Haw., 72 F.Supp. 533, and of course, the Mo Hock Ke Lok Po decision itself. Compare the recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in International Longshoremen\u2019s Union v. Wirtz,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> supra, affirming the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union et al. v. Wirtz et al., 37 Haw. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Much of course can be said upon the other side. We find three cases exceedingly troublesome; Phillips v. United States, supra, Mookini v. United States, supra, and Ex parte Collins, supra. The first decision, which is relied on strongly in Chief Judge Denman\u2019s dissenting opinion in the Mo Hock Ke Lok Po case points out that Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tion 266 of the old Judicial Code was not [74 F.Supp. 861] \u201ca measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but as an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such.\u201d 312 U.S. at page 251, 61 S.Ct. at page 483, 85 L.Ed. 800. Mr. Justice Frankfurter then went on to say, \u201cTo bring this procedural device into play \u2014 to' dislocate the normal operations of the system of lower federal courts and thereafter to come directly to this Court \u2014 requires a suit which seeks to interpose the Constitution against enforcement of a state policy, whether such policy is defined in a state constitution or in an ordinary statute or through the delegated legislation of an \u2018administrative board or commission\u2019. The crux of the business is procedural protection against an improvident state-wide doom by a federal court of a state\u2019s legislative policy. This was the aim of Congress and this is the reconciling principle of the cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In the Mookini case the Supreme Court, by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, decided that the provisions of Section 86 of the Organic Act of Hawaii, as it existed prior to the recent amendment, was not decisive in requiring the Criminal Appeals Rules prescribed by the Supreme Court for district courts of the United States to be applied in the District Court of Hawaii. See 303 U. S. at page 205, 58 S.Ct. 543, 82 L.Ed. 748. This decision must now be read in the light of the provisions of revised Title 28. As we have demonstrated Congress has seen fit to obliterate procedural and jurisdictional distinctions between the two types of courts bestowing on the District Court of Hawaii insofar as Congress could by legislation the jurisdiction of a constitutional court. Congress had looked in this direction for some time having provided by Section 86 of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 642, prior to the recent amendment, that the District Court of Hawaii \u201c * * * shall have the jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, and shall proceed * * * \u25a0 in the same manner as a district court * *</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In Ex parte Collins, supra, the Supreme Court, by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is, pointing out that the provisions of Section 266 were intended to restrain the enforcement [277 U.S. 565, 48 S.Ct. 586] \u201cof a statute of a state\u201d, said that it \u201cwas intended to embrace a limited class of cases of special importance and requiring special treatment in the interest of the public.\u201d In footnote 1, 277 U.S. at page 567, 48 S.Ct. at page 586, 72 L.Ed. 990, Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is pointed out that the amendment to the Commerce Act, which 'later 'became Section 266, \u201c * * * evidently recognizes the superior degree of consideration and sanction which should be given to a state statute-, and [Section 266] prevents hasty interference with the action of a sovereign state\u201d, citing 45 Cong. Rec. 7253. See also 277 U.S. at pages 567-569, 48 S.Ct. 585, 72 L. Ed. 990. It is true that as used in the Constitution of the United States the word \u201cstate\u201d has been held to mean \u201cstate\u201d as a member of the Union. See Hepburn &amp; Dundas v. Ellzey, 2 Cranch 445, 451, 2 L. Ed. 332; Corporation of New Orleans v. Winter, 1 Wheat. 91, 94, 4 L.Ed. 44, and Hooe v. Jamieson, 166 U.S. 395, 17 S.Ct. 596, 41 L.Ed. 1049. Cf. Enes v. Hoopai, Chief of Police, 38 Haw. 126, 134-140.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The matter is further complicated by various appeal provisions. As we have pointed out, Section 86 of the Organic Act, see note 54, supra, requires that appeals from the District Court for Hawaii should be had and allowed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the same manner as from district courts to the respective courts of appeals as provided by law. A proceeding under Section 2281 of revised Title 28, like one under Section 266 of the old Judicial Code, affords a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. See Section 1253 of revised Title 28 providing for direct appeal to the Supreme Court from decisions of a three-judge court. But see also Section 1294 of revised Title 28 which provides for appeals from decisions of the district and territorial courts to the various courts of appeals. Section 128 of the old Judicial Code had ordained that the circuit courts of appeals should have jurisdiction to review by appeal final decisions in the United States District Courts for Hawaii and for Puerto Rico in all cases. This distinction had come into the law by the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936. Section 13 of that Act provided expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>for the repeal of \u201cSo much of the Hawaiian Organic Act as amended by the Act of July 9, 1921, as permits a direct review 'by the Supreme Court of cases in the courts in Hawaii.\u201d The Act of July 9, 1921, 42 Stat. 108,' 120, had reiterated the pertinent portions of an Act of March 3, 1909, 35 Stat. 838, which amended Section 86 of the Organic Act by permitting appeals and writs of error to be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States from the District Court for Hawaii \u201c * * * in cases where appeals and writs of error are allowed from the district and circuit courts of the United States to the Supreme Court * *</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">But Sections 1253 and 1294 of revised Title 28 seemingly have broadened the base for appeal to the Supreme Court. Section 1253 provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress \u2019to be heard and determined by.a district court of three judges.\u201d Section 1294, which must be read in connection with Section 1253, provides, insofar as is pertinent here, that \u201cAppeals from reviewable decisions of the district and territorial courts shall be taken to the courts of appeals as follows: (1) From a district court of the United States to the court of appeals for the circuit embracing the district\u201d. As we have seen the District Court for the District of Hawaii has been integrated into the federal judicial system and has been made a district court of the United States insofar as that may be permissible under constitutional limitations. It remains a legislative and not a constitutional court but the procedure of appeal from its decisions is without any constitutional barrier. It follows, therefore, that appeals from the District Court for Hawaii go to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit except in those cases referred to in Section 1253 which permit direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, viz., appeals from decisions of district courts of three judges. All other appeal procedures are wiped out and obliterated by the new Judicial Code which has amended Section 86 of the Organic Act. It would seem to have been the intention of Congress to authorize appeals from three-judge decisions of the District Court for Hawaii direct to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">We conclude on consideration of all the foregoing that it was the intention of Congress by the enactment of the provisions of revised Title 28 referred to to award to statutes of Hawaii and to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii status whereby the provisions of Section 2281 must be employed to test the constitutionality of territorial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">If, however, we are wrong in our conclusion that we are a properly constituted three-judge court qualified by the provisions of Section 2281 to \u2019hear and adjudicate the validity of the statutes involved in the instant cases, we think that we are authorized to do so as the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii comprised of three judges qualified to sit therein and sitting en banc. As we stated in Reinecke v. Loper, D.C.Haw., <em>77 </em>F.Supp. 333, in note 2 cited to the text, the present writer was designated to sit in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Chief Justice Vinson pursuant to Section 13 <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> of the old Judicial Code. Thereafter, he was designated by Senior United States Circuit Judge Francis A. Garrecht of the Ninth Circuit to serve temporarily, in the District Court of the United States for the District of Hawaii pursuant to Section 14 <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> of the former Judicial Code. This section provided: \u201cEach district judge designated and assigned under the provisions of section 17 of this chapter may hold separately and at the same time a district court <em>in the district or territory </em>to which such judge is designated and assigned and discharge all the judicial duties of the district or territorial judge therein.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Each circuit judge designated and assigned to serve temporari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ly as a circuit judge in another circuit may and shall, during the period of 'his assignment, exercise all the judicial powers and discharge and perform all the judicial duties of and be subject to the same assignments of duties as the circuit judges of the circuit to which he is designated and assigned for temporary duty.\u201d See also Sections 15, 17 and 18 of the old Judicial Code and Sections 291, 292, 295 and 296, constituting Chapter 13 of revised Title 28, under which we render our present decisions. It should be pointed out that the substance of the pertinent provisions of revised Title 28 is identical with that of the former statutes referred to. It follows, therefore, that the present writer by virtue of the two assignments and designations referred to is qualified to sit in and to determine the cases at bar as a judge sitting in the District Court for the District of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Judge George B. Harris, a District Judge for the Northern District of California, was also assigned and designated to sit in the District Court for the District of Hawaii by Senior United States Circuit Judge Garrec'ht pursuant to the provisions of Sections 13 and 14 of the former Judicial Code and sits and determines the instant cases pursuant to the provisions of revised Title 28 referred to in the. previous paragraph. Chief Judge Delbert E. Metzger was the Senior United States District Judge of the District Court for the District of Hawaii at the time the instant cases were heard.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> All three judges, therefore, were and are qualified to sit in the instant cases and dispose of them as a court of the District Court of the District of Hawaii sitting en banc. In conclusion if should be pointed out that our decisions are unanimous. See Public Service Commission v. Brashear Freight Lines, 312 U.S. 621, 626, 61 S.Ct. 784, 85 L.Ed. 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The General Jurisdiction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In the decision of this court in Mo Hock Ke Lok Po v. Stainback, supra, 74 F.Supp. at page 853, it was said: \u201cThe court sua sponte notes that the jurisdictional amount' of \u00a7 41(1) is required of all civil suits litigating constitutional questions except those stated in the succeeding 27 paragraphs [of Section 41]. No one of these gives the district courts jurisdiction of a deprivation of a right created by <em>territorial </em>law, though paragraph (14) gives such jurisdiction to such a deprivation by a state law. * * * It thus seems that Congress intends that a territorial invasion of the right in controversy involving less than $3,000 should have its litigation in the territorial courts.\u201d The court then reached the conclusion that un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>less appropriate amendments as to jurisdictional amounts were made the complaint would have to be dismissed as to the plaintiffs designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Whatever may have been the extent of the jurisdiction of the District Court for Hawaii at the time of the decision in the Mo Hock Ke Lok Po case, viz. on October 22, 1947, we entertain no doubt for the reasons stated under the last heading of this opinion that the jurisdiction of the District Court for Hawaii is for the purposes of the instant cases co-extensive with that of any district court of the United States; that of the District of Nevada, for example. It must be pointed out that R.S. \u00a7. 1979, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43 provides that: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d See also R.S. \u00a7 1977, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41, which provides that: \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exaction's of every kind, and to no other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Section 1343 of revised Title 28, treating of civil rights, provides: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person: (1) To recover damages for injury to his person or property, or because of the deprivation of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, by any act done in furtherance of any conspiracy mentioned in Section 47 of Title 8; (2) To recover damages from any person who fails to prevent or -to aid in preventing any wrongs mentioned in section 47 of Title 8 which he had knowledge were about to occur and power to prevent; [and in particular] (3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured-by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d The suits at bar based on deprivation of civil rights, may be maintained without .allegations of jurisdictional amounts as was required by old Section 24(1), now Section 1331 of revised Title 28. See Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 774, 788, affirmed, though modified-on other grounds, in Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423. Nor is citizenship a necessary factor. Id. pages 307 U.S. at 526 and 531, 59 S.Ct. 954. We so hold in respect to both suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">As we have stated, the two major industries of the Hawaiian Islands are the growing of sugar cane and pineapples and a very great part of these products moves in commerce to the United States mainland. It cannot be doubted that the interruption of equable and peaceful labor relations in the Territory by strikes in the sugar and pineapple industries will affect disastrously that flow of commerce. The provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158, are applicable to the Territory of Hawaii. See Rules and Regulations Implementing National Labor Relations Act amended by Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, Series 5, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 203.7, which states, \u201cThe term \u2018State\u2019 as used herein shall include * * * all * * * Territories * * * of the United States.\u201d Upon analogy, therefore, to the doctrine enunciated by the Supreme Court in A. F. of L. v. Watson, 327 U.S. 582, 589-592, 66 S.Ct. 761, 90 L.Ed. 873, and in view of the findings hereinafter made respecting the impact of both the unlawful assembly and riot act and the conspiracy statute of the Territory of Hawaii, respectively Chapters 277 and 243 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, and the manner of the statutes\u2019 enforcement on labor relations in the Territory, we conclude that this court has jurisdiction of the instant causes under Section 1337 of revised Title 28 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>C.A., as well as under Section 1343 of that title.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As to the Constitutionality of the Unlawful Assembly and Riot Act of the Territory of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">It will be borne in mind that the individual plaintiffs, Kaholokula and others, Rania aside, at No. 836, have been indicted for unlawful assembly and riot and conspiracy in the indictment \u2018Na 2365, and that the individual plaintiffs at No. 828, Kawano aside, are held on complaints based on the unlawful assembly and riot act. For these reasons the constitutionality of both statutes is attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">The unlawful assembly and riot act of the Territory of Hawaii, \u201cRiots and Unlawful Assemblies\u201d, Chapter 277, as contained in the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, in pertinent part is set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The origin of the law is shrouded in some obscurity. It came into written existence through the hands of the Honorable Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>liam Little Lee, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. On September 27, 1847 the King-appointed House of Nobles and Representatives of Hawaii by resolution authorized Mr. Lee to examine \u25a0the laws of Hawaii and in effect to compile them.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The unlawful assembly and riot act.may perhaps have been in existence by edict promulgation prior to 1833 when King Kamehameha III came to the throne. The law appears in substance in the Penal Code of the Hawaiian Islands adopted by the House of Nobles and Representatives on June 21, 1850 known colloquially as \u201cLee\u2019s Compilation.\u201d In any event it is clear that the statute predates the Hawaiian Constitution of 1852 by at least two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The unlawful assembly and riot act of the Territory of Hawaii, Sections 11570\u2014 11584, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, bears a startling resemblance to the substance of the riot act of George I.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Indeed, it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>be fairly stated that the George First statute is more favorable to the public and to civil rights -than is the unlawful assembly and riot act of Hawaii. It should be noted at the outset that the statute of George I deemed a gathering not to be dangerous until twelve persons had assembled, whereas the territorial statute considers an assembly of \u201cthree or more persons\u201d as containing a threat of danger. Both statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>seem to consider a gathering of persons \u201cof their own authority,\u201d as contradistinguished from a gathering authorized by the sovereign, as menacing to public order. The statute of George the First required law enforcement officers to order a riotous crowd to disperse, and there had to be a failure on the part of the people to obey this command before the severe penalties of the statute could be invoked. But the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>of Hawaii in Territory of Hawaii v. Joseph Kaholokula, et al., supra, 37 Haw. at page 639, held that no command to disperse was necessary in order that the penalties prescribed by the law might be invoked. See in particular the Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 11581.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Under the statute of George I no felony was committed unless the rioters remained together for a period of an hour after an order to disperse was given. - The territorial statute is not clear in respect to the length of time that rioters must remain together. The crime under the ruling of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholokula case seems to be completed eo instanti when three or more persons have assembled under the conditions set out in Section 11570. Section 11576, relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the crowd remaining together after an order to disperse is given, therefore becomes of little relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Section 11570 of the unlawful assembly and riot act of Hawaii undertakes to define \u201can unlawful assembly\u201d. Any assembly of three or more persons \u201cof their own authority\u201d which meets or gathers with disturbance, tumult and violence \u201cstriking terror or tending to strike terror into others\u201d is brought within the purview of Chapter 277. Any large group of persons (unless they be persons subject to discipline such as a company of soldiers turning out to fall in) ordinarily will meet or gather with some disturbance or tumult. Three persons in assembly, however, would have to exert their physical capabilities to a considerable degree to meet with appreciable disturbance or tumult. The word \u201cviolence\u201d employed in the section surely has its ordinary legal meaning: \u201cThe abuse of force. That force which is employed against common right, against the laws, and against public liberty.\u201d, \u201cViolence is synonomous with physical force * * * \u201d. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s 3rd Revision. This much of the section is plain. But Section 11570 goes on to provide that the disturbance, tumult and violence must be one \u201cstriking terror or tending to strike terror into others =:= * * The test here laid down is purely subj ective and is very vague. An old fashioned charivari would come within the section\u2019s ambit. The test of reasonableness is absent from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">But the definition is further complicated by the provisions of Section 11572 which contains a broader characterization of \u201can unlawful assembly\u201d and also, as we shall see, of a \"riot\u201d. Menacing language or menacing gestures, or show of weapons \u201cor other signs or demonstrations tending to excite terror in others\u201d are stated to be \u201csufficient violence to characterize an unlawful assembly\u201d. A political meeting, the participants in which carry banners or transparencies attacking members of the opposition party and stating that they will be put out of public office, would lie within the purview of the words of the section last quoted. In short, any violence or attack, even a verbal or printed one, would make the members of a gathering liable to the penalties prescribed by the statute. Any gathering of pickets, or any picketing, however peaceful, might well \u201cexcite terror\u201d in the mind of an employer of labor. Indeed the statute received such an interpretion in effect from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit by Judge Wirtz, when he issued the ex parte injunction referred to above. See note 21, supra. Section 11570 read in conjunction with Section 11572 is so vague that it necessarily fails to meet the test of certainty laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888, and United States v. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.S. 81, 41 S.Ct. 298, 65 L. Ed. 516, 14 A.L.R. 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Concerning Section 11571, which defines a \u201criot\u201d, the same lack of clarity is apparent for the section states nothing more than \u201c * * * where three or more being in unlawful assembly join in doing or actually beginning to do an act, with tumult and violence, and striking terror, or tending to strike terror into others.\u201d Again the test \u201cstriking terror, or tending to strike terror into others\u201d, is necessarily one which must be purely subjective and hence objectionable. Moreover, Section 11572, as is the case in regard to the definition of \u201can unlawful assembly\u201d under Section 11570, has been interpolated into Section 11571, \u201c* * * [any] gestures * * * tending to excite terror in others, are sufficient to characterize * * * [a] riot\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Section 11573 deals with concurrence in intent. The provisions of this section are unusual. We shall not repeat them in detail in this opinion but we point out that the first part of the section provides that \u201cConcurrence in an intent of tumult and violence [to be read of course in connection with the definitions of Section 11570], and in any violent tumultuous act, tending to strike terror into others, is a sufficient joining in intent to constitute a riot * * * \u201d. It should be noted that a fair reading of the statute requires the conclusion that \u201can intent of tumult and violence\u201d is of itself \u201ca sufficient joining in intent to constitute a riot\u201d. The phrase \u201cand in any violent tumultuous act,\u201d separated in the text by commas, is plainly another and a separate ground upon which a \u201cjoining in intent tc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>constitute a riot\u201d may be found. We would agree that any violent tumultuous act on the part of a member of a mob could and should be sufficient to join the actor in the common unlawful intent to maintain a riot. But the section goes much further than this \u25a0and, as we have indicated, makes a state of mind, without an overt act, illegal and subject to the penalties of the statute. Indeed, it is fair to say that Section 11573 supplies guilt -by a kind of association. Guilt could be implied by the mere presence at the scene of any person. There is no reasonable certainty in the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Section 11574 states that \u201cIt is not requisite in order to constitute -an unlawful assembly or riot, that persons should have come together with a common or unlawful intent, or in any unlawful manner; or that the object of the meeting, or the act done or intended, should of itself be unlawful.\u201d The second sentence provides that \u201cThe tumult and violence tending to excite terror characterize the offense, though the persons may have assembled in a lawful manner, and though the object of the meeting, if legally pursued, or the act done or intended, if performed in a proper manner, would be lawful.\u201d We do not know what this language means and counsel have suggested no helpful solution. Cf. the opinion of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholokula case, supra, 37 Haw. at pages 628, 629. The section seems to intend the effect, however, that if any terror be excited, a lawful meeting performing lawful acts would fall within the ambit of Chapter 277 and the participants therein would become subject to the penalties of the statute.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Section 11575 deals with promoting or aiding a riot or unlawful assembly and states that any one present aiding, abetting, encouraging or- \u201ccountenancing\u201d the parties concerned therein by words, signs, acts, \u201cor otherwise\u201d are -themselves principals therein. The verb \u201ccountenance\u201d means \u201cto give countenance to; to encourage; favor; approve.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> It would necessarily follow that any one whose mien or appearance was deemed to favor the assembly would himself be guilty as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Section 11576 provides simply that upon \u201can unlawful assembly\u201d being ordered to disperse by any one having legal authority to order it to disperse, any person voluntarily remaining in the assembly, \u201cexcept for keeping the peace\u201d is \u201c * * * a party concerned in the unlawful assembly.\u201d It was the obvious intent of the framers of this section to make any one remaining on the scene, after an order to disperse was given, a participant in the crime and subject to the penalties of the act. But Section 11577 provides that \u201cEvery person present in an unlawful assembly is presumed to have notice of an order * * * \u201d to disperse. Here guilt is created by presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">As we have indicated, Section 11572 provides that any menacing language or gestures or other signs or demonstrations tending to excite terror in others are sufficient to characterize an assembly as unlawful. Section 11579 provides that \u201cWhoever is guilty of being a party concerned in a riot or unlawful assembly endangering the life, limb, health or liberty of any person\u201d shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment at hard labor for not more than twenty years. But the clause just quoted is qualified by the phrase \u201cnot of the description designated in section 11578\u201d. The provisions of Section 11572 would seem to make any person found guilty of unlawful assembly and riot (other than persons engaging in riots with the object of destruction of property designated in Section 11578) subject to a term of imprisonment at hard labor for not more than twenty years.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Cf. the .comments of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholokula case, 37 Haw. at pages 628, 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">No part of the text of Section 11580 need be repeated here. The Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Hawaii seemed to entertain doubts as to its validity in the Kaholokula case. 37 Haw. at page 641. The section\u2019s meaning turns on the interpretation of Section 11579 and we think the terms of Section 11580 are so indefinite and uncertain as to fall clearly within the ban of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States last cited herein. Indeed, as we have indicated, the whole statute falls within the interdiction. No part of it can be saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">But Chapter 277 possesses other substantial vices. We entertain no doubt that the provisions of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States are applicable to the Territory of Hawaii. See Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U.S. 284, 298, 299, 47 S.Ct. 406, 71 L.Ed. 646. See th\u00e9 Mo Hock Ke Lok Po case. If not, it is clear that the provisions of the Fifth Amendment do apply despite the fact that Hawaii is a territory. We have likened Chapter 277 to the riot act of George the First. Like that statute it is a gross trespass on the rights of free speech and assembly as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. That the Supreme Court of the United States would so regard it we think is implicit in the statements made by Mr. Justice Black in Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252, 265, 62 S.Ct. 190, 195, 86 L.Ed. 192, 159 A.L.R. 1346. He said specifically that \u201c * * * the restrictions upon assembly <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then prevalent in England would have been regarded as measures which the Constitution prohibited the American Congress from passing\u201d. Note \u201c9\u201d cited to the text of Mr. Justice Black\u2019s opinion, as has been said, refers specifically to the riot act of George I. Compare the treatment by the Supreme Court of the United States<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> of like restrictions which have been attempted to be placed upon the rights guaranteed against encroachment by the first ten Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The statute sub judice must be ..judged upon its face. The case of Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L. Ed. 1093, is particularly apposite. The Alabama statute, Section 3448 of the. State Code of 1923, Code 1940, Tit. 14, \u00a7 55, prohibited loitering or picketing. The words of Mr. Justice Murphy require repetition. He said, 310 U.S. at pages 97, 98, 60 S.Ct. at page 742: \u201cThe existence of such a statute, which readily lends itself to harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure, results in a continuous and pervasive restraint on all freedom of discussion that might reasonably be regarded as within its purview. It is not any less effective or, if the restraint is not permissible, less pernicious than the restraint on freedom of discussion imposed by the threat of censorship. An accused, after arrest and conviction under such a statute, does not have to sustain the burden of demonstrating that the State could not constitutionally have written a different and specific statute covering his activities as disclosed by the charge and the evidence introduced against him. * * * Where regulations of the liberty of free discussion are concerned, there are special reasons for observing the rule that it is the statute, and not the accusation or the evidence under it, which prescribes the limits of permissible \u2022conduct and warns against transgression. * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The unlawful assembly and riot act of the Territory lays too great an emphasis on peace as distinguished from freedom. It exalts order at the expense of the freedom of speech and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It offers a fertile field for the operation of the agent provocateur who may disturb any public gathering with comparative impunity and cause the arrest of the most innocent participant who may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>to stand trial tinder a theory of guilt by association and presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Among the statute\u2019s disabilities are the very heavy penalties which it imposes. They seem out of proportion to the crimes. Compare the VIII Amendment to the Con \u2022 stitution of the United States which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. While many of the States have not dissimilar statutes there is none which authorizes such a heavy penalty as the statute of Hawaii. Most of the statutes prescribe penalties, fines aside, of a few months\u2019, or a year\u2019s, maximum imprisonment.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> As Professor Chafee states in \u201cFree Speech in the United States,\u201d it is unrealistic to hold \u201ctwenty years in prison before a speaker and call him free to speak * * * \u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> It should be noted again that the very heavy penalty prescribed by Section 11579 first appeared in the statute in 1929, following the disastrous strike of Filipino laborers in Hawaii in 1924. See ante under the heading \u201cThe ILWU and the Labor Picture.\u201d See Laws of the Territory of Hawaii, 1929, Act 4, p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> We have given careful consideration to the' decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholokula case and to Judge Peters\u2019 thoughtful opinion. The ruling is entitled to great weight. But we are a court of the United States construing provisions of the Federal Constitution. We are constrained to a conclusion respecting the unlawful assembly and riot act opposite to that expressed by the Supreme Court of Hawaii. We hold the statute to be unconstitutional for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">As to the Constitutionality of th-e Conspiracy Statute of Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">It will be borne -in mind that -the individual plaintiffs at No. 836, Kaholokula and others, Rania aside, have been indicted for -conspiracy, third degree, in the indictment at No. 2365. Accordingly -they attack the -constitutionality o.f the -conspiracy statute of the Territory of Hawaii.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> The first \u25a0part of Section 11120 (the example -aside) defines conspiracy. It provides -that \u201cA conspiracy is a malicious or fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>combination or mutual undertaking or concerting together of two or more, to commit any offense or instigate anyone thereto, or charge anyone therewith; or to do what plainly and directly tends to excite or occasion offense, or what i-s obviously and directly wrongfully injurious to another: * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The conspiracy statute came into the written law of Hawaii in Lee\u2019-s Compilation, Penal Code of June 21, 1850, in \u2019 substance as it i-s today insofar as is pertinent -in the instant cases though it, like t-h-e unlawful assembly and riot act, may have had earlier existence as a -promulgated edict. We are of -the -opinion that the statute is so broad and -va-gue as to fall within -the prohibitions of the authorities cited under the previous heading. The constitutionality of the conspiracy statute has never been tested in this regard insofar \u2022a-s we -can ascertain, albeit some of -its terms, Section 5720, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1935 in haec verba with Section 11120 of Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, are discussed -and approved in Territory v. Hart, 35 Haw. 188, 195-197. Cf. Territory v. Reyes, 33 Haw. 180, and The King v. Joe, 8 Haw. 287, 288. Section 11120 as drawn is bad -on its face; particularly in view of the last clause 'following the first semicolon as quoted in note 70, supra. The term \u201coffense\u201d is clarified, if clarification he necessary, by -the provisions of Section 10601, contained in Chapter 222, dealing with \u201cDefinitions\u201d, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945. See Haas v. Henkel, 216 U.S. 462, 30 S.Ct. 249, 54 L.Ed. 569, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112, and Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S. 182, 44 S.Ct. 511, 68 L.Ed. 968. Cf. what was Section 37 of the Criminal Code, and since September 1, 1948 has -become Section 371 of revised Title 18 U.S.C.A. Section 10601 states that \u201cThe term 'offense,\u2019 as used in the laws -of -the Territory, means the doing what a -penal law forbids to he done, or omitting to- do what i-t -commands.\u201d The clause -of Section 11120 referred to makes \u2022two -or more persons guilty of -conspiracy if they concert together to do \u201c * * * what -is obviously and directly wrongfully injurious to another * * *\u201d and renders the section too vague to withstand \u25a0attack. The word \u201cwrongfully\u201d is not a term of art in -the criminal law. It mean-s \u201cIn a wrong manner; unjustly; in a manner contrary to the moral 'law, or to justice.\u201d Bouvier\u2019-s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s Third Revision. Cf. the term \u201cWrong\u201d, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Third Edition. The test supplied by the statute is, therefore, one -of <em>moral </em>law, and two or more persons concerting foget-her to effect a breach -of that law -or to commit a sin, transgression or misdeed injurious to another, or -to fail to do- some act which morality -requires, -that failure being injurious to another, would be guilty of the -crime of conspiracy under the statute. This would ibe true despite the fact that the act done or omitted to be -done is not defined in-th-e Penal Code of Hawaii or in any criminal -law of the Territory. Cf. the provisions of Section 10601. This -portion of -the statute clearly does not meet the test of certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">But if we -are wrong in respect to the foregoing conclusion, it is clear nevertheless that -that part of the -section following the semi-colon and quoted above does not by any means describe a crime. This \u25a0part of Section 11120 defines a -conspiracy a-s -the doing of that which \u201c-plainly and directly tends to -excite or occasion offense, or what is -obviously and directly wrongfully injurious to another\u201d. If two or more -persons were to agree to set up a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>grocery store (note that the \u00a1agreement alone, without any overt act, would be \u25a0sufficient to constitute the crime under Section 11122) in competition with the store of another, under a 'literal interpretation of Section 11120 they would -be guilty of the crime of \u00a1conspiracy under the statute since' what they contemplated doing would be obviously and directly \u201cinjurious\u201d to the rival merchant. True, the section employs the word \u201cwrongfully\u201d before the phrase \u201cinjurious to another\u201d, but -the word \u201cwrongfully\u201d is not a term of art in the law and means simply, as we have already stated, \u201cIn a wrong manner; unjustly; in a manner contrary to the moral law, or to .justice\u201d. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s 3rd Revision. No common law definition aids the statute in this \u00a1respect. Of. The King v. Angee, 8 Haw. 259, 260-262. We think it is obvious therefore that Section 11120 fails to state a crime cognizable by any \u00a1standard of Anglo-American law and for the reasons \u00a1given is contrary to the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment limiting federal action or to those of the Fourteenth Amendment curtailing action by a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The example or explanation contained in the Act (see the second 'quoted paragraph of note 70, supra) beginning with the words, \u201cFor instance\u201d, demonstrates, we \u25a0think, how \u00a1far the statute actually goes. The explanation states that \u201cA confederacy * * * to -prevent another, by indirect and sinister means, from exercising his trade, and to impoverish him * * * \u201d is a conspiracy. Picketing, however peaceful, would fall within this ban. The means would \u00a1be \u201cindirect\u201d and, doubtless, would be considered by many to be \u201csinister\u201d. The adjective \u201csinister\u201d is so- little a -term \u25a0of art in the law and is so inadequate as a legal description \u00a1that we cannot find it in any law dictionary. The Supreme Court of Hawaii in the-Kaholokula case, 37 Haw. at pages 625, 636, recognized the right of peaceful picketing, and also indicated, 37 Haw. at page 642, that to \u00a1deprive an individual of his right to work is to deprive him of \u201cliberty\u201d as employed in Section 11579 of the unlawful assembly and riot act. We agree with both positions and state that to deprive a man of his right to work \u25a0does deprive him of \u00a1a precious liberty. But we are concerned with a statute which by reason of its vagueness 'and uncertainty must be held to be unconstitutional in its entirety. We think it would be fruitless to discuss any other sections of the \u00a1conspiracy statute, Chapter '243, under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The Doctrine of Abstention.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">I'f our ruling is correct that we are authorized to adjudicate the cases, at bar as \u00a1a three-judge court pursuant to Section 2281 of revised Title 28, we .must deal with the \u00a1doctrine of \u201cabstention\u201d and will do so shortly. If, on the other hand, we are not -authorized by that statute to sit as \u00a1such a court we. adjudicate the instant disputes as the . District Court for the District. of Hawaii sitting en banc \u00a1and \u00a1for reasons stated immediately hereinafter -the doctrine of abstention \u00a1can -exercise no effect on our decisions and decrees, Proceeding under the former theory first we will discuss the provisions of Section 2283 <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> of revised Title 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Section 2283 provides that \u201cA \u25a0court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or -where necessary in a-id of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d Compare the provisions of Section 86 of the Organic Act, as amended, and -those of Section 265 of the old Judicial Code quoted in note 72 supra. Because of the -provisions of Section 86 of the Organic Act, set out in note 54 supra, the mandate of Section 2283 of revised Title 28 must -be imposed in -respect to all \u201c-matters and proceedings\u201d as between the District Court and the Territorial Courts of Hawaii. But the word \u201cState\u201d as employed -in Section 2281 -cannot have a different meaning th-an that which it -enjoys when used in Section 2283.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> I-f the statutes of Hawaii -are not \u201cState\u201d -statutes the criminal proceedings -complained of by the plaintiffs a-t -our N-o-s. 828 and 836 are not proceedings in -a \u201cState -court\u201d. The -sections of the -law referred to cannot be read both ways. They are not Janus-faced. If, therefore, -the word \u201cState\u201d used in Section 2281 is not -applicable to a statute of the Territory of Hawaii, Section 2283 -cannot serve as a bar to action taken by this -court \u2022to enjoin the criminal proceedings complained of in the -cases at bar. We .believe, however, for the reasons hereinbefore set out, that the Hawaiian statutes sub judice m-u-st be treated as if they were statutes of a State and that the provisions of Section 2283 are -applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">It is -clear that the doctrine of \u25a0abstention from action by injunction -by a \u2022federal court to restrain -proceedings in a State -court embodied in Section 2283 of revised Title 28, does not go to the jurisdiction of the federal tribunal but is instead a rule -of -comity in the form of positive 1-aw. Moran v. Sturges, 154 U.S. 256, 14 S.Ct. 1019, 38 L.Ed. 981; Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall. 166, 18 L.Ed. 768. The matter was well put in Feldman v. Pennroad Corporation, D.C.Del., 60 F. Supp. 716, 718, affirmed, 3 Cir., 155 F.2d 773, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 808, 67 S.Ct.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">921, 91 L.Ed. 690, wherein -it was said, \u201cThe statute [Section 265 of the old Judicial Code] is a limitation upon the equity powers of the federal courts. When application is made to -a federal -court -to enjoin proceedings in a -state -count, the -duty devolves upon the federal -cou-rt to determine whether -the petition has -alleged facts for which relie-f is prohibited by the -statute or whether -the equities o-f the -case -require that an injunction issue -despite the statutory limitation\u201d, citing Smith v. Apple, 264 U.S. 274, 44 S.Ct. 311, 68 L.Ed. 678. In Keegan v. State of New Jersey, D.C., 42 F. Supp. 922, 924, a three-judge Section 266 court stated: \u201cThe- protection of personal -rights -secured by the Constitution is -as important as the protection -o-f property -rights secured by it. Section 265 of the Judicial -Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 379, is not a jurisdictional statute, but one that merely goes to the equity presented by the bill. * * * A federal -court therefore may exercise its jurisdiction to prevent the trial of a defendant by a state -court where such -a trial would invade constitutional rights. Such jurisdiction may be exercised by way of injunction or in habeas corpus proceedings. In [Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 37-38, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131, L.R.A.1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.l917B, 283], Mr. Justice Sutherland delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court stated: \u2018The due and orderly administration of justice in a state court is not to be thus interfered with save in rare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">It has always been the -case, however, that a federal court may enjoin pro^ -ceedings in a State court if necessary to assert and protect a rightful jurisdiction. Guaranty Trust Co., of New York v. North Chicago St. R. Co., 7 Cir., 1904, 130 F. 801, certiorari denied 194 U.S. 638, 24 S.Ct. 860, 48 L.Ed. 1161. Section 2283 of revised Title 28 provides that \u201cA -court -o-f the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State -court except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>as expressly authorized by Act of -Congress, or when necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or -to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d There is no doubt that Congress set up the safeguards of Section 266 of the old Judicial Code iand those of Section 2281 of revised Title 28 to -guard against too 'frequent -injunctions by. th-e 'federal courts to restrain action by State officers acting under State statutes. In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628, 147 A.L.R. 674, the Supreme Court held invalid, on -an appeal from a three-judge Section 266 count, a regulation of a state board of education requiring -children in public \u25a0schools to salute the American flag. The regulation referred to must have had the effect to a statute otherwise the impanel\u2022ment of -a Section 266 court would have been held to have been inappropriate. In Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660, the Supreme Court struck down a statute which had for its purpose the licensing -of the press by the imposition of a gross receipts tax for -the privilege of engaging in the newspaper business. In Hague v. C. I. O., supra, the Supreme Court held two ordinances requiring the -licensing -of public meetings \u25a0in Jersey City void on -their face -and restrained their -enforcement. In Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292, 146 A.L.R. 81, the Supreme Court, on -certiorari to -the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, held invalid a municipal ordinance -requiring -religious colporteurs to pay a license tax -as a condition to the -pursuit of itheir activities. These authorities show -the general application -of injunctive principles by courts -of the United States to -protect -from -state action rights guaranteed -to the people by the First and the Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">But in the decision of the Supreme Court in Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324, lies the -difficulty an granting -the relief which the plaintiffs seek by way of injunction from this -court in order to -restrain the Hawaiian authorities from -proceeding with the criminal prosecutions. In the Jeannette case the Supreme Court had before it an unconstitutional -ordinance (held to be -such in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, supra, decided the same day), and the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, -by &gt;a single judge, had enjoined -threatened -criminal prosecutions thereunder. See 39 F.Supp. 32. Jurisdiction in the -case was based -on Section 24(14) of the -old Judicial Code and the Civil Rights Acts. The Supreme -Court by Mr. Chief Justice Stone said, 319 U.S. at pages 163, 164, 63 S.Ct. at page 881, 87 L.Ed. 1324: \u201cIt is -a familiar rule th-at -courts of equity do -not ordinarily -restrain criminal prosecutions. No person is immune fr-om prosecution -in good faith -for his alleged criminal acts. Its imminence, ev-en though alleged to be in violation of -constitutional -guaranties, is not a ground f-or equity -relief since the lawfulness or constitutionality of the -statute or -ordinance on which the prosecution is based may be determined a-s readily in the -criminal case as in a suit for an injunction. * * * Where the threatened prosecution is by state -officers for alleged violations -of a state law, the state courts are th-e final arbiters -of it-s meaning and application, subject only to -review iby this Court -on federal -grounds appropriately asserted. Hence -the arrest by th-e federal -courts of the -processes of -the criminal -law within the states, -and the -determination of questions -of criminal liability tmder state law by a -federal court -of -equity, are -to be supported -only -on a showing of danger of irreparable injury \u2018.both great -and immediate\u2019 \u201d, -citin-g, inter alia, Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, 295 U.S. 89, 95, 55 S.Ct. 678, 79 L.Ed. 1322; Beal v. Missouri Pacific R. Corp., 312 U.S. 45, 49, 61 S.Ct. 418, 85 L.Ed. 577, and Williams v. Miller, 317 U.S. 599, 63 S.Ct. 258, 87 L.Ed. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In the S-pielman -case the Supreme Court -refused to enjoin a criminal -prosecution under Chapter 781 of the Law-s of 1933 -of New York, Ex. Sess., holding, by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, -that it must appear -that [295 U.S. 89, 55 S.Ct. 681] \u201cThe danger of irreparable 'los-s i-s -both -great \u2022and immediate\u201d -and -th-at the petitioner had failed -to meet this test. In the Beal case the plaintiff railroad -had -sought an injunction -from the District Court restraining State officers from enforcing -the Nebraska <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Full Train Crew Law. The District Court had granted, relief and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit had affirmed, 108 F.2d 897. The Supreme Court .reversed, 312 U.S'. at page 49, 61 S.Ct. at page 420, 85 L.Ed. 577, Mr. Justice Stone saying: \u201cNo citizen or meihber of the community is immune 'from prosecution, in good -faith, for his 'alleged criminal acts. The imfhinenee of such a prosecution even though alleged to he unauthorized and hence unlawful is not alone ground for relief in equity which exerts its extraordinary powers only to prevent irreparable injury to the plaintiff who seeks its aid.\u201d, citing, inter alia, Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S. 197, 214, 44 S.Ct. 15, 68 L.Ed. 255. Cf. Truax v. Raich, supra, and Hague v. C. I. O., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">But in A. F. of L. v. Watson, supra, the Supreme Court, by Mr. Justice Douglas, pointed out that a district court of the United States might enjoin criminal prosecutions based on an amendment to the Florida Constitution in effect outlawing closed-shop agreements if exceptional circumstances and great and immediate danger of irreparable loss to .the petitioners, asserted by the pleading, were proved. Accordingly the judgment of the District Court was reversed and the cause -remanded. Mr. Justice Douglas stated, 327 U.S. at page 593, 66 S.Ct. at page 766, 90 L.Ed. 873: \u201cBut even though a district court has authority to hear and decide the case on the merits, it should not invoke its powers unless \u00a1those who seek its aid have a cause of action in equity. * * * The power of a court of equity .to act is a discretionary one. * * * Where a federal court of equity is asked to interfere with the enforcement of state \u00a1laws, it should do so only \u2018to prevent irreparable injury which is clear and imminent.\u2019 * * * That is a strict test. But we think -appellants satisfy it. We reach that conclusion -on the basis of the allegations concerning the disruption of the collective bargaining processes and the injury to the unions and .t-o- the -employers alike, if the closed-shop agreement is outlawed. As we have said, it is averred that there are -about 500 contracts wi-th Florida employers containing closed-shop agreements * * * \u201d. \u25a0Cf. Terrace -v. Thompson, supra, 263 U.S. at page 214, 44 S.Ct. at page 17, 68 L.Ed. 255, where Mr. Justice Butler stated, \u201cBut the legal remedy must be -as complete, practical and efficient as \u2018that which -equity could afford. <em>* </em>* * Equity jurisdiction will be exercised to enjoin the threatened enforcement of a state law which contravenes the federal Constitution wherever it is -essential in order effectually to protect property -rights and the rights of persons \u2022against injuries otherwise -irremediable; -and in such a case a person, who as an officer -of the state is clothed with the duty of enforcing its laws and who threatens \u25a0and is about to- commence proceedings, either civil or criminal, to enforce such a law against parties affected, may be -enjoined -from -such action by a Federal court of equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In concluding that the decision of A. F. of L. v. Watson has a potent bearing on the disposition of the cases at bar we are not unmindful of the fact that in the cited decision the Supreme Court ordered the cause -remanded to the District Court with directions to -retain the bill pending the final determination .of designated questions of local law. The circumstances of A. F. of L. v. Watson are to be 'distinguished \u00a1from the -cases at bar on the ground that the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholokula case held \u2018the unlawful assembly and riot act to be constitutional. A most important question of local law therefore has already been -decided unfavorably to \u25a0 the plaintiffs in the suits at bar. It should be pointed out, moreover, that the Kaholokula -case could not be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii was rendered on an interlocutory appeal under the procedure prescribed by Section 9531, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Even if it were to be held, despite the circumstances, that the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholokula -case had -rendered the question of constitutionality of the unlawful assembly and riot act res judicata as to Kaholokula and his fellow -defendants in the proceedings 'at No. 2657 -in the Supreme Court of Hawaii, 37 Haw. 625, or that he or -they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>could not -contest the validity of the statute further -because of the operation o-f a kind of -estoppel, nonetheless other plaintiffs at either No. 828 or No. 836 would not he so hound. The -short of it is that the determination of local -law which the Supreme Court of the United States ordered the District Court in A. F. of L. v. Watson to await and in the meantime to hold its -hand, has already taken place in ires-pect to th-e unlawful assembly and riot act. It -follows that under the 'circumstances of the instant \u25a0cases i-f our decision is to he effective we \u25a0ourselves must pass on the validity of the unlawful .assembly and riot a-ct. While the conspiracy statute has not been tested by the Territorial Courts insofar as we are aware, -sin-ce - it ifo-rms the basis -of only one count -of the indictment a-t No. 2365 we have thought -it proper for this court it-o determine its ^constitutionality since it would be futile to cut the indictment in half or to truncate the -instant proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We -conclude that the prosecutions -of the individual plaintiffs must \u00a1be enjoined. Our conclusion is based not -only on the decision of .the Supreme Court in A. F. of L. v. Watson hut 'also upon that in Douglas v. Jeannette.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">First under A. F. of L. v. Watson our reasons are as follows: As we have stated, the unlawful -assembly and riot act and the conspiracy statute of the Territory o-f Hawaii are unconstitutional upon their face \u25a0and the impact o-f the two statutes as -employed, and -as about to be employed, by the law enforcement authorities of the Territory, is -such as -to disrupt immediately any substantial possibility or -opportunity for genuine collective bargaining between the employers of the sugar and pineapple industries and their -respective employees. As we h-ave stated the -growing -of -pineapples -and the raising of sugar cane are the two major industries -of the Territory. By the very exisen-tce of -the two -statutes referred to -as well as by reason of the manner of their enforcement by the authorities of the Territory, the scales are weighted -so heavily in favor -o-f -the employer -and against the employee as to render fair collective bargaining a virtual impossibilty under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158. That A-c-t is appli-cabib \u00edH the Tefrito-ry of Hawaii as we have -stated-. The Hawaiian statutes -effect indirectly -th-\u00e9 very result which the \u2022amendment to the Constitution of Florida under -consideration in A. F. o-f L. v. Watson wa-s designed to effect -directly. A court of ithe'United States has a duty to protect inter-state commerce under Section 1337 of revised Title 28 U.S.C.A. A court of the -United States under Section 1343 of that Title also must protect civil rights .-as guaranteed by the Constitution and as defined by the Civil Rights Acts. A strike-properly conducted is a legitimate weapon-in the -armory -of labor. Peaceful assembly,, peaceful picketing, and freedom of \u00a1speech and of -assembly -are equally, legitimate weapons of labor. Indeed, freedom o-f speech and of assembly are rights guaranteed to all of us by the Constitution -o-f the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">All collective bargaining in the, Territory of Hawaii in o-ur opinion is substantially affected by -the two \u00a1statutes \u00a1as well as by the prosecutions conducted or about to be-carried on thereunder. Approximately thirty thousand members of the ILWU and the -union itself necessarily feel the impact \u25a0of the statutes as does each employer in the sugar and pineapple -industries. All -labor \u00a1relations in the Islands -are \u00a1clouded by them. On the records presently before us-we think it is fair to state that equable or amicable -relations between employers and employees in -the Territory of Hawaii \u00a1are impossible while the statutes -stand. The \u25a0repercussions which arise \u00a1from the enforcement -of these -statutes -o-f the Territory' are such as to cause great and irreparable \u25a0harm and damage to all labor relations in Hawaii. The danger -to labor -relations within the Territory is great -and immediate \u2019for if the \u00a1full penalty of twenty years, or comparatively -heavy -sentences; be imposed -after trial and conviction on any substantial number of the one hundred and twenty-seven plaintiffs at Nos. 828 and 836, -labor -on the Islands -of Hawaii may, with -a measure of justification, -conclude that the processes'of the law have been employed to \u25a0reduce its members to virtual peonage. If this were to transpire, in our opinion, many years would \u00a1pass before \u2019an adequate basis -for collective bargaining could -arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>again. We go further and state that the two statutes are of such a nature as to .affect not only labor but all other persons on the Islands and constitute a two-edged weapon with which the liberty of the individual, laboring man or capitalist, may ,be stricken down at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">But there are other and equally cogent reasons why the injunctions prayed \u25a0for here must issue. As was pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice Stone in Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U.S. at page 163, 63 S.Gt. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324, no person is immune from prosecution in <em>good faith. </em>But good faith prosecution is an essential if a person is not to be deprived of constitutional rights. The qualification of good faith in a prosecution runs through the line of cases applying the doctrine of abstention. See for example Beal v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., supra, 312 U.S. at page 49 61 S.Ct. 8, 85 L.Ed. 577. The words <em>irn, good faith </em>are of great importance and were intended to draw a line between <em>bona fide </em>prosecutions embarked upon to uphold the law and prosecutions 'for some ulterior .purpose or motive. The motive of the prosecutor is of course not relevant to the ordinary criminal proceeding; the material questions ordinarily are whether the defendant has committed the act alleged and whether it constitutes a crime. But prosecutions for motives other than the enforcement of the law have taken place on occasion and in connection with the exercise of the discretion of a district court of the United States to restrain such criminal actions good 'faith is material under the Civil Rights Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In this connection the following facts among others in the instant cases are pertinent: (1) (a), the mass arrests, and the very broad, indeed, the too broad field, from which the police drew the defendants in the various criminal proceedings after both the Paia and the Kaumalapau Harbor incidents, demonstrated by the fact that the names of sixteen persons were stricken out of one of the complaints and that of ninety-three arrests made on the Island of Oahu on July 13, 1947-only one person, viz. Sibolboro, was subjected to prosecution, all other complaints being nolle pressed; (b) the naming of persons as defendants in criminal proceedings from photographs taken by the police both prior and subsequent to the occurrence of the Kaumalapau Harbor incident; (c) the fact that the police made no arrests during the course of the Paia or Kaumalapau incidents; (d) the excessive bail required of many of the plaintiffs in the instant cases; (2) the fact that Assistant Chief of Police Freitas did \u25a0not read the unlawful assembly and riot act to the strikers during the Paia or Kaumalapau incidents and did not contemplate the swearing out of a complaint against any of the plaintiffs under that statute until directed to do so by the prosecuting officers of Maui County; (3) the repeated selection of the unlawful assembly and riot -act with its heavy penalties as the vehicle for the prosecution of comparatively minor infractions of the criminal laws; (4) the haste with which the prosecuting officers of Maui County procured the second indictment of Kaholokula and others when the first indictment was -held invalid by the Supreme Court of Hawaii; (5) the fact, for we have found it to be a .fact, that no one has been prosecuted under the unlawful assembly and riot act except in connection with labor disputes at any time during the life of the Territory; and (6) the fact that the maximum penalty under the unlawful -assembly and riot act was increased from five years\u2019 imprisonment to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment in 1929, following the Filipino workers\u2019 strike in 1924. In view of the foregoing we are brought to the conclusion that the threatened prosecutions of the plaintiffs are not \u201cin good faith\u201d within the purview of that requirement as laid down in Douglas v. Jeannette, and that the criminal proceedings complained of are being carried on for the purpose of attack upon a labor movement rather than for the ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">In making these statements we do not accuse the Attorney General of Hawaii or the prosecuting officers o-f Maui- County in the instant -cases -of lack of -honor or of personal integrity. The labor movement is an unpopular one in the Hawaiian Islands and these -gentlemen do no more than reflect the -mores of their time and -their locality. There is no personal feeling in the attitude of these defendants and we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>not doubt but that they are conscientiously \u2022animated by the high desire 'to- maintain industrial .prosperity in the Territory of Hawaii. The record -seems to- -indicate beyond peradventure, however, that the -unlawful assembly -and riot a-ct has been employed -as a .club to beat labor and .that the -conspiracy statute i-s an apt -instrument to the -same 'end.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We fin-d that the .plaintiffs\u2019 remedy at law is -not -and -oann-o-t -be \u201ca-s complete, \u25a0practical -and efficient as that whi-chequity could afford.\u201d Terrace v. Thompson, supra, 263 U.S. at page 214, 44 S.Ct. at page 17, 68 L.Ed. 255. The -d-ama-ge will be done to labor relations in the Territory of Hawaii and to the -plaintiffs long before the individual -cases, if -the .plaintiffs be' 'found -guilty, can -rea-ch the Court -of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The danger of irreparable -injury i-s both great and immediate. In this -connection we point out -again that -the Supreme Court of Hawaii in the Kaholok-u-la case has held the unlawful 'assembly and riot act to be constitutional upon interlocutory appeal, though -it held the -indi-atm-ent .insufficient for want of certainty. That decision will hind every court short of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and an unconstitutional statute will stand as a basis \u25a0for -present and -further prosecutions -thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In holding that injunctions against prosecution of the individual plaintiffs under the unlawful assembly and riot act and the conspiracy statute must issue we do not ignore the fact- that it is our duty to follow the interpretation of constitutionality imposed on the statute by the Supreme Court of Hawaii unless, in our opinion, that interpretation is clearly erroneous. After most careful consideration of both the statute and the decision do we conclude that the interpretation of the Supreme Court, was erroneous and that the unlawful assembly and riot act is unconstitutional on its face. So regarding the statute and the decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii it is our duty to proceed as the law requires of us.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Another matter requires brief discussion. Section 266 of the old Judicial Code provided, and Section 2284(5)<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> of revised Title 28 provides, that a three-judge court before final hearing should hold its hand and stay proceedings before it if a suit has been brought in a State court of competent jurisdiction to test the statute complained -of and the State court itself has stayed prosecution under the statute pending the completion of the test. See note 74 supra. See Traffic Telephone Workers\u2019 Federation of New Jersey v. Driscoll, D.C., 72 F.Supp. 499. It will be observed at once that the provisions of Section 2284(5) are literally inapplicable under the circumstances of the cases at bar foir no stay of the threatened or pending criminal proceedings has issued from any court of the Territory o-f Hawaii. The statute, therefore, not being literally applicable, can have no effect beyond the rule of comity expressed by the Supreme Court of -the United States in the Jeannette case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">As to the Defense of Unclean Hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The defendants contend, as we apprehend \u00a3heir position, that the plaintiffs seek to obtain an injunction from this court, \u201c * * * assuring them that their acts will not be* indictable as unlawful assembly and riot, so that they may with greater comfort and impunity pursue a course of unlawful conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We think the defendants misapprehend the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions and the point. Lest they also misunderstand the position of this court the statements which follow are necessary. We do' not condone or attempt in any manner to palliate the illegal conduct of the strikers, plaintiffs in these proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>But we are required to discharge our duty and we are of the opinion that that duty requires us to enjoin the prosecutions of the plaintiffs under the statutes designated for the reasons given. The doctrine of unclean hands is inapplicable here. If it were otherwise no one who had infringed an unconstitutional statute, no matter how irreparable the damage resulting from the prosecution and no matter how great and imminent the dangers inherent in the statute\u2019s enforcement, could cause a district court of the United States to enjoin prosecution thereunder. The application of the doctrine of unclean hands under the theory enunciated by the defendants would have driven the plaintiffs out of court in A. F. of L. v.

Driscoll, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">If our decision in the instant cases is upheld there remains in the armory of the Territory of Hawaii numerous criminal statutes of the kind well known to the States of the United States and adequate for the punishment of lawbreakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Attack on the Jury Commissioners and on the Grand Juries of Maui County.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">As to the Right of Kaholokula, et al. to Attack the Indictment Handed Down by the 1947 Maui County Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The complaint for violation of the unlawful assembly and riot statute against Agliam and his co-defendants was dated August 1, 1947, and Agliam and those named in the complaint with him were held for action of the grand jury on September 16, 1947. As we have stated Agliam and his co-defendants were joined as plaintiffs at No. 828 by stipulation and an appropriate order thereon. Barbosa and his co-defendants were named in a complaint based on violations of the unlawful assembly and riot act, dated July 16, 1947. Makekau and his co-defendants were named in a complaint similarly based, dated July 15, 1947. Makekau, et al., and Bar-bosa, et al., filed motions and challenges to the jury commissioners and to the 1947 grand jury of Maui County at Nos. 2412 and 2413 respectively in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit of the Territory of Hawaii. The matters raised by the motions and challenges to the jury commissioners and to the 1947 Maui County grand jury were decided by Judge Cristy on September 17, 1947, while the case of Kaholo-kula, et al., No. 2657 in the Supreme Court of Hawaii, 37 Haw. 625, decided November 26, 1947, was still before that Court. As we have said the constitutionality and the sufficiency of the indictment handed down by the Maui County grand jury on October 30, 1946, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 9, were tested by the Supreme Court in the cited case. The Supreme Court of the Territory held the unlawful assembly and riot act to be constitutional but the indictment was deemed to be insufficient in that specific illegal acts of the individuals were not described therein. As has been stated Ka-holokula and certain others, plaintiffs at No. 836, had 'been indicted by reason of the Paia incident. Kaholokula and the other defendants indicted with him made no attack on the jury commissioners and did not challenge the 1947 Maui County grand jury. They do presently attack, by the allegations of the complaint at No. 836, both the jury commissioners of M\u00bb'ui County and the methods used to select grand juries in that county. They offer in support of their contentions the record made before Judge Cristy (sitting vice Judge Wirtz in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit) under the motions and challenges of Make-kau, et al., and Barbosa, et al.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The evidence contained in that record will be discussed hereinafter the points raised are substantially those set up in the complaints at our Nos. 828 and 836. The motions and challenges of Makekau, et al., and Bar-bosa, et al., were filed in the Second Circuit Court on or about July 28, 1947 and were subsequently amended.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The defendants point out that when Judge Cristy\u2019s designation was made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Supreme Court to the Second Circuit Court, to the end that he could hear the motions and challenges referred to, it was apparent that there were involved in the Kaumala-pau Harbor incident not only Makekau and those charged with him but also Barbosa and his co-defendants. This, say the defendants in the cases at bar, is \u201cthe very evident reason why the order of the Supreme Court included authorization to Judge Cristy to hear supplementary challenges and why Judge Cristy in disposing of the motions and challenges on September 18, 1947 stated that his rulings would apply to any other case lying before the grand jury.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> But the case of Kaholo-kula, et al., was not then lying before a grand jury. The 1946 Maui County grand jury had handed down a true bill against Kaholokula and his co-defendants on October 30, 1946, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 9. Moreover, if Kaholokula, and his co-defendants under the indictment of October 30, 1946, believed, as they apparently did, that the unlawful assembly and riot statute would be declared unconstitutional, or that the indictment would be found to be insufficient as actually transpired, there was no reason why they should have challenged the 1947 Maui County grand jury. Actually the earlier indictment had been found by the 1946 Maui County grand jury and that jury was functus officio. Whether or not the indictment was held to be insufficient, the life of the 1947 grand jury would expire on January 12, 1948.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Kaholokula case was decided by.the Supreme Court on November 26, 1947. The Territory had twenty days after the opinion was announced in which to petition for rehearing.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The time for filing a petition for rehearing expired therefore on December 17, 1947. But the 1947 Maui County grand jury met on December 2, 1947 and indicted Kaholokula again and with him seventy-four other persons in indictment No. 2365, including one individual not designated in the earlier indictment, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 9. The later indictment, No. 2365, Exhibit E to the complaint at our No. 836; contains not only a count based on the unlawful assembly and riot act but also a count bottomed on conspiracy, third degree.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> At the time the indictment, No. 2365, was returned by the 1947 grand jury there had been no remittitur by the Supreme Court to the Second Circuit Court as has been said. The defendants\u2019 brief<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> states in regard to this point, \u201cThe grand jury undoubtedly had a right to consider and to act upon the case, but were the plaintiffs bound to 'take notice that they would do so? That is the issue. We cannot foretell the ruling of the territorial court thereon, and it is not material here; they [the defendants] either were bound to take notice that the grand jury would consider the case and waived their opportunity [to challenge], or were not bound to take notice of it and can still present, by plea or motion on arraignment all contentions based on federal rights.\u201d The defendants in the instant cases cite Territory v. Ferris, 15 Haw. 139, for comparison. The cited case holds that a defendant charged with murder waives his right to challenge the grand jury if he does not do so prior to the time it retires even though he is held in jail at the time. Section 9812, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, provides that any person \u201cheld to answer a charge for a criminal offense\u201d may challenge the panel before the grand jury is sworn. The grand jury is impaneled and sworn at the opening of the term.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The 1947 Maui grand jury could not have come into office until January 13, 1947, the second Monday in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Paragraph \u201cF. Challenges\u201d, of Rule 18 of the Rules of the Supreme Court<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>amended February 14 and March <em>27, </em>1947,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> provides, \u201cBefore the grand jury retires, * * * any person held to answer a charge for a criminal offense may challenge the panel or an individual juror for cause to be assigned to the court. All such challenges shall be tried and determined by the court.\u201d We think that the word \u201cretires\u201d as used in the Supreme Court rule means the first retirement 'by the newly impaneled grand jury after it has been charged by the court. See Section 9811 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945. See such cases as Commonwealth v. Smith, 9 Mass. 107, and People v. Jewett, 3 Wend., N.Y., 314. Territory v. Ferris, supra, is silent on this point, and we can find no pertinent Territorial authority. If we are correct in this ruling the opportunity of Ka-holokula and his co-defendants to challenge the 1947 grand jury either under Section 9812 or under Rule 18 of the Supreme Court Rules elapsed long before December 2, 1947 when the indictment, No. 2365, was handed down. A chance to challenge the individual grand juror\u2019s competency as distinguished from irregularity of the drawing of the grand jury, still remained. Questions of competency, as distinguished from questions of regularity in the drawing of the grand jury, could be presented on arraignment under the indictment. Cf. Territory v. Scully, 22 Haw. 618, 632, explaining Territory v. Ferris, supra. In the Scully case it was held that a motion to quash an indictment on the ground of irregularities in selecting the list of persons to act as grand jurors, must be made before the jury was sworn. In Territory v. Braly, 29 Haw. 7, 8-10, the Supreme Court of the Territory considered on a plea of abatement a challenge based on alleged failure to apportion properly the citizenry for grand jury service among several precincts but the court\u2019s decision was based in fact upon the conclusion that no abuse of discretion had been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The defendants urge that under the rule of Carter v. Texas, 177 U.S. 442, 20 S.Ct. 687, 44 L.Ed. 839, dealing with the exclusion by a Texas court of members of the African race from a grand jury, rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States to the plaintiffs in the instant cases could be preserved by a motion to quash the indictment on arraignment. Cf. Territory v. Ferris, supra. But this raises a substantial federal question which, however, melts into the major contentions of the plaintiffs in the ijistant cases that they have been denied their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We are of the opinion that the defendants named in the indictment No. 2365 did not have a fair opportunity <footnotemark>86</footnotemark> to challenge the 1947 Maui County grand jury and, as we have stated, had no substantial reason for believing that that grand jury would indict them on December 2,1947; that their objections to the jury commissioners and to the constituency of the 1947 grand jury must be weighed and considered. The question then becomes: Shall this court consider on behalf of Kaholokula and his co-defendants under indictment No. 2365 the motions and challenges, filed by Makekau and Barbosa in the Second Circuit Court which have been made part of the records of the cases at bar by the stipulations of the-parties ?<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The defendants insist that all the pertinent evidence on this issue should be stricken out at both numbers and that this court may not consider it. They contend that we do not have the jurisdiction, i. e., <em>power, </em>to determine the issue whether a grand jury of the Territory has been properly constituted even if it has been selected in a manner clearly prohibited by the Constitution of the United States. Cf. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783. The defendants endeavor to draw an analogy helpful to them from the federal statute relating to the removal of civil rights cases, Section 31 of the old Judicial Code, presently Section 1443 of revised Title 28, citing Kaizo v. Henry, 211 U.S. 146, 148, 29 S.Ct. 41, 53 L.Ed. 125, a case arising in the Territory of Hawaii, and Andrews v. Swartz, 156 U.S. 272, 276, 15 S.Ct. 389, 39 L.Ed. 422. It is doubtful if the cited cases retain full authority today in view of Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 146 A.L.R. 357, wherein the Supreme Court held that a trial court would lose jurisdiction,- i. e., the power, to try a criminal indictment, if the defendant wa-s denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. It is the law, however, that civil rights cases may not be removed to the federal court unless the denial of civil rights occurs by reason of provisions of a state constitution or statute. Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Powers, 201 U.S. 1, 30, 31; 26 S.Ct. 387, 50 L.Ed. 633, 5 Ann.Cas. 692; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 309, 25 L.Ed. 664; and Virginia v. Rives (Ex parte Virginia), 100 pp. 313, 321, 25 L.Ed. 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">But assuming, as we must by reason of Section 86 of the Organic Act, as amended, that the Territory of Hawaii stands in the same position to the United States as a State insofar as removal of causes is -concerned, we are of the opinion that decisions controlling the removal of civil rights cases to the federal courts nonetheless are not persuasive here. The question presented is not whether the case of the Territory v. Kaholokula, et al., may be removed to the United .States District Court for the District of Hawaii, but whether in a suit based upon the Civil Rights Acts this court may consider whether Kaholokula and his co-defendants, plaintiffs at No. 836, have been deprived of rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States by reason of the methods employed in the selection of the 1947 Maui County grand jury. We are of the opinion that the latter question is within the ambit of the powers conferred upon a district court of the United States by Section 1343 of revised Title 28. See also R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1977 and 1979. The question before us is not how might removal be accomplished but whether the plaintiffs are being deprived of their civil rights. The question at bottom therefore is the same as that previously decided by us. But even if it were not, we nontheless sit as a court of equity. It is well established that a court of equity, having acquired jurisdiction on adequate grounds should determine all material issues. Our decision should not be truncated. Accordingly, we hold that it is proper for this court to consider the pertinent evidence stipulated into the records at both numbers and to adjudicate the issue involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The Evidence Produced on the Motions and Challenges of Makekau and Others and Barbosa and Others to the Jury Commissioners and to the 1947 Maui County Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We state preliminarily that the provisions of the law of the Territory of Hawaii relating to \u201cJurors\u201d are to be found in Sections 9791 to 9813, inclusive, of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945. as amended, and in Section 83 of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 635. We shall not repeat -all the provisions of the statutes but we point out that Section 9800 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945 stated in pertinent part \u201cThat the jury commission of each circuit shall in each year make and file with the clerk of the circuit court at least ten days before the next term of court two certified, separate lists of citizens to serve respectively as grand and trial jurors in the oircuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>for the ensuing year. It shall select and list the names of one hundred citizens as trial jurors and fifty citizens as grand jurors * * * \u201d, and \u201cAll of such selections shall be citizens whom the respective commissions believe, after careful investigation in each case, to be qualified and not exempt under the provisions of this chapter. If practicable, no person shall be selected who has served as a juror or grand juror within one year. All of such selections shall be made without reference to the political affiliations or' to the race or place of nativity of citizens, with a view to obtain lists representative of the qualified citizenry of each circuit.\u201d The last sentence quoted was amended by L.1945, Act 163, \u00a7 1, Section 9800.01, to provide that \u201cNo person shall be selected and listed as a grand juror who has been so selected and listed within one year * * * \u201d. Section 2 of the statute last designated also added a requirement of three years residence in the Territory, amending Section 9791 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945 to that extent. Section 9791 need not be quoted here. It is sufficient to state that it embodies in substance, the amending residence qualification aside, the provisions of Section 83 of the Organic Act, including those relating to the ability of the juror to speak English. Section 9803 provides fbr the drawing of the grand jury panel by the clerk of the court by lot in the usual fashion; that is to say the fifty names on the list are put into the \u201cgrand jury box\u201d and from these names the clerk selects \u201c * * * not less than thirteen nor more than twenty-three persons to serve as grand jurors * * The 1947 grand jury consisted of twenty-one persons so selected. They are the defendants named as grand jurors in the complaints at Nos. 828 and 836..</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">It will be noted upon an examination of the testimony before this court, from the transcript of the hearings before Judge Cristy and also from a number of the exhibits that the terms \u201clist\u201d, \u201cgrand jury\u201d, \u201cgrand jury as a whole\u201d, \u201cpanel\u201d and \u201carray\u201d have been employed on occasion in a manner which creates some confusion. The three terms first quoted were generally employed to designate the list of fifty persons selected by the jury commissioners for grand jury service. The terms \u201cpanel\u201d or \u201carray\u201d seemingly were used on most occasions to designate the twenty-one grand jurors drawn by lot by the clerk of the court from the list of fifty names selected by the jury commission; for example, the grand jurors named as defendants in the instant occasion. Cf. the respective definitions of \u201cpanel\u201d and \u201carray\u201d, Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s Third Revision. In at least tw&amp; instances, however, the word \u201cpanel\u201d was used where the term \u201clist\u201d would have been more appropriate. See Movants\u2019 Exhibit No. 15 in the proceedings before Judge Cristy, referred to hereinafter. See also Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The evidence produced on the challenges to the grand jury by Makekau, et al., and Barbosa, et al., in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit respectively at Criminal Nos. 2412 and 2413, shows that the 1947 Maui County grand jury was not impaneled in accordance with law. This appears from the record of the proceedings before Judge Albert M. Cristy, sitting vice Judge Cable A. Wirtz, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, and made part of the record at both our numbers.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The Court allowed but a limited review of the methods employed to select the grand jury and of the individual qualifications of the members thereof. Judge Cristy would not permit what he referred to as a \u201cfree for all\u201d examination of the members of the panel upon voir dire. He permitted examination of individual grand jurors on voir dire only to the extent of allowing the defendants\u2019 counsel to bring out their respective business connections and general position in the community. The court was apparently of the view that a wider scope of examination of the qualifications of individual members of the panel would be irrelevant. Judge Cristy also excluded evidence which, from the nature of the offers made, would have tended to show more clearly that certain important elements of the community were precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>from serving on the grand juries of Maui County. The court, however, permitted enough evidence to come into the record to demonstrate the erroneous method employed in selecting the 1947 Maui County grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">There was evidence which we believe to be credible and from which we find that 84% of the persons who were selected and listed for grand jury service in 1947 came from the ranks of the employer-entrepreneur group and their salaried (non-labor) employees. The record demonstrates also that all other groups in th\u2019e community, including labor, had approximately but a 16% representation on the 1947 grand jury list.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The word \u201chaole\u201d has been much employed throughout the testimony and, as we \u25a0stated at an earlier point in this opinion, a satisfactory definition of it is hard to encompass. A haole was defined by a witness (see note 11, supra) as <em>a person of mainland American or of northern European </em>stock, <em>not a person of Portuguese, Spanish or Puerto Rican descent. </em>To this we added the gloss of Adams\u2019 definition (see note 13, supra) describing the haole as a class of persons of <em>superior economic and social status. </em>As indicated previously we accept this composite definition. The dominant position of the haole in the economic life of the Territory of Hawaii has been testified to repeatedly in the instant case and is also fully borne out by such authorities as Burrows<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> and Lind.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> While we think that the record in the instant cases demonstrates that the haole group and the employer-entrepreneur group in the Islands should be deemed to be almost co-extensive, we shall not so treat them for the purposes of the question now under discussion and will employ the term \u201chaole\u201d as defined in this paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Employing that definition we find that though the haole group comprised but about 3.6% of the population of Maui County, the 1947 Maui County grand jury list nonetheless contained the names of twenty-one haoles or 42% of the list. On the other hand there were only six laboring men named on the grand jury list, or a total of 12%. Cf. Movants\u2019 Exhibits Nos. 7 and 9. But male laborers in Maui County comprised approximately 79% of the total male population of that County. Again see Movants\u2019 Exhibit No. 9. Only laborers are named in the indictment at No. 2365 and in the criminal complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">It should be observed that the percentage of Koreans, Hawaiians, Puerto Ricans and Filipinos on the list was zero. There were over 10,000 persons of Filipino descent in Maui County in 1946 and 1947 but the 1947 grand jury list contained no Filipinos. The evidence also shows that Filipinos constitute the -second largest national group in the Territory. While Filipinos who had not been engaged in the military service of the United States could not become naturalized citizens until 1946<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> nonetheless the registry of voters at the election which was held on November 5, 1946<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> demonstrates that many, more than one hundred, male Filipinos were entitled to vote at that election. It will be noted that the provisions of Section 9791 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945 do not require that to be eligible for 'jury service that the individual must be a registered voter but only that he possess the qualifications for registration as a voter. Questionnaires <footnotemark>93</footnotemark> were submitted to numerous Filipinos along with other members of the community whom it was contemplated might be called for jury service, and though there were numerous Filipinos who were qualified <footnotemark>94</footnotemark> none was called to serve. There were a number of Filipinos indicted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the indictment at No. 2365 and named in the criminal complaints hereinbefore referred to. These include at No. 828, Diego Barbosa, Victor Degamo, and Basilo Ar-ruiza; at No. 836, Leocadio Baldovi, Calix-tro Cason and Juan Hara.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Statistics are sometimes most misleading when they seem the clearest and we would hesitate to base our decision upon them. Filipinos represent about 35% of the male population of Maui County though comparatively few are citizens, and therefore it might be argued that it was by pure inadvertence that all of them were excluded from grand jury duty; that the haole group are in fact better educated than the average citizen of Hawaii, and that therefore, since the jury commissioners are required by law to make a \u201ccareful investigation in each case\u201d,<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> their selections naturally include more of the better educated members of the community. In this connection we point out again that Section 83 of the Organic Act requires that a juror must be able \u201cunderstandingly [to] speak, read, and write the English language * * * The testimony received by Judge Cristy, however, makes it clear, statistics aside, \u2022 that the exclusion of certain groups of the community was deliberate and intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Pursuant to Section <em>9799, </em>Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, the jury lists are made up by three jury commissioners, two of whom are appointed by the judge of the circuit court, the third commissioner being ex officio the judge himself. Augustine Pombo, one of the jury commissioners, had served as such for an extended period of time, having had fourteen years of consecutive service with the exception of one year, 1945. The other jury commissioner was Claude E. Chatterton. Judge Wirtz, Mr. Pombo and Mr. Chatterton chose the persons comprising the list of the 1947 Maui County grand jury. When Mr. Pombo was asked why there never had been a Filipino on the \u201cGrand Jury\u201d he replied candidly, \u201cWe just have a lot of other men a lot better.\u201d <footnotemark>96</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>97</footnotemark> As to the number of haoles on the grand jury list Mr. Pombo\u2019s statements were equally pointed and conclusive and admit of no misunderstanding. He testified in effect that he picked haoles because he wanted to give them something to do \u201c * * * if they want a chance to run the country * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> The substance of Mr. Pombo\u2019s testimony is that haoles were placed on the grand jury so that they might have an opportunity to run the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Mr. Pombo\u2019s standard of selecting jurymen was also made plain when he stated: \u201cWell, we picked men \u2014 majority of them with better education. They are in business in the community.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cWas it your feeling that a man in business would be better qualified than a man out of business?\u201d He replied, \u201cHe has got a better head on him.\u201d <footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Neither of the other two jury commissioners denied the accuracy of Mr. Pombo\u2019s testimony respecting this basis or standard of selection in any particular. What Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Pombo said respecting methods of selecting persons to comprise the grand jury list seems to us to be conclusive in proving deliberate exclusion of Filipinos from grand jury service as well as a deliberate weighting of the grand jury list in favor of haoles and against the laboring men of the community. We so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Judge Wirtz testified that the selection of jurors was made from persons whom the jury commissioners knew, individuals with whom they had had personal contact on a business or social basis.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Judge Wirtz\u2019 testimony respecting the personal knowledge of the jury commissioners of the persons selected by them to form the list was corroborated by Mr. Pombo and to some extent also by Mr. Chatterton.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> See Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 132, 61 S.Ct. 164, 85 L.Ed. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Section 9800, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, provided in respect to the selection of jurors, both grand and petit, that, \u201cIf practicable, no person shall be selected who has served as a juror or grand juror within one year.\u201d Movants\u2019 Exhibit No. 15 in the proceedings before judge C-risty on the challenges to the jury commissioners and to the 1947 grand jury of Maui County by Makekau, et al., and Barbosa, et al., Criminal Nos. 2412 and 2413, Circuit Court, Second Circuit, Territory of Hawaii, covers the service of members of the Maui County grand jury panels from 1942 to 1947, inclusive. The exhibit, however, was so qualified by the testimony of Judge Wirtz<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> that it appears that the term \u201cservice\u201d as employed in the exhibit meant listing on the grand jury lists rather than actual service on a grand jury. Assuming, as we think we must, that the terms \u201cservice\u201d and \u201cserved\u201d as employed in the exhibit mean being named on a grand' jury list, rather than actual service on a grand jury, i. e., being called and sworn to serve thereon, the exhibit is enlightening nonetheless as to the methods employed in constituting grand jury lists in Maui County for it demonstrates that 54 individuals were listed to serve for 141 years of a total of 300 man-</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">years (50 men on each jury list for 6 years) during the period indicated. It does appear, however, from the testimony taken before Judge Cristy that there was no person on the 1947 grand jury list who had been listed as a grand juror in Maui County in 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Section 9800 stated, prior to amendment, that if practicable no person should be selected who had served as a juror within a year. Section 9800, as we have said, was amended by L. 1945, Act 163, \u00a7 1, Section 9800.01, to provide that no person should be selected and listed as a grand juror who had been <em>so </em>selected and listed within one year and that no person should be selected and listed as a trial juror who had been <em>so </em>selected and listed within one year. The law as amended became effective on May 14, 1945, subject to a qualification not here pertinent. Despite these provisions, however, it will be observed from Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 26 that at least seven persons (at least six of whom were haoles) who were listed on the 1945 Maui County grand jury list were listed again on the 1946 list. It will be remembered that the 1946 grand jury returned the first indictment, Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit No. 9, against Kaholokula and others based on the unlawful assembly and riot act of the Territory of Hawaii. The names of the seven men to whom we have referred are H. B. Benner, F. G. Bush, A. J. Collins, Wm. Dickson, F. J. S. Gay, J. W. Hoxie, and E. F. Sabin. The 1946 indictment of Kaholokula, et al., was quashed by order of the Supreme Court of Hawaii following its opinion in Territory of Hawaii v. Kaholokula et al., 37 Haw. 625, and the facts stated have no specific bearing on the 1947 grand jury list. They are illuminating, however, in view of what we have previously stated in respect to the handling of grand jury lists in the Circuit Court, Second Circuit, and they are pertinent insofar as they serve to corroborate Pombo\u2019s testimony set out in note 98, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Section 83 of the Organic Act provides inter alia that \u201c* * * all juries shall be constituted without reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the race or place of nativity of the jurors\u201d. Yet the questionnaires in evidence<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> submitted to each prospective juror in every instance require a statement as to where the individual was born and the nationality of both his father and mother. True, \u201crace\u201d is not \u201cnationality\u201d if the two words be employed in a strict ethnological sense but commonly the word \u201crace\u201d is used to denote \u201cThe descendants of a common ancestor; a family, tribe, people, or nation * * * \u00bb<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> We are 0f j-jjg opinion that the questions to which we have referred were in fact directed to \u201crace\u201d as that word is used in the ordinary or common sense and, therefore, indirectly at least, referred to \u201cplace of nativity\u201d in derogation of Section 83 of the Organic Act. The questionnaires seem to have been employed for no purpose within the law insofar as the 1947 grand jury was concerned. See Section 9791, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">In view of the foregoing we con-, elude that the 1947 Maui County grand jury was constituted illegally. The provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States apply to the Territory of Hawaii. See Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U.S. 197, 211, 23 S.Ct. 787, 47 L.Ed. 1016. Cf. Andres v. United States, supra, 333 U.S. at page 748, 68 S. Ct. 880. The exclusion of Filipinos from grand jury service for the reason given by Pombo falls clearly within the prohibition of that line of cases beginning with Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L. Ed. 664, and running through Smith v. Texas, supra, to Patton v. Mississippi, 332 U.S. 463, 68 S.Ct. 184. There was also, as \u2022 we have indicated, a deliberate substantial exclusion of wage earners and a deliberate substantial weighting of the grand jury list in favor of \u201cbusinessmen\u201d, in the instant cases, really the employer-entrepreneur which includes the haole group of Maui County. This also is prohibited. In Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 220-224, 66 S.Ct. 984, 985, 90 L.Ed. 1181, 166 A.L.R. 1412, the Supreme Court by Mr. Justice Murphy stated: \u201cThe American tradition of trial by jui <em>y, </em>considered in connection with either criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartial jury drawn from a cross-section of the community. * * * This does not mean, of course, that every jury must contain representatives of all the economic, social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups of the community; frequently such complete representation would be impossible. But it does mean that prospective jurors shall be selected by court officials without systematic and intentional exclusion of any of these groups. Recognition must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to be found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system. To disregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and discriminations which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial by jury. * * * Wage earners, include ing those who are paid by the day, constitute a very substantial portion of the community, * * * a portion that cannot be intentionally and systematically excluded in whole or in part without doing violence to the democratic nature of the jury system. Were we to sanction an exclusion of this nature we would encourage whatever desires those responsible for the selection of jury panels may have to discriminate against persons of low economic and social status. We would breathe life into any latent tendencies to establish the jury as the instrument of the economically and socially privileged. That we refuse to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Compare Fay v. New York, 332 U.S. 261, 67 S.Ct. 1613, 91 L.Ed. 2043. In the cited case the Supreme Court held that consistent with due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment a State could try a defendant charged with a crime by a special or \u201cblue ribbon\u201d jury. Mr. Justice Jackson distinquished carefully, however, between State and federal juries and the decisions respecting each. See 332 U.S. at page 284 et seq., 67 S.Ct. 1613, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>L.Ed. 2043, and compare Moore v. New York, 333 U.S. 565, 68 S.Ct. 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">It is clear that the Territory of Hawaii and its Legislature, Executive Officers and Judiciary, can exercise only the powers delegated to them by Congress, and that Congress cannot deny the right of trial by jury as guaranteed \u2019by the Sixth Amendment or indictment by a grand jury under \u25a0the Fifth Amendment. The constitutional guarantee requires that no group in the' community shall be excluded deliberately from jury service and that a grand jury panel shall constitute a fair cross-section of the country or locality from which it is drawn. The 1947 Maui County grand jury was constituted in disregard of these fundamental principles, as well as of others of importance embraced in the local law as we have indicated.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> We, therefore, have no hesitancy in enjoining the prosecution of the individual plaintiffs under indictment No. 2365, even if that prosecution was not to be restrained for the reasons stated under the earlier heading of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The plaintiffs also charge the jury commissioners with bias and prejudice and point out that Mr. Pombo, Mr. Chatterton and Judge Wirtz are still in office. This court would be without power to remove them from office, even if we were of the opinion that the facts warranted such action. The challenges to individual members of the grand jury were not sufficiently developed in the evidence possibly because of the exclusion of evidence by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit which tried the proceeding. Under these circumstances there can be no point in further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Respecting the Qualifications of Certain Plaintiffs to Maintain Suit and Questions of Misjoinder, or Lack of Capacity of Certain Defendants to be Sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">As we have indicated we entertain no doubt of the right of the individual plaintiffs, who are defendants in the various criminal proceedings which we have referred to, to maintain the suits at bar under the Civil Rights Acts. So much we think is clear, but do the ILWU, Kawano at No. 828 and Rania at No. 836, possess the right to maintain suits?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the Hague case, supra, 101 F.2d at page 709, for the reasons therein stated, held that unincorporated associations, labor unions, were proper parties and possessed the capacity to conduct in the interests of their respective members a suit based on the Civil Rights Acts. Mr. Justice Roberts in his opinion in Hague v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>C. I. O., supra, 307 U.S. at page 514, 59 S.Ct. 954, 963, 83 L.Ed. 1423, disagreed. Basing his opinion on the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he pointed out that \u201cNatural persons,' and they alone, are entitled to the privileges and immunities which Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment secures for \u2018citizens of the United States.\u2019 Only the individual respondents may, therefore, maintain this suit.\u201d While this opinion is entitled to great weight we think that the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment are protected from abridgment by a State by virtue of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See the opinion of Mr. Justice Stone in the Hague case, and Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 68 S.Ct. 1148. The privileges and immunities secured to citizens against encroachment by the States under the Fourteenth Amendment are substantially identical, insofar as the instant cases are concerned, with those guaranteed to any individual against impairment by the federal government under the First Amendment. We can perceive no reason, in the light of history, why an unincorporated association should not be held to be \u201ca person\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, in A. F. of L. v. Watson, supra, the Supreme Court seemed to entertain no doubt of the capacity of the union to maintain a suit to test the constitutionality under the Federal Constitution of an amendment to the Constitution of Florida. It may have been argued in the cited case, as in effect it was argufcd in the instant cases, that the interest of the union was too remote to give it locus standi. See 327 U.S. at pages 582, 587, 66 S.Ct. 761, 90 L.Ed. 873. Cf. Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra, 297 U.S. at page 244, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660. But in any event the decision in A. F. of L. v. Watson is governing here and we hold that the ILWU is entitled to maintain the instant suits as a party plaintiff. This is so whether the suit be maintained as a true class action under Rule 23 (a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., made applicable in the District Court of the United States for the District of Hawaii by Section 86a of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646, [see revised 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2072 and Reviser\u2019s note], pursuant to Section 1337 of Revised Title 28 United States Code Annotated, <em>or </em>under Rule 23 (a) (3), as a spurious class suit to redress the deprivation of civil rights under Section 1343 of revised Title 28 United States Code Annotated. See Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U.S. 282, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189. Accordingly the motions to dismiss it as a party will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The defendants have made like motions to dismiss as to Kawano and Rania who, as has been stated, have sued as members and officials of the ILWU as well as individually. Their representative statuses are clear and it is unnecessary for Kawano at No. 828 to rely for a representative capacity on his presidency of the now defunct Territorial Council of the IL WU. We think that both of these individuals are entitled to maintain the representative actions in which they appear as plaintiffs. See Rule 23 (a) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co., 259 U.S. 344, 385, 42 S.Ct. 570, 66, L.Ed. 975, 27 A.L.R. 762; United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 88 L.Ed. 1542, 152 A.L.R. 1202. Cf. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. Langer, 8 Cir., 168 F.2d 182, 187. The motions to dismiss as to Kawano and Rani\u00e1 will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">As to the Territorial Council of the IL WU, a plaintiff at No. 828, since it was no longer in existence at the time the cases were tried, it will be dismissed as a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">A number of the defendants have moved to dismiss on the ground that no cause of action has been stated as to them or on the ground of misjoinder or for other reasons. Judge Cable A. Wirtz has been sued individually as a Circuit Court Judge and as Jury Commissioner of the County of Maui, and Messrs. Pombo and Chatterton have been sued both individually and as Jury Commissioners of Maui County. The 1947 Maui County grand jury like that of 1946 is now functus officio. This court has no power over Judge Wirtz or over Mr. Pombo or Mr. Chatterton as jury com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>missioners as we have already indicated. We cannot undertake to govern their future actions by prescient decrees. The relief sought against Judge Wirtz seems to be sought solely against him as a jury commissioner. <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> The prayers of the respective complaints do not seek to restrain him in any other way. It follows .that no relief has been sought against these defendants either individually or otherwise which can be granted 'by this court. Accordingly they will be dismissed as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">What has been said respecting Judge Wirtz and the two other jury commissioners is true in substance as to the twenty-one grand jurors who comprised the 1947 Maui County grand jury and who are named as defendants both individually and as grand jurors. The work of that grand jury is over and done and its members have been discharged. There is no basis for present injunctive relief against them or any of them. Accordingly they will be dismissed as defendants. We note parenthetically ithat none of the individual grand jurors at No. 836 was served with process. This constitutes an additional ground for the dismissal of the suit at No. 836 as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The Honorable Ingram M. Stain-baclc has been named as a defendant both individually and as Governor of the Territory of Hawaii. Section 67 of the Organic Aat, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 532, states that' \u201cThe governor shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of the United States and of the Territory of Hawaii within the said Territory * * * Section 9572, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, provides, \u201c * * * the [Judiciary] department and the several judges and other judicial officers thereof shall in all respects be independent of both the executive and legislative departments. The governor shall \u25a0 have no power to interfere with, alter or overrule any order, writ, judgment or decision of any court, judge or other judicial officer, except in the exercise of the power to grant reprieves and pardons in pursuance of law.\u201d If there be a conflict between the provisions of Section 67 of the Organic Act and Section 9572 of the Revised. Laws of Hawaii 1945, it is unnecessary to resolve it for there is not an iota of evidence to prove that Governor Stainback had any connection with any of the prosecutions complained of. Accordingly the complaints will be dismissed as to him for want of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Walter D. Ackerman, Jr., has been sued individually and as Attorney General of the Territory of Hawaii. It is contended that he was appointed to office after the happening of the events complained of and therefore should not be held as a party defendant. It should be noted, however, that Mr. Ackerman took office on October 14, 1947, and Joseph Kaholokula, et al., were indicted (second indictment) December 2, 1947. The relief which we shall grant, however, will be injunctive in its nature and the laws of the Territory of Hawaii require that the Attorney General \u201c* * * shall appear for the Territory personally or by deputy, in all courts of record, in all cases criminal or civil in which the Territory may be a party, or be- interested, and may in like manner appear in the district courts in such cases.\u201d Section 1501, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945. Section 1502, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, provides inter alia, that the Attorney General \u201c * * * shall be vigilant and active in detecting offenders against the laws of the Territory, and shall prosecute the same with diligence * * * In view of all the circumstances it would be improper to dismiss Mr. Ackerman as a party defendant. Accordingly the motions ito dismiss as to him will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">E. R. Bevins has been sued individually and as County Attorney for the County of Maui, and Wendell F. Crockett, Deputy County Attorney of Maui County, has also been sued individually and as Deputy County Attorney. By Section 6271, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, Mr. Bevins is made a deputy to the Attorney General for the purposes of law enforcement, and Mr. Crockett is Mr. Bevins\u2019 deputy. They are properly in the cases as defendants and must remain. They have moved .to dismiss the complaints on the ground of lack of equity. The motions will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Jean Lane has been sued at No. 828 individually and as Chief of Police of Maui County. As the chief law enforcement officer of that County he is properly a party to the proceedings. See Sections 6472-6474, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945. Accordingly the motion to dismiss as to him will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The motions heretofore made in the cases for more definite statements, to strike the complaints, to dismiss the actions and for summary judgments, were denied at preliminary stages for what the court deemed to be sufficient reasons and in order that these long pending litigations might be proceeded with promptly. Thereafter, these motions were renewed at the suggestion of the court and were taken under advisement. They will now be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">All motions made by the parties to strike testimony or documentary evidence will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">All other points raised 'by the respective parties have been considered by the court but require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Decrees will be entered at Nos. 828 and 836, mutatis mutandis, in accordance with the relief to be granted under this opinion to the respective parties and movants, and, in particular adjudging the unlawful assembly and riot act and the conspiracy statute of the Territory of Hawaii to be void as unconstitutional and restraining the defendants Ackerman, Bevins, Crockett, and Lane and their respective agents and deputies and their successors in office from proceeding with the prosecution of the individual plaintiffs as designated herein under any complaint or indictment based on the unlawful assembly and riot act or the conspiracy statute of the Territory of Hawaii. The decrees will be so framed that the benefits thereof shall inure to the ILWU, and to Kawano and Rania in their respective representative capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">We believe that all necessary findings of fact and conclusions of law are contained in this opinion as contemplated by Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Decrees may be submitted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> At No. 828, the plaintiffs by amendment set up jurisdictional amount and other allegations required by Section 24(1) of the Judicial Code of 1911, now revised Title 28, Section 1331. Similar allegations are contained in the original complaint at No. 836. Jurisdiction in the cases at bar, however, lies in the court by virtue of Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 43, R.S. \u00a7 1979, 8 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 43, the Civil Rights Acts referred to above and Section 1343 of revised Title 28. Jurisdiction is also vested in this court by virtue of Section 1337 of revised Title 28. See the heading, \u201cThe General Jurisdiction of the Court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">The allegations as to jurisdictional amounts contained in the amendment at No. 828 and in the complaint at No. 836 deal with losses allegedly suffered by the ILWU, not by any local, and by individual plaintiffs. Pertinent findings as to jurisdictional amounts are made in note 5, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-20\"> This is applicable to Portuguese and Puerto Ricans and to persons whose ancestry contains either a Portuguese or a Puerto Rican strain, all of whom are considered by Island custom or <em>mores </em>to be non-Oaucasians.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-21\"> See paragraph 2 of the stipulations of April 22, 1948 filed at Nos. 828 and 836.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-10\"> This is No. 2365 in the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit.

As we have stated like allegations are set up in the amendment to the complaint at No. 828. The financial losses in each case are alleged to be in excess of $3,000. In the view we take of the cases, insofar as jurisdiction is concerned, these allegations are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">But, if we are wrong in our decisions, to the end that the causes may not have to be remanded by the reviewing Court for further findings, wo find that losses resulting to the ILWU by reason of the enforcement of the unlawful assembly and riot act of Hawaii were in excess of $3,000. We find that the enforcement of the statute caused a decrease in the membership of the union which loss resulted in the loss of dues to the union in excess of the amount of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">As a matter of law these losses, since they resulted indirectly to the ILWU, are not cognizable as legal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">There are no allegations in either the complaint at No. <em>828, </em>as amended, or in the complaint at No. 836, that individual locals of the ILWU suffered damages. Indeed, no local is named as a plaintiff in either action.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">The damages to the individual plaintiffs in either action are not cognizable in terms of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">This note and the findings contained therein are to be read in conjunction with those in note 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b122-4\"> Mr. Justice Stone and Mr. Justice Cardozo in their concurring opinion in Borden\u2019s Farm Products Co. v.

Mr. Adams wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\u201cIn continental United States the people of the white race take themselves for granted and they classify the others and assign them their place in the social order. They are able to ignore any point of view different from their own. In Hawaii the white people were, for a long time, so few that the Hawaiians, who took themselves for granted, named and placed the other peoples. Of course they had to place (114) the British and Americans near the top, but the name, <em>haole, </em>was Hawaiian and it is best understood from the standpoint of Hawaiian experience. It has been necessary, therefore, in Hawaii for white people to see themselves somewhat as Hawaiians see them. 'They have accepted the Hawaiian designation, <em>haole, </em>and, of course, it has affected their conception of their role and their behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">\u201cThe word, <em>haole, </em>in the beginning meant stranger or outsider. It did not, at first, refer to color, but since nearly all of the early strangers, were white men it came to be applied in its unmodified form only to white people. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">\u201c * * * When white men, mainly British and American, came to be somewhat numerous they occupied most of the important professional positions and they were executives and administrators, the owners of property and the initiators of policy. Of course there were many who occupied positions of minor importance, but even they were better paid than others and the way was more open to them for promotion. Thus the word came gradually to stand for a class of superior economic and social status. * * * It is reasonable to assume that the term, <em>haole, </em>was, for a long time, more significant of rank than of race. But as Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians in the more recent times have been learning to speak the English language and, with it, taking over other elements of American (115) and European culture, they are more or less coming to think in terms of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">\u201cIt must be emphasized that the term, <em>haole, </em>acquired its meaning from Hawaiian experience and attitudes and that its use has become current among all the other peoples because it stands for something they feel to be unique in the posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tion of this group. As a local classificatory term its meaning is maintained not so much by the <em>haole </em>as by others. When some of the German plantation laborers won a better economic status the decision whether they were to be regarded as <em>haole </em>lay in part with the <em>haole </em>who might or might not give them social recognition, but more largely with the Hawaiians and others who might or might not be willing to treat them as <em>haole.\u201d </em>(116)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\u201cAmong the European immigrants of the nineteenth century the Portuguese were unique in relation to the status achieved. Coming mainly as plantation laborers they did not as promptly improve their status as did the Germans and Norwegians. The Portuguese were much more numerous.

Senate Document No. 16, p. 162, \u201cReport of the Committee on Judiciary\u201d, wherein it is stated in part, \u201cHawaii having been hitherto a single independent State, its courts have exercised much of the jurisdiction exercised by both the Federal and State courts in this country. In this respect the Hawaiian courts have resembled somewhat the courts of the Territories of the United States, which, as a rule, have had much Federal jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction of cases arising un-dor the Territorial laws. It seems very desirable in the case of Hawaii to separate these jurisdictions, leaving all cases arising under the laws of the Territory to Territorial courts and transferring all jurisdiction of a Federal nature to a district court of the United States to be established for the Territory of Hawaii. This district court should have also the jurisdiction of a circuit court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">\u201cThere are many reasons which make this separation of jurisdictions desirable. The foreign shipping already calling at the ports of Hawaii, as well as the shipping from the United States is very ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tensive and is rapidly increasing. With the natural growth of commerce on the Pacific, and- especially in view of the change in the ownership of the Philippines, the near completion of the Siberian Railway, and the projected Nicaraguan Canal, the shipping that will call at the Hawaiian Islands will undoubtedly increase more rapidly in the future than it has increased in the past. This will give rise to many important admiralty cases in Hawaii, some of which may become matters of international interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u201cIt is obviously very desirable that jurisdiction over such cases should be exercised by Federal judges. Again, in the event of war, Hawaii may become a center for the trial of prize cases, of which the Federal courts should have exclusive jurisdiction. <em>By making the relations between the territorial courts of Hawaii and the Federal courts, as to appeals, removal of causes, etc., the same as the corresponding relations between the State and Federal courts, all cases of a local nature can be tried and determined finally in the islands, and thus the expense and delay of bringing such cases to the mainland, and possibly to Washington, a distance of 5,000 miles, will be avoided. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u201cVery little change need be made in the organization of the territorial or local judiciary. The organization and procedure of the Hawaiian courts is already very similar to what is found in the United States. This has been the result of a growth of sixty years of constitutional government in Hawaii under American influences. The judiciary department, unlike the executive and legislative departments, has always been free from politics. The people of Hawaii have great confidence irt their judiciary and have always looked to it as the one impregnable bulwark of their liberties. The last two sovereigns under the monarchy, who did so much to lower the standard of the executive and legislative departments, did not dare to encroach materially upon the judiciary department until the final attempt of the Queen, which resulted in the loss of her throne.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\"> To read as follows: \u201cThe laws of the United States relating to removal of causes, appeals and other matters and proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the several States shall govern in such matters and proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of the Territory of Hawaii.\u201d 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">The language quoted is in all pertinent respects identical with that which has always been included in Section 86 of the Organic Act.

Such a limitation in our opinion does not exist. Section 132(b) of revised Title 28 provides, it is true, that each district court shall consist of the district judges for the district in active service. But that sub-section also provides that, \u201c* * * judges designated or assigned shall be competent to sit as judges of the court.\u201d The two judges sitting in this case with the Chief Judge of the District Court were thus designated or assigned and comprise a court of three judges sitting en bane.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The other District Judge for Hawaii did not sit. This fact does not prevent this tribunal from exercising jurisdiction in the instant cases for it is a rule of general application that the death, disqualification or absence of a judge will not deprive the remaining judges of the court of authority to hold court and to adjudieate cases provided that the number of the court is not reduced below that legally required for the transaction of business.

Put briefly, the argument made by the plaintiffs runs as follows: Section S3 of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 635 provides that \u201c * * * no person who is not a male citizen of the United States * * * shall be a qualified juror or grand juror in the Territory of Hawaii.\u201d See also the 'similar provision of Section 9791, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945. By the Act of June 26, 1930, 46 Stat. 818, the qualifications of electors of the Territory was amended by striking from Section 60 of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 617, the word \u201cmale\u201d so that women are now qualified electors in the Territory. The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, effective August 26, 1920, provides that \u201cThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State on account of sex.\u201d The plaintiffs contend that with the adoption of the Amendment \u201c * * * women became qualified jurors since the qualifications for jury service existing as of that time were the same as for electors.\u201d Cf. Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 67 S.Ct. 261, 91 L.Ed. 181, and see State v. Walker, 192 Iowa 823, 185 N.W. 619 and State v. Hickman, 195 Iowa 765, 771, 193 N.W. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">But the provisions of the Nineteenth Amendment guarantee to women who are citizens of the United States only the right to vote. Section 83 of the Organic Act, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 635, has not been amended, that statute still providing that. jurors shall be male citizens. Section 9791, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945, as amended, follows in respects here pertinent, the language of Section 83 of the Organic Act. The enlargement of the group of electors of the Territory by adding women thereto by statutory enactment pursuant to the mandate of the Nineteenth Amendment cannot automatically qualify women as jurors in the territorial courts of Hawaii. The point asserted by the plaintiffs is lacking in merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"106\">\n<p id=\"b172-12\"> gee paragraph XI of the Complaint at No. 828 and paragraph X of the complaint at No. 836.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
