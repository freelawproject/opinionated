L., <em>\u00fc. </em>218, s. 2. \u201cThe word \u2018citizen,\u2019 when used in its most common and most comprehensive sense, doubtless includes women : but a woman is not, by virtue of her citizenship, vested by the constitution . . . with any absolute right, independent of legislation, to take part in the government, either as a voter or as, an officer, or to be admitted to practice as an attorney. . . . The word \u2018 citizen,\u2019 in the statute under which this application is made, is but a repetition of the word originally adopted with a view of excluding aliens.\u201d <em>Robinson\u2019s </em>Case, 131 Mass. 376, 377, 382.. Under a statute like ours in all respects that are material in the present inquiry, it was held in that case that an unmarried woman is not entitled to be examined for admission as an attorney. The ground of the decision was, that by the law of England, which was our law from the first settlement of the country until the American Revolution, no woman could, in person, take an official part in the government of the state, except as queen or overseer of the poor, without express authority of statute: no case is known in which a woman was admitted to practice as an attorney, solicitor, or barrister: although an attorney at-law is not, in the strictest sense, a public officer, he comes very near it: he is required to take the oaths to support the constitutions, and an oath of office, which has remained without substantial change since the time of Lord Holt: by admission he becomes an officer of the court, and holds his office during good behavior, subject to removal: his office concerns the public, for it is for the administration of justice: whenever the legislature has intended to make a change in the legal rights or capacities of women, it has used words clearly manifesting its intent and the extent of the change intended: in making innovations upon the long established system of law on this subject, the legislature has proceeded with great caution, one step at a time: the whole course of legislation precludes the inference that any change in the legal rights or capacities of women is to be implied, which has not been clearly expressed: there has been no legislative or judicial action having any tendency to prove such a change in the law and usage prevailing in 1776 as to admit women to the exercise of any office that concerns the administration of justice. This ground of decision was adopted in <em>Leonard\u2019s Case, 12 </em>Oreg. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The same conclusion was reached in <em>Bradwell\u2019s </em>Case, <em>55 </em>Ill. 535, 537-541, where it was held that authority to license attorneys was derived from a statute. \u201cAlthough an attorney-at-law,\u201d say the court, \u201cis an agent . . . when he has been retained to act for another, yet he is also much more than an agent. He is an officer of the court, holding his commission, in this state, from two\u2019 members of this court, and subject to be disbarred by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>court for what our statute calls \u2018 mal-conduct in his office.\u2019 He is appointed to assist,in the administration of justice, is required to take an oath of office, and is privileged from arrest while attending courts. ... At the time this statute was enacted, we had, by express provision, adopted the common law of England. . . . Female attorneys-at-law were unknown in England. . . . When the legislature gave to this court the power of granting licenses to practise law, it was with not the slightest expectation that this privilege would be extended equally to men and women. This step, if taken by us, would mean that in the opinion of this tribunal every civil office in this state may be filled by women. . . . The great body of our law rests on ancient usage. . . . The mere fact that women have never been licensed as attorneys-at-law, is, in a tribunal where immemorial usage is as much respected as it is and ought to be in courts of justice, a sufficient reason for declining to exercise our discretion in their favor, until the propriety of their participating in the offices of state and the administration of public affairs shall have been recognized by the law-making department of the government. ... If we could disregard in this matter the authority of those unwritten usages which make the great body of our law, we might do so in any other, and the dearest rights of person and property would become a matter of mere judicial discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In <em>Goodell\u2019s </em>Case, 39 Wis. 232, it was held that the statute left the admission of attorneys to the discretion of the court, and a motion to admit Miss Goodell was denied on the ground that it is public policy not to tempt women from the proper duties of their sex by opening to them duties peculiar to ours: the practice of the law, like military service, is not one of the many employments that are fit for women: discussions are habitually necessary in courts of justice which are unfit for female ears: the habitual presence of women at these would tend to relax the public sense of decency and propriety. \u201c If these things are to come,\u201d say the court, \u201c we will take no voluntary part in bringing them about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">In <em>Lockwood\u2019s Case, </em>9 Ct. Cl. 346, it was held that admission to the bar is admission to an office which a woman is without legal capacity to hold; and the opinion was expressed that women are as well fitted for military service as for the practice of law. \u201cIn cases of misconduct by an attorney,\u201d it was said <em>( p. </em>353), he may be attached by the court, and imprisoned; but if the attorney were a married woman, she might come in and say that the misconduct occurred in her husband\u2019s presence, and that at common law it was by his compulsion. She might misapply the funds of a client, or be guilty of gross neglect or fraud, and the husband be sued at common law for the wrong.\u201d In <em>Hall\u2019s Case, </em>50 Conn. 131, the construction given to a statute, by a majority of the court, allowed women to be admitted to the bar. Upon reenactments of an old statute, general compilations and revisions, and Circumstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>tial evidence, contextual and extraneous, it seems to have been held that the legislature had changed the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The common-law disabilities of a married woman, whose legal existence, for some purposes and to some extent, was merged in that of her husband, may have made it inexpedient that she should be a member of the legal profession. Her application for admission might formerly have been denied on the ground that she \u201cwould be bound neither by her express contracts nor by those implied contracts which it is the policy of the law to create between attorney and client.\u201d <em>Bradwell's </em>Case, 55 Ill. 535, 536 ; <em>Alton </em>v. Gilmanton, 2 N. H. 520; <em>Leighton </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>27 N. H. 460, 468-472 ; <em>Towle </em>v. Hatch, 43 N. H. 270 ; <em>Varnum </em>v. Martin, 15 Pick. 440 ; <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>3 Cush. 345, 350, 351. A form of a declaration in assumpsit against an attorney is, \u201c For that whereas ... in consideration that the plaintiff . . . had then retained and employed the defendant, as then being an attorney, to prosecute and conduct a certain action, . . . for reasonable fees and reward, to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, he, the defendant, then promised the plaintiff to use due and proper care and skill; . . . nevertheless, the defendant, not regarding his *said promise, did not, nor would, use due and proper care and skill.\u201d 1 Saund. PI. &amp; Ev. 268. A married woman who could defeat such a suit by pleading and proving her coverture at the time of making the contract, might not be a competent attorney. In this state, legal disabilities have been so far removed that marriage does not disqualify a woman for admission to the bar. G. L., <em>e. </em>183, s. 12; Laws 1879, <em>c. </em>57, s. 27; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>58 N. H. 481, 483, 484; <em>Laton </em>v. <em>Balcom, </em>64 N. H. 92, 95; <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Adams, ante, pp. </em>142, 143. \u201c An act of parliament cannot alter by reason of time; but the common law may, since <em>cessante ratione cessat lex.\u201d </em>Pott. Dwarris 122; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Lake Co., </em>54 N. H. 242, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u201cThe constitution . . . vests in the courts all the judicial power of the state. The constitutional establishment of such courts appears to carry with it the power to establish a bar to practice in them. And admission to the bar appears to be a judicial power. It may, therefore, become a very grave question for adjudication here, whether the constitution does not entrust the rule of admission to the bar, as well as of expulsion from it, exclusively to the discretion of the courts.\u201d <em>Goodell's Case, </em>39 Wis. 232, 239; <em>Splane\u2019s Case, </em>123 Pa. St. 527, 540. The constitutional question need not now be considered. If our statute of attorneys is an exercise of legislative power, it makes no change in the common law applicable to this case. It removes none of the legal disabilities of women, and destroys none of their rights. 54 N. H. 619, 626, 635, 636. If its provisions are not operative as a statute, they have nevertheless been acquiesced in and acted upon, and may well be regarded as having the force of rules of court, for the adoption of which a written order is not necessary. <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>1 Pet. 604, 613 ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Duncan </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>7 Pet. 435, 451. Independently of any statute, every court of record may make such rules for the transaction of its business as do not contravene the laws of the land. Bac. Abr. (Am. ed., 1868) Courts of U. S. (C). The power is incidental, that is, implied as a means of accomplishing the purpose for which the court is established. 64 N. H. 177. The provision that \u201c The court may from time to time establish rules and orders of practice, consistent with the laws, for conducting and regulating its business, and prescribe forms of proceedings in all cases not provided for\u201d (G. L., c. 208, <em>s. </em>6), is an enactment of common law. In the absence of written law establishing a different state of things, authority to make reasonable rules for the admission and removal of members of the bar \u201c is necessarily inherent in every court, in order to enable it to discharge its duties, as much so as the power to preserve order.\u201d <em>Bryant's Case, </em>24 N. H. 149, 158; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>French, </em>149 Mass. 391, 398, 399; <em>State </em>v. Winton, 11 Oreg. 456, 460; <em>Ex parte Burr, </em>9 Wheat. 529, 531; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>2 How. 244, 257; 3 B. &amp; Ad. 770, 777, 782. \u201cThe relations between the court and the attorneys and counsellors who practise in it, and their respective rights and duties, are regulated by the common law. And it has been well settled, by the rules and practice of common-law courts, that it rests exclusively with the court to determine who is qualified to become one of its officers, as an attorney and counsellor, and for what cause he ought to be removed.\u201d <em>Secombe\u2019s Case, </em>19 How. 9, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u201c The profession of an attorney and counsellor is not like an office created by an act of congress, which depends for its continuance, its powers, and its emoluments upon the will of its creator, and the possession of which may be burdened with any conditions not prohibited by the constitution. Attorneys and counsellors are not officers of the United States; they are not elected or appointed in the manner prescribed by the constitution for the election and appointment of such officers. They are officers of the court, admitted as such by its order, upon evidence of their possessing sufficient legal learning and fair private character. . . The order of admission is the judgment of the court that the parties possess the requisite qualifications as attorneys and counsellors, and are entitled to appear as such and conduct causes therein. From its entry the parties become officers of the court, and are responsible to it for professional misconduct. They hold their office during good behavior, and can only be deprived of it for misconduct ascertained and declared by the judgment of the court after opportunity to be heard has been afforded. Their admission or their exclusion ... is the exercise of judicial power. . . . The legislature may undoubtedly prescribe qualifications for the office ... as it may . . . proscribe qualifications for the pursuit of any of the ordinary avocations of life.\u201d <em>Ex parte Garland, </em>4 Wall. 333, 378, 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u201cThe court, in some instances, will order an attorney to pay costs to his own client for neglect, or to the opposite party for vexatious or improper conduct. And if a rule be made upon an attorney for the delivery of writings, or payment of costs, etc., and it' be not obeyed; the court will enforce it by attachment.\u201d 1 Tidd Pr. 58. \u201cAt common law an attorney was always liable to be dealt with in a summary way for any ill practice attended with fraud or corruption, and committed against the obvious rules of justice and honesty. No complaint, indictment, or information was ever necessary as the foundation of such proceedings. Usually they are commenced by rule to show cause, or by an attachment or summons to answer; but these are issued on motion or bare suggestion to the court, or even on the knowledge which the court may acquire of the doings of an attorney by their own observation. No formal or technical description of the act complained of is deemed requisite to the validity of such a proceeding. Sometimes they are founded on affidavit of the facts, to which the attorney is summoned to answer; in other cases, by an order to show cause why he should not be stricken from the roll; and when the court judicially know of the misconduct of an attorney, they will of their own motion order an inquiry to be made by a master without issuing any process whatever. . . . Nor can a judgment of removal be properly . . . considered as a punishment for a crime or offence.\u201d It is not a bar to a criminal prosecution. The power of removal is necessary, \u201c not as a mode of inflicting a punishment for an offence, but in order to enable the courts to prevent the scandal and reproach which would be occasioned to the administration of the law by the continuance in office of those who had violated their oaths or abused their trust, and to take away from such persons the power and opportunity of injuring others by further acts of misconduct and malpractice.\u201d <em>Randall's </em>Petition, 11 Allen 473, 479, 480; <em>Randall </em>v. Brigham, 7 Wall. 523, 539, 540; <em>Kimball's Case, </em>64 Me. 140, 147; <em>Austin's </em>Case, 5 Rawle 191, 204; <em>State </em>v. <em>Winton, </em>11 Oreg. 456, 466; <em>Cohen </em>v. Wright, 22 Cal. 293, 320. The question tried in such a case is, \u201c whether, after the conduct of this man, it is proper that he should continue a member of a profession which should stand free from all suspicion,\u201d whether \u201c he is an unfit person to practise as an attorney.\u201d <em>Brounsall's </em>Case, Cowp. 829, 830. The issue of fitness for the office of an attorney is as general and comprehensive as the question raised by a petition to the legislature for the removal of a military or judicial officer by address. An adjournment of the hearing after adverse evidence is received, gives an opportunity for defence as ample as would be furnished by a formal specification of charges filed before the hearing begins. As attorneys are peculiarly exposed to groundless accusations, and may suffer irreparable injury from a public trial of the question of removal on an order to show cause, even if it ends in their complete vindication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>(4 Camp. Ch. Jus. 136, 137), such an order is not made unless manifestly required by the public interest. <em>Meux </em>v. Lloyd, 2 C. B. N. S. 409, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u201c Barristers or counsellors-at-law, in England, were never appointed by the courts at Westminster, but were called to the bar by the inns of court.\u201d <em>Cooper's </em>Case, 22 N. Y. 67, 90. \u201cThe original institution of the inns of court nowhere precisely appears, but it is certain that they are not corporations, and have no constitution by charter from the crown. They are voluntary societies, which for ages have submitted to government analogous to that of other seminaries of learning. But all the power they have concerning the admission to the bar is delegated to them from the judges, and in every instance their conduct is subject to their control as visitors.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Benchers of Gray's </em>Inn, 1 Doug. 353, 354. That case was an .application for a mandamus to compel the defendants to- call the petitioner, Hart, to the degree of a barrister-at-law. A mandamus was refused on the ground that the ancient and usual way of redress was by appeal to the twelve judges as visitors. The power of admission, inherent in courts, having been immemorially exercised by the inns, with the assent of the judges and subject to their revision, its qualified delegation could be inferred from the circumstances. No one is called to the bar who is not a member of an inn. On the question of admission to an inn there is no appeal from the benchers. As visitors, the judges have jurisdiction only over actually admitted members of an inn. \u201cThis court has no power to compel the benchers of this society to permit any individual to become a member of the society, or to assign any reasons why they do not admit him.\u201d Abbott, C. J., in <em>King </em>v. <em>Benchers of Lincoln's </em>Inn, 4 B. &amp; C. 855, 858. \u201cEvery individual . . . has not an inchoate right to be admitted a member of any of these societies. They make their own rules as to the admission of members; and even if they act capriciously upon the subject, this court can give no remedy in such a case, because in fact there has been no violation of any right. This case is analogous to that of a college.\u201d Bayley, J., in the same case.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">When \u201c the fixing of the court of common pleas, the grand tribunal for disputes of property, to be held in one certain spot,\u201d brought the legal profession together, \u201cthey naturally fell into a kind of collegiate order, and, being excluded from Oxford and Cambridge, found it necessary to establish a new university of their own. This they did by purchasing at various times certain houses (now called the inns of court and of chancery). . . . Here exercises were performed, lectures read, and degrees were at length conferred in the common law, as at other universities in the canon and civil. The degrees were those of barristers (first styled apprentices . . .) who answered to our bachelors: as the state and degree of a serjeant . . . did to that of doctor.\u201d 1 Bl. Com. 22, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201c Of advocates, or (as we generally call them) counsel, there are two species or degrees; barristers and serjeants. The former are admitted after a considerable period of study, or at least standing, in the inns of court. . . . From both these degrees some are usually selected to be his majesty\u2019s counsel learned in the law. . . . These king\u2019s counsel . . . must not be employed in any cause against the crown without special license. . . . A custom has of late year\u2019s prevailed of granting letters-patent of precedence to such barristers as the crown thinks proper to honor with that mark of distinction: whereby they are entitled to such rank and pre-audience as are assigned in their respective patents; sometimes next after the king\u2019s attorney-general, but usually next after his majesty\u2019s counsel then being. These . . . rank promiscuously with the king\u2019s counsel, and together with them sit within the bar of the respective courts; but receive no-salaries, and are not sworn, and therefore are at -liberty to be retained in causes against the crown. And all other serjeants and barristers indiscriminately (except in the court of common pleas, where only serjeants are admitted) may take upon them the protection and defence of any suitors, whether plaintiff or defendant; who are therefore called their clients, like the dependants upon the ancient Roman orators. Those indeed practised gratis, for honor merely, or at most for the sake of gaining influence: and so likewise it is established with us that a counsel can maintain no-action for his fees; which are given, not as <em>locatio vel eonductio, </em>but as <em>quiddam honorarium; </em>not as a salary or hire, but as a mere gratuity. . . . Counsel guilty of deceit or collusion are punishable by the statute Westm. 1, 3 Edw. I, c. 28, with imprisonment for a year and a day, and perpetual silence in the courts.\u201d 3 Bl. Com. 26-29. This statute did not impair the common-law power of disbarment delegated by the courts to the inns t&amp; which the members of the bar respectively belong, and exercised by them subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the visitors from whom the power was derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u201cWe are told that in the reign of Henry VI there were ten lesser inns, which were called <em>inns of </em>chancery, each containing at least one hundred students, and some a great many more. These were designed as places of elementary studies : here they learned the nature of original and judicial writs, which were then considered as the first principles of the law: and for this reason these inns were denominated from the chancery. When young men had made some progress here, and were more advanced in years, then they were admitted into the <em>inns of court. </em>Of these there were four in number. . . . The degree of serjeant-at-law was considered in a very respectable light: none could be a judge in the king\u2019s bench or common pleas but one who had been first a serjeant; nor was a person to be called to the degree of serjeant till he had been in the general study of the law ... at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>for sixteen years, which probably meant from his first entrance at an inn of chancery.\u201d 4 Itoeve Eng. Law 120, 121, ed. of 1787.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\"Barristers, in England, are the highest class of lawyers who have exclusive audience in all the superior courts. Every bai\u2019rister must be a member of one of the four ancient societies called inns of court, viz., Lincoln\u2019s Inn, the Inner and Middle Temples, and Gray\u2019s Inn. . . . Associations of lawyers acquired houses of their own in which students were educated in the common law. . . . These schools of law are now represented by the inns of court, which still enjoy the exclusive privilege of calling to the bar, and through their superior order of <em>benchers </em>control the discipline of the profession. . . . Subject to an appeal to the common-law judges as visitors, they may reject the petition of a student to be called to the bar, or expel from their society and from the profession any barrister or bencher of the inn. The peculiar business of barristers is the advocacy of causes in open court, but ... a great deal of other business falls into their hands. They are the chief conveyancers, and the pleadings . . . are in all but the simplest cases drafted by them. There is indeed a separate class of <em>conveyancers </em>and <em>special </em>pleaders, being persons who have kept the necessary number of terms qualifying for a call, but who, instead of being called, take out licenses to practise <em>under the bar. </em>There are still a few persons who act under such special licenses, but in general conveyancing and special pleading form part of the ordinary work of a junior barrister. The highest rank among barristers is that of king\u2019s or queen\u2019s counsel. They lead the case in court, and give opinions on cases submitted to them, but they do not accept conveyancing or pleading, nor do they admit pupils to their chambers. Precedence among queen\u2019s counsel, as well as among outer barristers, is determined by seniority. The order of sergeants-at-law still exists, but no new appointments have recently been made, and it will probably be allowed to become extinct, the title of queen\u2019s counsel being generally preferred. Sergeants rank after queen\u2019s counsel. . . . Barristers cannot maintain an action for their fees, which are regarded as gratuities, nor can they, by the usage of the profession, undertake a case without the intervention of an attorney.\u201d 3 Enc. Brit. 394, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\"There certainly has been an understanding in the profession that a barrister ought not to accept a brief in a civil suit, except from an attorney. . . . But . . . there is no rule of law by which it can be enforced. . . . This being a matter of procedure, the judges . . . might . . . have laid down a general rule . . . : but no such rule is to be found.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. Hale, 15 A. &amp; E. N. S. 171, 182, 183, 225. In early times, personal communication between counsel and client \"was necessary; for there were no attorneys. ... It was not until after the statutes of Merton (20 H.

In this respect, therefore, the counsel stands in a different position from the attorney.\u201d <em>Swinfen </em>v. <em>Swinfen, </em>1 C. B. N. S. 364, 403. \u201cAn advocate at the English bar, accepting a brief in the usual way, undertakes a duty, but does not enter into any contract or promise, express or implied. Cases may indeed occur where on an express promise (if he made one) he would be liable in assumpsit; but we think a barrister is to be considered, not as making a contract with his client, but as taking upon himself an office or duty, in the proper discharge of which not merely the client, but the court in which the duty is to be performed, and the public at large, have an interest. ... A counsel has complete authority over the suit, the mode of conducting it, and all that is incident to it. . . . No action will lie against counsel for any act honestly done in the conduct or management of the cause.\u201d <em>Swinfen </em>v. <em>Chelmsford, </em>5 H. &amp; N. 890, 920, 922, 923. \u201cA promise by a client to pay money to a counsel for his advocacy, whether made before, or during, or after the litigation, has no binding effect; . . . the relation of counsel and client renders the parties mutually incapable of making any contract of hiring and service concerning advocacy in litigation. ... If the authorities were doubtful, and it was necessary to resort to principle, the same proposition appears to us to be founded on good reason. . . . The inca pacity of the advocate in litigation to make a contract of hiring affects the integrity and dignity of advocates, and so is in close relation with the highest of human interests, viz., the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Broun, </em>13 C.

In 1834, the king, by warrant, ordered that the right of practising, pleading, and audience in the common pleas should cease to be exercised exclusively by the serjeants, and that all barristers should have equal right in that court with the serjeants. 10 Bing. 571. The order was obeyed till 1839, when, on motion made by Wilde, in behalf of four other serjeants and himself, the exclusive privilege of the serjeants was restored, on the ground that it was a legal right of which they could not be deprived without an act of parliament. Wilde contended that \u201c The rank and office of serjeant were as ancient, and rested on the same foundation, as those held by their lordships; there was no evidence of the existence of the court without them; they were as ancient as the law itself.\u201d Newton, an apprentice {a barrister not raised to the degree of serjeant), was heard on the other side. \u201c The learned serjeant,\u201d he said, \u201c had contended that the crown had no power to issue a warrant which interfered with the privileges of the serjeants. By what authority, then, was it that these learned gentlemen claimed to be entitled to those privileges? By virtue of the royal\u201d writ \u201cby which they were raised to the degree of the coif. . . . They derived their appointment from the supreme executive power; and the same authority had an equal right to empower other members of the bar to enjoy equal privileges.

They are called to the state and degree of serjeant <em>by writ: </em>which of itself is a strong argument of the antiquity of their office. . . . By their oath of office, which has existed from the earliest time\u2014 an oath by which no other barrister is bound to give attendance in any particular court \u2014 they bind themselves \u2018 to give due attendance for the service of the king\u2019s people in their causes.\u2019 As early as any authentic records exist, the serjeants are found to be practising in the court of common pleas; and there is no evidence of any other barrister being allowed to practise ... in that court. . . . From time immemorial, the serjeants have enjoyed the exclusive privilege of practising, pleading, and audience in the court of common pleas. Immemorial enjoyment is the most solid of all titles. . . . The warrant of the crown can no more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>deprive the serjeant, who holds an- immemorial office, of the benefits and privileges which belong to it, than it could alter the administration of the law within the court itself.

But every man is liable to error. ... A counsel may mistake, as well as an attorney. Yet no one will say that a counsel who has been mistaken shall be charged with the debt. The counsel, indeed, is honorary in his advice, and does not <em>demand </em>a fee: the attorney may <em>demand </em>a compensation, but neither of them ought to be charged with the debt for a mistake.\u201d <em>Pitt </em>v. Yalden, 4 Burr. 2,060, 2,061. \u201cAn attorney is supposed to be always present in court: and on that account has many privileges belonging to him in common with the other officers of the court. Where an attorney is plaintiff, he is entitled to sue in his own court, by attachment of privilege; and may lay the venue in Middlesex. Where he is defendant, he must be sued in his own court by bill, even as acceptor of a bill of exchange; and cannot be arrested or holden to special bail. . '. . An attorney is also, by reason of the supposed necessity of his attendance in court, exempt from all offices that require personal service: . . . and formerly he was not liable to serve in the militia. . . . These privileges are allowed, not so much for the benefit of attornies, as of their clients; and are therefore confined to attornies who practise, or at least have practised within a. year.\u201d 1 Tidd Pr. 264-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u201cAn attorney-at-law ... is one who is put in the place, stead, or <em>turn </em>of another, to manage his matters of law.

But ... it is now permitted in general, by divers ancient statutes, whereof the first is statute Westm. 3, <em>c. </em>10, that attorneys may be made to prosecute or defend any action. . . . These attorneys are now formed into a regular corps; they are admitted to the execution of their office by the superior courts of Westminster Hall, and are in all points officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of the respective courts of which they are admitted. . . . No man can practise as an attorney in any of those courts, but such as is admitted and sworn an attorney of that particular court: an attorney of the court of king\u2019s bench cannot practise in the conrt of common pleas ; nor <em>vice versa. </em>To practise in the court of chancery, it is also necessary to be admitted a solicitor therein.\u201d 8 Bl.

By the common law the actual presence of the parties to a suit was considered indispensable, but the privilege of appearing by attorney was conceded in certain cases by special dispensation, until the statute of Merton and subsequent enactments-made it competent for both parties in all judicial proceedings to appeal1 by attorney. Solicitors appear to have been at first distinguished from attorneys, as not having the attorney\u2019s power to bind their principles, but latterly the distinction has been between attorneys as the agents formally appointed in actions at law, and solicitors who take care of proceedings in parliament, chancery, privy council, etc. In practice, however, and in ordinary language, the terms are synonymous. . . . The qualifications necessary for admission on the rolls of attorneys and solicitors \u201d are fixed by statute. \u201cThey may act as advocates in certain of the inferior-courts. Conveyancing, formerly considered the exclusive business of the bar, is now often performed by attorneys. Barristers are understood to require the intervention of an attorney in all cases that come before them professionally, although in criminal cases the prisoner not unfrequently engages a counsel directly by giving him a fee in open court.\u201d 3 Enc. Brit. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u201c The court by common law had no power to admit an attorney . . . to practice. . . . It was the policy of the common law, in order that suits might not multiply and increase, that both plaintiff and defendant should appear in person. . . . While the justices could not permit a person to appear by attorney, the king, by the plenitude of his prerogative, might appoint an attorney, and give any person a right to appear in this manner: letters-patent would issue out of chancery, or under the privy seal, commanding the justices to admit such and such a person as attorney for another, in regard to the particular suit in question. . . . Such an attorney was simply an attorney in fact. . . . The power of clients to appoint attorneys was conferred in England by statute Westrn. 2 (3 Ed. I, <em>c. </em>42), in certain cases. The object of this legislation was to confer the right to appear by attorney without applying to the king. ... In those cases to which the statute and succeeding acts did not extend, the courts were very rigid in applying the former rule. . . . The char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>acter and qualifications of an attorney were not at all involved by these statutes. He was simply an attorney in. fact. Any one could, by legal principles, be an attorney. The king might send a message to the courts to receive such person as the party may name. . . . The courts say in one case (Year Book, 21 Henry YI, 30 . . .) that by the rules of law an outlaw or an attainted clerk may be an attorney in a suit, though such persons could not themselves bring actions. The reason why they could appear as attorneys was because they sued <em>in auter droit. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cLord Coke tells us that the introduction of attorneys was a great and lamentable innovation upon the common law. 2 Inst. 250. The king, for a time, . . . attempted to regulate the .matter. In the 20th of Edward I, he directed the justices to provide and appoint, according to their discretion, attorneys in every county. Seven score he thought enough for all England; but the justices, in their discretion, might increase the number. .\u2022 . . The idea that attorneys held offices undoubtedly grew out of the limitation of their number in the ordinance of King Edward I. These measures, however-, did not reach the evil. The legislature passed, in the reign of Henry IY, the model act upon this subject, and from which all subsequent legislation has derived an impress. (2 Inst. 215.) This act, after reciting in the preamble the mischiefs growing out of the former system, proceeds as follows: that all attorneys shall be examined by the justices, and that by their discretion their names shall be put upon the roll, and that they be good, virtuous, and of good fame, and be received and sworn well to serve in their offices. And the other attorneys shall be put out by the discretion of the justices, and if any of the attorneys do die, the justices shall make another in his place (4 Henry IY, <em>c. </em>18). . . . Before this statute, no regulations had been made either to define the qualifications for an attorney, or to point out who should be at liberty to undertake the office. . . . This statute is very important, both for what it enacts and what it dis\u00abcloses. It shows that an attorney at that time held an office; that no system of testing attainments or character existed. Attorneys now for the, first time go on the roll; they become .attorneys of record, and cease to be mere attorneys in fact. . . . \u25a0Coke (in 4 Inst. 76) laments the increase of attorneys beyond the number allowed by law. . . .

The foundation of the English common law, with its infinite niceties, was nothing more than usage; and usage here holds as high a place, in our esteem, as usage there. Indeed, we regard the ignorance of the first colonists of the technicalities of the common law as one of the most fortunate things in the history of the law; since, while the substance of the common law was preserved, we happily lost a great mass of antiquated and useless rubbish, and gained in its stead a couise of practice of admirable simplicity, and one which seems to us far better than the most improved codes of practice which have been recently introduced elsewhere.\u201d <em>B. C. &amp; M. Railroad </em>v. <em>State, </em>32 N. H. 215, 230, 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The extracts from Fitzh. N. B., relating to the exercise of royal prerogative before the statutes allowed airpearance by attorney, present a sample of what has been lost. No prerogative or statute was ever necessary in this state to enable litigants to appear by their agents. The law regulating the admission of attorneys is a part of the law of procedure <em>(ante, p. </em>211) ; and our common law allows such procedure as justice and convenience require. <em>Boody </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>64 N. H. 162, 171-173, 178, 179. Justice requires that a party should be permitted to conduct his cause in person (sub ject to reasonable requirements of propriety), or by any agent of good character, and that the test of the agent\u2019s character should not be so rigorously applied as to imperil the constitutional right to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>trial. But no one should commonly practise as an attorney without the mental and moral qualifications adequate for a business in which the administration of justice is deeply concerned, and in which his unfitness would naturally bring serious disaster upon his employers and himself. These rules of our common law of procedure have been affirmed by the legislature. G. L., <em>c. </em>218, <em>ss. </em>1, 2. As a mass of details, the English law on the subject, being inapplicable to our situation and circumstances, is not in force in this state; and if no relevant and decisive general principle of that law has been adopted here, this case must be determined by the common law that grows out of American conditions. <em>Concord Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Robertson, ante, pp. </em>1, 6, 7; <em>State </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>ante, <em>pp. </em>39, 72, 73.</p>\n<p id=\"ASG\">. In <em>Olive </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>2 Str. 1114, \u201c two points were made: 1. Whether a woman was capable of being chosen sexton [of a parish]. And, 2. Whether women could vote in the election. As to the first, the court seemed to have no difficulty, . . . nor did I think proper to argue it, there having been many cases where offices of greater consequence have been held by women, and there being many women sextons now in London. . . . As to the second point; 4 Inst. 5 was cited to show women could not vote for members of parliament or coi\u2019oners. . . . But the court notwithstanding held that this being an office that did not concern the public, or the care and inspection of the morals of the parishioners, there was no reason to exclude women who paid rates from the privilege of voting: they observed, here was no usage of excluding them stated, which perhaps might have altered the case.\u201d \u201c I am clearly of opinion,\u201d said <em>Lee, </em>C. J., delivering the judgment of the court, \u201cthat a woman may be sexton of a parish. Women have held much higher offices, and indeed almost all the offices of the kingdom: as Queen, Marshal, Great Chamberlain, Great Constable, Champion of England, Commissioner of Sewers, Keeper of a Prison, and Returning Officer for members of parliament. 2. As to the second point, it would be strange if a woman may herself fill the office, and yet should be disqualified to vote for it. The election of members of parliament and of coroners stands on special grounds. No woman has ever sat in parliament or voted for members of parliament, and we must presume that when the franchise was first created it was confined to the male sex. There was no reason for such a restriction respecting the office of sexton, whose duties do not concern the morals of the living, but the interment of the dead.\u201d 3 Camp. Ch. Jus. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">In 1787, a woman and two men, being the only householders of \u201cthe township of the monastery of Ronton Abbey,\u201d \u201can extra-parochial place,\u201d were appointed overseers of the poor. <em>King </em>v. <em>Stubbs, </em>2 D. &amp; E. 393, 406. \u201cWe think,\u201d says <em>Ashurst, </em>J., delivering the opinion of the court, \u201cthat the circumstance of one of the persons appointed being a woman does not vitiate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>appointment. The only qualification required by 43 Eliz. is that they shall be <em>substantial householders; </em>it has no reference to sex. The only question then is, whether there is anything in the nature of the office that should make women incompetent; and we think there is not. There are many instances where, in offices of a higher nature, they are held not to be disqualified; as in the case of the office of high chamberlain, high constable, and marshal; and that of a common constable, which is both an office of trust, and likewise, in a degree, judicial. So in the case of the office of sexton. As to the case in Vin., tit. Poor, 415, that is no. conclusive authority. It is to be collected from the case that there were other persons in the parish proper to serve; and if so, the court held that the justices had not acted improperly in refusing to approve of a woman. Where there are a sufficient number of men qualified to serve the office, they are certainly more proper: but that is not the case here; and therefore, if there is no absolute incapacity, it is proper in this instance from the necessity of the case. And there is no danger of making it a general practice; for as the justices are invested with a discretionary power of approbation, it is not likely that they will approve of such an appointment when there are other proper objects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In <em>Hearle </em>v. <em>Greenbank, </em>1 Ves. 298 (S. C., 3 Atk. 695), a testator had devised realty to trustees to the use of his daughter, a married minor, during her life, with power, \u201c notwithstanding her coverture,\u201d to dispose of it as she should think fit; and while a minor, she made a will, devising it in pursuance of the power. Hardwicke, Ld. Ch., holding that the power was not executed, said, \u2014 \u201c There are some kind of powers an infant may execute: as where he is a mere instrument or conduit pipe, where no prudence or discretion is required, or where his right is not affected. 1 Inst. 52 a. \u2018 New persons are disabled to be private attoruies to deliver seizin : for monks, infants, feme coverts, &amp;c., may be attoruies.\u2019 As this opinion of Lord <em>Coke </em>is delivered, it seems at first as if he meant only to deliver seizin; which is merely a ministerial act: although the latter words are general. Yet he himself (1 Inst. 128 a) says that an infant cannot be an attorney: it is therefore pretty much undetermined how far infants can be attoruies, unless to deliver seizin or such a ministerial act. But that is different from these kind of powers. . . . It is said that a feme covert may execute a power; (which was so determined in <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Beaumont </em>upon the execution of a power created before she was covert: and so in a case before Lord King) so a power to <em>a feme covert </em>to make leases is good. ... I take it in law that the disability of an infant with respect to the real estate is more favored, and a stronger disability, than that of <em>feme coverts. </em>In Hob. 95, there are some cases put: and there is a marginal note very material. And here I will take notice, that the notes in Hob. are allowed to be his own. The note is this, \u2018 coverture was not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>common law so far protected as infancy, and some other disabilities, as <em>non sane </em>memory, &amp;c.\u2019 the ground of the disability being not from want of judgment, but from being under the power of her husband; she having as much judgment as if discovert. . . . The disability of an infant arises from want of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u201cA grant of an office requiring skill, to an infant, to be exercised <em>in </em>praesenti, is void. . . . Offices merely ministerial, which do not require particular skill and knowledge, and exercisable by deputy, may be granted to any person, and even to women. Thus, a woman may have the office of the custody of a castle. And Lord Coke [4 Inst. 3,11] mentions an instance of a woman\u2019s having the office of forester in fee simple; but he observes that she could not execute the office herself, but was obliged to appoint a deputy, during the eyre, who should be sworn.\u201d The earl of Hereford held manors of the king \u201c by the service of being constable of England; and had issue two daughters. Upon a question how the daughters, before marriage, could exercise the office; it was resolved that they might make their sufficient deputy to do it for them; and after marriage the husband of the eldest might do it alone. . . . The following question was put to the judges: \u2018The late Duke of Ancaster having died seized of the office of great chamberlain of England, leaving\u2019 two sisters, \u2018 does the said office belong to the eldest alone, or to both? ... Or does it devolve upon the king to name a proper person to execute the office, during the incapacity of the heir?\u2019 The judges delivered their unanimous opinion, \u2014 \u2018 That the office belonged to both \u2022sisters ; . . . that both sisters might execute it by deputy, to be appointed by them.\u2019 \u201d 3 Cru.

S. 988, \u201cwas an action against the keeper of the Queen\u2019s prison for a false return to a <em>habeas corpus. </em>On the trial, before <em>HollocJc, </em>C. B., . . . the plaintiff, who was in custody, did not appear by either counsel or attorney, or in person; but his wife appeared, and proposed to conduct the cause on his behalf. The Lord Chief Baron, after conference with Erie, J., refused to permit this; and the plaintiff was non-suited. . . . The plaintiff in person now moved that the non-suit might be set aside. . . . Lord <em>Campbell, </em>C. J. We cannot say that the Lord Chief Baron was wrong in refusing to hear the wife of the plaintiff as an advocate. The nonsuit was regular. The plaintiff was called, and appeared neither by counsel or attorney nor in person; but his wife claimed to appear for him. The question therefore is, whether, as of right, the wife of a party may insist on appearing on his behalf in a civil cause. There is no such rule in a civil suit. The first day I sat here, Mrs. Cobbett desired to make a motion on behalf of her husband for a <em>habeas corpus ; </em>and I heard her without the smallest scruple, as my illustrious predecessor <em>Hale </em>heard the wife of John Bunyan. [2 Camp. Ch. Jus. 210-213.] On each of those occasions the liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>o\u00ed the subject was in question; and in such a case great inconvenience might arise from refusing to hear the wife, or any person, on behalf of the party who was under restraint. But a proceeding at <em>nisi prius </em>is very different: there can be no similar necessity there for the wife\u2019s appearance as counsel to conduct the cause for her husband. There would at least be opportunity for applying to a gentleman of the bar ; and we know that on such an occasion any member of the bar would come forward without an <em>honorarium, </em>and see justice done. And this would be much better than that the wife of a party should come into court to wrangle at <em>nisi prius, </em>and engage in scenes inconsistent with the character of her sex. 1 think the Lord Chief Baron and my brother <em>Erie </em>did right.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>\u201cColeridge, </em>. . . <em>Wightman, </em>and <em>Erie, </em>Js., concurred.

It seems always to have been held that an infant could not be a juror. ... So he could not be an attorney of a court, . . . nor administrator of an estate, . . . nor could he act as an executor until he arrived at the age of seventeen years. . . . An infant could not execute the office of a judge,\u201d nor \u201c hold the office of clerk of a court where it was part of the duty of the office to receive the money of the suitors. But notwithstanding these disabilities, there are many things which can be legally done by an infant. . . . Females of the age of twelve, and males of the age of fourteen years, may dispose of persona] property by will. ... It has long been settled that infants were capable of holding certain ministerial offices. . . . Upon a thorough examination of the adjudged cases, . . . we are satisfied that the principle they establish is that some offices can and some cannot be held by infants. Offices where judgment and discretion and experience are essentially necessary, . . . are not to be entrusted in the hands of infants. But they may hold offices which are merely ministerial, and which require nothing more than skill and diligence. . . . The service and return \u201d of the writ \u201c seem . . . to be as merely ministerial [Mechem, Public Officers, <em>ss. </em>657-659] as any that can be conceived.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>3 N.

A teacher of a public school, who is selected by the school board, but is not an officer (32 Vt. 122), is paid by the district.

This is the substance of the act of 1714, which was an enactment of previous custom. 53 N. H. 139, 231. From an early day in the history of the province until 1819, the town minister was chosen by the majority of voters in town meeting. His salary was paid from the town treasury. His employment as teacher in a meeting-house, built and controlled by the town for public use, was public. In a certain sense, it was official, like that of a teacher of a public school. But it was non-official in such a sense that women could legally be called to it. In the exercise of their parochial right of electing ministers, towns were as unrestricted as voluntary religious societies are now. If women had never been teachers of public schools, they could be employed as such, notwithstanding the usage, and without an alteration of the law, because that public employment has not been understood to be an office. Not being an office in the ordinary sense, it is open to women at common law, whatever the usage may have been. \u201c The relation that subsists between a minister and the town [by which he is elected] is civil; that which subsists between a minister and the church is spiritual.\u201d \u201cPublic teachers of religion and morality chosen by a\u201d town, \u201care to every purpose civil officers of the state, as much so as school-masters and magistrates.\u201d <em>Muzzy </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>Smith (N.

In such, a connection, no distinction being made between public office and other public employment, \u201c civil officers of the state \u201d means persons in the civil service of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Great numbers of persons, male and female, who are not regarded as public officers, are employed by the public, and selected and paid by public authority. In the civil service, the classification is not as distinct as among privates and commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and the location of the official line, at some points, may be a subject of controversy. In some instances, a test may be found in that universal understanding which is the sanction. and source of much common law. 107 Mass. 604; Shars. Law Lee. 196-199. While a removal of common-law disability by legislation was necessary to enable women to be members of school boards (G.

Ministers elected by towns were considered a class of teachers employed by contract. In this and other cases, the making of contracts by voters in town-meeting was an exercise of governmental power. \u201cA government office is different from a government contract.\u201d <em>U.

C. 133, the plaintiff was elected an alderman of a city while acting, under an appointment from, the treasury department of the United States, at a salary of $60 a month, as night watchman of a post-office building. The state constitution provided that \u201c No person who shall hold any office or place of trust or profit under the United States, or any department thereof, . . . shall hold or exercise any other office or place of trust or profit under the authority of this state.\u201d It was held that the plaintiff\u2019s federal employment was not an office or place of trust or profit.

An office is a public charge or employment; but, as every employment is not an office, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between employments which are and those which are not offices. . . . \u2018A public officer is one who has some duty to perform concerning the public; and he is not the less a public officer when his duty is confined) to narrow limits, because it is the duty, and the nature of that duty, which makes him a public officer, and not the extent of his authority.\u2019 7 Bac. Abr, 280; Carth. 479. . . . Where an employment or duty is a continuing one, which is defined by rules prescribed by law and not by contract, such a charge or employment is an office, and the person who performs it is an officer. . . . The powers vested in the government of the state of Mississippi are either legislative, judicial, or executive; and these respective branches of power have been committed to separate bodies of magistracy. . . . Whether an office has been created by the constitution itself, or by statute, . . . the incumbent, as a component member of one of the bodies of the magistracy, is vested with a portion of the power of the government. . . . The words \u2018 civil office under the state \u2019 . . . import an office in which is reposed some portion of the sovereign power of the state, and of necessity having some connection with the legislative, judicial, or executive departments of the government. . . . The local and limited power and duties of the levee commissioner can have no effect in determining the question whether his office is not an office under the state. A member of the board of county police, or a justice of the peace, is as much an officer under the state as the executive, the heads of department, or a member of the judiciary. The powers attached to the office of levee commissioner evidently pertain to the executive branch of the government.

The term \u2018 office \u2019 has a very general signification, and is defined to be that function by virtue whereof a person has some employment in the affairs of another; and it may be public, or private, or <em>quasi </em>public, as exercised under public authority, but yet affecting only the affairs of particular individuals. The presidency of a bank is spoken of as an office, and a trustee of a private trust is, in ordinary parlance, said to hold the office of trustee ; and the term office is applied to an executor or guardian, etc. A referee, for the trial and decision of actions, is an officer exercising judicial powers under public authority. So, receivers appointed by the courts, and commissioners for the appraisal of damages for lands taken for public use, are officers, and strictly and technically exercise the functions of an office.

In what cases counsellors are punishable in the manner above mentioned. It seems clear, that notwithstanding they are neither officers of any court, nor invested with any judicial office, but barely practise as counsellors, yet inasmuch as they have a special privilege to practise the law, and their misbehavior tends to bring a disgrace upon the law itself, they are punishable for any foul practice as other ministers of justice are.\u201d 2 Hawk. P. C., <em>c. </em>22, <em>ss. </em>1, 5, 12, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u201cAttornies and solicitors are to be considered as public officers and ministers of justice. Upon this ground it is, that in courts both of law and equity they have stated fees allowed them for their service, and are under the government of the several courts in relation to their behavior to their clients. The courts exercise a much larger authority over them, and interfere much more in contracts which they make with their clients, than they do in other cases. . . . Upon this ground it is, that if an attorney accepts a retainer from his client, and does not appear for him, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>will compel him to do it. . . . Attornies and solicitors, when they have accepted retainers from their clients, are bound to serve them for the stated fees which are allowed by the several courts.\u201d <em>Hardwicke, </em>Ld. CH., in Walmesley v. <em>Booth, </em>Barn. Ch. 478, 479. \u201c It is because attornies and solicitors are regarded as officers of the court, that our courts have been in the habit of granting relief against them by summary motion, treating the act as one of official misconduct in an officer of the court, and there to be redressed in a summary manner.\u201d <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>22 Barb. 593, 595.</p>\n<p id=\"AqI\"><em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>10 Paige 352, \u201ccame before the chancellor upon an appeal of J. Wallis, one of the solicitors and counsellors of this court, from an order of the vice chancellor, . . . made upon the application of Loubat, who was a purchaser <em>pendente lite </em>of part of the property in litigation in this cause.\u201d The suit was brought by Merritt against Lambert for the specific performance of a contract to exchange lands, and the bill was dismissed. Wallis was originally employed by Lambert. During the pendency of the suit a receiver was appointed of the rents of Lambert\u2019s land, which rents came into the hands of Wallis when the bill was dismissed. Loubat had employed Wallis to defend his title to a part of that land. After the bill was dismissed, Loubat applied for an order that Wallis pay him his share of the rents. The vice chancellor directed a reference to a master to ascertain and report the amount of the rents of Loubat\u2019s lot received by Wallis; and also to ascertain and report what reasonable counsel fees should be allowed to Wallis; and that upon the confirmation of the master\u2019s report Wallis should pay Loubat the balance, if any, remaining in his hands after deducting taxable costs and reasonable counsel fees. <em>Walworth, </em>Ch , affirming this order, said, \u2014 - \u201c The principles upon which the court proceeds, in cases of this kind, are stated ... by Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>in <em>Walmesley </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>Barn. Ch. 478. He there says attorneys and solicitors are to be considered as public officers and ministers of justice. If an attorney extorts more money from his client than the courts allow of, or makes a contract with his client to have more money, the courts will give relief. ... In England, the duties of attorney or solicitor, and counsel, are always performed by different persons; and of course the attorney or solicitor cannot be permitted to stipulate for any greater compensation for his services than such as are allowed by the practice of the courts, or by the tariff of fees fixed by law. The same rule prevails here, so far as relates to the mere services of an attorney or solicitor. But as most members of the profession practise in the capacity of counsel, as well as in that of solicitor or attorney, if the client agrees with his solicitor or attorney to perform the duty of counsel also, the latter, in his character of counsel, may stipulate for a reasonable reward for his services as such counsel. . . . But he is not permitted, either as attorney or solicitor, or as counsel, to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tract with his client . . . for a part of the demand, or subject-matter of the litigation, as a compensation for his services.\u201d This statement of the law shows the ground of Chancellor <em>Walworth\u2019s </em>previous decision in <em>Bleakley\u2019s </em>Case, 5 Paige 311, and of his opinion, afterwards expressed in <em>Ray </em>v. Birdseye, 5 Den. 619, 627, that \u201c the attorney who issued the execution was a public officer appointed under the authority of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In <em>Leigh\u2019s </em>Case, 1 Munf. 468 (decided in 1810), the question was, whether an attorney at law was a person \u201c appointed to any office or place, civil or military, under this commonwealth,\u201d within section 3 of an act to suppress duelling, which prescribed a certain oath to be taken by every such person. On his motion to be admitted to the bar of the supreme court of appeals, without taking this oath, \u201c Mr. Leigh insisted that the practice of law was not an <em>office or place under the </em>commonwealth, within the meaning of the act; that the act intended <em>public </em>offices only, and not <em>private </em>ones of any kind. I agree, said he, it is laid down, generally, that attorneys at law in England are in all points officers of the respective courts in which they are admitted. 3 Bl. Com. 26. But their character of officers of court in England is derived from certain restrictions they are under, and privileges they enjoy, in that country, unknown in this. In England, attorneys cannot be bail in civil cases; nor can attorneys at law practise as solicitors in chancery; nor attorneys in one of the courts of Westminster in any other; nor can they be called to the bar till struck off the roll of attorneys; nor, if once admitted barristers, enrolled as attorneys again, till disbarred at their inns of court. . . . On the other hand, attorneys cannot, regularly, be held to special bail; they must be sued by bill, not by original; they can only be sued in the courts they belong to ; and they are exempt from serving in offices they may be elected to against their inclination. . . . Barristers at law (king\u2019s counsel excepted) . . . take no oath of office, and are not deemed officers of court. In Virginia, no such restrictions or privileges exist: here attorneys are counsel. In England, too, it was formerly held that attorneys were compellable to act. Co. Lit. 295 a. But it has been since adjudged, that an attorney is not compellable to appear for any one, unless he take his fee, or back the warrant. 1 Salk. 87. And even if the law, as stated by Coke, has not been thus exploded; still <em>counsel </em>were never thought compellable to act (Harg. note 252, to Co. Lit. 295 a.) ; and as in Virginia, the characters of attorney and counsel are inseparably blended in the same person, so that one cannot be engaged as attorney without being engaged as counsel, in which latter capacity he is on no principle compellable to act; it results that no part of the profession is so compellable in this country. Attorneys therefore are no more officers of the court here, than counsel are in England. A class of men they are, indeed, in this as well as in that country, <em>concerned </em>in the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>justice, to whose diligence, integrity, ability, and honor much is necessarily confided; . . . sworn to do their duty, regulated by rules of policy and practice, and liable to summary punishment and privation for unworthiness or misconduct. But these, their only traits of the officer known to our law, they have in common with jurors. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201c But granting that attorneys are on the same footing here as in England ; that they are officers of court; still, Mr. Leigh contended, they are not public officers within this act. In fixing the legal construction of this our test, said he, I could not . . . forbear looking into the construction put by English legislators and lawyers on their corporation, test, and abjuration acts, which are known to have been enforced and interpreted in a spirit that the most rigorous expounder of our test cannot except against. . . . By the abjuration act, 13 Wm. III, <em>c. </em>6, it was enacted \u2018that every person who shall bear any office, civil or military . . . and all persons teaching pupils, etc., and all preachers-etc., and every person that shall act as a serjeant at law, counsellor barrister, advocate, attorney, solicitor, clerk, or notary, by practising a,s such in any court, shall, within three months after they enter upon such office, or take upon them such practice,\u2019 take the oath of abjuration. . . . The alternative words (or <em>take upon them, such, </em>practice) plainly referred to the legal characters before mentioned, and showed that the parliament did not deem their profession, nor was it generally understood to be, an office or place under government; if they had thought so, those words would not have been inserted. And by the corporation act, 13 Car. II, <em>stat. </em>2, <em>c. </em>1, it was enacted \u2018that no person shall be placed or chosen in any office of mayor, alderman, recorder, bailiff, town-clerk, common councilman, or other office of magistracy, place,, trust, or employment, concerning the government of any city, borough, or cinque port, and their members, or other port town, that shall not, within one year next before such choice, have taken\u2019 the oaths of supremacy, etc. ... If any words would include the attorneys of corporation courts, as officers or placemen, those of this statute would. Yet it had been expressly adjudged that an attorney was not an officer within that act. <em>Hurst's </em>(Case, T. Ray. 56, 94; Sid. 94, 152; 1 Keb. 349, 354, 387, 558, 675. In all the notices of this case, the only question ever raised was, whether an attorneyship was such a place as that a mandamus would lie to restore one to it; . . . but no doubt was ever entertained that the attorney was not within the corporation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">\u201c If the profession of the law be an office or place under the commonwealth at all, it is a <em>lucrative </em>one. Now the constitution of Virginia expressly provides that all persons \u2018holding lucrative offices shall be incapable of being elected members of either house of assembly or the privy council.\u2019 Art. 14. If, then, the construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tion I am controverting be right, lawyers are excluded from the assembly and the council. Yet the framers of the constitution . . . and their successors ever since, never (as we know) had any such idea. The whole practice of the constitution, from its origin to this day, the contemporaneous, the present, the constant exposition of it, refutes this inference . . . that attorneys are officers under government. . . . By the constitution of the United States, <em>art. </em>1, s. 6, <em>cl. 2, </em>\u2018No person holding any office under the United States shall be a member of either house during his continuance in office.\u2019 Is it, or has it ever been, thought that hereby the bar of the federal courts are excluded from congress? . . . By the act of 1788, . . . \u2018 all persons who shall hold any legislative, executive, or judicial office, or other lucrative office whatsoever, under the authority of the United States, shall be . . . incapable of holding . . . any legislative, executive, or judicial office, or other lucrative office whatsoever, under the government of this commonwealth.\u2019 And by the act of 1799, . . . \u2018No person holding or occupying any office or place, or any commission or appointment whatsoever, civil or military, under the authority of the United States, whether any pay or emolument be attached to such office, place, commission, or appointment, or otherwise, . . . shall be capable of being elected to or holding any office, legislative, executive, or judicial, or any other office, place, or appointment of trust or profit, under the government of this commonwealth.\u2019 If lawyers in the state courts are officers or placemen under the commonwealth, lawyers in the federal courts are so under the United States, and are . . . excluded, not only from all political and military state offices, but from the state bar also. . . . It never occurred as a possible opinion, that lawyers of the state or federal bar are officers under the state or federal government. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">\u201c Mr. Leigh knew of only two objections to his argument, which had been deduced from our own laws and usages. One was, that under a <em>general </em>provision that all <em>officers of government </em>shall take the oath of allegiance, the members of the bar, state and federal, have been always held bound to take that oath; that is, they have been held to be <em>officers under government. </em>But this objection . . . was founded on a plain mistake: ... it was not from any such reasoning or inference, but from positive and express provision, that the profession had been required to take the oath of allegiance to the state or to the Union. . . . Another objection was, that the act of 1792, <em>c. </em>71, <em>s. </em>2, directs that counsel and attorneys \u2018 shall take an <em>oath of </em>office,\u2019 namely, \u2018 I do solemnly swear that I will honestly demean myself in the practice of the law, as counsel or attorney, and will in all respects execute my <em>office </em>according to the best of my knowledge and abilities.\u2019 This objection . . . begged the whole question . . . The lawyer swears he will execute his office: What office ? The practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the law. And this brought it back to the first point; the <em>nature </em>of that office. <em>Office </em>there meant no more than <em>duty. . . . </em>In a large sense, an attorney at law is an officer; so is an attorney in fact, an administrator, a physician, and who not ? In the largest sense, every duty is an office. . . . The question here is, not whether the practice of the law be an <em>office, </em>but whether it be (as the chief justice says, 5 Mod. 432) a <em>public </em>office or not. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u201cJudge <em>Tucker. </em>On a former day of this term, Mr. Leigh, a gentleman who has practised as an attorney and counsel for several years in the district courts, county courts, and court of chancery, made a motion to be permitted to practise in this court. A question was propounded whether he must take the oath prescribed by the act of the last session for the suppression of duel-ling. I was of opinion that he could not be permitted to practise in this court without taking that oath. My opinion was founded upon these principles: That an attorney at law is a <em>public </em>officer; that his license is only an inchoate step to office ; that he becomes an officer in that court <em>only </em>in which he qualifies as the law directs; that his admission to practice in one court does not authorize him to practise in any other court; . . . that such an admission was equivalent to an <em>appointment, </em>inasmuch as he thereby becomes an officer of that particular court. ... In England, an attorney at law is considered as a public officer; otherwise a <em>mandamus </em>would not lie to restore him. The whole context of our act concerning counsel and attorneys at law, between whom there is no distinction in this country, proves the same thing. . . . They are subject to penalties to which no private citizen could possibly be subjected. Let a single example suffice: The lawyers practising in the inferior courts may demand for an opinion or advice, where no suit is brought, or prosecuted or defended, by the attorney giving such advice, but not otherwise, $1.67; those in the general court $3.58, for advice, under the same restrictions. And every lawyer exacting, taking, receiving, or demanding any greater fee, or other reward, is subjected to a heavy penalty. Under what color or pretext could the legislature impose a penalty on any other than a <em>public officer </em>for demanding and receiving $100 or $1,000, or any other sum whatever, for giving his <em>advice </em>to any person willing to pay for it? . . . Whether the legislature, the executive, or the court <em>appoints </em>or <em>admits </em>to an <em>office, </em>the <em>office </em>or <em>place </em>is held or exercised under the authority of the commonwealth. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u201c Judge <em>Roane. . . . </em>An attorney is defined to be one who is set in the place of another, and he is either <em>public, </em>as an attorney at law, or <em>private, </em>as being delegated to act for another in private contracts or agreements. 1 Bac. 287 ; Co. Lit. 52. With respect to these public attorneys, or attorneys at law, in order to ensure a due degree of probity and knowledge in their profession, so indispensable to persons acting in that character, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>none are permitted to act as such but those who are allowed by the judges to be skilled in the law, and certified by the court of the county of their residence to be persons of honesty, probity, and good demeanor. As a further guard against improper practices in their profession, they are required to take the oath prescribed by the act upon this subject. . . . Having obtained the sanction of these two tribunals touching these two particulars, an attorney is <em>licensed </em>or <em>allowed </em>to practise; and the courts have also a continuing control over them, with power to revoke their licenses for unworthy practices or behavior: but the licensing judges cannot be said to \u2018 elect \u2019 or \u2018 appoint \u2019 an attorney: he can, perhaps, only be said to be \u2018 appointed \u2019 by the particular clients, who, after he is licensed, ma.y severally employ him. This result is entirely justified by a view of the act \u2018 concerning attorneys at law and counsel,\u2019 ... in which these functionaries are nowhere said to be \u2018 elected \u2019 or \u2018 appointed,\u2019 either by the government or the licensing judges, nor are their functions anywhere called or designated as \u2018 offices \u2019 in the act, except in the form of the oath prescribed to be taken; and even there that term may well be taken in a general and extended sense, as synonymous with \u2018 duty.\u2019 The act, it is true, prescribes an oath to be taken as aforesaid, previous to being allowed to practise; but that can only be considered . . . as an <em>additional </em>security for the good conduct of the attorney. It would be too much to say that this single circumstance of precaution (any more than tho;-e of the license and certificate of the county court before mentioned) shall exalt that-functionary into an \u2018 officer,\u2019 when he is neither said in the law to. be \u2018appointed\u2019 to any office, nor to <em>hold </em>any office, and when he receives no salary or emolument except the fees which individual citizens may please to give him. If this single circumstance should be construed to have that effect, it might be equally argued to have-a similar effect in relation to jurors. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\u201cIt is not necessary in this case to consider whether, and in what degree, attorneys are considered in this country (as they are in England) officers <em>of their resjoeetive courts ; </em>though it is easy to-see that an attorney in this country not having as many privileges-as the English attorneys, in consideration of which that character is there holden to attach, a difference may probably exist in this-country in this particular. . . . Even admitting . . that-attorneys are,-in some sense and in some degree, officers of their several courts, as they are held to be in England, the question still recurs, Are they officers within the meaning of the act to suppress duelling? . . . The 2d section declares that a person accepting-a challenge, &amp;c., \u2018 shall be incapable of <em>holding </em>or being \u201c <em>elected </em>\u201d to any post of profit, trust, or emolument, civil or military, under the government of this commonwealth.\u2019 It relates as well to persons <em>now </em>in office as to those <em>to be elected </em>thereto. . . . The-former- must have been <em>elected. . . . </em>This part of the clause- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>. . . excludes attorneys at law, who . . . are neither \u2018 elected \u2019 nor \u2018 appointed \u2019 to office, but are merely <em>permitted </em>to practise by those who are constituted by law judges of their character and qualifications. . . . Admitting . . . that attorneys are to be considered as \u2018 officers,\u2019 they are only considered, even in England, ... as officers of their respective courts. 1 Bac. 287. They do not, therefore, come up to the <em>desideratum, </em>of this act; they are not officers <em>under the government of the commonwealth. </em>There is no just ground on which we can erect, by implication or construction, into <em>governmental </em>officers, those who, in England, are not exalted to that character, and who, in the only books and doctrines handed to us on the subject from that country, are held, at most, to be mere subordinate officers of <em>their respective courts. </em>But if attorneys could be even considered as officers of the government, they do not hold an office of <em>profit </em>or <em>emolument </em>under the government (or, in other words, a <em>lucrative </em>office) ; otherwise they would have been excluded from a seat in the legislature by the provisions of the constitution. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u201c The words of the oath, . . . \u2018 during my continuance in office,\u2019 seem to indicate those public offices which are held by commission or appointment, and are wont and proper to be <em>resigned; </em>they do not naturally apply to a function which is never resigned or formally given up, which it is the right of one citizen to exercise at the request and for the benefit of another, and in respect to which the <em>regulating </em>hand of the legislature has only interposed for the saintary purposes before mentioned. ... It has never been pretended (although, if attorneys when they practise in the state courts thereby become officers of the commonwealth, they equally become officers of the general government when they practise in the federal courts) that the attorneys practising in the latter courts cannot also practise in the former. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u201cJudge <em>Fleming. . . . </em>Practitioners of the law are not comprehended in the act, under these words, \u2018every person who shall be appointed to any office or place, civil or military, under the commonwealth, shall, in addition to the oath now prescribed by law, take the following oath,\u2019 &amp;c. The practice of the law is a profession which every citizen of the state, having complied with certain requisites, . . . may take up, engage in, and exercise according to his own will and pleasure; and which he may lay down, and resume, as often as to him may seem convenient, without any responsibility for his conduct in so doing. . . . The officer taking the oath, after swearing \u2018that he hath not been engaged in a duel,\u2019 ... is further to swear that \u2018 he will not be so concerned, directly or indirectly, in such duel, <em>during his continuance in office; </em>\u2019 which . . . has no allusion to practitioners of the law.\u201d Mr. Leigh was therefore admitted without taking the oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">In <em>Byrne </em>v. Stewart, 8 Desaus. 466 (decided in 1812), it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>was held that the office of a solicitor in a court \u00f3f chancery is not a public office. \u201c Pie is not appointed by the legislature,\u201d says Chancellor <em>Waties (pp. </em>478, 479), \u201cnor is he amenable to it, for he does not possess any portion of the public authority. His admission to practice is indeed regulated by law, but it is in the power of any man, who will comply with the legal requisites, to become a solicitor, independently of the will of the legislature. He can be considered in no other light than that of a private agent \u25a0for the citizens of the country, who may employ him to do their legal business in the courts ; and although the law requires of him certain- qualifications, and he receives a license from the judges, yet his office is no more a public one than would be any other profession or trade which the legislature might choose to subject to similar regulations, and which is the practice in many other countries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u201cThe \u2018act to suppi\u2019ess duelling\u2019 [passed in 1816] . . . \u2022requires \u2018 every member of the senate or of the assembly, and every person who shall be elected or appointed to any office or place, civil or military, except town officers, and every person who shall be admitted a counsellor, attorney, or solicitor . . . to take an oath that he has not been engaged in a duel.\u201d A new \u25a0section of the constitution of 1821 \u201c ordains that members of the \u2022legislature, and all officers, executive and judicial . . . shall take ... an oath or affirmation to support the- constitution of the United States, and the constitution of this state, and also faithfully to discharge the duties of his office; and that \u2018 no other oath, declaration, or test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust.\u2019 The question now presented is, whether the new constitution has repealed the provision of the \u2018 act to sup.press duelling,\u2019 in regard to the oath required to be taken by attorneys and counsellors of this court. The point is simply whether an attorney or counsellor holds an <em>office </em>or <em>public trust </em>in the sense of the constitution. Lexicographers, generally define \u2018office\u2019 to mean \u2018public employment;\u2019 and I apprehend its legal meaning to be an employment on behalf of the government, in any station or public trust, not merely transient, occasional, or incidental. In common parlance, the term \u2018 office \u2019 has a more general signification. Thus, we say the <em>office </em>of executor, or <em>guardian; </em>or the <em>office </em>of <em>a friend. </em>In my judgment, an attorney or counsellor does not hold an <em>office, </em>but exercises <em>a privilege or franchise. </em>As attorneys or counsellors, they perform no duties on behalf of the government; they execute no public trust. They enjoy the exclusive privilege of prosecuting and defending suits for clients who may choose to employ them. Various classes of persons are licensed in the city of New York, with an exclusive privilege in their employment; yet they are not public officers. Physicians are also licensed, pursuant to statutes ; yet they hold no office or public trust, in legal construction. Lawyers are licensed to prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tise in one of the learned professions, and physicians in another; and there are many regulations by law for their government as distinct orders of men in society; but they are not trustees, nor agents, for the public, any more than persons licensed to carry on the business of banking. The fees of attorneys are fixed by law ; and so is the compensation of cartmen and bakers and ferrymen. . . . The legislature, in framing the \u2018 act to suppress duelling,\u2019 have discriminated between <em>public </em>officers, and <em>attorneys </em>and <em>counsellors. </em>They provide not only that \u2018 persons elected or appointed to any office or place, civil or military,\u2019 but that \u2018 persons <em>admitted </em>\u2019 as <em>counsellors </em>and attorneys, shall take the oath: thus, by fair inference, giving an exposition which shows that lawyers, in their contemplation, were not <em>public officers. </em>I am therefore of opinion that the new constitution has not abrogated the provision of the act which required attorneys and counsellors to take this oath.\u201d Platt, J., in the <em>Matter of the Oaths to be taken by Attorneys and Counsellors, </em>20 Johns. 492-494. <em>Woodworth, </em>J., concurred; <em>Spencer, </em>C. J., dissented. In <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>2 Cow. 13, 28, 29, <em>Spencer, </em>C. J., expressed the opinion that an attorney holds an office within the sense of the constitutional provision that \u201cneither the chancellor, nor justices of the supreme court, nor any circuit judge, shall hold any other office or public trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u201c So far as the legal profession is an occupation open to all, there is no reason to consider a lawyer as a public officer. The exercise of this profession is in part an occupation, in which every person is free to engage; but it is not so in respect to proceedings in the courts of justice. These proceedings are, according to our laws and usages, conducted by a distinct class of men specially appointed for this service. The practice of the law in the courts of justice is permitted only to those who are appointed by the courts; the persons appointed are subject to the control of the courts; and they may be deprived of their right to pursue this occupation. These regulations evidently consider the practice of the law in the courts as a part of the administration of justice; as a function important not merely to private parties, but also to the public. They are regulations which are supposed to be necessary or conducive to a good administration of public justice. The admission of an attorney, solicitor, or counsellor is a general appointment to conduct causes before the courts. This station, thus conferred by public authority, has its peculiar powers, privileges, and duties; and this station thus becomes an office in the administration of justice. Attorneys, solicitors, and counsellors are constantly denominated officers of the courts by which they are appointed. Our laws have required that upon their admission they should take a particular oath for the faithful discharge of their duties, and that oath is termed, by the legislature itself, an oath of office. In this, as in other regulations, the legislature have considered and treated persons appointed to practise the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>as holding a species of office. . . . The constitution of the Union requires that all executive and judicial officers of the United States and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support that constitution.

An act, passed in 1826, required \u201c all members of the general assembly . . . and all officers and public functionaries, . . . and attorneys and counsellors at law,\u201d to take an oath that they had taken no part in a duel since Jan. 1, 1826, and would take no part therein during their continuance in office or in the discharge of any public function; and provided that \u201cany attorney or counsellor at law, failing or refusing to take the said oath, shall not be permitted to practise as such in any court in this state.\u201d In <em>Dorsey\u2019s </em>Case, 7 Por. 293, it was held by a majority of. the court that the requirement of this oath was not a constitutional method of disqualification. \u201c <em>G-old</em>thwaite, J. ... If a <em>statute </em>excluded from <em>office </em>one convicted of a particular offence, and used no other term of designation, I should not hesitate to decide that the profession of a lawyer was not included within the meaning of the term as generally used; because he can no more be said to hold an office than one who pursues the profession of a physician, the avocation of a teacher, or who discharges the functions of an administrator or guai\u2019dian. But if I were called on to declare that the constitution, by these express grants, has not invested the general assembly with power to exclude from tlie exercise of these or similar professions, I confess I should very much doubt the propriety of such a construction. The present inclination of my judgment is, that those terms are sufficiently comprehensive to include all avocations, franchises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>professions, or functions, which are public in their nature, and which therefore may affect the constitution and well-being of society. . . .

The first question ... is, whether the privilege or right to practise law is an <em>office, </em>within the meaning of <em>art. </em>6, <em>s. </em>3. The word office has two meanings \u2014 the one popular, the other legal and technical. Thus, we speak of the office of an executor, guardian, etc. The legal meaning of the term always implies \u2018 a charge, or trust, conferred by public authority, and for a public purpose.\u2019 It is most unlikely that in framing a constitution of government its authors should have used a word of the importance of this, technical in its nature, . . . in a loose or popular sense. . . . \u2018 Extending to disqualification from office, or the <em>tenure </em>thereof,\u2019 is quite conclusive of its meaning; for with no propriety of language could the <em>tenure </em>of an office be spoken of, unless it were an office of public trust. . . . Under the head of impeachments, wo find that the governor and all civil officers shall be liable to impeachment for any misdemeanor in office. The term is <em>general </em>\u2014 all <em>civil officers </em>\u2014 and must embrace all persons holding an office within the purview of any constitutional regulation or restriction ; yet no one, wo apprehend, would contend that for malpractice, or for other good and sufficient cause, an attorney at law must be removed by impeachment before the senate. <em>[Pp. </em>371,372.] . . . <em>Collier, </em>C.

Nor does an attorney and counsellor at law, <em>as such, </em>hold an office under the government. . . . Taking the law to have been correctly adjudged in the cases cited from 20 Johns, and 1 Munford, an attorney may be said to hold a privilege or profession. . . . Such only as are charged with the interests of the public are officers within the meaning of the constitution.\u201d <em>Pp. </em>392-394, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">In <em>Faulkner\u2019s Case, </em>1 W.

Whenever it was the legislative intention to embrace attorneys at law, they are named as such; and when not so intended they are not so named, and are not included by the general terms \u2018 all officers elected or appointed.\u2019 ... It would seem to be the settled understanding . . . that attorneys at law were not officers of the government, either state, or national, elected or appointed, within the meaning of any of said acts relative to officers, civil or military ; but, on the contrary, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>they were a profession or class <em>sui generis; </em>and though called officers of courts, yet never in the sense of these acts, nor intended to be embraced by them.\u201d <em>P. </em>285.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">A California statute provided that \u201c no attorney at law shall be permitted to practise ... until he shall have' taken and filed \u201d an oath \u201c that I have not, since April 25, 1863 [the date of the passage of the act], knowingly aided, encouraged, countenanced, or assisted, nor will I hereafter in any manner aid, encourage, countenance, or assist, the so called Confederate States, or any of them, in their rebellion.\u201d \u201cIt is insisted that the statute violates <em>s. </em>3 of <em>art.. </em>11 of the constitution of this state,\u201d which requires \u201cmembers of the legislature, and all officers, executive and judicial,\u201d to take an oath to support the constitutions, state and federal, and to faithfully discharge the duties of their office, and provides that \u201cno other oath, declaration, or test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust.\u201d \u201c It is insisted that an attorney at law is an \u2018 officer; \u2019 that the privilege he exercises is an \u2018office\u2019 within the intent and meaning of this section, and that the affidavit required by the statute in question is another and a' different oath, in the nature of a test oath, imposed as a qualification for the office, and that the law therefore conflicts with the constitution. ... To construe this section to mean that a lawyer is an officer, would directly conflict with the well established meaning of other provisions in which the word officer is used. Thus, if it is an office it is one of profit, and an impeached officer would be disqualified from .practising the profession, under <em>s. </em>19 of <em>art. </em>4; and senators and assemblymen who should vote to regulate attorneys\u2019 fees would be excluded from practising law by s. 20 ; and a lawyer, admitted to practice under the laws of the United States, would be a \u2018person holding a lucrative office under the United States,\u2019 and would not \u2018 be eligible to any civil office of profit under this state,\u2019 and so would be excluded from practising in our state courts, or holding any office, by s. 21, and could not be governor under <em>s. </em>12 of <em>art. </em>5. If it is an office, it is liable to become \u2018vacant\u2019 by death, resignation, removal from the state, or otherwise, and would be governed by <em>s. </em>8- of <em>art. </em>5 [which authorizes the governor to fill vacancies]. If it is an office, a lawyer must be a \u2018judicial officer,\u2019 for his duties relate mainly to courts of justice, and he has always been termed an officer of the court. He would therefore be precluded from receiving \u2018 to his own use any fees or perquisites of office.\u2019 <em>[Art. </em>6, <em>s. </em>11.] . . . If he is an officer, he must be elected or appointed, as required by <em>s. </em>6 of <em>art. </em>11, and the duration of the office cannot exceed four years, as prescribed by <em>s. </em>7 of <em>art. </em>11.....</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cAttorneys are officers of the court, and as such are subject to&gt; the control of the court before which they practise, which has power to summarily investigate the dealings and transactions between them and their clients, ... as also to disbar them for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>misconduct and deprive them of the privilege of practising their profession. The books are full o\u00a3 decisions in which they are termed officers in this sense. And in some cases the courts have said, arguendo, that they are \u2018 public officers,\u2019 on the ground that they receive stated fees fixed by statute and are subject to the control of the court. . . . But none of the cases we have been referred to hold directly, as a point actually decided, . . that they are \u2018officers,\u2019 or \u2018public officers,\u2019 within the legal meaning of those terms when used in statutes and constitutions, except the case of <em>Wood, </em>in Hopk.

Their special researches and general legal knowledge enable them to aid the courts, and thus to contribute toward the due administration of justice. The. office is therefore an important one, and the attorney incidentally performs a g-wasi-public duty. But admission to the profession is purely a private matter, and is secured solely for the advancement of private interests. By virtue of such admission attorneys are not required to perform specific public acts, nor are specified duties- devolved upon them in behalf of the general public. The duties they assume and the labor they perform are usually in pursuance of personal contracts with private litigants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>. . .

The legislature may be of opinion that the public welfare requires a reasonable degree of skill and trustworthiness in physicians and lawyers, as well as in pilots, and that their business should not be carried on by persons to whom important interests cannot be safely intrusted. Statutes have authorized the selection of persons qualified for various employments, and the grant of licenses as evidence of their qualifications, and excluded all who did not obtain this evidence. Such regulations, adopted as a means of protecting the public against incapacity and unfitness, do -not necessarily transform the licensee\u2019s business into a public office in such a sense as to exclude, women. A legislative purpose to introduce a sexual test, and extend the legal disabilities of women, cannot be implied from a mere requirement of a license as a certificate that the holder is competent for a specified work.

Every man may be a plaintiff or defendant. Every man may have a right to enforce, or an unjust claim to resist. . . . When he applies to an attorney for advice, he should have security, from the attorney\u2019s previous study of his profession, that he is reasonably competent to discharge his trust. There is no class of men whose advice in their particular calling is more generally followed than the class of attorneys. More implicit confidence is reposed in them, for personal honor and devotion to their duties, than in any other persons. Secrets involving all that renders life valuable are confided to them upon the mere security and belief that they will not violate a professional confidence. Evidences of debt and of rights to property are placed in their hands, for whose return other security than their professional trust is rarely required. It is even more important for the interest of the public than of the attorneys that this high character should continue to be deserved as it has been,\u201d and that they should be mentally and morally competent to act as legal advisers and draughtsmen, and \u201c to take charge of litigated cases in court, involving as they do the life, liberty, reputation, and property of so many of their fellow-citizens.\u201d <em>Bryant's </em>Case, 24 N.

If that be so,, then it is quite clear that the plaintiff in this case is entitled to-maintain this action.\u201d See <em>Foltz </em>v. Kerlin, 105 Ind. 221, 223. This definition does not include attorneys at law. The obligation to render public service, which the law imposes upon common carriers, and which is one of the ordinary characteristics of public office, is not an element in the business of the legal profession. \u201cAn attorney is neither a public officer nor an officer of the court in the sense in which a prosecuting attorney, a clerk, a sheriff, or coroner is an officer. ... In the mere practice of his profession, he is not in the receipt either of a salary or fees allowed by law, but is simply engaged in a private pursuit. Consequently his particular services cannot be required without compensation.\u201d <em>Ex parte </em>Harrison, 112 Ind. 329, 333. On this point the authorities are conflicting. Cool. Con. Lim. 406, 486. In this state an attorney is not compellable to engage in general or special practice,, or to render any professional service, upon tender of compensation. \u201c It seems like a solecism to regard that to be an office, in this country, to which there are no duties assigned \u201d ( <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>62 Pa. St. 343), and in which an unlimited number of incumbents may remain during life, legally qualified and amply competent in fact, but refusing every request to perform official service, without incurring censure or liability, or being guilty of official neglect. If public office is erroneously defined as including-duty, the inquiry may be merely whether a license to practise law is an appointment to a place of governmental power. Whether that power is or is not necessarily accompanied by duty, a right to-exercise it, in its electoral or official form, is not conferred upon women by the common law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In Rome and England and elsewhere, women have not been lawyers. The usage may have been regarded as universal law; but it is not conclusive on the question of legality. The callings-followed by women have multiplied without legislation, and there-are others in which they are not found, but in which they can lawfully engage. Without a statutory or common-law rule closing-any branch of any profession against them, public sentiment, based on prevailing views of natural law and public policy, might be pi-actically equivalent to a legislative prohibition. \u201cThe paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator. And the rules of civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of things.\u201d <em>Bradley, Swayne, </em>and <em>Field, </em>JJ., in <em>Bradwell </em>v. <em>State, </em>16 Wall. 130, 141. Men authorized to admit women to the bar, or to practise as attorneys, might deem it inexpedient to try the experiment. In certain social conditions, the legal question would not be likely to arise. Its first appearance would) be expected in this age, and in this country. With a universal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>opinion that the practice of law is not an employment fit for women, and with such a view of consequences as was expressed in <em>Goodell's Case (ante, p. </em>209), the question in the minds of benchers and courts would be, not whether women could lawfully be admitted, but whether they could lawfully be kept out. When it was held that it could not be necessary that Mrs. Cobbett \u201cshould come into court [in behalf of her husband who was absent and in-custody <em>(ante, p. </em>229) ] -to wrangle at <em>nisi prius, </em>and engage in scenes inconsistent with the character of her sex,\u201d it would not have been considered necessary or advisable that women should engage, professionally and habitually, in scenes thus described.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The principle by which the question of judicial power to grant the petition in this case is to be determined seems plain and simple, however difficult may be its application to other cases nearer the line that separates official from non-official employments. By our common law, women do not vote in town-meeting. The reason is, that voting is an exercise of governmental power. For the same \u25a0reason, and by the same law, they do not hold public office. ' The reason of the rule does not exclude them from an occupation in which they would take no official part in the government of the country. The question is, whether an attorney at law is an officer of government within the reason and purpose of the rule. If a licensed attorney, being a public officer in a special and limited sense, is not a public officer in the ordinary sense, and by virtue of his office takes no official part in the government, the admission of women to the bar would not be a violation of our common law. If an attorney\u2019s occupation is a public office in the governmental sense, the admission of women will be illegal until the disability is removed by the legislature. The test cannot be found in anything so indeterminate as whatever concerns the administration of justice. Nothing concerns the administration of justice more than the part taken by men and women as witnesses in the trial of civil and criminal cases. Governmental power is not exercised by their testifying truly or falsely. Neither is it exercised by an attorney in advising a client, drawing a will, deed, declaration, or plea, questioning witnesses, or arguing upon their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Before appearance by attorney was allowed by acts of parliament, a person appearing as attorney for a party under a royal mandate may have been regarded as invested with a degree of official authority. After the passage of the act of 1402 (4 Hen. IV, <em>c. </em>18), entitled \u201cFor Regulation of Attorneys,\u201d which required them to be \u201c sworn well and truly to serve in their offices,\u201d there may have been little occasion to distinguish between their position as officers of the court, and the position of other officials who exercised powers of government. Serjeants at law, appointed by the king, may have been considered officers -in a peculiar sense. All barristers might be accounted officers by those who denied that they were agents of their clients. To what extent attorneys and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>counsel were understood to be government officers, and to what extent they were mere occupants of places assigned them in the social and legal ranks into which the whole community was divided, may be a question. 1 Bl. Com. 271, 272, 376, 396-408. Giving due weight to history, tradition, and usage, it does not appear that members of the New Hampshire bar are public officers in any other sense than that in which they are officers of the court. That sense is well understood, and is fully set forth and clearly defined in authorities before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In determining whether an indictment shall be nol-prossed or tried, the attorney-general acts for the state in business in which he is the state\u2019s agent, exercises a portion of the power of the state, and performs an official duty. The prisoner\u2019s counsel is not employed by and does not act for the same principal, exercises no governmental power, and performs no official duty due from him to the state. As adviser, draftsman, and counsel for other parties than the state, he is the private agent of his employers. His admission to practice was not an admission to the state\u2019s service in an official or unofficial capacity. When retained by the state to bring a civil suit or prosecute an indictment, he does not become a state officer. When not retained by the state, he is not in the state\u2019s employment; and his vocation as an attorney, and an officer of the court (a public officer, in the special and limited sense explained by the authorities), with no power or duty of a governmental nature, is not a public office within the meaning and reason of the common-law rule which excludes women from government by withholding electoral and official power. Their exclusion from the exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial authority does not prevent their being licensed to practise as physicians or attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">When the attorney-general employs counsel in a state case (G. L., <em>c. </em>263, s. 2), there is a distinction between the position of the public prosecutor who acts in his official capacity, and the position of the attorney who renders service in pursuance of a contract. In every branch of the government illegal attempts may be made, by contract or license, to delegate official power to disqualified persons, minors, women, and aliens, and to adult male citizens. 61 N. H. 323-329. The inconvenience that may arise from this practice, and the difficulty (in some cases) of finding the line between official and non-official employment, are not a ground on which the existence or the necessity of the line can be denied, or on which it can be held that a woman cannot legally act as ah amanuensis in drawing an indictment, or as an attorney in a civil or criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">When the petitioner furnishes the evidence required by the rules, the question of her admission to examination (or admission to practise without examination, as a person who has been admitted and has practised in another state) will be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
