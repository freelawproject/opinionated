Both parties claim under Brackett &amp; Hersey, who, December 6, 1866, owned the whole of the bank lot, however bounded. On that day Libby conveyed to them the rear part of the Libby lot \u201cbounded and described as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Beginning on the easterly side of a sixteen-foot passway between Blake Folsom\u2019s store and stable lot and the said Libby lot on a line corresponding with the westerly end of the L part of said Libby's house at a point corresponding with the rear part of said Libby\u2019s buildings at a stake and stones, northerly on said pass-way until it intersects with the line between the land of A. D. and J. L. Avery and the bank lot so called; thence easterly to a stone post adjoining said bank lot to land of Brackett &amp; Hersey, thence by said Brackett &amp; Hersey\u2019s land to a point that will correspond with the rear part of said Libby\u2019s buildings at right angles with the point begun at a stake and stones, thence westerly by the rear part of said Libby\u2019s buildings to the bound begun at.\u201d This is a clear and definite description of the tract of land situated in the rear of Libby\u2019s buildings and between the passway extended in a straight line to Avery\u2019s land and the westerly line of the front part of the bank lot extended in like manner, it being conceded that the stone post referred to is located at the northerly end of the latter line. February 3, 1871, Brackett &amp; Hersey, describing this tract in language identical with the foregoing, conveyed an undivided half of it to the defendant. On the same day they conveyed to Thurston an undivided third of the bank lot and \u201calso one third part in common and undivided of one half of a lot of land adjoining said granted premises [the bank lot] which is owned in common and undivided with Blake Folsom [the defendant] being the same that was conveyed to us by .Daniel Libby by his deed dated December 6, 1866, reference being had to said deed for further description.\u201d The defendant thus acquired a title good at the least as against Brackett &amp; Hersey and all persons claiming under them, to an undivided half of the tract described. This is all the defendant claims It is immaterial whether Brackett <em>&amp; </em>Hersey had any title to the tract, or if they had a good title, how they obtained it, \u2014 whether, as the defendant claims, they took it under Libby\u2019s deed of December 6, 1866, or, as the plaintiffs claim, they already owned the land as being a part of the original bank lot. Subsequent conveyances by Brackett &amp; Hersey or by their grantees, though broad enough to cover the rear part of the Libby lot, could not affect the defendant\u2019s title. The defendant is entitled to</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b655-6\"><em>S. W.
