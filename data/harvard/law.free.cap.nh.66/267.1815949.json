Plea, the general issue, with a brief statement that the defendants were evicted by the plaintiffs from a portion of the demised premises, April 1, 1885, and were kept out of the possession thereof ever afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-8\">January 26, 1880, by the writing under seal, the plaintiffs-leased to the defendants, for the term of ten years from July 1, 1880, their mill in Meredith, described as \u201c a certain factory building known as their large mill and the brick picker building adjoining. As also the passageways from the street to the end and front of said building, and the yard-room around the same, not otherwise occupied. AH for the purpose of an iron machine-shop,\u201d etc. Fronting on the easterly side of the highway, and situated on the northerly side of the passageway leading from the highway easterly through the mill-yard to the mill, is a one-story wooden building, formerly occupied as a counting-room for the mill, but at the time of the execution of the lease occupied as a millinery store. It was not claimed that this building was included in the lease. The distance between the rear or easterly end of this building and the mill was about 100 feet, and the land between it and the mill was a part of the yard-room referred to in the lease. In the spring of 1885 the plaintiffs extended the one-story building twelve feet easterly towards the mill the whole width of the building, fourteen feet, and the building thus enlarged was afterwards occupied by the plaintiffs\u2019 other tenants. The space of ground, twelve by fourteen feet, thus covered by the extension, is-the portion of the demised premises from which the defendants complain they were evicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-10\">The plaintiffs offered to show by their agent, Seneca A. Ladd, that during the negotiations and before the execution of the leaseLadd went upon the premises with one Worrell, the defendants\u2019 treasurer and agent, and told him that the land immediately back of the millinery store was occupied in connection with it, and that-they agreed how much land was to be considered as so occupied, and fixed the bounds thereof. The court ruled that the plaintiffs-might show what land was otherwise occupied, or pointed out as- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c otherwise occupied,\u201d but excluded evidence of any agreement by parol reserving land for the shop, or as to any conversation about reserving land for the shop, not then occupied in connection with it. To this ruling the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\">The following question was put to Ladd, who was deaf, in writing: \u201cYou will observe that the lease reads, in describing the premises, \u2018as also the passage from the street to the end and front of said building, and the yard-room' around the same not otherwise occupied.\u2019 Please state if in said negotiations and prior to the execution of the lease you pointed out to Mr. Worrell what part of the yard-room was occupied by the association, and if you did, what part of said yard was so pointed out.\u201d Ans. \u201cI pointed out the yard-room at the end of the little building [saying, \u2018 Some ten to twenty feet here we reserve to go with the millinery room \u2019]., I paced ten or fifteen feet from the end of the building opposite to a rock in the bank [and said, \u2018 We reserve it to go with this building\u2019]. The. land and rock in the bank which I pointed out were fifteen or twenty feet below the little building, and seven or eight feet from the building as it is now.\u201d So much of the foregoing answer as is included within brackets was stricken out after the closing arguments of counsel, and the jury were instructed to disregard it; and the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">In reply to a question from one of the jurors, whether, in determining if the land in question was otherwise occupied, regard should be had to the occupation of the premises at the time of the execution of the lease, or at some subsequent time, the court instructed them that the words \u201c otherwise occupied,\u201d as used in the lease, mean the occupation of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises at the time of the execution of the lease, and not at some subsequent time. To this instruction the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">There was no evidence of occupation by the tenants of the millinery shop of that part covered by the addition at the time of and prior to the execution of the lease.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-7\"><em>D.

Also the passageways from the street to the end and front of said building, and tbe yard-room around the same, not otherwise occupied.\u201d Parol evidence was admissible to identify the premises leased, and to determine the limits of the yard-room around the building and the portion other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>wise occupied, but it was inadmissible to show an intention on the part of the lessor, or a parol agreement of the parties, to reserve any part of the premises not reserved by the terms of the lease. The language of the lease conveyed the yard-room around the building \u201c not otherwise occupied,\u201d having reference to the usual and customary occupation, and evidence of a parol agreement to reserve land for the millinery shop not usually occupied in connection with it, and any conversation about a reservation for future occupation was rightfully excluded, being in conflict with \u25a0 the language of the lease. <em>Prescott </em>v.
