L., <em>c. </em>215, s. 7. \u201c Police coiu\u2019ts have . . . exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences committed within the town in which such court is established, so far hs justices of the peace have jurisdiction.\u201d G. L., <em>c. </em>252, s. 8. Under the act of 1885 (e. 94, s. 5), an inquiry concerning alleged corrupt practices in an election is made by \u201c any justice of the peace, or police judge.\u201d The inquisition is not an ordinary criminal prosecution, but a process of discovery, like a coroner\u2019s inquest. \u201cAny justice of the peace and quorum shall have and exercise the same powers ... as a coroner.\u201d G. L., <em>c. </em>265, s. 2. It has not been understood that the authority of a justice of the peace and quorum to act as a coroner is limited to towns in which there is no police court. There are reasons for inferring that the legislature intended an election inquest might be conducted in any town by a justice-of the peace. The police court of Littleton has not exclusive jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-6\">Bingham, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
