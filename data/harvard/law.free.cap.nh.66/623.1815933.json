In April, 1884, Brown and the plaintiff\u2019s testate, Hopkinson, recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>judgments against Benton, and Hodgdon was charged as trustee for the amount of the judgments. In payment of the judgments, four of the notes (reduced to the amount of the judgments by an endorsement of a partial payment, which was adjusted by Benton and Hodgdon) were transferred and delivered with the mortgage by Benton to Brown and \u25a0 Hopkinson. Hopkinson afterwards bought Brown\u2019s interest in the four notes and the mortgage. Benton still holds the other two notes. Hopkinson, Brown, and Benton understood that if a foreclosure of the mortgage should be necessary to obtain payment of the four transferred notes, those notes should be fully paid before any proceeds of the foreclosure should be applied to the payment of the other two notes. The competent proof that this understanding was a part of the transaction is conclusive. A finding against Hopkinson\u2019s prior right would be set aside as against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">\n<em>Decree for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-5\">Carpenter, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
