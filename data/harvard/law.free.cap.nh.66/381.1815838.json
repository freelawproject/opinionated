The plaintiff was a candidate for tbe office of senator iii the Somersworth district (No. 12) at the election in November, 1890, and tbe defendant is town-clerk of Rochester. The prayer of the petition is for a writ requiring the defendant to make a correct record of the moderator\u2019s declaration of the votes given for senator in Rochester at that election, and to make due return thereof to the secretary of state. The selectmen counted the votes, entered the numbers in columns on a paper previously prepared, added them, wrote the result at the foot of the columns, as follows, \u2014 for Parshley 861, for the plaintiff 856, for Bean 84,' \u2014 and handed the paper to the moderator, who declared <em>the votes </em>according to that addition, and handed the paper to the town-clerk, who had no doubt tbat tbe votes were declared by the moderator from and according to the footings. Some time after-wards, a week or more, when the defendant was making bis returns to the secretary of state, on adding the column of whole number of votes for senator be found there were ten more than tbe sum of the footings for Parsbley, Felker, and Bean, and on adding the columns of Bean\u2019s votes, be found the sum to be 44 instead of 34.

Felker was 856, and the whole number of tickets given in for Frank R. Bean was 44, but in adding up the column containing the whole number of tickets given in for Frank R. Bean an error appears whereby the footing of said column is made to read 34 instead of 44, which is the correct footing of said column, and whether the moderator, in making- his declaration aforesaid declared the number of votes given in for Frank R. Bean to be 34 or 44 the clerk is unable to state from memory, and therefore makes this record of the fact a part of his record prescribed by law.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-42\"><em>J.
