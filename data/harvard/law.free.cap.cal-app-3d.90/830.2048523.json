Appellant Nix also was found to have used a firearm in the commission of the robbery and the burglary. Appellant McNeal was also found to be in violation of his probation for a previous violation of Penal Code sections 236 (false imprisonment), 221 (assault with intent to commit a felony), and 594 (vandalism).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">In the early morning hours of April 25, 1977, the victim, Allen Fawkes, was awakened in his home by three intruders who wore rubber masks: one described as a blackish-green witch\u2019s face, another as a fox or a wolf, and the third as a large bald head. The masks completely covered the heads of the intruders. The individual wearing the witch\u2019s mask held a flashlight and a shotgun or rifle. Fawkes was robbed of a small quantity of marijuana, his wallet and two .22 caliber rifles. Within a few hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>after the robbery, appellants and their juvenile coparticipant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The principal issue raised by appellants is whether the court erred in failing to ascertain if good cause existed for excusing one of the jurors. We conclude that the court erred, requiring a reversal of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In the afternoon of the first day of jury deliberations, the jury foreman sent a note to the trial judge, resulting in an in-chambers discussion with the foreman, with all counsel and appellants present. The note itself is not in the record. However, a colloquy between the court and the foreman regarding the note was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">\u201cQ. Your note indicates that one of the jurors has some personal knowledge that was brought about from the testimony of the last defense witness, and says it has definitely had a bearing on the way she will vote. Has she discussed what this knowledge is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201cA. Yes, she has, to a point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">\u201cQ. To a point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">\u201cA. She mentioned a couple of names, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d Counsel indicated they wished to talk to the juror. The court then recessed for the day and separated the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The following morning, before commencement of jury deliberations, counsel for McNeal suggested the foreman\u2019s statements required a formal hearing pursuant to Penal Code section 1120, so that the court could determine whether good cause existed to discharge the juror. The district attorney also asked that the juror be interrogated and that the court further ascertain if other jurors had been tainted. Penal Code section 1120 provides: \u201cIf a juror has any personal knowledge respecting a fact in controversy in a cause, he must declare the same in open court during the trial. If, during the retirement of the jury, a juror declare a fact which could be evidence in the cause, as of his own knowledge, the jury must return into court. In either of these cases, the juror making the statement must be sworn as a witness and examined in the presence of the parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>order that the court may determine whether good cause exists for his discharge as a juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">During further discussions with counsel as to how to proceed, the court declared, <em>\u201cI\u2019m not going into the facts.\u201d </em>The judge ultimately decided to requestion the foreman \u201cto find out from him what specifically, <em>not the facts, </em>but rather whether it was her [the juror] request or just his idea that brought this note.\u201d (Italics added.) The foreman was again brought into chambers and was asked by the judge how the note came about. \u201cDid the juror ask to have it sent?\u201d The foreman answered, \u201cYes. She just broke down and said that there was some\u2014that she had too much to lose, and it would definitely affect her decision now.\u201d The foreman then identified the juror as Jessie Exline. After this brief discussion with the foreman, Juror Exline was brought into chambers and verified that she had read the note before it had been sent to the court. The judge told the juror he wanted to ask her \u201ca couple of questions.\u201d \u201cYou can just answer yes or no, <em>and we don\u2019t want to go into factual matters.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The judge then asked the juror if she could deliberate fairly and impartially in the matter, to which Juror Exline answered, \u201cWell, after giving it some thought, since yesterday, I still can\u2019t find that I can say \u2018guilty\u2019 when I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Just what the juror meant by her statement was not pursued. Instead, the judge said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m asking.\u201d Further questions were asked of the juror as to whether she could deliberate fairly and impartially, to which she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor then said, \u201cWell, the note indicates that maybe Mrs. Exline has information outside the evidence, outside the things that were just presented to the court.\u201d The court thereupon asked the juror, \u201cDo you feel you could set that aside and judge the case on the evidence?\u201d She replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The jury was then instructed to resume their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in not conducting a hearing as required by Penal Code section 1120; in particular, appellants object to the court\u2019s failure to inquire into the facts of the juror\u2019s knowledge. We agree that the court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Penal Code section 1123 provides a mechanism by which a juror can be excused after the court determines there is \u201cgood cause\u201d to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>conclusion that the juror is unable to perform his duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Included within the scope of that section is a juror who claims personal knowledge of a fact which could be evidence in the cause, according to section 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The hearing requirements under Penal Code section 1120 are explicit. If the court is put on notice that a juror has declared personal knowledge of a fact in controversy, the court is under an obligation to determine whether that knowledge means there is good cause to discharge that juror. In such a situation, the juror must be <em>sworn </em>and examined. While a hearing with sworn testimony by the juror is required by section 1120, it appears that a less formal inquiry is adequate to determine \u201cgood cause\u201d to discharge a juror under other circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Compton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 55, 60 [98 Cal.Rptr. 217, 490 P.2d 537], the court, referring to Penal Code sections 1089 and 1123, stated, \u201cthe trial court has at most a limited discretion to determine that the facts show an inability to perform the functions of a juror, and that inability must appear in the record as a demonstrable reality.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 687, 696 [131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 552 P.2d 742].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Manriquez </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 426, 432 [130 Cal.Rptr. 585], the court stated: \u201cA hearing under sections 1123 and 1089 should be summary in nature and scope. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tinnin </em>(1934) 136 Cal.App. 301, 318-319 [28 P.2d 951]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 362, 371 [303 P.2d 730].) The hearing, though not a full-scale adversary hearing nonetheless should be complete enough to determine \u2018good cause.\u2019 (Cf <em>People </em>v. <em>Huff </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 443, 448 [63 Cal.Rptr. 317]; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 643, 649 [24 Cal.Rptr. 671].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The question presented here is whether, based upon the information available to the court, a more extensive hearing should have been conducted. We conclude that the record is abundant with statements that should have alerted the court to the requirement of an inquiry into the factual basis of the juror\u2019s original concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">According to the foreman, in addition to stating that she had personal knowledge brought about by the testimony of the last witness (defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>witness Francis Rogers), the juror \u201cmentioned a couple of names, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d That statement creates something of a mystery as to just what the juror said and whether it was said only to the foreman or to other jurors as well. The next day, the foreman offered the additional, equally mystifying information that Juror Exline \u201cjust broke down\u201d and said \u201cshe had too much to lose.\u201d From that statement one could speculate as to any number of possible improper influences being brought to bear upon the juror. It appears also from the statement that the foreman had not divulged everything he knew about the problem with Juror Exline in his first conference with the judge. The situation became more complicated during the court\u2019s discussion with Juror Exline herself, when she stated she could not say \u201cguilty\u201d when she didn\u2019t believe it, as if she was expected to vote to convict appellants even if she didn\u2019t believe them to be guilty; however, the court did not make any inquiry for clarification of that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Respondent contends that an adequate inquiry was made by the court, to wit, a determination that the juror could be fair and impartial. The cases cited by respondent, however, are inapposite. It is not enough for the juror alone to evaluate the facts and conclude that they do not interfere, with his or her impartiality. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Farris </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 376, 386-387 [136 Cal.Rptr. 45].) In <em>Farris </em>and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 18 [128 Cal.Rptr. 94], the court determined the factual basis for the possibility that the juror would be unable to discharge his duties properly, and then <em>further </em>inquired as to whether the juror could be fair and impartial. In the instant case, the court failed to ascertain the facts which might impair the impartiality of the juror. Once the court is alerted to the possibility that a juror cannot properly perform his duty to render an impartial and unbiased verdict, it is obligated to make reasonable inquiry into the factual explanation for that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Requiring such an inquiry is not inconsistent with <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 687 [131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 552 P.2d 742], In that case a juror was dismissed when she asked to be excused after deliberations had begun, claiming she was unable to make a decision based on the law and the evidence. During extensive questioning by the court, the juror stated she was involved emotionally more than intellectually, and repeatedly insisted that she could not follow the court\u2019s instructions, and that she had been upset throughout the trial. The court discharged her and substituted an alternate. The defendant challenged that discharge. Among other contentions, he argued the court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate because it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>not elicit any factual basis to support good cause for the discharge (at pp. 695-696). The Supreme Court disagreed. The juror\u2019s inability to deliberate impartially was clear. Once the trial court determined that she had not been coerced or subjected to duress during deliberations, no further factual inquiry into the basis of her distress was necessary or useful (at p. 696).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">In contrast here, the court\u2019s cursory questioning of Juror Exline did not justify its conclusion that she could properly perform her duties as a juror. Despite her provocative comments that she had \u201ctoo much to lose\u201d and that she couldn\u2019t \u201csay guilty\u201d when she didn\u2019t believe it, the court did not determine whether she had been subjected to some kind of duress. Here the court\u2019s failure to make at least a minimal factual inquiry left unresolved the essential question: Juror Exline\u2019s ability to deliberate impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Respondent also argues that a formal hearing pursuant to Penal Code section 1120 was not required because nothing in the record indicates that the juror declared that she had information as to facts which could be <em>evidence </em>in the case. However, it is apparent that the trial court intentionally avoided questioning the juror as to the facts of her personal knowledge. The appellants, therefore, cannot be faulted for not pointing to the \u201cfacts\u201d possessed by the juror which would be evidence. It was also necessary for the court to determine whether other jurors had become aware of any statements by Juror Exline, and if so, whether their impartiality would be influenced thereby. Once a court is put on notice of the possibility that improper or external influences are being brought to bear on a juror, it is the court\u2019s duty to make whatever inquiry is reasonably necessary to determine if the juror should be discharged and whether the impartiality of other jurors has been affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">We now turn to an evaluation of whether the court\u2019s error requires reversal. We are mindful that a presumption of prejudice arises from juror misconduct, and that in the absence of evidence to rebut the presumption, reversal is required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Honeycutt </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 150 [141 Cal.Rptr. 698, 570 P.2d 1050].) Here there is no evidence of juror misconduct. What Juror Exline knew and what she meant by her statements are not a part of the record. We cannot assume that because Juror Exline had some \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d and \u201cmentioned a couple of names,\u201d she was guilty of misconduct of the sort criticized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lambright </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 482 [39 Cal.Rptr. 209, 393 P.2d 409] (juror reading newspaper accounts); <em>People </em>v. <em>Conkling </em>(1896) 111 Cal. 616 [44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>P. 314]) juror conducting his own investigation); and <em>People </em>v. <em>Honeycutt, supra </em>(juror receiving extrajudicial legal advice). However, in each of those cases, whether there was misconduct could be determined from the facts. Here, further inquiry might have demonstrated that there was misconduct, or although there was no misconduct, the juror should be discharged because of her personal knowledge, or that there was no misconduct, personal knowledge, or other good cause for discharging the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">An evaluation of whether the error was prejudicial must have as its foundation the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial by a fair and impartial jury, as provided by the California Constitution, article I, section 16. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 690, 697 [234 P.2d 300].)  It is evident that a purpose of Penal Code sections 1089, 1120, and 1123 is to provide a vehicle for the dismissal of a sworn juror when facts are discovered from which it can reasonably be concluded that the juror, originally thought to be unbiased, actually cannot be fair and impartial. It necessarily follows that in such situations, as in the case at bench, where the fact of a sworn juror\u2019s impartiality comes into question as a result of that juror\u2019s conduct or statements during the course of the trial or the deliberations, the failure of the court to make at least a preliminary inquiry into the facts of such impartiality cannot be said to be error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,  We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s failure to make an appropriate inquiry into the facts in order to determine whether they constituted good cause for discharge of the juror constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We have examined the remaining contentions of appellants and conclude that they do not merit publication. A discussion of some of those contentions is necessary, however, to assist the court in the event of retrial. Preferably there would be a partial publication rule available for these circumstances.  Absent such a rule, the balance of the opinion will be placed in a footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. </em>v. <em>Muzzi </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 707 [148 Cal.Rptr. 197].)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Judgments are reversed.

The order finding that he came within section 602 of the Juvenile Court Law (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 500 et seq.) in that he committed a robbery in violation of Penal Code section 211 was affirmed by Division One of this court in its unpublished opinion (1 Civ. 42597, 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\"> PenaI Code section 1123 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf before the jury has returned its verdict into court, a juror becomes sick or upon other good cause shown to the court is found to be unable to perform his duty, the court may order him to be discharged.\u201d The balance of section 1123 and section 1089 provide for the manner of selection of alternate jurors, or for the declaration of a mistrial in the event there are no alternates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in not suppressing observations made by a police officer as to what he saw in appellants\u2019 car the night before the robbery. (4) Appellants contend that the initial stop of April 24, 1977, by Officer Schmidt was illegal, and that any fruits of that detention, including Schmidt\u2019s testimony as to what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>observed in the car, should have been suppressed. Appellants also contend their arrest on the night of the robbery was the direct result of the previous night\u2019s illegal stop; therefore, they argue, any evidence seized as a consequence of that second arrest should also have been suppressed. We conclude tnat there was sufficient cause for the stop and detention. Therefore, it is unnecessary to address appellants\u2019 latter contention. The Supreme Court has recently set forth guidelines as to the propriety of investigative stops or detentions in <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957], In regard to such detentions, the court stated (at p. 893): \u201cBalancing these factors, the courts have concluded that in order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (I) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so: the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his training and experience <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kiefer) supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 827), to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question. The corollary to this rule, of course, is that an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch is unlawful, even though the officer may be acting in complete good faith. <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 22 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 906-907].)\u201d [Fn. omitted.] On April 24, 1977, the night before the robbery involved here, Officer Schmidt of the Areata Police Department was patrolling the downtown area of that city. At approximately 4:30 a.m.. Schmidt observed an unfamiliar red and white Chevrolet traveling on a street in a high crime area; the vehicle stopped at a stop sign. About three minutes later, Officer Schmidt saw the same car in the same location. The car again stopped at the stop sign. No stores or restaurants were open. Although the car was not speeding or moving erratically, Schmidt decided that the car was \u201csuspicious.\u201d He testified, \u201cIt seemed to be driving around without apparent destination.\u201d He thought he should \u201ccheck it out.\u201d We conclude that the lateness of the hour and the reappearance of the unfamiliar car in a high crime area, when all businesses were closed, are sufficient articulable facts upon which the officer in the instant case could reasonably base his decision to stop and investigate the automobile. (5) Appellants also contend that even if the detention was proper, the scope of the subsequent alleged search was improper. When Officer Schmidt stopped the vehicle, he found the driver, appellant McNeal, was unlicensed. Schmidt cited him for violation of Vehicle Code section 12500 (driving without a license). Two other individuals were in the car: appellant Nathan Nix and a juvenile, one Peter S. Schmidt determined that Nix had a license, and instructed him to drive. Schmidt checked the interior of the car with a flashlight. Observing a beer can between the passenger seat and car door, he opened the door to retrieve the can, which was open and almost empty. He then looked on the floor in the back seat, where he discovered a wooden stick protruding from under a jacket; the stick \u201cappeared to be a billy.\u201d He investigated the item, which he determined was a nunchaku, an illegal weapon. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020.) He then looked throughout the interior of the vehicle, and saw some \u201crubberized items which looked a little unusual.\u201d Unrolling them, he found three rubber masks: one a wolf\u2019s head, one an old man, one a witch. He seized the nunchaku and arrested McNeal for its possession. He did not take the masks. Appellant Nix drove the car away. When Officer Schmidt saw the beer can through the car window, that observation constituted probable cause for his further examination of the vehicle to ascertain whether other open cans were in the car. Similarly, once he observed the illegal nunchaku, he had probable cause to believe other weapons might be inside the car, and further search was justified. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kiefer) </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 807, 817 [91 Cal.Rptr. 729, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>478 P.2d 449, 45 A.L.R.3d 559].) His observation of the three masks was not outside the scope of that search. We conclude that the observations and the search made subsequent to the detention were proper. (6) Appellants next contend that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of appellant Nix\u2019s prior statement to Officer Schmidt. During the April 24 detention, Officer Schmidt asked the appellants about the masks in the car. Appellant Nix stated the masks belonged to his children. On cross-examination of Officer Schmidt at trial, appellants\u2019 counsel asked Schmidt if he had any way of linking the masks to the occupants of the car. Schmidt replied, \u201cYes.\u201d On redirect the prosecutor asked, over objection, how Schmidt connected the masks and the occupants. Schmidt replied that Nix stated the masks belonged to his children. Appellants contend that the trial court erred in admitting the statements without a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether Nix had been properly warned according to <em>Miranda. (People </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 230 [129 Cal.Rptr. 679].) Respondent correctly argues that the statements made by appellant Nix were not made during an interrogation designed to elicit incriminating information so as to require a <em>Miranda </em>warning. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Manis </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 653 [74 Cal.Rptr. 423].) Nothing in the record indicates that appellant Nix was suspected of owning the illegal nunchaku; it was appellant McNeal who was subsequently arrested for its possession. Nor was Nix being interrogated by Officer Schmidt as a suspect in a crime involving the masks. The officer\u2019s question was a neutral inquiry. He was not attempting to elicit incriminating statements about the masks; he was not focusing on Nix as an accused. This situation cannot fairly be characterized as a custodial interrogation designed to elicit incriminating statements; consequently, a <em>Miranda </em>warning was not required before Officer Schmidt asked about the masks. There was no error in admitting Nix\u2019s statement. (7) Appellant McNeal contends that if the robbery conviction is reversed, the order revoking probation should also be reversed and the cause remanded for resentencing. Appellant properly states that the determination to revoke probation is largely discretionary. <em>(In re Coughlin </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 52, 56 [127 Cal.Rptr. 337, 545 P.2d 249].) Appellant states that after his conviction of robbery, a prison sentence was mandatory, because Penal Code section 1203.06, subdivision (a)(l)(iii) (applicable to appellant because his offense was committed prior to July 1, 1977) prohibited probation for any person who used a firearm during the commission of a robbery. Consequently, appellant argues, the revocation of his earlier probation was inevitable because that probation was inconsistent with the mandatory prison sentence required by Penal Code section 1203.06. Thus, appellant concludes, the trial court was unable to exercise its discretion in determining whether his probation should be revoked. Respondent argues that the trial court did exercise its discretion when it revoked appellant\u2019s probation. The record does not support appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court failed to exercise discretion in its decision to revoke his probation. Nothing in the record indicates the trial court believed it had no discretion in that matter. The court stated it had considered the probation report and had heard all of the trial; the court also treated the revocation of probation and the sentencing on the robbery conviction as two separate matters. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayko </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 604, 611 [86 Cal.Rptr. 726], the specified basis for a trial court\u2019s revocation of probation was a <em>conviction </em>which was declared invalid on appeal because of an illegal search and seizure. The appellate court reversed the order revoking probation, stating, \u201cWe do not know whether the court would have taken the same action regarding appellant, just on the basis of the contraband seized, if there had not been a trial and conviction\u201d (p. 611). In contrast here, the record does not indicate that the trial court specified the <em>conviction </em>as the basis for its revocation of probation. Apparently, it considered the probation report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>and all the evidence heard at trial. The court is authorized to revoke probation if it \u201chas reason to believe from the report of the probation officer or otherwise\u201d that the probationer has violated terms of his probation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.2, 'subd. (a).) (8) The standard of proof to be used by the trial court in assessing whether there exists \u201creason to believe\u201d the probationer has violated his probation has been stated as \u201cclear and satisfactory,\u201d \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d and \u201cproof by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d; the standard is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>(in re Coughlin, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 56.) Here it appears that the trial court concluded from the probation officer\u2019s report and the evidence introduced at trial that there was reason to believe appellant had violated the terms of his probation; that determination will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
