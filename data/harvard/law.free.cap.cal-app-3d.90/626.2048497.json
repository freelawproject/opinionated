Post sought injunctive and declaratory relief in an amended and supplemental complaint which challenged the constitutionality of Public Resources Code section 6922, enacted as part of the Geothermal Resources Act of 1967.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Named as defendants were Edward V. Prati, John T. Sink, Peter H. Flood, Richard J. Wall as trustee for children of Peter H. Flood; these defendants will sometimes be referred to herein as the surface owners. Also named defendants were Aminoil U.S.A., Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Mervyn Dymally, Kenneth Cory and Roy Bell, in their representative capacity as members of the State Lands Commission of the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Defendants demurred to plaintiff\u2019s pleading, contending that it failed to state a cause of action. As a part of their demurrer, defendants requested the trial court to take judicial notice of various materials presented to illuminate the legislative history and objectives resulting in the act\u2019s passage. In support of his complaint, plaintiff also presented materials which were subject to judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The trial court ruled in favor of the defendants, sustaining their demurrers without leave to amend, thereby upholding the constitutionality of Public Resources Code section 6922. The order of dismissal (judgment) was entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (3). By corrected notice of appeal, plaintiff has appealed from the \u201cMemorandum of Ruling\u201d and the \u201cOrder of Dismissal.\u201d The \u201cMemorandum,\u201d of course, is not an appealable order; we take cognizance of the \u201cMemorandum\u201d on the appeal from the order of dismissal, which is appealable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">We take a brief look at the background of this dispute. In 1967, after several years of legislative study, the California Legislature amended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Public Resources Code (ch. 4 of div. 3, commencing with \u00a7 3700) and added article 5.5 (commencing with \u00a7 6902), the addition to be known as the Geothermal Resources Act of 1967.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The act reflected general legislative concern with the necessity for developing new energy sources, among them geothermal resources.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Geothermal resources located in California constitute potentially the largest amount in the world; many of these resources are found in areas of the state which are presently economically depressed, and where the development of new industry is essential.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Thus it is provided by statute that \u201cthe people of the State of California have a direct and primary interest in the development of geothermal resources.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 3700.) The general legislative objective was to promote the orderly and safe development of such resources and to secure maximum economic recovery therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The act itself is concerned with the development of this energy source on state-owned lands, or on land which has been conveyed by the state to private interests with a reservation of mineral rights to the state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The developmental scheme contemplates the issuance of permits or long term leases by the State Lands Commission (hereinafter, the Commission) to private developers in return for royalties in specified amounts. As the result of legislative fact-finding, it was determined that economic feasibility requires minimum acreage of 640 acres to 2,560 acres for a geothermal plant; the act also specifies that no one entity would be able to lease more than 25,600 acres. Permits and leases are to be granted by the Commission to the highest qualified bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Section 6922 of the Public Resources Code, the source of this litigation, created a bidding preference in favor of a surface owner of land which contains geothermal resources subject to state development. The section provided: \u201cIn case of an application for a permit or lease covering lands which have been sold by the state, subject to a reservation by the state of the geothermal resources thereof, by anyone other than the owner of such lands, the owner shall have six months from the date of service of notice on the owner of such application within which to file his application for a permit or lease. Such notice shall be served by the applicant together with a copy of the application. If the owner exercises his rights hereunder and is a qualified person, his application shall be granted but subject to all the other provisions of this article. If the owner fails to exercise the rights granted by this section, then the owner\u2019s rights hereunder shall thereupon cease and terminate and the original applicant shall be permitted to proceed with his application. [If] In the event that the lands subject to such classification are classified as being within a known geothermal resource area, then, after the commission has determined the highest competitive bid thereon, <em>the owner may </em>within 10 days after notification by the commission <em>submit a bid identical to such highest acceptable bid, in which case the commission shall issue a lease to such surface landowner. </em>If the surface landowner does not file such a bid within such period of time, the commission may proceed with the award of the bid to other than such surface landowner.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Section 6922, which allows a surface owner to make a preemptive bid, was included in the act without any specific accompanying explanation of legislative intent that we have been able to discover.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In the instant case, surface rights to the acreage in question, located in a geothermally rich resource area in Sonoma County, known as \u201cThe Geysers,\u201d were conveyed by the state to defendants Prati and Sink in 1949 and 1950, respectively. In 1953, Prati and Sink quitclaimed their interests to themselves and the other defendants identified herein as the surface owners. On January 1, 1967, all of the surface owners executed an agreement with the Signal Oil Company, thereby leasing the right to develop the geothermal resources; the successor in interest to that agreement is defendant Amin oil U.S.A., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In September 1976, the Commission announced, pursuant to the act, that competitive bidding would be held with respect to a geothermal lease of the acreage in question. In December 1976, defendant Commission determined that plaintiff Post had submitted the highest qualified bid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>offering to pay the state 47.77 percent of the net profits derived from development pursuant to the lease. Then, as provided by Public Resources Code section 6922, the surface owners were notified of plaintiff\u2019s bid, and submitted an identical bid to the Commission; the Commission accepted the identical bid made by the surface owners. The bid, of course, was actually made on behalf of Aminoil, to whom the surface owners were contractually bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Plaintiff, deprived of the lease, brought this action to test the constitutionality of Public Resources Code section 6922, and has appealed from the adverse judgment rendered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Judicial Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In the instant case, the judgment sustaining the demurrers was entered after the trial court had considered not only the contents of the complaint but also materials offered by the parties, of which the trial court took judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">With respect to the question of the sufficiency of the complaint, the appellate standard of review is conducted \u201cby the well settled principles governing the testing of [the complaint\u2019s] sufficiency by demurrer: A demurrer admits all material and issuable facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] However, it does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged therein.\u201d <em>(Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732].)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Judicial notice of a matter means the acceptance by the court of the existence of a matter of law or fact without the necessity of formal proof of that matter. \u201cThe doctrine of judicial notice is an evidentiary doctrine that permits the court to consider <em>as established </em>in a case a matter of <em>law </em>or <em>fact </em>that is relevant to an issue, without the necessity of formal proof of the matter by any party. Judicial notice is a substitute for formal proof. Judicial notice may be taken of either a proposition of <em>law </em>or a proposition of <em>fact. </em>The fundamental theory of judicial notice is that the matter that is judicially noticed is one of law or fact that <em>cannot reasonably be </em>disputed.\u201d (Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (1972) Judicial Notice, \u00a7 47.1, p. 833.) (Italics in original.)  Judicial notice may be taken by the trial court in connection with a demurrer (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.70) and may also be considered by an appellate court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>conducting review. <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241].)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">We have before us the materials judicially noticed below. Primarily, they consist of two major legislative committee reports on geothermal resources,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the \u201cfinal [legislative] history\u201d of the act,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> excerpts from testimony given at public legislative hearings, and some correspondence directed to the Governor\u2019s office recommending his signature on Senate Bill No. 169 (the act) from the legislative analyst, a state agency, and an individual legislator. Judicial notice was properly taken of these materials since they are in the category of \u201c[ojfficial acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United States.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As was explained in the comment by the Law Revision Commission to Evidence Code section 450, such extrinsic aids as legislative committee reports and legislative history are often helpful in assessing constitutional issues raised with respect to a statute. Interpretation of a statute, however, remains a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Plaintiff concedes that both the trial and the appellate court may properly take judicial notice of the type of material that was offered here. Plaintiff, however, disputes the <em>relevance </em>of the material offered, pointing out that none of the material contained <em>specific </em>reference to Public Resources Code section 6922, the provision of which plaintiff complains. Plaintiff argues that, since no specific legislative intent could be determined with respect to section 6922, it was error for the trial court to resolve what plaintiff perceives to be a factual issue\u2014that of legislative intent\u2014without a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">It is true, as plaintiff contends, that none of the materials judicially noticed dealt specifically with the legislative purpose reflected in conferring a \u201cright of first refusal\u201d on surface owners with respect to geothermal leases, thus paving the way for the merger of the property interests involved. Plaintiff, of course, had equal opportunity in the trial court, on its consideration of the demurrer, to produce, along with defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>specifically relevant information if such existed. In the absence of the existence of such information, it is difficult to see how the issue of legislative purpose could be resolved by a factual trial; the opinions of individual legislators as to its purpose, even those closely associated with the challenged enactment, would not be admissible. <em>(In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">It remains a judicial function to interpret the meaning of a statute. Courts utilize the extrinsic aids available in performing this function. Despite the void which exists here as to specific legislative purpose, our task is to draw what inferences may reasonably be drawn from the legislative materials contained in this record, and to consider plaintiff\u2019s two contentions regarding the constitutionality of Public Resources Code section 6922 in light of the established principles of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\n<em>Does Section 6922 Violate the \u201cGift\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\n<em>Prohibition Contained in the California Constitution?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Article XVI, section 6, of the California Constitution prohibits the Legislature from making \u201cany gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever; . . .\u201d Plaintiff contends that Public Resources Code section 6922 violates this provision by conferring upon defendant surface owners, without adequate consideration, the preemptive right to bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">There can be no dispute that the right to first refusal of a geothermal lease is a valuable right, \u201ca thing of value.\u201d In the instant case, defendant surface owners presumably have profited from possession of the right, as the result of their transaction with Signal Oil Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The decisional law interpreting the constitutional prohibition against legislative \u201cgifts\u201d has defined the term \u201cgift,\u201d as employed in the constitutional context, to mean not only a transfer of property without adequate consideration but a transfer made for a private as opposed to a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">In <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Janssen </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 276, 281 [106 P.2d 11, 130 A.L.R. 1141], the court explained that \u201c[i]t is well settled that, in determining whether an appropriation of public funds or property is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>considered a gift, the primary question is whether the funds are to be used for a \u2018public\u2019 or a \u2018private\u2019 purpose. If they are for a \u2018public purpose,\u2019 they are not a gift within the meaning [of the Constitution\u2019s prohibition], [Citations.] <em>The benefit to the state from an expenditure for a \u2018public purpose\u2019 is in the n\u00e1ture of consideration </em>and the funds expended are therefore not a gift <em>even though private persons are benefited therefrom. </em>[Citation.]\u201d (Italics added.) (See, also, <em>Winkelman </em>v. <em>City of Tiburon </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 834, 844-845 [108 Cal.Rptr. 415].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">With this principle in mind, we analyze the rights and procedures established in section 6922, to determine if they reasonably could be regarded as beneficial to the state, thereby serving a legitimate public purpose. <em>(Mannheim </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 678, 691 [91 Cal.Rptr. 585, 478 P.2d 17].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In the \u201cMemorandum of Intended Decision,\u201d the trial court in the instant case expressed the view that the limitation expressed in section 6922 with reference to competitive bidding was not detrimental to any state interest because the surface owner was required to meet the bid made by the outsider; furthermore, the trial court determined that the statutory scheme had been enacted for public purposes, although the specific purposes were not enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We fail to see any advantage to the public by the restriction of competitive bidding that is contained in Public Resources Code section 6922. The public would certainly be benefited in a situation where open competitive bidding for the geothermal lease would produce the highest bid that reasonably could be made, enabling the state to receive the highest rate of return in the form of royalties. But under section 6922, an outsider knows that not only must he expend whatever sums are necessary to arrive at an educated bid for a particular lease but that he must risk loss of the lease if an identical\u2014but favored\u2014bid is made by the surface owner. It is quite likely that if experience demonstrated over any length of time that the preemptive right was being regularly exercised, the inevitable result would be a lessening of interest in such projects by outsiders. Without that interest by outsiders, the state would be faced with a situation where the \u201chighest qualified\u201d bid might also be the only bid, made by the surface owner. We thus can find no benefit to the state here, considered in terms of bidding projects alone, which qualifies as the substitution for consideration required to justify the \u201cgift,\u201d since public rather than private benefit is the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number> Defendants, however, have offered another basis for establishing a public benefit from section 6922. It is contended that the surface owner of land harboring geothermal resources faces considerable detriment to his property interest by development of the resources. This detriment occurs in terms of access and substantial use of the surface, which the surface owner must permit to a lessee or permittee to obtain what lies below. Public Resources Code section 6915 provides that \u201c[s]ubject to the other provisions of this article, the permittee or lessee shall be entitled to use so much of the surface as is reasonably necessary as determined by the commission for the production and conservation of geothermal resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Information gathered by legislative fact-finding (fn. 7, <em>ante) </em>reveals that plants must be constructed near the resources because of the nature of the energy involved; loss of heat would occur if the energy had to be transported for any distance prior to its conversion to usable electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Thus it appears that development of these resources must necessarily have substantial impact on the surface owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Defendants argue that the Legislature was mindful of this detriment to the surface owner, and feared that controversies would erupt between the holders of the various property interests, and that the ultimate result would frustrate the legislative purpose of energy development under optimal conditions. Section 6922, it is argued, was fashioned to encourage merger of the various property interests to lessen the possibility of controversy and litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">This appears to us to be a legitimate state concern. The Legislature certainly sought to minimize the detriment to the surface owner by providing the means by which that owner could retain some control over development and obtain remuneration from those chosen to undertake the development. The benefit to the state lies in the likelihood that the arrangement will promote rather than impede orderly economic growth. The solution to the problem was one the Legislature, in its admittedly broad discretion, was entitled to select. We conclude that the preference extended to surface owners may serve a justifiable public goal, and that the California Constitution has not been violated thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\n<em>Does Section 6922 Deny Plaintiff Equal Protection of the Laws?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Article I, section 7 of the California Constitution, as added in 1974, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] person may not be . . , denied equal protection of the laws. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Plaintiff contends that Public Resources Code section 6922 establishes an unconstitutional classification of surface owners as the preferred recipients of geothermal leases, and that this classification has denied to him his constitutional right of equal protection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">We review briefly the principles applicable to such a contention. It was explained in <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 597 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241], that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has employed a two-level test for measuring legislative classifications against the equal protection clause. \u2018In the area of economic regulation, the high court has exercised restraint, investing legislation with a presumption of constitutionality and requiring merely that distinctions drawn by a challenged statute bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. . . .\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">We perceive section 6922 as an example of economic regulation. \u201cThere is no constitutional requirement of uniform treatment. [Citations.] Legislative classification is permissible when made for a lawful state purpose and when the classification bears a rational relationship to that purpose. [Citations.] \u2018Wide discretion is vested in the Legislature in making the classification and every presumption is in favor of the validity of the statute; the decision of the Legislature as to what is a sufficient distinction to warrant the classification will not be overthrown by the courts unless it is palpably arbitrary. . . . [Citations.] <em>A distinction in legislation is not arbitrary if any set of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it? </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Horman </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 62, 75 [95 Cal.Rptr. 433, 485 P.2d 785].) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>We have previously discussed herein the legitimate state interest which supports the preferential classification established in Public Resources Code section 6922 for surface owners such as the defendants herein. The Legislature\u2019s purpose was to encourage the creation of a new industry and the growth of energy production under optimum conditions. To that end, the Legislature perceived a rational relationship between its goal and the merging of property interests in land where the energy source was located.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We find that there is an important state interest in giving a preference to surface owners in bidding for geothermal leases, and that the classification made by Public Resources Code section 6922 significantly furthers this important state interest. Plaintiff\u2019s equal protection contention must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Kingsley, Acting P.
