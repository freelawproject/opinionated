J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment denying his petition for a writ of mandate to compel defendant school district to appoint him as a probationary teacher. Upon the filing of the petition, an alternative writ and order to show cause were issued. A hearing was held, after which the trial court entered a minute order indicating that plaintiff had no clear right to the requested relief. The court made findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered judgment denying the petition for a peremptory writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The facts as stipulated to by parties at the hearing can be summarized as follows: Plaintiff has a valid elementary school teaching credential issued by the State of California. Initially, he was hired by defendant school district as a \u201cday-to-day substitute\u201d in September 1974. In October 1974, defendant hired plaintiff as a \u201clong-term substitute.\u201d Later in the same school year in January of 1975, defendant again changed plaintiff\u2019s employment status, hiring him as a \u201ctemporary employee.\u201d As a result of these employment actions, plaintiff served more than 75 percent of the number of days school was maintained by the district for the 1974-1975 school year. Thus, he became eligible for appointment as a probationary teacher pursuant to Education Code section 44918<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the ensuing school year should there be any vacant positions in the school district for which he was certified and qualified to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Plaintiff and 35 other employees of the school district met the conditions of section 44918 and were thereby eligible for reemployment for the following year to fill vacant classroom teaching positions. There were 28 vacant teaching positions in the district for the school year 1975-1976. Defendant filled 3 of these 28 positions with teachers who did not meet the criteria of section 44918 and thus were not eligible for employment. This left 25 vacant teaching positions which defendant filled by hiring 25 of the 36 teachers qualifying for reemployment under section 44918. Plaintiff and 10 other eligible teachers were not hired as probationaiy employees by defendant. Of those 25 eligible teachers who were hired, 2 had acceptance dates of employment as long-term substitutes or temporary teachers later than plaintiff\u2019s acceptance date so that plaintiff was \u201csenior\u201d to them in this type of employment with the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Besides the facts stipulated to above, it was stipulated, in effect, that evidence in the form of a declaration by the administrator of personnel services for the district may be considered by the court. The administrator stated that the 25 qualified teachers who were chosen for employment from the pool of 36 eligible teachers were selected \u201con the basis of qualification, experience and performance,. . .\u201d He also declared that he had offered plaintiff the opportunity to interview for a full-time teaching position at a \u201cyear-round\u201d school in the district, but that plaintiff had indicated to him that he was not interested in the position. It was also stipulated that if called to testify, plaintiff would deny that he was ever given such an opportunity and that he would testify that he wanted a teaching position and would have accepted a position had it been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The court made findings in accordance with the stipulated facts and further found that the persons employed to fill the 28 vacant positions for the 1975-1976 school year were chosen on the basis of their qualifications, experience and performance and not upon seniority; that plaintiff failed to show that he would have been selected for one of the three positions which were filled by persons not meeting the criteria of section 44918; that plaintiff was afforded an opportunity to be interviewed for a teaching position at a \u201cyear-round school\u201d (Plavan School) but that plaintiff informed the administrator of personnel services that he was not interested in teaching at Plavan; and that plaintiff was employed as a substitute teacher for the 1975-1976 school year. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the reasonableness of the district\u2019s decision not to hire plaintiff to fill one of the 25 vacant positions for the 1975-1976 school year and that notwithstanding the district\u2019s employment of 3 persons who had not served 75 percent of the school days for 1974-1975, there was no substantial evidence that plaintiff would have been selected for one of those positions. Judgment was entered denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On appeal plaintiff contends that he is entitled to be hired as a probationary teacher because the school district violated its ministerial duty to appoint only those in the pool of teachers eligible under section 44918 to vacant teaching positions in the district. He also argues for rehiring on the ground he was senior to two qualified teachers reemployed by the district and that the provisions for reappointment according to seniority found in other sections of the Education Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>applied to section 44918. Finally, plaintiff maintains that three findings of fact made by the trial court were not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Defendant responds that plaintiff made no showing that he would have been offered one of the three positions given to the ineligible teachers; that the district properly exercised its discretion in choosing employees for rehiring from the pool of eligibles; that the Education Code does not mandate the use of seniority in appointing substitute and temporary teachers to probationary status; and that the findings of fact are indeed supported by substantial evidence. We agree and conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the district to appoint plaintiff as a probationary teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Generally, for a writ of mandate to issue, two basic requirements are essential, namely, a clear, present and usually ministerial duty on the part of defendant and a clear, present and beneficial right in plaintiff to performance of that duty. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado, 5 </em>Cal.3d 480, 491 [96 Cal.Rptr. 553, 487 P.2d 1193]; <em>Gong </em>v. <em>City of Fremont, 250 </em>Cal.App.2d 568, 572 [58 Cal.Rptr. 664].)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In the case at bench, the parties stipulated and the trial court found that the school district violated its ministerial duty under section 44918 to appoint eligible temporary and long-term substitute teachers to vacant positions as probationary employees by appointing unqualified personnel to three vacant positions,  However, the party who seeks a writ of mandate has the burden of proving that the official body which fails to perform an act has thus violated its duty toward him by denying him a clear and present right. (See <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Williams, 222 </em>Cal.App.2d 193, 196-197 [35 Cal.Rptr. 35]; <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>66 Cal.App.2d 640, 643-644 [152 P.2d 517]; Cal. Civil Writs (Cent. Ed. Bar 1970) \u00a7 17.17, pp. 413-414.)  Plaintiff made no showing that he would have been offered one of the three positions filled by unqualified</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>teachers and thus has not carried his burden of proving that he was entitled to one of those three jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">A writ of mandate will also lie to correct an abuse of the discretion vested in a court, official or board, though it will not lie to control the exercise of the discretion reposed in those bodies. <em>(Manjares </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>64 Cal.2d 365, 370 [49 Cal.Rptr. 805, 411 P.2d 901]; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>16 Cal.2d 260, 265 [105 P.2d 975]; <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Antonetti, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 283, 286 [50 Cal.Rptr. 370].) In such a case the party seeking the writ must make some showing that the body invested with discretion has acted arbitrarily, capriciously, fraudulently, or without due regard for his rights and that the action was prejudicial to him. <em>(Hogan </em>v. <em>Retirement Board, etc., </em>13 Cal.App.2d 676, 677 [57 P.2d 520]; <em>Mogan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commrs., </em>100 Cal.App. 270, 276 [279 P. 1080]; Cal. Civil Writs (Cont. Ed. Bar 1970) \u00a7 17.18, p. 414.)  Here, the school district exercised its discretion in choosing which of the 36 eligible teachers would be offered the 25 vacant positions. An administrator for the district stated and the court found that the district used \u201cqualification, experience and performance\u201d as criteria in its selections. Plaintiff made no showing that the district\u2019s actions toward him were in any way arbitrary or capricious; he has thus failed to prove that the district abused its discretion in hiring the teachers from the pool of eligibles.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Plaintiff also maintains that the school district violated its duties to him through not holding a lottery and establishing a seniority system among temporary and long-term substitute teachers, so that such teachers would be appointed to vacant probationary positions on the basis of seniority. He argues that though section 44918 does not mandate a seniority system for temporary and long-term substitute teachers, the fact that numerous other statutes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> establish a seniority system for probationary and permanent teachers means that we should find that such a system exists for temporaries and substitutes. We cannot agree with this reasoning.  The role of the courts is not to legislate or to rewrite the law, but to interpret what is before them. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; <em>Estate of Tkachuk, </em>73 Cal.App.3d 14, 18 [139 Cal.Rptr. 55]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>122 Cal.App.2d 551, 554 [265 P.2d 115].)  Moreover, \u201c\u2018Where a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>19 Cal.3d 749, 755 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>28 Cal.2d 121, 142 [169 P.2d 1].) In the case at bench, the fact that detailed seniority systems are set out statutorily for other groups of school employees, but not for temporary and substitute teachers, indicates to us that the Legislature did not intend for their rehiring as probationary employees to be governed by seniority. We conclude that the school district did not wrong plaintiff by hiring two teachers from the eligible pool who had acceptance dates for temporary employment later than his.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Finally, plaintiff contends that three of the findings of fact made by the trial court are not supported by the evidence.  The scope of appellate review of findings of fact is well established. \u201c \u2018When a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial evidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the finding of fact.\u2019 \u201d (Original italics; <em>Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362], quoting from <em>Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 693 [299 P.2d 231]; <em>Estate of Bristol, </em>23 Cal.2d 221, 223 [143 P.2d 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The first finding to which plaintiff objects is finding number ll.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His contention that this finding is unsupported by the evidence is inexplicable since the finding is among the facts stipulated to by the parties at the beginning of the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   Next, plaintiff contends that there is absolutely no evidence to support finding number 17 which states that persons selected by the district to fill the vacant positions for the 1975-1976 school year were chosen on the basis of \u201cqualification, experience and performance, . . .\u201d The record contains, however, a declaration by the district\u2019s personnel administrator which states specifically that these criteria were indeed the basis for the hiring decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Last, plaintiff argues that finding number 13, which establishes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>reason plaintiff was not hired as a probationary teacher was because the number of eligible teachers exceeded the number of vacant positions, is unsupported by the evidence. There is ample evidence to support this explanation for plaintiff\u2019s not being rehired, including the facts stipulated to by the parties and the district administrator\u2019s declaration. We conclude that plaintiff\u2019s contentions concerning the lack of evidentiary support for the findings of fact are unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The trial court did not err in denying a peremptory writ of mandamus. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Kaufman, J., and McDaniel, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 13, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">All code references herein are to the Education Code unless otherwise indicated.
