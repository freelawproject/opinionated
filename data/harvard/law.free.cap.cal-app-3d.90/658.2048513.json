(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The sole issue is whether the trial court based its sentencing determinations on incorrect data when it declared that defendant was ineligible for probation under Penal Code section 1203, subdivision (d). (See <em>In re Huddleston </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1031, 1037 [80 Cal.Rptr. 595, 458 P.2d 507].) We have concluded that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The relevant portions of section 1203, subdivision (d), read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c(d) Except in unusual cases where the interests of justice would best be served if the person is granted probation, probation shall not be granted to any of the following persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201c(1) Unless he had a lawful right to carry a deadly weapon, other than a firearm, at the time of the perpetration of the crime or his arrest, any person who has been convicted of arson, robbery, burglary, burglary with explosives, rape with force or violence, murder, assault with intent to commit murder, attempt to commit murder, trainwrecking, kidnapping, escape from the state prison, or a conspiracy to commit one or more of such crimes and was armed with such weapon at either of such times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c(4) Any person who has been previously convicted twice in this state of a felony or in any other place of a public offense which, if committed in this state, would have been punishable as a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201c(6) Any person who has been previously convicted once in this state of a felony or in any other place of a public offense which, if committed in this state, would have been punishable as a felony, if he committed any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\u201c(i) Unless he had a lawful right to carry a deadly weapon at the time of the perpetration of such previous crime or his arrest for such previous crime, he was armed with such weapon at either of such times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201c(ii) He used or attempted to use a deadly weapon upon a human being in connection with the perpetration of such previous crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Although there is some uncertainty in the record before us, it appears that defendant was convicted in February 1970 of at least one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and possibly two counts of first degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), and of attempted kidnapping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207), possession of a sawed-off shotgun (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12020), and possibly assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245). The record is certain as to at least three prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The sentencing court declared defendant ineligible for probation pursuant to subdivisions (d)(1) and (d)(4). He erred as to subdivision (d)(1), as there was no showing that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the current offense. The court was correct as to subdivision (d)(4), however.  Defendant argues that the \u201cclear\u201d legislative intent was to make ineligible under this subdivision only those persons whose convictions arose out of separate transactions as distinguished from a single transaction. Assuming arguendo that a single transaction was involved, we discern no such legislative intent. (Cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 654.) The subdivision speaks of any person \u201cwho has been previously convicted twice in this state of a felony.\u201d Defendant has been so convicted, and absent any authority to the contrary, subdivision (d)(4) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Defendant concedes that subdivision (d)(6) applies to him. Thus, he was ineligible under two subdivisions. The fact the trial court felt he was ineligible under subdivision (d)(1) instead of (d)(6) is irrelevant. The point remains that the court felt defendant was ineligible under two subdivisions and that the interests of justice did not warrant a grant of probation as an \u201cunusual case.\u201d These conclusions were adequately supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Before Racanelli.
