Code, \u00a7 288a) and burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We summarize the relevant evidence as it was presented at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The victim of the charged offenses was one Olivia, a 17-year-old emotionally disturbed black girl who was undergoing treatment at a publicly operated rehabilitation center. Rodgers, a black man well-known to Olivia, was employed by the center as a houseparent of a residential unit occupied by emotionally disturbed boys. Olivia had been assigned to a room of a \u201cco-ed\u201d unit some distance away. One evening while she was heavily medicated a black man entered her room and forced her to copulate his penis. The female houseparent of the unit observed Rodgers leaving the unit from the direction of Olivia\u2019s room. Soon after, the door of Olivia\u2019s room opened and she exclaimed that she had been \u201craped.\u201d She could not, or at least did not, identify her attacker. When her houseparent suggested that it was \u201cSonny\u201d (the nickname by which Rodgers was known) Olivia replied, \u201cOh no, not Sonny. We\u2019re so tight.\u201d A police investigation disclosed Rodgers\u2019 fingerprints on or near a malfunctioning latch of the window of Olivia\u2019s room. Rodgers was arrested and charged with the sex offense and with the burglary resulting from his entering the room with the requisite intent to commit a felony. At Rodgers\u2019 trial Olivia positively identified him as her attacker. She also testified that when questioned by the police following the criminal incident she told them that Rodgers was the offender; this was denied by the police officers who had responded to the scene. But for her trial testimony, there was no evidence whatever that Olivia had been able at the time to identify her attacker. At the trial Olivia explained that she \u201cbecame sure\u201d that Rodgers was the culprit when she \u201chad time to look over the descriptions, read over the preliminary trial papers [and] I\u2019ve had time to think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Other evidence at the trial indicated that Olivia\u2019s houseparent, who had identified Rodgers as the person who came out of Olivia\u2019s room at the time, entertained a strong <em>animus </em>toward him. She had accused him of causing her to be disciplined by loss of a week\u2019s pay (an accusation apparently conceded by all as true) and had said, \u201cIf it\u2019s the last thing I do, I\u2019m going to fix Sonny Rodgers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In respect of the fingerprints near the latch of Olivia\u2019s window, evidence was produced by Rodgers that he had, before the incident at issue, attempted to repair the defective piece of hardware.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Rodgers did not testify at his trial. He had previously been convicted of the felony of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We find merit in Rodgers\u2019 contention of prejudicial misconduct on the part of the prosecutor, Mr. Flippen. As a result of that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Such misconduct pervaded the trial. We select some highlights from the prosecutor\u2019s jury argument. \u201c[Y]ou have to pause and you have to say, is Mr. Rodgers here because he\u2019s not guilty?\u201d \u201cIn fact, as you well know, most people go through their lives without being accused of anything\u201d; \u201cif you have any doubts about the case, I want you to ask yourself this: Knowing what you know now, would you want him to babysit for your teenage daughter, huh?\u201d (Speaking of defense testimony) \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. . . . She\u2019s trying to cover for him. I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Such insinuations\u2014that because the accused is \u201chere\u201d in court, he must be guilty, that doubts of his guilt should be resolved against him because he appears unfitted as a babysitter, and that the prosecutor (representing a prestigious public office) is personally convinced that certain contested evidence is true\u2014are to be roundly condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> Just as grievous is what we find to be a blatant violation of the well-known rule of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], proscribing prosecutorial comment on the failure of one criminally accused to testify on his own behalf. At the trial\u2019s start, on voir dire of the jury, the prosecutor speculated whether \u201cMr. Rodgers [would] decide to take the stand,\u201d and stated that if the trial produced an evidentiary conflict \u201call a person would have to say is, T didn\u2019t do it.\u2019 \u201d And following Rodgers\u2019 failure to testify, in the prosecutor\u2019s jury argument he continued throughout with such comments as: \u201c[NJobody who has testified here has told you that he didn\u2019t do it\u201d; \u201cNobody has said Sonny Rodgers didn\u2019t do that to Olivia\u201d; \u201cNobody told you that that didn\u2019t happen\u201d; \u201cnobody has told you ... the act did not occur\u201d; and, \u201cnobody has even suggested that she voluntarily entered into these things.\u201d And then the prosecutor concluded: <em>\u201cSimply because he exercises those </em>[Fifth Amendment] <em>constitutional protections </em>does not mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>he\u2019s innocent, does not mean that you are supposed to find him not guilty.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Generally the prosecutor\u2019s transparent misconduct was objected to, and generally the trial court appropriately admonished the jury or directed that the subject discussion be ended. Such shortcomings as there may have been in continued objections were cured by the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 647 (last sentence). And the prosecutor generally persisted in his misconduct despite the objections and the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We observe further that the People\u2019s appellate brief commendably makes no real contention that prosecutorial misconduct was not rampant at the trial. Instead it is argued that the case was not \u201cclosely balanced\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ney, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 785, 790 [48 Cal.Rptr. 265]), that the trial court\u2019s frequent admonitions cured any prejudice <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berryman, </em>6 Cal.2d 331, 337 [57 P.2d 136]), that there was no \u201c \u2018dishonest act or an attempt to persuade the court or jury, by use of deceptive or reprehensible methods\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beivelman, </em>70 Cal.2d 60, 75 [73 Cal.Rptr. 521, 447 P.2d 913] [cert. den., 406 U.S. 971], and that in any event the misconduct was \u201charmless\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] [cert. den., 355 U.S. 846 (2 L.Ed.2d 55, 78 S.Ct. 70)]). We are told, \u201cViewed together with these principles, each of [Rodgers\u2019] assignments of misconduct is either insubstantial or nonprejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We conclude that as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s reprehensible conduct, Rodgers was denied the fair trial guaranteed him by the due process clauses of the federal and state Constitutions. (See <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 540 [14 L.Ed.2d 543, 548-549, 85 S.Ct. 1628]; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45 [77 L.Ed. 158, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>47 Cal.2d 311, 319 [303 P.2d 329].) It is idle for us to speculate whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct resulted from ignorance of the law and his official duties, or was a \u201cdishonest act or an attempt to persuade the court or jury, by use of deceptive or reprehensible methods.\u201d Under either circumstance the <em>unfair </em>trial and the resultant conviction and punishment of the accused is an outrage, and the insult to our system of criminal justice, intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cFewer judgments would have to be reversed if the trial courts were more firm in controlling the comparatively few prosecutors who need restraint.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 467, 472 [200 P.2d 867].)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
