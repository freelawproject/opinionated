He commenced an action against defendant Concord Gardens Mobile Home Park, Ltd. (Concord Gardens), and others, to recover money owed him for services as such a contractor. Its first count sought to establish and foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien; its second was for the reasonable value of materials and labor furnished \u201cat the special instance and request of defendant . . . .\u201d The first cause of action was dismissed for reasons unrelated to this appeal, but on the second count the contractor recovered judgment for $7,349.19. Concord Gardens alone has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Concord Gardens first contends: \u201cThe court erred by not dismissing the second cause of action for failure to comply with Business and Professions Code section 7018.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Business and Professions Code section 7018 provides: \u201cOn or before June 30, 1966, the board shall prescribe a form entitled \u2018Notice\u2019 which shall describe the pertinent provisions of this state\u2019s lien laws. Each contractor licensed under this chapter, prior to receiving from the owner of property or his agent any payment for work for which a contractor\u2019s license is required, shall give a copy of this \u2018Notice\u2019 to the payor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The \u201cboard\u201d had timely prescribed such a \u201cform entitled \u2018Notice,\u2019 \u201d and the contractor had neglected to give a copy of it to Concord Gardens. Concord Gardens contends that such notice was a statutory condition precedent to the contractor\u2019s action, which accordingly should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">It will be seen that Concord Gardens\u2019 proposed construction of section 7018 would impose a forfeiture upon the contractor. \u201cThe law traditionally disfavors forfeitures and statutes imposing them are to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co., </em>5 Cal.3d 898, 906 [98 Cal.Rptr. 57, 489 P.2d 1385]; and see <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Irwin, 69 </em>Cal.App.3d 317, 322 [138 Cal.Rptr. 9]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Surety Ins. Co., </em>30 Cal.App.3d 75, 79 [106 Cal.Rptr. 220].)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Such a forfeiture, or threat of it, is unnecessary in order to enforce, or otherwise give effect to, section 7018. Section 7115 of the Business and Professions Code provides that failure in any material respect to comply with the Contractors License Law constitutes a cause for disciplinary action thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Further, it is observed that the Contractors License Law\u2019s section 7031 provides that no contractor such as the plaintiff Gonzales, \u201cmay bring or maintain any action\u201d to recover compensation for services as a contractor \u201cwithout alleging and proving that he was a duly licensed contractor ....\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There the forfeiture provision is <em>expressly </em>stated, and it will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>enforced by the courts. (See <em>Lewis &amp; Queen </em>v. <em>N.M. Ball Sons, </em>48 Cal.2d 141, 151 [308 P.2d 713]; <em>Rushing </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>61 Cal.App.3d 597, 605 [130 Cal.Rptr. 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">It is of course the general rule that one may bring an action for breach of contract, or for the reasonable value of labor and materials furnished at another\u2019s request. The Contractors License Law however, and as noted, has <em>expressly </em>provided by section 7031 that an unlicensed contractor may not maintain such an action. But the same law, for violation of section 7018, imposes no similar harsh sanction. The doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>must reasonably be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201cIf a statute enumerates the persons or things to be affected by its provisions, there is an implied exclusion of others, and if a statute specifies one exception to a general rule [here the right to maintain an action for labor and materials furnished], other exceptions or effects are excluded; ... It is an elementary rule of construction that the expression of one excludes the other. And it is equally well settled that the court is without power to supply an omission.\u201d <em>(Estate of Pardue, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 178, 180-181 [70 P.2d 678].) \u201cUnder the familiar maxim of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>it is well settled that, when a statute expresses certain exceptions to a general rule, other exceptions are necessarily excluded.\u201d <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>City &amp; Co. of S. F., </em>112 Cal.App.2d 719, 731 [247 P.2d 362]; and see <em>Wildlife Alive </em>v. <em>Chickering, </em>18 Cal.3d 190, 195 [132 Cal.Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537]; <em>McGahey </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>109 Cal. 63, 69 [41 P. 817]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 567, 571-572 [20 Cal.Rptr. 227].) And a statutory \u201cdeclaration that the court had power . . . to dismiss an action upon the conditions prescribed implied the negative of the power to dismiss unless such conditions existed.\u201d <em>(Johnston </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>167 Cal. 260, 264-265 [139 P. 86].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Under these principles we hold that Business and Professions Code section 7018 does not deprive a contractor who violates its direction of the right to bring and maintain an action on contract, or for services, as such a contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Concord Gardens\u2019 next contention is; \u201cPlaintiff was precluded from bringing the second cause of action for failure to comply with Business and Professions Code section 7030.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Section 7030 provides: \u201c(a) Eveiy person licensed pursuant to this chapter shall include the following statement in prominent type on all written contracts with respect to which such person is a prime contractor: Contractors are required by law to be licensed and regulated by the Contractors\u2019 State License Board. Any questions concerning a contractor may be referred to the registrar of the board whose address is</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\u201cContractors\u2019 State License Board 1020 N Street</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Sacramento, California 95814</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">\u201c(b) For the purposes of subdivision (a), \u2018prominent type\u2019 means at least 10-point boldface type, and in no event type less than two points larger than the type in any other portion of the written contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">The contractor\u2019s now dismissed first cause of action was based upon a written contract in which the \u201cinclusion\u201d required by section 7030 was omitted. Concord Gardens here makes the same argument as was made in respect of section 7018.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">For the reasons expressed in part I above this contention is also found invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">The remaining appellate contention is expressed in this manner: \u201cThere was insufficient evidence to establish the reasonable value of plaintiff\u2019s services and labor rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\"> Without objection, at the trial the contractor testified that \u201cit cost me\u201d \u201cfor the finishers and the laborers in this sum shown here, $5,006.76,\u201d and that the \u201ctotal shown here for the equipment rented is $1,591.43,\u201d and is \u201ccorrect.\u201d Another qualified witness testified that the $7,349.19 charge of the contractor was \u201ca fair and reasonable charge for the work and material done and performed by him,\u201d and \u201cAs a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>fact, 15 percent overhead is very, very low. I don\u2019t know of anyone doing it for that.\u201d Such testimony was substantial evidence of \u201cthe reasonable value of plaintiff\u2019s services and labor rendered.\u201d The instant contention also is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">For these several reasons the judgment of the superior court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-11\">The full text of Business and Professions Code section 7031: \u201cNo person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or maintain any action in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>or contract for which a license is required by this chapter without alleging and proving that he was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of such act or contract, except that such prohibition shall not apply to contractors who are each individually licensed under this chapter but who fail to comply with Section 7029.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
