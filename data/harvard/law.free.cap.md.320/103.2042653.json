At issue is the extent of the immunity of Governors of Maryland when an alleged tort is based upon their vetoing or approving legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tion. For the reasons set forth below we hold, as a matter of Maryland common law, that the immunity applicable to the gubernatorial veto/approval function is, civilly, as complete an immunity as that which protects members of the General Assembly when voting for or against legislative bills. Under that type of immunity damages in tort may not be awarded against either a Governor or a member of the legislature based upon what a court or jury believes were the motives underlying the public official\u2019s exercise of these functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellees, James F. O\u2019Hara, III and Michael P. O\u2019Hara (the O\u2019Haras), are the remaining plaintiffs in this suit which was instituted in 1978. They were stockholders in the corporation which owned the Marlboro racetrack. Their complaint now consists of one count alleging that common law deceit was practiced upon them in the December 31, 1971, sale of their Marlboro stock. In a previous appeal in this case, we reversed a summary judgment in favor of the defendants based on limitations. <em>O\u2019Hara v. Kovens, </em>305 Md. 280, 503 A.2d 1313 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Defendants in this action (collectively, the Kovens Group) include former Governor Marvin Mandel, the instant appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Certain undisputed background facts are set forth in <em>O\u2019Hara.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cPrior to, or during, the 1971 session of the Maryland General Assembly, Marlboro and an entity (Hagerstown) which also conducted horse racing with parimutuel betting had agreed that Hagerstown would sell to Marlboro eighteen racing days theretofore utilized for the Hagerstown meeting. Those eighteen days, together with eighteen days previously allocated to Marlboro, would allow thirty-six days of racing by Marlboro. Transfer of the Hagerstown days was subject to legislative approval. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Approval at either the 1971 or 1972 session of the Maryland General Assembly would have satisfied the approval condition in the contract. H.B. 1128, enacted at the 1971 legislative session, conferred the necessary approval. On May 28,1971, then Governor Mandel, expressing concerns about the wisdom and constitutionality of the legislation, vetoed H.B. 1128. Following the sale by the plaintiffs of their stock in Marlboro the General Assembly on January 12, 1972, overrode the veto____ In December 1972 Marlboro merged with another corporation (Bowie) which conducted horse racing with parimutuel betting at the Bowie racetrack. On November 24, 1975, the federal government filed indictments against Governor Mandel and others ... of the Kovens Group.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">305 Md. at 283-85, 503 A.2d at 1314-16 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Our opinion in the earlier appeal explained the theory of the plaintiffs\u2019 case to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">\u201cthat there was a conspiracy between Governor Mandel and others of the Kovens Group which antedated May 28, 1971. Plaintiffs in essence contend that the alleged conspirators planned (1) to have the Mandel veto depress the value of Marlboro stock below the price it would have commanded had H.B. 1128 been signed into law, (2) to acquire the stock at a depressed price, and then (3) to restore its value by having Governor Mandel \u2018himself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>through his agents\u2019 induce the General Assembly to override the veto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 286, 503 A.2d at 1316. On that previous appeal the only issue related exclusively to the limitations defense. We were not presented any issues concerned \u201cwith the sufficiency of any undisputed facts to prove any element of plaintiffs\u2019 deceit theory, or whether any alleged facts, if proved, would establish a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">After our remand Governor Mandel moved for summary judgment on the ground of absolute immunity. The trial court denied that motion. Governor Mandel noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and sought a stay which that court granted. He also petitioned this Court for certiorari. We issued the writ prior to any determination on the merits by the Court of Special Appeals in order to decide this question of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The parties agree that a Governor of Maryland, if performing gubernatorial duties involving the exercise of discretion, enjoys a degree of public official immunity. They disagree over whether an absolute or qualified immunity applies here. An absolute immunity from tort liability \u201cstands even if the official acts in bad faith, or with malice or corrupt motives.\u201d <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, </em>\u00a7 132, at 1057 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted) (Prosser). \u201c[Qualified immunity is usually destroyed by \u2018malice,\u2019 bad faith or improper purpose[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1059-60 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Absolute \u201cimmunity protects both judges and legislators, so long as their acts are \u2018judicial\u2019 or legislative in nature and within the very general scope of their jurisdiction.\u201d Prosser at 1056-57 (footnotes omitted). And <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 895D, comment <em>c, </em>at 412 (1977) (a judge or a legislator \u201cis not liable for [that official\u2019s] discretionary acts or omissions even though [the official] is found to have acted with malicious or other improper motives\u201d). \u201cThe policy is to free the officer from the necessity of submitting [the officer\u2019s] purposes, motives and beliefs to the uncertain appraisal of juries or even judges.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Determining immunity defenses at any given point across the wide range of various duties performed by the vast numbers of officials and employees in the executive branch of federal, state and local governments is by no means as relatively clear-cut as determining legislative and judicial immunities. The Restatement's attempt at generalization is that \u201c[a] high-level executive officer is usually accorded the same type of immunity as that given the judge and for the same reasons.\u201d \u00a7 895D, comment <em>d, </em>at 413. The high-level executive must feel free to make discretionary decisions \u201cwithout being subject to influence by the threat of a harassing suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Immunity \u201cis not confined to the executive officials who are at the highest level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There are many situations, some giving rise to absolute immunity, others qualified immunity and still others only a defense based on reasonableness of the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 413-15. Prosser\u2019s attempt at generalization is that, in most states, officials and employees of the executive department, with respect to state law claims against them, \u201cenjoy no immunity at all for ministerial acts and only a qualified immunity on matters calling for the officer\u2019s discretion.\u201d Prosser, at 1059 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In the case before us Governor Mandel attempts to avoid the thicket which is the law of immunities resting solely on executive department duties. One of his arguments is that the veto/approval function is a legislative function, so that a Maryland Governor is protected civilly in that function by an absolute immunity, as are legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We also granted certiorari on whether the order denying the motion for summary judgment is appealable. It is. We shall first explain our resolution of the immunity questions and then appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The decisions of this Court neither compel nor foreclose the conclusion that a Governor of Maryland has an absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>civil immunity when vetoing or approving legislation. The occasion to consider that issue simply has not arisen. But some discussion of absolute versus qualified immunity for executive department officials of lesser rank than Governor does appear in our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">When a mayor of Baltimore City ordered a painting removed from a municipal museum, the artist sued the mayor alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>interference with contractual relations, libel and slander. The mayor argued absolute immunity or privilege, and the trial court sustained a demurrer. In <em>Walker v. D\u2019Alesandro, </em>212 Md. 163, 129 A.2d 148 (1957), this Court, speaking through Chief Judge Brune, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cThe basis for immunity from liability by reason of privilege is that a public or social interest is to be served by according the privilege; and as Professor Prosser observes <em>([Prosser, Torts </em>(2d ed. 1955)], \u00a7 16), \u2018The sliding scale by which the law balances the interests of the parties to accomplish a social purpose is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of privilege.\u2019 An absolute privilege is accorded to judicial proceedings and to legislative proceedings and to the activities of high executive officers____ As to executive officers, see <em>Spalding v. Vilas, </em>161 U.S. 483 [16 S.Ct. 631, 40 L.Ed. 780] (U.S. Postmaster General) and <em>Matson v. Margiotti, </em>371 Pa. 188, 88 A.2d 892 (State Attorney General).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A55\"><em>Id. </em>at 169-70, 129 A.2d at 151. The Court assumed, without holding, that an absolute privilege would be accorded to the holder of the office of Mayor of Baltimore City, but concluded \u201cthat none of the acts complained of ... are within the actual field of the defendant\u2019s powers or duties as Mayor or so closely related thereto as to be entitled to an absolute privilege____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 129 A.2d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">A contrast between federal law at the time and Maryland law was presented in <em>Carr v. Watkins, </em>227 Md. 578, 177 A.2d 841 (1962). The plaintiff had been discharged from his job as a security guard at a shopping center allegedly because of untrue, derogatory information communicated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the employer by the defendants. One defendant was a security officer at the Naval Ordinance Laboratory where the plaintiff had previously worked, and the two remaining-defendants were Montgomery County police officers. The suit alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>slander, invasion of privacy and malicious interference with contract. The action was dismissed on demurrer, and this Court reversed. Federal law controlled the claim against the federal security officer, and that law \u201cpredicated immunity on whether the act complained of was within the scope of the official\u2019s duties rather than [on] the official\u2019s rank in the governmental hierarchy.\u201d 227 Md. at 584, 177 A.2d. at 844 (footnote omitted).. Determining the federal officer\u2019s duties required evidence. As to the Montgomery County police officers, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">\u201c[T]his Court has shown reluctance to extend absolute privilege or immunity from liability for torts to government officers of a higher rank than these defendants. <em>Walker v. D\u2019Alesandro, </em>212 Md. 163 [129 A.2d 148]; <em>Maurice v. Worden, </em>54 Md, 233[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Id. </em>at. 585, 177 A.2d at 844-45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The defendants in <em>Eliason v. Funk, </em>233 Md. 351, 196 A.2d. 887 (1964), were the Chairman of the State Roads Commission and the Commissioner of State Personnel. They had allegedly conspired to cause the plaintiff\u2019s discharge from state classified service, with one defendant placing charges against the plaintiff and the other accepting perjured testimony at an administrative hearing. This Court noted holdings \u201cthat judges have an absolute privilege from suits arising out of their judicial acts,\u201d and that \u201c[pjrosecutors in judicial hearings ar\u00e9 afforded the sarnie privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 196 A.2d at 889-90. ' The Court recognized that \u201c[t]he Maryland cases seem to indicate that discretionary action will be protected only in the absence of malice.\u201d Touching upon a functional approach to immunity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the Court said: \u201cBut the instant case is much closer factually to the cases dealing with judicial actions, where there is a right to review, than to the discretionary acts of law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356-57,196 A.2d at 890. It was unnecessary, however, to hold that the privilege was absolute in <em>Eliason </em>because the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to permit even an inference of bad faith or malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>Robinson v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>262 Md. 342, 278 A.2d 71 (1971), was an action for false arrest and battery against two police officers and the county which employed them. The police officers had prevailed with an immunity defense but this Court reversed, holding that the defense had not been raised by the proper procedure. Anticipating that the proper procedure would be used on remand, this Court gave guidance to the trial court. After referring to the refusal in <em>Carr v. Watkins, supra, </em>to move toward absolute privilege as then applied by the Supreme Court, this Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cWe think our own rule is sound. Indeed we can not think of any reason why a public official should not be held responsible for his malicious actions even though he claims they were done within the scope of his discretionary authority. Other jurisdictions have so held, Prosser, <em>supra </em>at 1016, and we do so here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">262 Md. at 348, 278 A.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">None of the executive official, civil immunity cases to come before this Court, however, has dealt with the Governor, and, thus, none has dealt with that official\u2019s relations with the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Public official immunity invoked by a legislator in defense of criminal charges was considered in <em>Blondes v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 165, 294 A.2d 661 (1972), an opinion authored for the court by Chief Judge Murphy. Blondes, a member of the House of Delegates, had been convicted of bribery. The conviction was reversed because of violations of Maryland Declaration of Rights, art. 10 (\u201cThat freedom of speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and debate, or proceedings in the Legislature, ought not to be impeached in any Court of Judicature.\u201d) and of Maryland Constitution, art. Ill, \u00a7 18 (\u201cNo Senator or Delegate shall be liable in any civil action, or criminal prosecution, whatever, for words spoken in debate.\u201d). Under interpretations of the speech and debate clause of the federal constitution in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>383 U.S. 169, 86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681 (1966) and in <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>408 U.S. 501, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507 (1972), the trial court should have precluded the prosecution from proving certain parliamentary motions and votes by Blondes in a county delegation caucus even though they were on an issue as to which Blondes had accepted a fee to represent private interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">One of the decisions arising out of the criminal prosecution of Governor Mandel points out that legislative immunity is a common law doctrine which is broader than the literal wording of provisions in the federal or state constitutions guaranteeing freedom of speech and debate. <em>See United States v. Mandel, </em>415 F.Supp. 1025, 1027 (D.Md. 1976). \u201c[I]n cases where particular speech or debate provisions were not applicable to protect conduct arising in the legislative context, courts have applied the common law doctrine of legislative immunity as a part of the judicially-created doctrine of official immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1028. Indeed, \u201c[ajbsolute legislative privilege dates back to at least 1399.\u201d <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 579, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 1343, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434, 1446 (1959) (Warren, C.J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">For at least the past two decades in the United States the principal vehicles for developing law concerning public official immunity have been actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has said that \u201c\u00a7 1983 is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>read in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses rather than in derogation of them.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 418, 96 S.Ct. 984, 989, 47 L.Ed.2d 128, 136 (1976). Thus, \u00a7 1983 cases and their first cousins, tort actions based directly on certain alleged violations of the United States Constitution by officials of the federal government, see <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), may be persuasive authority as to the Maryland common law of public official immunity in a state law, nonconstitutional tort action against a state official, as presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">With respect to federal law claims against state or federal officials, public official immunity has undergone some change when viewed from an historical perspective. Judges, when performing judicial functions, and legislators, when performing legislative functions, enjoyed and continue to enjoy an absolute immunity. Previously, high officials in the executive department enjoyed an absolute immunity. Currently, however, there is a \u201cfederal retreat from absolute immunity in its most stringent form[.]\u201d Prosser \u00a7 132, at 1062. Whether an official of the executive department enjoys a \u00a7 1983 immunity, and whether that immunity is absolute or qualified, is determined in relation to the function which gives rise to the federal law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">An absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 for state legislators \u201cacting in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity\u201d was recognized in <em>Tenney v. Brandhove, </em>341 U.S. 367, 376, 71 S.Ct. 783, 788, 95 L.Ed. 1019, 1027 (1951). It was an action for damages against the members of the California Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>plaintiff alleged that he had been summoned to testify before that committee in order to be used as a tool to \u201csmear\u201d as a \u201cRed\u201d a candidate for mayor of San Francisco. In explaining the absolute nature of the immunity, Justice Frankfurter said for the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201cThe claim of an unworthy purpose does not destroy the privilege. Legislators are immune from deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative duty, not for their private indulgence but for the public good. One must not expect uncommon courage even in legislators. The privilege would be of little value if they could be subjected to the cost and inconvenience and distractions of a trial upon a conclusion of the pleader, or to the hazard of a judgment against them based upon a jury\u2019s speculation as to motives. The holding of this Court in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 130, that it was not consonant with our scheme of government for a court to inquire into the motives of legislators, has remained unquestioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">341 U.S. at 377, 71 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Absolute immunity of state judges in \u00a7 1983 actions was recognized in <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213,18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). And <em>see Bradley v. Fisher, </em>13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Immunity for executive department officials was considered in <em>Spalding v. Vilas, </em>161 U.S. 483, 16 S.Ct. 631, 40 L.Ed. 780 (1896). That case recognized an absolute immunity for the Post Master General in a libel action resulting from a notice sent by that official to certain local postmasters describing the operation of a federal statute. The Court said that the postmaster</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyH\">\u201ccannot be held liable to a civil suit for damages on account of official communications made by him pursuant to an act of Congress, and in respect of matters within his authority, by reason of any personal motive that might be alleged to have prompted his action; for, personal mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tives cannot be imputed to duly authorized official conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">161 U.S. at 498, 16 S.Ct. at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\"><em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, reaffirmed <em>Spalding v. Vilas, supra. Barr </em>was a defamation action against the acting Director of the Office of Rent Stabilization. The plurality opinion in <em>Barr </em>quoted and applied the frequently repeated reasoning by Judge Learned Hand from <em>Gregoire v. Biddle, </em>177 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir.1949), <em>cert, denied, </em>339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363 (1950).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201c \u2018It does indeed go without saying that an official, who is in fact guilty of using his powers to vent his spleen upon others, or for any other personal motive not connected with the public good, should not escape liability for the injuries he may so cause; and, if it were possible in practice to confine such complaints to the guilty, it would be monstrous to deny recovery. The justification for doing so is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties. Again and again the public interest calls for action which may turn out to be founded on a mistake, in the face of which an official may later find himself hard put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith. There must indeed be means of punishing public officers who have been truant to their duties; but that is quite another matter from exposing such as have been honestly mistaken to suit by anyone who has suffered from their errors. As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative. In this instance it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u201c \u2018The decisions have, indeed, always imposed as a limitation upon the immunity that the official\u2019s act must have been within the scope of his powers; and it can be argued that official powers, since they exist only for the public good, never cover occasions where the public good is not their aim, and hence that to exercise a power dishonestly is necessarily to overstep its bounds. A moment\u2019s reflection shows, however, that that cannot be the meaning of the limitation without defeating the whole doctrine. What is meant by saying that the officer must be acting within his power cannot be more than that the occasion must be such as would have justified the act, if he had been using his power for any of the purposes on whose account it was vested in him____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>Barr v.

Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), involving a state governor. Based upon the deployment of the Ohio National Guard at Kent State University in May 1970, and upon events which followed that deployment, \u00a7 1983 suits were brought against the Governor, the Adjutant General, his assistant, various officers and enlisted members of the Ohio National Guard and the president of Kent State University. The complaints in essence alleged</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201cthat each of the named defendants, in undertaking [their] actions, acted either outside the scope of his respective office or, if within the scope, acted in an arbitrary manner, grossly abusing the lawful powers of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">416 U.S. at 235, 94 S.Ct. at 1686. The District Court dismissed the complaints before answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The Supreme Court noted that official immunity apparently rests on two rationales, (1) the injustice of subjecting to liability an officer who is legally required to exercise discretion, particularly absent bad faith, and (2) the danger of deterring willingness to exercise judgment with decisive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ness posed by the threat of liability. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 94 S.Ct. at 1688. The Court reaffirmed its prior holdings concerning judicial and legislative absolute immunity. The Court then analogized the Governor\u2019s exercise of discretion in dealing with civil disorder to possible arrest situations confronted by police officers. The \u201c \u2018common law has never granted police officers an absolute and unqualified immunity[.]\u2019 \u201d Id. at 245, 94 S.Ct. at 1691 (quoting <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. at 555, 87 S.Ct. at 1218). Although good faith and probable cause are the guidelines for evaluating police conduct relating to an arrest,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201c[i]n the case of higher officers of the executive branch, however, the inquiry is far more complex since the range of decisions and choices \u2014 whether the formulation of policy, of legislation, of budgets, or of day-to-day decisions \u2014 is virtually infinite.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">416 U.S. at 246, 94 S.Ct. at 1691. \u201c \u2018It is not the title of his office but the duties with which the particular officer sought to be made to respond in damages is entrusted\u2019 \u201d which provide the guide for the scope of immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 94 S.Ct. at 1692 (quoting <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. at 573, 79 S.Ct. at 1340). In remanding for further proceedings the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cThese considerations suggest that, in varying scope, a qualified immunity is available to officers of the executive branch of government, the variation being dependent upon the scope of discretion and responsibilities of the office and all the circumstances as they reasonably appeared at the time of the action on which liability is sought to be based. It is the existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time and in light of all the circumstances, coupled with good-faith belief, that affords a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACT\">416 U.S. at 247-48, 94 S.Ct. at 1692.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Two years later the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a state prosecuting attorney, \u201cas a member of the executive branch, cannot claim the immunity reserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>for the judiciary, but only a qualified immunity akin to that accorded other executive officials in this Court\u2019s previous cases.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. at 420-21, 96 S.Ct. at 990. The Court concluded that prosecutors enjoyed an absolute immunity at common law \u201cbased upon the same considerations that underlie the common-law immunities of judges and grand jurors acting within the scope of their duties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 422-23, 96 S.Ct. at 991, and that those same considerations of public policy countenanced absolute immunity in \u00a7 1983 actions for initiating a prosecution and presenting the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The meaning of <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra, </em>was considerably clarified, or, at least, the apparent sweep of the opinion was considerably narrowed, in <em>Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). There the plaintiff, a commodity futures commission merchant, had been found in administrative proceedings within the Department of Agriculture to have violated certain requirements and faced a loss of registration. The administrative determination was reversed on judicial review. The plaintiff then brought a <em>Bivens </em>action against all of the officials in the Department of Agriculture who had had anything to do with the administrative proceeding. The District Court dismissed, holding that there was absolute immunity under <em>Barr v. Matteo, supra. </em>The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that <em>Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra, </em>and other opinions \u201cestablished] that officials of the Executive Branch exercising discretionary functions did not need the protection of an absolute immunity from suit____\u201d <em>Butz, </em>438 U.S. at 484, 98 S.Ct. at 2899. In answering the Government\u2019s argument that absolute immunity protected federal officials, even if high state officials did not enjoy the same immunity, the Court, speaking through Justice White, undertook to harmonize the precedents. The Court said that \u201cthe general rule, which long prevailed, [is] that a federal official may not with impunity ignore the limitations which the controlling law has placed on his powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>98 S.Ct. at 2902.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court recognized that the plurality opinion in <em>Barr </em>appeared to have extended absolute immunity, but distinguished both <em>Barr </em>and <em>Spalding </em>on the basis that neither involved the liability of officials who had exceeded constitutional limits. 438 U.S. at 495, 98 S.Ct. at 2905.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Absolute immunity for federal officials based on their status was rejected. Immunity in a <em>Bivens </em>case would not be greater than that accorded state officials sued for identical violations under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 98 S.Ct. at 2907.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The <em>Butz </em>Court then used <em>Scheuer </em>to supply the governing principles for resolving the immunity defenses. That <em>Scheuer </em>analysis produced the following holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201c[I]n a suit for damages arising from unconstitutional action, federal executive officials exercising discretion are entitled only to the qualified immunity specified in <em>Scheuer, </em>subject to those exceptional situations where it is demonstrated that absolute immunity is essential for the conduct of the public business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">438 U.S. at 507, 98 S.Ct. at 2911 (footnote omitted). Thus, \u201c[ajlthough a qualified immunity from damages liability should be the general rule for executive officials charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>with constitutional violations ... <em>there are some officials whose special functions require a full exemption from liability.\" Id. </em>at 508, 98 S.Ct. at 2912 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Supreme Court concluded that the Court of Appeals had erred by placing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201cundue emphasis on the fact that the officials sued here are \u2014 from an administrative perspective \u2014 employees of the Executive Branch. Judges have absolute immunity not because of their particular location within the Government but because of the special nature of their responsibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 511, 98 S.Ct. at 2913. Consequently, <em>Butz </em>held that all of the Department of Agriculture officials who had participated in the decision to initiate the administrative prosecution, and the attorney who had presented the case, had absolute immunity because their functions were analogous to that of a prosecutor, so that <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, </em>controlled. The administrative law judges and hearing officers enjoyed the same absolute exemption as do judges in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">This approach to immunity law is a \u201c \u2018functional\u2019 \u201d one. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 810, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2734, 73 L.Ed.2d 396, 406 (1982). \u201cThe scope of immunity is determined by function, not office.\u201d <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 785, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 2719, 73 L.Ed.2d 349, 386 (1982) (White, J., dissenting). Under this approach members of an interstate planning agency have been held to have absolute immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability for damages for harm allegedly caused by adopting a land use ordinance and general plan because these were actions taken by those officials in their legislative capacities. <em>See Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979). That case confirmed the view expressed by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in 1976 in <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>415 F.Supp. at 1028, that absolute immunity for state legislators, as recognized in <em>Tenney v. Brandhove, </em>341 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 783, is not restricted to the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the speech or debate clauses expressed in the federal and in state constitutions. <em>Tahoe, </em>440 U.S. at 404, 99 S.Ct. at 1178. \u201cRather, the rule of <em>[Tenney </em>] recognizes the need for immunity to protect the \u2018public good.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tahoe, </em>440 U.S. at 404-05, 99 S.Ct. at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Similarly, if a state supreme court is acting legislatively, it enjoys an absolute legislative immunity from \u00a7 1983 damages. <em>See Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union of the United States, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 719, 100 S.Ct. 1967, 64 L.Ed.2d 641 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Here the function involved is the exercise of the power to veto or approve legislation. <em>See </em>Maryland Constitution, art. II, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[A]s a matter of historical development as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>as of theory ... the veto is a legislative power.\u201d E. Mason, <em>The Veto Power </em>\u00a7 100 (A. Hart ed. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><em>People v. Bowen, </em>21 N.Y. 517 (1860), presented a clear exposition of the political theory underlying veto power. <em>Bowen </em>held that the power to approve and sign a bill presented to the Governor of New York within a specified number of days prior to adjournment of the legislature does not cease with the adjournment. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8b\">\u201cWhatever the authority, touching the enactment of laws, with which the Governor is clothed, shall be called, it is of the same general nature with that which is exercised by the members of the two houses. He is to consider as to the constitutionality, justice and public expediency of such legislative measures as shall have been agreed upon by the two houses, by the ordinary majorities, and be presented to him; and he is to accord or withhold his approbation, according to the result of his deliberation. This is plainly the function of a legislator. The sovereign of England, who is charged with the same duty in respect to acts of Parliament, is considered to be a constituent part of the supreme legislative power. (1 Bl.Com., 261.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>It is true that his determination to disapprove a bill deprives it of any effect; while one disallowed by the Governor may yet be established by an extraordinary concurrence of votes in the houses. Thus, though the action of the executive is less potential here than in England, the quality of the act, namely, deliberating and determining upon the propriety of laws proposed to be enacted, is precisely the same. Besides making his determination, the Governor is required, in case it is unfavorable to the law, to submit his objections to the legislature, which is to examine them, and again pass upon them in the light of the discussion which they have thus undergone. To my mind, it is clear that this involves a participation on the part of the Governor, with the two houses of the legislature, in the enactment of laws. It would not be correct language to say, that he forms a branch of the legislature, for the Constitution has limited that designation to the Senate and Assembly; but it would be equally incorrect to affirm, that the sanction which he is required to give to or withhold from bills before they can become operative does not render him a participator in the function of making laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">This Court reached an identical holding concerning the effect of adjournment under the Maryland Constitution, in which <em>People v. Bowen </em>was cited with approval. <em>See Lankford v. County Comm\u2019rs of Somerset County, </em>73 Md. 105, 116, 20 A. 1017, 1020 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States has espoused the same theory as to the veto power of the President of the United States, see <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>286 U.S. 482, 490, 52 S.Ct. 627, 630, 76 L.Ed. 1239, 1243 (1932) (\u201cThe fact that [the President\u2019s function in approving or disapproving bills] is a legislative function does not mean that it can be performed only while Congress is in session.\u201d), and as to state governors, see <em>Smiley v.

There the plaintiff owned land through which the municipality planned to build a highway. The city council unanimously had rezoned that land, but the mayor vetoed the measure. The council did not override the veto. The plaintiff alleged that the municipal officials had delayed making a decision on the rezoning in order to maintain the depressed market'value of the land and thereby to minimize the cost of acquiring the right of way for the highway. The Fifth Circuit first held that legislative immunity could apply to local legislators in \u00a7 1983 actions.

It was <em>only </em>because there were conflicting factual inferences whether a conspiracy antedated the veto and whether the reasons publicly given for the veto represented Governor Mandel\u2019s true reasons for the veto that the complaint escaped dismissal as a matter of law on limitations grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 302-03, 503 A.2d at 1324. We shall not permit the plaintiffs now to minimize the role of the veto in their theory of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>after they have made critical use of the veto to avoid the defense of limitations raised by all members of the Kovens Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Treating a veto as legislative action by the Governor, the O\u2019Haras submit, would violate the doctrine of separation of powers, particularly' as embodied in Maryland Declaration of Rights, art. 8.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The argument overstates the separation of powers concept. In No. 66 of the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton refuted a similar objection to the trial of impeachments in the Senate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201cThe <em>first </em>of these objections is that the provision in question confounds legislative and judiciary authorities in the same body in violation of that important and well-established maxim which requires a separation between the different departments of power. The true meaning of this maxim has been discussed and ascertained in another place, and has been shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of those departments for special purposes, preserving them, in the main, distinct and unconnected. This partial intermixture is even, in some cases, not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense of the several members of the government against each other. An absolute or qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of the legislative body is admitted, by the ablest adepts in political science, to be an indispensable barrier against the encroachments of the latter upon the former.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">A.

Jay, <em>The Federalist Papers, </em>at 401-02 (The New American Library ed. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Relying on <em>England v. Rockefeller, </em>739 F.2d 140, <em>overruled on other grounds Young v. Lynch, </em>846 F.2d 960, 962 (4th Cir.1984), the O\u2019Haras argue that even a governor cannot assert absolute legislative immunity, at least for \u00a7 1983 purposes, unless that official exercises all of the state\u2019s legislative power on the subject matter at issue. In the action against Governor Rockefeller of West Virginia former employees of the state highway agency contended that they had been discharged for political reasons. They alleged that the governor had deliberately inflated revenue estimates for fiscal year 1981 to justify excessive expenditures and then utilized the ensuing deficit as an excuse to terminate the plaintiffs. Rejecting an absolute legislative immunity defense, the Fourth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cLegislative immunity attaches to the acts of state executive branch officers only when they are exercising the state\u2019s \u2018entire legislative power with respect to\u2019 the matter at issue. <em>Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, </em>446 U.S. 719, 734 [100 S.Ct. 1967, 1975]. ... Although the Governor of West Virginia is intimately involved in the state\u2019s budget process, his participation clearly does not qualify for .legislative immunity under <em>Supreme Court of Virginia. </em>The West Virginia Constitution requires the Governor to submit a detailed budget bill to the legislature____ The legislature may amend the bill ... but the Governor has an item veto over the bill as finally passed, which can be overridden on an item-by-item basis only by a two-thirds vote in each house. ..'. Thus his responsibilities regarding the budget, though considerable, clearly fall short of an exercise of the state\u2019s entire legislative power to appropriate monies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEQ\">739 F.2d at 142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">We do not read <em>Consumers Union </em>as narrowly as did the Fourth Circuit in <em>Rockefeller. </em>In <em>Consumers Union </em>a Virginia statute provided that the Supreme Court of Virginia \u201cmay, from time to time, prescribe, adopt, promulgate and amend rules and regulations ... [prescribing a code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ethics governing the professional conduct of attorneys-atlaw____\u201d Virginia Code (1950, 1978 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 54-48(b). Consumers Union argued that the Supreme Court of Virginia was \u201cmerely exercising a delegated power to make rules in the same manner that many executive and agency officials wield authority to make rules in a wide variety of circumstances.\u201d 446 U.S. at 734, 100 S.Ct. at 1976. The Supreme Court conceded that <em>\u201c[ajll </em>of such officials\u201d are not absolutely immune but said that \u201cit would not follow that ... in wo circumstances do those who exercise delegated legislative power enjoy legislative immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). It is in that context that the Court then went on to say that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201c[i]n any event, in this case the Virginia Court claims inherent power to regulate the Bar, and ... the Virginia Court is exercising the State\u2019s entire legislative power with respect to regulating the Bar, and its members are the State\u2019s legislators for the purpose of issuing the Bar Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court\u2019s reference to a state\u2019s entire legislative power was simply to point out that the case was clearly one for absolute legislative immunity. The reference is not a requirement that all legislative power be delegated as a condition precedent to the delegatee\u2019s enjoying legislative immunity. <em>Consumers Union </em>expressly recognizes that absolute legislative immunity may arise with lesser delegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">An example of a lesser delegation is <em>Jayvee Brand, Inc. v. United States, </em>721 F.2d 385 (D.C.Cir.1983). The plaintiffs, manufacturers of children\u2019s sleepwear, sued the then current and former members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission in a <em>Bivens </em>action alleging a denial of due process in adopting regulations in 1974 which approved treating fabric with a certain flame-retardant compound and then in 1977 prohibiting use of that same compound. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the defendants enjoyed absolute legislative immunity in exercising quasi-legislative regulatory authority. The court relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Consumers Union </em>together with <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Further, the <em>Rockefeller </em>court\u2019s analysis finds that the West Virginia budget process divided power between the Governor and the Legislature. If exercise of a state\u2019s entire legislative authority on a given subject is required for legislative immunity, then legislators themselves would never have immunity in any state in which legislative power is shared under a constitutional requirement that the Governor either sign or veto legislative enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In any event, we decline to adopt the <em>Rockefeller </em>court\u2019s limited view of legislative immunity as part of Maryland law. This is particularly because of the adverse ramifications that that rule would have on gubernatorial decision-making in preparing the executive budget under Maryland Constitution, art. III, \u00a7 52. <em>Cf. Kelly v. Marylanders for Sports Sanity, </em>310 Md. 437, 453, 530 A.2d 245, 253 (1987) (prior to Budget Amendment \u201cthe power to expend public monies was vested solely in the Legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Budget Amendment, adopted in 1916, and the veto provision, adopted in 1867, are more particular and more recent guides for formulating Maryland common law than are the general and essentially precatory provisions of Maryland Declaration of Rights, art. 6, adopted in 1776.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence we decline the O\u2019Haras\u2019 invitation to use art. 6 as our polestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>5</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The O\u2019Haras contend that no absolute immunity of any kind can apply to action taken by a public official for the purpose of defrauding persons. This argument is, in substance, a denial of absolute immunity. Whether a function qualifies for absolute immunity is made objectively and not subjectively. <em>Spalding v. Vilas, </em>161 U.S. 483, 498, 16 S.Ct. 631, 637, looked to whether the matters involved were committed by law to the public official\u2019s control or supervision. <em>Nixon v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 731, 756, 102 S.Ct. 2690, 2704, involving the unique absolute immunity of the President of the United States, and <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 575, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 1341, looked to whether the acts were within the outer perimeter of the official\u2019s responsibility. We need not define any perimeter in the case before us because the legislative veto/appr\u00f3val power of a Governor is at the very core of gubernatorial duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In <em>Nixon </em>the argument was made, similar to that presented here, that the President enjoyed no immunity from damages for the discharge of the plaintiff because the discharge lacked \u201csuch cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\u201d a requirement imposed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512(A). The Court (plurality opinion) rejected the contention saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cThis construction would subject the President to trial on virtually every allegation that an action was unlawful, or was taken for a forbidden purpose. Adoption of this construction thus would deprive absolute immunity of its intended effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">457 U.S. at 756, 102 S.Ct. at 2705. And <em>see Tenney v. Brandhove, </em>341 U.S. at 377, 71 S.Ct. at 788; <em>Gregoire v. Biddle, </em>177 F.2d at 581; Prosser, at 1059; Restatement (Second) of Torts, comments to \u00a7 895D at 412-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The discretion exercised by a Governor in deciding whether to veto or approve legislation does not differ from that to be exercised by legislators in deciding whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>vote for or against a bill. There is no policy reason why legislators should enjoy absolute immunity for their legislative acts but that a Governor should have only a qualified immunity for his or her legislative function of vetoing or approving legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons we hold, as a matter of Maryland common law, that a Governor of Maryland enjoys an absolute immunity from liability for damages for non-constitutional torts based on the approval or veto of legislative enactments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Because absolute immunity carries with it the right to avoid trial as a party defendant, review after final judgment will not protect the right. It follows that the denial of Governor Mandel\u2019s motion for summary judgment is an appealable order under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley Conservation League, </em>300 Md. 200, 477 A.2d 759 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">From a procedural standpoint the absolute immunity asserted in this case is a defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. That defense may be made by motion for summary judgment and, under Maryland Rule 2-324, is not waived, even if first made at trial on the merits. Thus, even though Governor Mandel did not argue in the trial court that the veto is a legislative function, it would be inefficient to remand in order to present to the trial court a pure point of law which the parties have briefed and argued in this Court. Further, because the defense is unaffected by the particular facts which might be developed, a case of this type is not one within the discretion which a trial court ordinarily has to deny summary judgment. <em>Compare Three Garden Village Ltd. Partner</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>ship v.
