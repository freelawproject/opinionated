They left the card game together, and Ford offered Anderson a ride home in Ford\u2019s automobile. According to Ford\u2019s testimony at the trial below, Ford entered the vehicle on the driver\u2019s side, reached across and opened the door on the passenger\u2019s side, and then started the vehicle. As soon as he started the vehicle, he heard \u201ca big noise in the car\u201d and \u201cthought that the car had blown up.\u201d Next, his arm and his leg \u201cgot numb,\u201d and he saw the defendant Anderson running down the street. Anderson had not entered the car after the door on the passenger side had been opened. Ford \u201cfelt\u201d that his side was wet, reached down with his hand, and saw blood on his hand. Ford exclaimed: \u201cHe shot me.\u201d At no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>time during the incident, however, did Ford see a gun. Ford was hospitalized for eight to ten weeks because of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Anderson was charged in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore City, with attempted murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), wearing or carrying a handgun in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b), and discharging a firearm in Baltimore City in violation of Art. 19, \u00a7 112, of the Baltimore City Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">At the District Court trial, in addition to Ford\u2019s testimony set forth above, the investigating policeman testified that Ford had been \u201cshot in the torso area\u201d on the \u201cright side.\u201d He also testified that the \u201cbullet hole\u201d was small. No bullet, however, was found. Furthermore, there was no medical or other expert testimony concerning the nature or cause of the wound. At one point during Ford\u2019s testimony, Ford speculated that Anderson \u201cshot\u201d him because Ford had taken five dollars from a pool of money which Anderson had won in the card game. Ford stated that Anderson had owed him five dollars from the previous week.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Following the presentation of the evidence at the trial, and during argument of counsel, the district judge indicated that he was concerned about the absence of evidence regarding the weapon and the absence of a bullet. At one point, the judge speculated that the wound might have been caused by something other than a bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Nevertheless, after argument by counsel, and based on the circumstances and the victim\u2019s testimony which the district judge stated that he believed, the judge rendered verdicts that Anderson was guilty of attempted murder and not guilty of the \u201chandgun charges.\u201d The court thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">\u201cCourt: Well, I think, I think the state of, I believe the, the testimony of the victim and I was not dissuaded in any way by the inconsistencies that were brought out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>because of the police report. I found those inconsistencies to be explainable. I think, because of the fact, there was no actual evidence of the handgun being fired, but the fact that no one saw the handgun, they just heard a noise, although the, an apparent bullet hole is there, is going to make for an inconsistent verdict. I believe that the State presented enough to, to convict on the attempted murder and verdict will be guilty. As to the handgun charges, the verdict\u2019s not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Nothing specifically was said concerning the charge of discharging a firearm in Baltimore City. On the verdict sheets signed by the judge, however, a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict was entered with respect to discharging a firearm in Baltimore City. Later a motion to set aside the attempted murder verdict was denied, and a sentence of 30 years imprisonment was imposed for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Anderson took an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. As there was no consent between the parties that the appeal would be on the District Court record, the appeal was scheduled to be heard as a trial de novo in the circuit court. Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-401(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Prior to the hearing of the appeal de novo, Anderson filed in the circuit court a motion to dismiss the attempted murder charge. The theory of the motion was that the district judge had rendered inconsistent verdicts, that the findings underlying the acquittals on the handgun and firearm charges precluded a conviction on the attempted murder charge, and that an appeal de novo in the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>court on the attempted murder charge was barred by principles of collateral estoppel embodied in the double jeopardy prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">After some initial procedural skirmishes, the circuit court granted the motion and dismissed the attempted murder charge. The circuit court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cYou have a situation here where the defendant went to trial on the attempted murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, possession of a handgun and discharge of a handgun and even the Judge below recognized that the verdict was an inconsistent one. The fact of the matter is he found the Defendant not guilty of the handgun charges, he found him guilty of the attempted murder and that attempted murder was by way of shooting. It would seem to me that perhaps if the attempted murder and the evidence relating to the attempted murder was not by way of shooting then we would be in a somewhat different posture, but that\u2019s not the case here. The evidence adduced at trial below dealt with a shooting and even though the argument can be made that the acquittal on the use of the handgun charge certainly would not bar retrial on the attempted murder and again certainly it could be argued that acquittal on the possession of a handgun charge does not necessarily bar retrial on the attempted murder, I am constrained to see how acquittal on discharging of a firearm charge would not preclude on the attempted murder charge. It would seem to me that in order to prove the attempted murder under the facts and circumstances of this case the State is going to have to show that a weapon that is used to propel a bullet was used. That bullet was lodged in the victim in this case, hence there is \u2014 you have the gun by way of discharging that firearm \u2014 and he\u2019s already been acquitted of discharging of a firearm. Consequently, I am going to grant the motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The State filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Thereafter, but within thirty days of the. circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>court\u2019s judgment, the State filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. The petition requested either the issuance of a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-302(c)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article or the issuance of a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to \u00a7 12-305 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. This Court granted the State\u2019s petition and issued writs of certiorari both to the Court of Special Appeals and to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The State, before addressing the merits of the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the attempted murder charge, strenuously argues that it had a right to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. The State claims that our jurisdiction vests under \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which authorize certiorari review by this Court of cases pending in the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The State relies on \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201c(c) In a criminal case, the State may appeal as provided in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(1) The State may appeal from a final judgment granting a motion to dismiss or quashing or dismissing any indictment, information, presentment, or inquisition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI_\">The State contends that \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) is not limited to criminal cases where a circuit court was exercising jurisdiction as a trial court. The State insists that \u00a7 12-302(c)(l) also authorizes the State to appeal from a circuit court judgment dismissing a charging document when the circuit court is exercising appellate jurisdiction over a criminal case which was initially tried in the District Court. We disagree with the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The basic right of a party to appeal from a final circuit court judgment is set forth in \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201cExcept as provided in \u00a7 12-302, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Section 12-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, however, lists six \u201cexceptions\u201d to \u00a7 12-301. The first exception covers the present case. Section 12-302 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201c\u00a7 12-302. Same \u2014 Exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">(a) Unless a right to appeal is expressly granted by law, \u00a7 12-301 does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered or made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of the District Court____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Subsections (b) through (f) contain the remaining exceptions. The limitations upon the State\u2019s right to appeal final circuit court judgments in criminal cases are contained in subsection (c). Subsection (c)(1) authorizes the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>appeal from a final judgment granting a motion to dismiss a charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The State\u2019s theory is that \u00a7 12-302(c) constitutes an independent provision of law authorizing the State to appeal in criminal cases, and, as such, \u201csubsection (c) provides the exception to Section 12-302(a), thereby providing a right of appeal for the State for cases originating in District Court.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief, p. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The flaw in the State\u2019s theory is that \u00a7 12-301 is the statute authorizing either party to appeal from final circuit court judgments in criminal as well as civil cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the language of \u00a7 12-301 and the heading of \u00a7 12-302 make clear, the subsections of \u00a7 12-302 simply set forth the \u201cexceptions\u201d to the right of appeal conferred by \u00a7 12-301. The State\u2019s right of appeal is conferred by \u00a7 12-301. It is then limited by all of the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 12-302. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 12-302 limits for all parties the \u00a7 12-301 right of appeal by excluding circuit court final judgments entered \u201cin the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of the District Court____\u201d Subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-302 additionally limits, in criminal cases, the State\u2019s \u00a7 12-301 right of appeal to those situations specified in subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Although the State\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in this case was not precluded by the limitations contained in \u00a7 12-302(c), it was precluded by the limitation contained in \u00a7 12-302(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 and 12-302 is reinforced by \u00a7 12-305 which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall require by writ of certiorari that a decision be certified to it for review and determination in any case in which a circuit court has rendered a final judgment on appeal from the District Court ... if it appears to the Court of Appeals, upon petition of a party that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201c(2) There are ... special circumstances rendering it desirable and in the public interest that the decision be reviewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>See also </em>\u00a7 12-307(2), vesting jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals \u201cto review a case or proceeding decided by a circuit court, in accordance with \u00a7 12-305 of this Article.\u201d Sections 12-305 and 12-307(2) are the only provisions of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article expressly authorizing further review of circuit court final judgments rendered in cases on appeal from the District Court, and they provide that there shall be discretionary review by the Court of Appeals and not an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. As recently pointed out by Chief Judge Murphy for the Court in <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>319 Md. 674, 678 n. 1, 574 A.2d 918, 919 n. 1 (1990), \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals, not the Court of Special Appeals, has the authority to review cases \u2018in which a circuit court has rendered a final judgment on appeal from the District Court.\u2019 \u00a7 12-305.\u201d <em>But cf., Legal Aid Bureau v. Farmer, </em>74 Md.App. 707, 709-714, 539 A.2d 1173 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Consequently, the State was not entitled to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in this case. Thus, we can not decide the merits of the State\u2019s appeal under the writ of certiorari issued to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 and 12-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We shall dismiss the State\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">On the other hand, as previously mentioned, the State alternately petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to \u00a7 12-305 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. As we be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>lieved that the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the attempted murder charge presented an issue of public importance, we also issued a writ of certiorari to the circuit court. We can reach the merits of the circuit court\u2019s dismissal under that writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Relying upon <em>Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984), the State\u2019s principal argument on the merits is that \u201cdouble jeopardy based upon a proceeding in the District Court can never be a bar to de novo proceedings in the circuit court.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief, p. 9). Alternatively, the State appears to argue that an examination of the District Court\u2019s statements shows that the District Court did not make findings inconsistent with the attempted murder charge or which would require resolving the attempted murder charge in Anderson\u2019s favor. Again we do not concur with the State\u2019s principal argument, but we shall decide in favor of the State essentially on the alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\"><em>Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, supra, </em>dealt with the particular double jeopardy principle enunciated in <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). The <em>Burks </em>case had \u201cheld that the Double Jeopardy Clause [of the Fifth Amendment] bars a second trial when a reviewing court reverses a conviction on the ground that the evidence presented at the first trial was legally insufficient.\u201d 466 U.S. at 298, 104 S.Ct. at 1808. The Supreme Court in <em>Lydon </em>held that the <em>Burks </em>principle had no application to \u201cthe trial <em>de novo </em>of respondent Lydon, pursuant to Massachusetts\u2019 \u2018two-tier\u2019 system for trying minor crimes____\u201d 466 U.S. at 296-297, 104 S.Ct. at 1807.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">There are major differences between the Massachusetts two-tier trial de novo system involved in <em>Lydon </em>and the Maryland system regarding appeals to circuit courts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>final District Court judgments in criminal cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Court in <em>Lydon </em>appeared to rely upon some features of the Massachusetts system not present in the Maryland system. Nevertheless, we shall assume that the holding in <em>Lydon </em>is applicable to a criminal appeal from the District Court of Maryland to a circuit court where the parties have not consented to an appeal on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Nothing in the <em>Lydon </em>opinion, however, supports the State\u2019s broad contention that the double jeopardy prohibition \u201cbased upon a proceeding in the District Court can never be a bar to de novo proceedings in the circuit court.\u201d <em>Lydon </em>dealt only with the applicability of the <em>Burks </em>principle. No other component of the double jeopardy prohibition was involved. Moreover, the <em>Lydon </em>opinion itself appears to refute the State\u2019s broad argument, as the Supreme Court clearly indicated that the second tier de novo trial could not encompass any charges on which the defendant was acquitted at the initial trial. 466 U.S. at 307, 308, 311-312, 104 S.Ct. at 1813,1815; This Court has flatly taken the position that, under the double jeopardy prohibition, the de novo appeal can not embrace a charge on which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>was acquitted in the District Court. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>289 Md. 1, 6, 421 A.2d 974 (1980). <em>See also Block v. State, </em>286 Md. 266, 407 A.2d 320 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Neither <em>Lydon </em>nor any opinion of this Court decides whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as embodied in either the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause or the Maryland common law double jeopardy prohibition, would preclude a trial de novo on appeal as to one charge involving an issue of ultimate fact which was resolved against the State by a District Court acquittal on another charge in the same case. <em>See, </em>however, <em>Ferrell v. State, </em>318 Md. 235, 243, 567 A.2d 937, <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 110 S.Ct. 3301, 111 L.Ed.2d 810 (1990) (\u201c \u2018the critical consideration is whether \u201can issue of ultimate fact\u201d has been determined in favor of a defendant. The process by which that determination is made ... is not critical\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Robinson v. State, </em>307 Md. 738, 742, 517 A.2d 94, 96 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">It is, however, settled in this State, as a nonconstitutional common law principle, that inconsistent verdicts of guilty and not guilty, by a trial judge at a nonjury trial, are not ordinarily permitted. <em>Hoffert v. State, </em>319 Md. 377, 385 n. 2, 572 A.2d 536 (1990); <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 52-58, 512 A.2d 358 (1986); <em>Johnson, etc. v. State, </em>238 Md. 528, 541-545, 209 A.2d 765 (1965).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The remedy is to reverse or vacate the judgment entered on the inconsistent guilty verdict. <em>Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 58, 512 A.2d at 364; <em>Johnson, etc. v. State, supra, </em>238 Md. at 543, 209 A.2d at 772. <em>See United States v. Maybury, </em>274 F.2d 899, 905 (2d Cir.1960). Where, however, there is an apparent inconsistency in the verdicts at a nonjury trial, but where the trial judge on the record satisfactorily explains the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>inconsistency, the guilty verdict may stand. <em>Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 56-57, 512 A.2d at 363-364; <em>Johnson, etc. v. State, supra, </em>238 Md. at 544-545, 209 A.2d at 772. If \u201cthere is only an apparent inconsistency which in substance disappears upon review of the trial court\u2019s explanation,\u201d the guilty verdict will not be vacated. <em>Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 57, 512 A.2d at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In our view, the present case is one where there is an apparent inconsistency in the District Court\u2019s verdicts which disappears upon review of the district judge\u2019s findings and explanation. Therefore, under the decisions in <em>Shell </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>inconsistency in the verdict furnished no proper basis for dismissing the attempted murder charge. Moreover, we shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the doctrine of collateral estoppel would be applicable to prevent a de novo appeal on the attempted murder charge if the district judge\u2019s findings underlying the acquittals resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor a critical issue involved in the attempted murder charge. An examination of the district judge\u2019s findings demonstrates that he did not resolve in the defendant\u2019s favor an issue critical to the attempted murder prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The prosecution\u2019s theory underlying the attempted murder charge, as shown by the charging document, the arguments, and the testimony at the District Court trial, was that the defendant Anderson attempted to murder Ford by shooting him with a firearm. At no time did the prosecution limit its theory to attempted murder by a <em>handgun. </em>In addition, the trial judge\u2019s guilty verdict on the attempted murder charge was not premised upon the use of a handgun. The acquittals on the other charges, however, were based upon the district judge\u2019s view that the prosecution was required to prove that Anderson used a <em>handgun </em>within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B, and that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>insufficient proof that a handgun was used.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Thus, following closing argument by the defense attorney and the prosecuting attorney, the district judge found that Ford\u2019s testimony constituted \u201csufficient evidence that he was shot.\u201d The question in the judge\u2019s mind was \u201chad the State proved in any way that ... the victim was in fact shot with a handgun?\u201d Thereafter, in rendering the verdicts, the district judge\u2019s statements explained that the verdicts on the handgun charges would be different from the verdict on the attempted murder charge because of the absence of evidence of a \u201chandgun.\u201d After finding that the victim\u2019s testimony warranted a verdict of guilty of attempted murder, the judge went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cI think, because of the fact, there was no actual evidence of the handgun being fired, by the fact that no one saw the handgun, they just heard a noise, although the, an apparent bullet hole is there, is going to make for an inconsistent verdict. I believe that the State presented enough to, to convict on the attempted murder and verdict will be guilty. As to the handgun charges, the verdict\u2019s not guilty. Is there any other charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201cState: Three other charges, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">\u201cCourt: Are we going to proceed with the second case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201cState: May we have a moment to talk with the detective on that one, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201cCourt: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cDefense: Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cCourt: I\u2019m ready to take a break____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">It is clear that the district judge believed that evidence of a <em>handgun </em>was required for guilty verdicts on all of the charges except the attempted murder charge. His belief was correct with regard to the charges based on Art. 27, \u00a7 36B, of the Maryland Code. It may have been erroneous with regard to the charge of violating Art. 19, \u00a7 112, of the Baltimore City Code. Nevertheless, his actual findings satisfactorily explain the apparent inconsistency in verdicts and in no way resolve in the defendant\u2019s favor a critical issue underlying the attempted murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the attempted murder verdict, the district judge reiterated that all of the acquittals were based upon the failure of the State to prove that a handgun, within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B, was used. After the attorneys\u2019 arguments, the district judge stated that \u201cI don\u2019t think there was sufficient evidence to ... substantiate use of a handgun ...\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is more strict proof required certainly for those ... statutory handgun offenses. That is what the court has found----\u201d Later the judge again said that in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">\u201clots of cases where the evidence is just insufficient to prove handgun. You know, maybe the handgun wasn\u2019t described sufficiently. Certainly wasn\u2019t in this case. Lots of time when it was not a handgun, it could be a rifle....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The district judge concluded by saying that \u201cthe State has just not been ... [able] for whatever reason to prove the handgun statute, but they prove[d] the substance of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">As the district judge\u2019s statements satisfactorily resolved the apparent inconsistency in the verdicts, and as the judge\u2019s findings furnish no collateral estoppel basis for precluding a second trial for attempted murder, the circuit court erred in dismissing the attempted murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>UNDER THE WRIT OF CERTIORARI ISSUED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS, APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">UNDER THE WRIT OF CERTIORARI ISSUED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT IS REVERSED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR A TRIAL DE NOVO ON THE CHARGE OF ATTEMPTED MURDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">RESPONDENT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">.

Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 12-301, effective January 1, 1974, the basic statute granting a right to appeal from final circuit court judgments did not encompass criminal cases. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1968 Repl.Vol.), Art. 5, \u00a7 1. The right to appeal in criminal cases was conferred by other statutes. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1968 Repl.Vol.), Art. 5, \u00a7 12 <em>et seq. </em>Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was intended to consolidate several prior statutes, including Art. 5, \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 12. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 12-301 in the 1974 edition of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-5\">. Under the Massachusetts \u201c \u2018two-tier\u2019 system for trying minor crimes\" described in <em>Lydon, </em>a convicted defendant\u2019s \"only recourse is a trial <em>de novo,\u201d </em>and the trial de novo is before the jury session of the same court. 466 U.S. at 297-298, 104 S.Ct. at 1807-1808. In Maryland, the District Court has jurisdiction over quite serious crimes; the appeal is on the record if the parties consent, and the appeal goes to a different court exercising appellate jurisdiction. Under the Massachusetts system described by the Supreme Court, the application for a trial de novo vacates the initial judgment. 466 U.S. at 300, 310, 104 S.Ct. at 1809, 1814. This is not true in Maryland. The Supreme Court also viewed the initial Massachusetts proceeding and the trial de novo as \u2018\u201cpart of a single, continuous course of judicial proceedings____\u2019\u2019\u2019 466 U.S. at 309, 104 S.Ct. at 1814.
