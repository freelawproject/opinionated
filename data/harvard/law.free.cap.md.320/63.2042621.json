On the merits the principal issue is whether the ordinance creating the special tax district was initiated by the requisite number of petition signatures. Procedurally, the principal issues are whether this litigation may properly proceed until the Attorney General of Maryland has been notified and until the owners of all of the lots in the tax district have been joined as co-defendants with the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Longview Beach is a platted subdivision of 870 lots lying between Maryland Route 238 and the Wicomico River.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At least some of the roads shown on the plat have been laid out and graded, but none is surfaced to current County standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Prior to July 21, 1987, the owners of 236 lots in Longview Beach petitioned the County to improve certain of the private roads in Longview Beach and to incorporate those roads, so improved, into the County roads system. This petition was presented pursuant to a public local law authorizing the County to construct \u201con or along private roads after the approval of a petition of a majority of the property owners whose property will benefit from the proposed construction or improvement, requesting that the roads be taken into the county roads system.\u201d St. Mary\u2019s County Code (1978, 1989 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 109-2.C.(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>On July 21, 1987, the County adopted Ordinance No. 87-10, the Longview Beach Special Taxing District Ordinance (the Ordinance). The tax district initially consists of 466 of the 870 lots in Longview Beach. The Ordinance specifically refers to block and lot designations, as shown on the recorded plat, in order to create a tax district consisting of \u201call improved lots and all lots fronting on one of the roads to be reconstructed.\u201d In other words, the district initially consists of unimproved lots abutting a proposed County road, improved lots abutting a proposed County road, and improved lots abutting a private road, but unimproved lots abutting a private road will not be assessed initially. The Ordinance further provides that \u201c[i]f improvements are constructed on lots that are not currently included in the taxing district ... such lots shall, in the assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ment year following such construction or subdivision, be included in the taxing district at the appropriate rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The total costs of the proposed County roads in Longview Beach are to be paid by benefit assessments levied against the lots comprising the tax district from time to time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The criteria for determining the initial lots to be assessed create sections of the tax district which are wholly surrounded by lots which are not part of the tax district. Those criteria also produce an initial tax district of 466 lots. Inasmuch as the petition under \u00a7 109-2.C of the County Code was signed by the owners of 236 lots, the petition was signed by a majority of the owners of the lots in the tax district, as defined in the Ordinance. One issue on the merits of this case is whether the \u00a7 109-2. C requirement for <em>\u201ca </em>petition of the majority of the property owners whose property will benefit from the proposed construction\u201d has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>This litigation began when Viola M. Gardner and others, the Petitioners, filed in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County an order for appeal, followed by a petition for appeal, under Maryland Rules of Procedure, Ch. 1100, Subtitle B, \u201cAdministrative Agencies \u2014 Appeal From.\u201d The circuit court granted the County\u2019s motion to dismiss, but allowed Petitioners leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In their amended complaint Petitioners alleged that they are \u201cproperty owners and taxpayers in Longview Beach whose properties will be subject to a special taxing district tax.\u201d They sought a judgment declaring the Ordinance to be void and enjoining the County from implementing it. They alleged that fewer than half of the lot owners in Longview Beach petitioned for creation of the tax district. The amended complaint also alleged that the County\u2019s action violated Art. XV of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">At no time during the course of this litigation have the Petitioners sent notice of their suit to the Attorney General of Maryland, despite the County\u2019s having raised by answer Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-405(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The County\u2019s answer also asserted that \u201cat least 466 property owners are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>be in this taxing district and would be possibly affected by the outcome of this case and, therefore, should be included as necessary parties in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The circuit court essentially severed for separate trial, on stipulated facts, the issue involving the number of signatures on the petition. That court concluded that the owners of a majority of the benefited lots had not signed so that the Ordinance was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The County appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which vacated the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings, to be conducted after notice to the Attorney General in accordance with the requirements of CJ \u00a7 3-405(c). <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of St. Mary\u2019s County v. Gardner, </em>79 Md.App. 417, 557 A.2d 260 (1989). The appellate court concluded that \u00a7 3-405(c) must be followed even though the trial court had not predicated its judgment on constitutional grounds. The Court of Special Appeals, however, expressly disclaimed \u201cruling that notice to the Attorney General is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 557 A.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The intermediate appellate court also held that the owners of lots assessed under the Ordinance were directly impacted by any ruling on its validity. Relying on CJ \u00a7 3-405(a) and Maryland Rule 2-211, the court held that \u201c[ijnclusion of persons owning property within the scope of the [Ordinance is, therefore, mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 557 A.2d at 262.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court did not reach the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>We issued the writ of certiorari at the request of the Petitioners. That petition included the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">\u201c1. Whether the failure to notify the Attorney General in a declaratory judgment action, pursuant to ... Section 3-405(e), is harmless error when the Circuit Court enters the declaratory judgment based on non-constitutional grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201c3. Whether the Plaintiffs, in a taxpayer\u2019s suit seeking a decree enjoining the implementation of an ordinance illegally creating a special taxing district, are required to join all other property owners located in the special taxing district pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-211 (1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c5. Whether the ordinance creating a special taxing district is illegal or ultra vires since a class of property owners who will be taxed in the future if they improve their property were not permitted to vote on, nor counted toward, the proposed taxing district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The Attorney General also obtained leave to file a brief as amicus curiae, in order to address only the issue involving CJ \u00a7 3-405(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">As a threshold matter the County submits that the circuit court had no jurisdiction. We consider this contention, despite the absence of a cross petition for certiorari, because lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter may be raised at any time. Md.Rule 2-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Petitioners\u2019 first pleading invoked the B Rules which confer no substantive right to judicial review of legislative enactments. The County seems to say that the misconcep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tion by Petitioners of their remedy rendered the circuit court powerless to act in any aspect of the case. Courts have jurisdiction, as in the case here, to rule that an initial claim for relief does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Maryland Rule 2-341 permits amendments which \u201cshall be freely allowed when justice so permits.\u201d An amendment may seek to \u201cchange the nature of the action.\u201d Md.Rule 2-341(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We now turn to the effect of Petitioners\u2019 violation of CJ \u00a7 3-405(c). By the clear terms of that statute the Petitioners should have given notice to the Attorney General when they filed their suit alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>the unconstitutionally of the Ordinance. The purpose of \u00a7 3-405(c) is to give the Attorney General \u201cthe opportunity to decide whether to intervene on behalf of the State or any State agency affected.\u201d <em>Pressman v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>204 Md. 78, 86, 102 A.2d 821, 826 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">CJ \u00a7 3-405(c) is \u00a7 11 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, 12 U.L.A. 516 (1975). One court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvK\">\u201cThe purpose of this provision is to enhance the quality of constitutional litigation by notifying the Attorney General of the pending action____ While it is not contemplated that the Attorney General will actually appear in every case in which he is served, still, from a copy of the proceedings, he can identify the parties and issues and decide whether the State, with the forces it can muster, should step in and support the enactment. If, in a particular case, the Attorney General decides to appear in court, as this statute permits, his presentation of evidence and argument may provide the court with that additional crucial matter which will demonstrate that an enactment is constitutional. Having this important goal as its basis, this statutory notice provision deserves to be vigilantly enforced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Sendak, Attorney General v. Debro, </em>264 Ind. 323, 327, 343 N.E.2d 779, 781-82 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The Attorney General submits that Petitioners\u2019 failure to give notice deprives the circuit court of jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment. There are decisions which speak of a lack of jurisdiction to proceed, absent the notice. See <em>Smith v. City of Florence, </em>288 Ala. 61, 256 So.2d 893 (1971); <em>Sullivan v. Murphy, </em>279 Ala. 202, 183 So.2d 798 (1966); <em>Plantation Pipeline Co. v. City of Bremen, </em>225 Ga. 607, 170 S.E.2d 398 (1969); <em>Williams v. Kaylor, </em>218 Ga. 576, 129 S.E.2d 791 (1963); <em>Hydraulic Press Brick Co. v. City of Independence, </em>38 Ohio App.2d 37, 311 N.E.2d 873 (1974); <em>McCabe v. City of Milwaukee, </em>53 Wis.2d 34, 191 N.W.2d 926 (1971); <em>Tobin v. Pursel, </em>539 P.2d 361 (Wyo. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has taken the view that notice to the Attorney General and an opportunity for that official to be heard \u201care conditions precedent to the entry of a declaratory decree.\u201d <em>Court St. Parking Co. v. City of Boston, </em>336 Mass. 224, 226, 143 N.E.2d 683, 685, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>355 U.S. 272, 78 S.Ct. 331, 2 L.Ed.2d 257 (1957). \u201cBut the lack of power to enter such a decree of course does not impair the general equitable jurisdiction of the Superior Court which was invoked by the bills of complaint to prevent irreparable injury by enjoining invalid action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Court St. Parking, </em>the lower court entered a declaratory decree, without notice to the Attorney General. It upheld the constitutionality of a condemnation statute. The Supreme Judicial Court, in an appeal at which the Attorney General appeared, agreed that the statute was constitutional. For that reason the court considered it unnecessary to determine whether the notice requirement was fulfilled by the Attorney General\u2019s appearance at the appellate level. The court reversed the declaratory decree and entered a mandate dismissing the complaints on the merits, saying that \u201c[t]he same end of a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the validity of the statutes is now served[.]\u201d 336 Mass, at 232, 143 N.E.2d at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In <em>Lumberton Mun. Util. Dist. v. Cease, </em>596 S.W.2d 601 (Tex.Civ.App.1980), the trial court had temporarily enjoined a tax district from levying or collecting any taxes. The complaint had raised both constitutional and nonconstitutional grounds, but the complainants had not notified the Attorney General. The injunction was predicated on non-constitutional grounds. On appeal the court held that \u201c[t]he failure to give notice to the Attorney General did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to grant relief on other legal <em>\\i.e., </em>nonconstitutional] grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We need not fathom how other courts have used \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in their opinions on the issue before us because, under Maryland law, failure to give notice is not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense. In <em>Givner v. Cohen, </em>208 Md. 23, 116 A.2d 357 (1955), the dismissal of a bill for declaratory judgment was affirmed. Among many reasons supporting the result this Court pointed out that \u201c[a] bill for a declaratory decree or judgment cannot be maintained, at least against a demurrer, without compliance with\u201d the notice requirement. 208 Md. at 31, 116 A.2d at 360. The principal reason for dismissal, however, was that the issue of the constitutionality of warrantless searches by officers of the Baltimore City Health Department was not presented in a sufficiently concrete fashion to be justiciable. We so interpreted <em>Givner </em>in <em>Hatt v. Anderson, </em>297 Md. 42, 46, 464 A.2d 1076, 1078-79 (1983). If failure to give notice deprives a circuit court of jurisdiction over the subject matter, it would have been unnecessary in <em>Givner </em>to say any more than that to support dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In other cases this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have noted a violation of CJ \u00a7 3-405(e) without dismissing for want of subject matter jurisdiction or, indeed, without imposing any sanction whatsoever. <em>See Harden v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>277 Md. 399, 404 n. 3, 354 A.2d 817, 819-20 n. 3 (1977); <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Calvert County v. East Prince Frederick Corp., </em>80 Md.App. 78, 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>n. 1, 559 A.2d 822 n. 1, <em>cert, granted, </em>317 Md. 609, 565 A.2d 1033 (1989); <em>Bama, Inc. v. Anne Arundel County, </em>53 Md.App. 14, 26 n. 4, 451 A.2d 1261, 1268 n. 4 (1982), <em>cert, denied, </em>295 Md. 529 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Thus, the circuit court was not deprived of jurisdiction over the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The true issue concerning Petitioners\u2019 violation of CJ \u00a7 3-405(c) is whether a sanction should be imposed or a remedy fashioned and, if so, what it should be. Any sanction or remedy should be designed to achieve the purpose of the statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">If, without notice to the Attorney General, a trial court proceeds to judgment and invalidates an enactment on constitutional grounds, an appropriate remedy, if requested, may well be to vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings after notice to the Attorney General. <em>See Sendak v. Debro, supra; Lazo v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Bernalillo, </em>102 N.M. 35, 690 P.2d 1029 (1984). If, under the same assumption, and after remand, an Attorney General were to choose not to be heard on the rehearing, the trial court may reenter its prior judgment. <em>See Lakewood Pawnbrokers, Inc. v. City of Lakewood, </em>182 Colo. 315, 512 P.2d 1241 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In the instant case the circuit court declared the Ordinance to be invalid on nonconstitutional grounds. The Attorney General\u2019s motion and amicus brief in this Court evidence that the Attorney General now has notice, but the Attorney General indicates no interest in arguing to us that the circuit court\u2019s judgment on the merits was erroneous. Indeed, the Attorney General agrees that \u201c[t]he circuit court held the [Ordinance invalid on nonconstitutional grounds.\u201d Brief of State of Maryland as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>in Support of Appellee, at 3. In Part IV, <em>infra, </em>we shall hold that the circuit court ruled correctly on the merits. Under all of these circumstances the purpose of CJ \u00a7 3-405(c) has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>been substantially served. There is no need further to remedy Petitioners\u2019 failure to give notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The County, disagreeing with the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of CJ \u00a7 3-405(c), submits that Petitioners\u2019 allegation that the Ordinance violates St. Mary\u2019s County Code \u00a7 109-2.C is an allegation that the Ordinance is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d within the meaning of CJ \u00a7 3-405(e). The argument is that the term \u201cunconstitutional\u201d embraces any organic law, the violation of which by a dependent law renders the latter invalid. We disagree. That has not been the interpretation in practice when an ordinance of a charter county is alleged to be invalid for violation of the county charter or of the Express Powers Act (even when those allegations were coupled with claimed violations of Maryland Const., Art. XI-A). See, <em>e.g., Montgomery Citizens League v. Greenhalgh, </em>253 Md. 151, 252 A.2d 242 (1969); <em>Scull v. Montgomery Citizens League, </em>249 Md. 271, 239 A.2d 92 (1967). '</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Petitioners also seek reversal of the requirement laid down by the Court of Special Appeals that Petitioners join the owners of the other lots in Longview Beach tax district in order for the case to proceed. The issue is one of compulsory joinder and is primarily controlled by Md.Rule 2-211(a), see n. 5, <em>supra. </em>The Declaratory Judgment Act, CJ \u00a7 3-405(a), see n. 4, <em>supra, </em>also contains a compulsory joinder provision. \u201cGenerally there is no difference in the rule as to necessary parties between a declaratory judgment proceeding and any other proceeding <em>in </em>personam.\u201d <em>Maryland Naturopathic Ass\u2019n v. Kloman, </em>191 Md. 626, 631, 62 A.2d 538, 540 (1948) (emphasis in original omitted); <em>Staley v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>189 Md. 447, 456, 56 A.2d 144, 148 (1947). We shall therefore analyze whether the other owners in the tax district must be made parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>either individually or as members of a class, in terms of Md.Rule 2-211(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The Court of Special Appeals rested its holding on both aspects of Md.Rule 2-211(a)(2) when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cDisposition of the action, in the absence of [other lot owners in the district], will impede or impair their ability to protect a claimed interest. Further, public officials charged with implementing the [Ordinance may incur multiple or inconsistent obligations absent joinder of necessary parties in this suit. Inclusion of persons owning property within the scope of the [Ordinance is, therefore, mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">79 Md.App. at 421, 557 A.2d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Petitioners submit that this is a taxpayers\u2019 action against public officials and that, in that type of action, joinder of other property owners has not been required. The County says that the instant action is not a taxpayers\u2019 suit at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">In their complaint Petitioners describe themselves as \u201cproperty owners and taxpayers in Longview Beach whose properties will be subject to a special taxing district tax.\u201d The complaint does not go on to say that Petitioners bring the action for the benefit of all other taxpayers in the tax district. The County argues, without citation of authority, that the omission is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">One aspect of the concept of a taxpayer\u2019s suit concerns the standing of the plaintiff to sue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">\u201cUnder Maryland law, the doctrine of taxpayer\u2019s standing is not as narrowly limited as it is under the law of some jurisdictions. \u2018In Maryland, taxpayers have standing to bring suit to challenge the constitutionality of a statute when the statute as applied increases their taxes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-12\"><em>State v.

Board of Supervisors of Elections for Montgomery County, </em>311 Md. 512, 516 n. 3, 536 A.2d 641, 643 n. 3 (1988), we held that a challenge to charter amendments, based on conflict with public general law, could be asserted by a single taxpayer. The ability of the, plaintiff to proceed in these cases has not, turned on whether the plaintiff alleged that the suit was brought for the benefit of other taxpayers similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"AIm\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that Petitioners\u2019 attack on the Ordinance subjected the County \u201cto a substantial risk of incurring multiple or inconsistent obligations by reason of the ...' claimed interest\u201d of the nonjoined lot owners.' Md. Rule 2-211(a)(2). Perhaps the most forceful illustration of the lack of any substantial risk to the County of incurring multiple or inconsistent obligations is found in the \u201ctest\u201d cases. In those permissibly collusive actions a governmental body or private party seeks o\u00fat a taxpayer to' bring an action in order to obtain an adjudication concerning the validity of some public action, and the party seeking the determination pays the fees of counsel for the taxpayer plaintiff.

Moxley, </em>157 Md. 619, 147 A. 596 (1929). That case involved a benefit assessment for street improvements in a municipality in Prince George\u2019s County. In an earlier challenge by a different taxpayer the assessment legislation had been sustained by the circuit court. In <em>Holt v. Moxley </em>a second taxpayer challenged the same benefit assessment legislation on the same grounds. This Court applied the concept, traditional to equity practice, of virtual representation and held that the second action was barred by the first. In view of our holding premised on precedent, it is unnecessary for us to intimate any opinion on the possible application here of the <em>res judicata </em>aspects of <em>Holt v. Moxley. </em>We do address, however, the rationale employed by the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Appeals in disposing of Petitioners\u2019 citation to <em>Holt v. Moxley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Court of Special Appeals undertook to distinguish that case on the basis that it was a decision \u201creached prior to the adoption of Maryland Rules 2-231 [Class Actions] and 2-211 and \u00a7 3-405(a)(l) which require that all affected parties be given an opportunity to participate.\u201d 79 Md.App. at 420, 557 A.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The revision of the Maryland Rules which became effective July 1, 1984, did not abrogate all of the case law of pleading and practice which theretofore existed at law and in equity, and the new Maryland Rules do not purport to state within their text the universe of Maryland pleading and practice law. Rule l-201(c) states, in part, that \u201c[neither these rules nor omissions from these rules supersede common law or statute unless inconsistent with these rules.\u201d Further, as originally proposed by the Rules Committee, Rule 2-211 did not contain the introductory phrase, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law.\u201d <em>See </em>10 Md.Reg., Issue 10, at S-17 (May 13, 1983). The quoted introductory phrase was added to the rule \u201cto ensure that current case law on point is not abrogated.\u201d <em>See </em>Letter of August 1, 1983, from Judge John F. McAuliffe, Chairman, to the Judges of this Court, on file in the office of the Rules Committee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Thus, Rules 2-211 and 2-231 do not change the practice of allowing a taxpayer action without joinder of other taxpayers similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Nor do we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that lot owners in the district have interests, the protection of which may be impaired or impeded by adjudication of this action without joinder of those owners. That \u201cinterest,\u201d we infer, is in obtaining the roads and would be an \u201cinterest\u201d of those property owners who favor the public roads under the payment scheme provided by the Ordinance. But viewing a proposed public improvement as a benefit is not the kind of an interest with which Rule 2-211 and CJ \u00a7 3-405(a)(l) are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Rule 2-211 is substantially derived from Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. \u201c[T]he body of federal law developed in connection with [Fed.Rule 19] is useful authority in construing this rule.\u201d Niemeyer <em>&amp; </em>Richards, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>at 95 (1987). Describing Fed.R.Civ.P. 19, 3A J. Moore &amp; J. Lucas, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 19.07[2.-0], at 19-99 (2d ed. 1989), says: \u201cThe \u2018interest relating to the subject of the action,\u2019 that makes an absent person a party needed for just adjudication, must be a legally protected interest, and not merely a financial interest or interest of convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Thus, where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sought an injunction requiring a Florida real estate developer to cease further dredging of canals and to restore the canals to a depth of five to ten feet, the individual lot owners were not indispensable parties. <em>See United States v. Sexton Cove Estates, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 1293 (5th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 1306 (5th Cir.1976). And <em>see Jeffries v. Georgia Residential Fin.

Under the analysis set forth above, that is not a legally protected interest which compels joinder. Although Maryland appellate courts have not previously expressly addressed the question, cases factually analogous to that before us have arisen. These cases have some precedential value because a court is obliged to notice, <em>sua sponte, </em>the want of an indispensable party. <em>See Freeman v. Northwest Acceptance Corp., </em>754 F.2d 553 (5th Cir.1985); <em>McCowen v. Jamieson, </em>724 F.2d 1421 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Weisberg v.

Reindollar, </em>193 Md. 683, 69 A.2d 482 (1949).

The circuit court concluded that \u201cthe majority of the property owners whose property will benefit from the proposed construction or improvement,\u201d St. Mary\u2019s County Code, \u00a7 109-2.C(1), had not petitioned the County to build the roads. At a chambers conference the circuit judge had identified that issue as a threshold question. As requested by the court, the parties stipulated to the number of lots in Longview Beach (870), the number selected for initial assessment (466), and the number petitioning for the improvements (236). The circuit court necessarily concluded that the 404 nonabutting and unimproved lots in Longview Beach which were excluded from initial assessment would \u201cbenefit from the proposed construction or improvement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 109-2.C(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Section 109-2.C(1) addresses two aspects of the process, the petition by property owners requesting an ordinance and the ordinance providing the method for fixing the annual benefit assessments. Prior to the enactment of Ch. 681 of the Acts of 1978, \u00a7 109-2.C(1) had limited petitioning property owners to those whose property \u201cabuts on the road to be constructed or improved,\u201d and provided for the annual benefit assessment to be levied against the \u201cabutting properties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chapter 681 enlarged the class of property owners for both purposes from owners of abutting lots to owners of all benefited lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In laying the initial special benefit assessment in Long-view Beach, the County concluded that the 466 improved and unimproved but abutting lots in Longview Beach were benefited, but that the 404 unimproved, nonabutting lots were not benefited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The County took the same approach in deciding that the owners of unimproved, nonabutting lots were not eligible to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The standard for judicial review is set forth in <em>Leonardo v. County Comm\u2019rs of St. Mary\u2019s County, supra, </em>214 Md. at 308-09, 134 A.2d at 284, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201cIn the establishment of improvement districts, <em>within the restrictions of the applicable law, </em>broad discretion is vested in the municipal authorities, and this discretion is conclusive in the absence of evidence that its exercise was procured by fraud or that it is manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable, or that the assessment is palpably unjust and oppressive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Here the County\u2019s treatment of the unimproved, nonabutting lots is contradictory. In assessing not only improved lots abutting the proposed roads but also unimproved lots abutting the proposed roads the County found that unimproved lots enjoy a benefit. In assessing improved-lots not abutting the proposed roads the County found that lots which do not abut the proposed roads also enjoy a benefit. The omission of the unimproved, nonabutting lots from the assessment, and the omission of the owners of those lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>from the count of eligible voters, cannot be explained on the basis of absence of any benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In form the County has attempted to structure a tax district composed only of certain specified lots, consisting of the first members of a class which will open up to admit unabutting lots as they are improved. The prospective members of the class are limited to lots in Longview Beach. The Ordinance determines now that the unimproved, nonabutting lots will be assessed. It simply defers to some indefinite time in the future, not greater than twenty years, the imposition of any assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The legal effect of the Ordinance is to create a tax district consisting of the Longview Beach subdivision. The Ordinance in effect finds all lots in the subdivision are benefited to an extent sufficient to support some assessment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the Ordinance as we construe it, that is sufficient to require the owners of unimproved, nonabutting lots to be counted in determining whether the petition under \u00a7 109-2.C has been presented by \u201cthe majority of the property owners whose property will benefit from the proposed construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED.

There are actually 1,200 lots depicted on the subdivision plat of Longview Beach. Contiguous lots which are held in the same ownership, however, may be treated as one unit for all purposes relevant to this appeal. Thus, in this opinion the term \"lot\" means one of those units, unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\">. St. Mary\u2019s County Code (1978, 1989 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 109-2.C in its entirety reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201c(1) The County Commissioners may construct and improve roads and drainage incident to construction or improvement on or along private roads after the approval of a petition of the majority of the property owners whose property will benefit from the proposed construction or improvement, requesting that the roads be taken into the county road system. In addition, when requested by the property owners and on receipt of a petition signed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>majority of the property owners affected, the County Commissioners may construct and install sidewalk systems. In the exercise of the powers granted by this subsection, the County Commissioners, by proper ordinance passed in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 3 of Article 25 of the Annotated Code of this state, may adopt all necessary rules and conditions for the acceptance, construction and maintenance of roads or other authorized improvements by the county. The ordinance shall provide for the method of determination of the annual benefit assessments levied against the properties benefiting from the improvements for the purpose of reimbursing the county for the cost of the improvements and the time and manner of payment, but not to exceed twenty (20) years. Annual benefit assessments are a first lien upon the property against which they are assessed, until paid, subject only to prior state and county taxes, and if any property is sold for state and county taxes and there remains a surplus, then the County Commissioners may petition the Circuit Court to secure payment of their lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201c(2) Before the powers granted by this subsection are exercised, there must first be the petition of the property owners requesting improvements, public hearing upon the petition after ten (10) days\u2019 notice in a newspaper regularly published in St. Mary\u2019s County, approval of the petition by the majority vote of the County Commissioners and passage of a resolution pursuant to the authority of the section, setting forth the improvements being constructed, the property owners affected and all material terms of the annual benefit assessments levied to pay the cost of the improvements, or any reasonable portion of them, as determined by the County Commissioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">.
