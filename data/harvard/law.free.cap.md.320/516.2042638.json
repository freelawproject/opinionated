The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari to determine whether, at a pretrial hearing, the court (Thieme, J.) erred in denying Brooks\u2019s motion to compel disclosure of the State\u2019s informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">On March 4, 1988, Detectives Foote and Young of the Anne Arundel County Police Department were conducting an undercover operation in the Bywater community, a housing project in Annapolis. They drove into the area in an unmarked vehicle, accompanied by an informer, and bought cocaine from an individual while seated in their car. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>May 25, 1988, almost two months after the transaction, Brooks was arrested as the criminal agent and charged with distribution, possession with intent to distribute, and simple possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Prior to trial, Brooks moved to compel disclosure of the informer. He proffered to show that he had been misidentified as the seller and that the informer was a crucial witness to negate any police testimony to the contrary. The State conceded that the informer was present throughout the transaction and that he introduced the seller to the detectives. It maintained, however, that the State\u2019s privilege to conceal the identity of informers was applicable because the informer was not an integral part of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The court rejected Brooks\u2019s proffer and denied the motion. It ruled that disclosure is not required if the informer is a mere tipster so that, even if he accepted Brooks\u2019s proffer, \u201cthe only thing I\u2019ve heard is that at most [the informer] was a tipster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">At trial, Detective Foote testified that, prior to March 4, 1988, he had \u201creceived numerous names\u201d of individuals, including Brooks, who were suspected of dealing narcotics. He also testified that, on the day of the sale, Detective Young was driving the unmarked vehicle, the informer was sitting in the front passenger seat, and Detective Foote was sitting in the back seat, behind the informer. Detective Young stopped the vehicle so that the driver\u2019s side was next to the passenger\u2019s side of an already-parked white Chevrolet Nova. A tall, light-skinned black man was exiting the passenger side of the Nova. The informer knew him. Detective Young rolled down his window and the informer said, \u201cHey, Barry, can I holler at you for a minute?\u201d The man came over to Detective Young\u2019s window and discussed with Young the type and quantity of narcotic he was seeking. The man thereafter said he would return. He walked towards the housing project and returned in five minutes, getting into the back seat of the car behind Detective Young and exchanging money for a package of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>later was tested to be cocaine. He told the detectives to come to a housing project in the Newtown area, near Bywater, if they wanted more cocaine. He then left the vehicle. According to Detective Foote, at no time did the seller stand next to the passenger\u2019s side of the unmarked car, where the informer was sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Detective Young gave a substantially similar version of the transaction. However, contrary to Detective Foote\u2019s testimony, Detective Young said that it was the informer, not he, who initiated discussion about purchasing narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Neither detective had met Brooks before the day in question, and the police report written the day after the transaction only identified Brooks by height and weight. Detective Foote testified that he had seen Brooks on approximately four prior occasions, always in-the Newtown area. He remembered seeing him once alone, twice in a crowd of mostly \u201cdark-skinned, black males,\u201d and once driving a white Chevrolet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On none of these occasions did Detective Foote approach him. The detective also testified that he had seen a photograph of Brooks prior to the day of the unlawful transaction, but that his identification of Brooks at trial was based on the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Detective Young testified that he had seen Brooks on about five occasions before March 4,1988, but that he could not have described Brooks\u2019s weight or any identifying characteristics before the day of the transaction; he had known only that Brooks was a tall, light-skinned black man. Detective Young had run a check on the license plate of the Chevrolet that they had seen driven by an individual thought to be Brooks, and learned that Brooks owned the vehicle. The detective did not run a similar check on the license plate of the white Nova which was observed on March 4. The detective also saw the photograph of Brooks approximately two days after the transaction. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>detective reexamined the photograph in the subsequent seven months before trial, and there was no evidence that they saw Brooks in person again during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Brooks did not present any evidence. He noted in closing argument that neither detective, either at the time of the transaction or at trial, had commented on Brooks\u2019s facial scar or his two gold-trimmed teeth as assisting them in identifying him.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Brooks argued that Judge Thieme committed reversible error when he denied the motion to compel disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity. He claimed that Judge Thieme mislabelled the informer a \u201ctipster,\u201d and then failed to weigh Brooks\u2019s specific claim of misidentification against the State\u2019s interest in withholding the identity of the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed that the informer was not a mere \u201ctipster.\u201d It reasoned that the informer issue was \u201cmid-point along a spectrum which is free of ambiguity at both ends.\u201d It held that, had the informer been a mere \u201ctipster,\u201d his disclosure would not have been required. On the other hand, it said that had the informer been an active participant in the crime itself, his disclosure could be compelled. The court then held that, as a witness, the informer stood between the two categories and that, in those circumstances, the law entrusts the disclosure decision to the wide discretion of the judge at the pretrial hearing. The court concluded that Judge Thieme had fairly exercised his discretion in denying the motion. It also found that, in making the motion, Brooks was \u201cinvolved either on a fishing expedition or an opportunity to make procedural mischief for future appellate purposes.\u201d In so holding, the intermediate appellate court determined that Judge Thieme\u2019s decision not to compel disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity was fortified by the fact that the two officers had seen Brooks on three or four previous occasions, had seen his vehicle, and had identified his photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The State\u2019s privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of its informers has long been recognized, not only in Maryland, <em>Drouin v. State, </em>222 Md. 271, 279,160 A.2d 85 (1960), but throughout the country. <em>McCray v. Illinois, </em>386 U.S. 300, 308, 87 S.Ct. 1056,1061,18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967). The purpose of the privilege is to further and protect the public interest in effective law enforcement. <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, 627, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201c \u2018Communications of this kind ought to receive encouragement. They are discouraged if the informer\u2019s identity is disclosed____ Law enforcement officers often depend upon professional informers to furnish them with a flow of information about criminal activities. Revelation of the dual role played by such persons ends their usefulness to the government and discourages others from entering into a like relationship.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\"><em>McCray, </em>386 U.S. at 308-09, 87 S.Ct. at 1061 (quoting 8 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 2374 (McNaughton rev. 1961)). The informer\u2019s privilege is especially important \u201c \u2018in the enforcement of ... narcotics laws, [since] it is all but impossible to obtain evidence for prosecution save by the use of decoys. There are rarely complaining witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 206, 210-11, n. 6, 87 S.Ct. 424, 427 n. 6, 17 L.Ed.2d 312 (1966) (quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.10, comment, p. 16 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1959)). <em>Accord McCray, </em>386 U.S. at 312, 87 S.Ct. at 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">While the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the anonymity of its informers is manifestly important, that interest is necessarily circumscribed by the defendant\u2019s interest in a fair trial. In this regard, the Supreme Court held in <em>Roviaro, </em>its seminal case on this issue, that the privilege is limited by fundamental fairness requirements when determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. \u201cWhere the disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the privilege must give way.\u201d 353 U.S. at 60-61, 77 S.Ct. at 627-628. This is the applicable standard when determining whether the State\u2019s privilege accedes to the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of due process and confrontation. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 870,102 S.Ct. 3440, 3448, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 4-263(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In that same vein, the Court held that the privilege is limited to its underlying purpose. <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 60, 77 S.Ct. at 627. Thus, once the identity of the informer has been disclosed to those who would resent the communication, the privilege no longer applies if its purpose of protecting the anonymity of the informer is no longer served. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><em>Roviaro </em>did not impose any absolute rule of when an informer\u2019s identity must be disclosed. <em>Id. </em>353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628. <em>See also McCray, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 311, 87 S.Ct. at 1062. Instead, the Court required trial judges to balance the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare a defense. <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628. \u201cWhether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court suggested three defenses for which an informer\u2019s identity could be vital: entrapment, lack of knowledge of the contents of a package, and, as in this case, mistaken identity. <em>Id. </em>353 U.S. at 64, 77 S.Ct. at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In <em>Roviaro, </em>the informer and the accused were the sole participants in a drug transaction, the testifying police officers only listened to the transaction or watched it from afar, the accused did not know the informer, and the defense was entrapment. The Court, applying its balancing test, held that the informer\u2019s name should have been released. In so holding, it noted that the informer\u2019s \u201cpossible testimony was highly relevant and might have been helpful to the defense,\u201d <em>id. </em>353 U.S. at 63-64, 77 S.Ct. at 629-630, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>part because he was the \u201conly witness [other than the accused] in a position to amplify or contradict the testimony of government witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>353 U.S. at 64, 77 S.Ct. at 629.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Relying on <em>Roviaro, </em>we interpreted the nondisclosure privilege to be inapplicable \u201cwhenever the informer was an integral part of the illegal transaction.\u201d <em>McCoy v. State, </em>216 Md. 332, 337, 140 A.2d 689, <em>cert. denied, sub nom., McCoy v. Pepersack, </em>358 U.S. 853, 79 S.Ct. 82, 3 L.Ed.2d 87 (1958). We noted that \u201c[t]he cases universally recognize the exception to the nondisclosure privilege where the informer was a participant, accessory or witness to the crime.\u201d <em>Gulick v. State, </em>252 Md. 348, 354, 249 A.2d 702 (1969). Judge Orth, in <em>Nutter v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 635, 639, 262 A.2d 80 (1970), clarified the disclosure requirement in regard to an informer who witnesses the unlawful transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">\u201c \u2018[Witness\u2019 as used in <em>Gulick </em>means a material witness, in the sense that his testimony is <em>important </em>to a fair determination of the cause. It is then that his identity becomes necessary and relevant to a fair defense. Thus in this context \u2018material\u2019 may be said to have a meaning more restrictive than its usual meaning. So, although an eyewitness to a crime is clearly a \u2018material\u2019 witness as that word is ordinarily used, if he is an informer, simply observing an illegal transaction but not participating in it, the fact that he observes the transaction does not necessarily make his possible testimony so important as to compel disclosure of his identity in the face of the rationale of the nondisclosure privilege.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The decision to compel disclosure of an informer is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Gulick, </em>252 Md. at 354, 249 A.2d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">We have stressed that trial courts must apply the <em>Roviaro </em>balancing test in each case, regardless of the labels attached to the informer\u2019s role. <em>Gulick, </em>252 Md. at 354, 249 A.2d 702; <em>Drouin, supra, </em>222 Md. at 286, 160 A.2d 85. Clearly, the practical application of the balancing test is more rudimentary in some cases. For example, we recognize that the privilege ordinarily applies where the informer is a mere \u201ctipster,\u201d who supplies a lead to law enforcement officers but is not present at the crime, while disclosure is usually required when the informer is a participant in the actual crime. <em>United States v. Brinkman, </em>739 F.2d 977, 981 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Jones v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 101, 110, 466 A.2d 895 (1983). Contrary to the view taken by the Court of Special Appeals in this case, the balancing test should be applied in all cases. As noted in <em>Nutter, </em>the key element is not the role of the informer, but the materiality of his testimony to the determination of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence balanced against the State\u2019s interest in protecting the identity of the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We thus reject the State\u2019s contention that the nondisclosure privilege applies when an informer merely points out or introduces a defendant to an undercover officer and is only a witness to, not a participant in, the illegal transaction. Such a rule would ignore the required <em>Roviaro </em>balancing test. Indeed, virtually all the cases cited by the State in favor of this proposition applied the <em>Roviaro </em>test to the particular facts of the case before concluding that disclosure was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">A number of jurisdictions confronted with claimed misidentification cases similar to the instant case have balanced the State\u2019s interest in nondisclosure against the accused\u2019s interest in the informer\u2019s testimony and have found the latter interest to prevail. <em>State v. Blyther, </em>287 S.C. 31, 336 S.E.2d 151 (Ct.App.1985), <em>cited with approval in State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Burney, </em>294 S.C. 61, 362 S.E.2d 635 (1987) (disclosure required where informer introduced s\u00e9ller by different last name, and where police report written by testifying officer did not describe seller as having defendant\u2019s moustache or missing teeth, and did not accurately describe defendant\u2019s height); <em>State v. Wandix, </em>590 S.W.2d 82 (Mo.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>445 U.S. 972, 100 S.Ct. 1665, 64 L.Ed.2d 248 (1980) (disclosure required even though informer initroduced seller by defendant\u2019s name, because defendant had alibi and testifying officer had only seen defendant once before sale); <em>State v. Tuell, </em>112 Ariz. 340, 541 P.2d 1142 (1975) (disclosure required where sale occurred in defendant\u2019s house because officer\u2019s description of defendant \u201cLarry\u201d more accurately described defendant\u2019s housemate \u201cGary\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Carter, </em>427 Pa. 53, 233 A.2d 284 (1967) (disclosure required where testifying officers only knew defendant from sale in question). <em>See also United States v. Ayala, </em>643 F.2d 244 (5th Cir.1981) (disclosure required where informer was present and both informer and testifying officer knew defendant only from sale in question); <em>Sims v. State, </em>313 So.2d 27 (Miss.1975) (disclosure normally required where informers are present, since there is usually nothing secret, confidential or \u201cundercover\u201d about who they are).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Jurisdictions that have denied disclosure in mistaken identity cases have also relied ,on the <em>Roviaro </em>balancing test. <em>United States v. Soles, </em>482 F.2d 105 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>414 U.S. 1027, 94 S.Ct. 455, 38 L.Ed.2d 319 (1973) (privilege applied where it was highly unlikely that police officer who spent substantial periods of time with defendant making two drug transactions was mistaken as to defendant\u2019s identity); <em>State v. Milligan, </em>71 N.J. 373, 365 A.2d 914 (1976) (privilege applied even though officer\u2019s description of defendant had minor mistakes where narcotic sale occurred in defendant\u2019s house and not on street).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In <em>People v. Goggins, </em>34 N.Y.2d 163, 356 N.Y.S.2d 571, 313 N.E.2d 41, <em>cert, denied, </em>419 U.S. 1012, 95 S.Ct. 332, 42 L.Ed.2d 286 (1974), the New York Court of Appeals held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>two factually similar consolidated cases that disclosure was warranted in one case but not in the other. Both cases involved an informer introducing an undercover officer to a narcotics dealer who then sold narcotics to the officer on two separate occasions. In the first case, the sales were made in a public bar; in the second case, they were made in the defendant\u2019s apartment. The officer\u2019s opportunity to identify the defendant as the seller was better in the second case than in the first. These facts were pivotal in the court\u2019s holding that there was a colorable factual dispute on the issue of identity in the first case but not the second. <em>Goggins </em>demonstrates that \u201cthe truly crucial factor in every case is the relevance of the informer\u2019s testimony to the guilt or innocence of the accused,\u201d 356 N.Y.S.2d at 576, 313 N.E.2d at 45, and not the label attached to the informer\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that Judge Thieme properly exercised his discretion when denying Brooks\u2019s motion to disclose the identity of the informer. As we see it, the trial judge erroneously labelled the informer a \u201ctipster;\u201d he then erred when he held that this determination, in effect, replaced his duty to balance Brooks\u2019s claim of misidentification against the State\u2019s interest in protecting the informer\u2019s identity. The intermediate appellate court seemingly ignored the possibility that Brooks requested the disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity because he truly was misidentified by the police as the seller, and was therefore not at the scene of the crime to know the informer\u2019s identity. In these circumstances, it is hardly beyond reason that the informer, who knew the seller, might exonerate him. The measure of that possibility is for the trial court to determine, applying the balancing test set forth in <em>Roviaro, </em>based on the record made at the pretrial hearing. In this regard, we note that the intermediate appellate court inappropriately relied on the prosecution testimony at trial to support Judge Thieme\u2019s denial of the motion to disclose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>As with pretrial suppression hearings, <em>see Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670-71, 521 A.2d 749 (1987), the appellate court reviews only the record made at the pretrial motion to disclose, and not the record of the trial itself, in determining whether it was error to deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We conclude, in the circumstances of this case, that Brooks must be afforded a new trial. Whether Brooks\u2019s motion to compel disclosure of the informer\u2019s identity should be granted upon retrial is governed by the principles set forth in this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.
