It was asserted that the fall was due to the \u201cslippery, hazardous, dangerous and defective design and condition of the steps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">The case was tried before Circuit Judge Mary Arabian and a jury on October 27 and 28, 1986. At the conclusion of all of the evidence on October 28th, Judge Arabian granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial on November 6, 1986, and it was denied on November 17, 1986. Twenty-nine days later, on December 16, 1986, the plaintiffs filed a request for review by a court in banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">A court in banc, consisting of Judges Pines, Gordy and Noel, after receiving memoranda and hearing oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ment, filed an opinion and order on January 26, 1988. The court in banc mandated that the \u201cdecision of the trial court is hereby REVERSED and it is hereby ORDERED that the case be set in for a new trial.\u201d The defendant had not, either before Judge Arabian or before the in banc court, raised any issue concerning the timeliness under Maryland Rule 2-551(b) of the request for in banc review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The defendant on February 24, 1988, filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals, on its own motion, dismissed the appeal on the ground that the January 26, 1988, order by the court in banc was not a final appealable judgment. <em>Dabrowski v. Dondalski, </em>77 Md.App. 747, 551 A.2d 933 (1989). The Court of Special Appeals relied on a decision dismissing an appeal from the grant of a new trial by a single circuit judge, <em>Feinberg v. Geo. Wash. Cemetery, </em>233 Md. 440, 197 A.2d 147 (1964). The intermediate appellate court also cited two cases involving appeals from final judgments, where this Court indicated that a single trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewable on appeal only for abuse of discretion. <em>See Martin v. Rossignol, </em>226 Md. 363, 366-367, 174 A.2d 149 (1961); <em>Brinand v. Denzik, </em>226 Md. 287, 292-293, 173 A.2d 203 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The defendant filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, raising essentially three questions: (1) whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the decision of the in banc court was not a final judgment; (2) whether the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file the notice of in banc review within ten days after Judge Arabian denied the' motion for new trial, as required by Rule 2-551(b), requires that this Court vacate the decisions of the Court of Special Appeals and of the in banc court; (3) whether Rule 2-551(b), permitting a request for in banc review to be filed within ten days after the trial court\u2019s judgment, instead of requiring that it be filed on the same day as the trial court\u2019s ruling, is unconstitutional in light of Art. IV, \u00a7 22, of the Maryland Constitution and <em>Costigin v. Bond, </em>65 Md. 122, 3 A. 285 (1886). <em>See Montgomery County v. McNeece, </em>311 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Md. 194, 533 A.2d 671 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant obviously urged an affirmative answer with regard to all three questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">This Court granted the petition, 316 Md. 107, 557 A.2d 255, and our order encompassed all three questions presented. Nonetheless, as we agree with the defendant\u2019s position concerning the first two questions, we shall not reach the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">It is clear that the decision of the court in banc was a final order appealable to the Court of Special Appeals under Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Art. IV, \u00a7 22, of the Maryland Constitution. Our decision in <em>Estep v. Estep, </em>285 Md. 416, 420-421, 404 A.2d 1040 (1979), is dispositive. In <em>Estep, </em>as in the present case, an appeal was taken from a circuit court decision to a court in banc; the court in banc reversed and ordered further proceedings in the circuit court; the appellee before the court in banc took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal. Reversing the Court of Special Appeals, this Court, in an opinion by Judge J. Dudley Digges, stated (285 Md. at 420-421, 404 A.2d at 1042-1043):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cIn addressing the initial issue of the propriety of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal of petitioner\u2019s request for review, we find that we are at somewhat of a loss because that court failed to further explain the reason for its decision, other than to say the appeal was \u2018not allowed by law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">* * * * * Jit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201cIf, as petitioner has suggested, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal to it as interlocutory because the court in banc, after reversing the circuit court\u2019s decision, remanded the case for further action on the respondent\u2019s petition for modification, such a ruling by the Court of Special Appeals would be in error. In holding that a non-moving party\u2019s appeal from the decision of a court in banc to grant a new trial would be timely only if it were made immediately, rather than after the new trial was conducted, this Court in <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 187-88, 304 A.2d 826, 828 (1973), clearly indicated that the court in banc acts only as an appellate tribunal so that its decisions are not those of a reconsidering trial court but are reviewable as final appellate judgments. Thus, we find no grounds for the dismissal by the Court of Special Appeals of the petitioner\u2019s appeal and will reverse that action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Judge Digges for the Court went on to note as follows (285 Md. at 421 n. 5, 404 A.2d at 1043 n. 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cIn <em>Dobson v. Mulcare, </em>26 Md.App. 699, 704-05, 338 A.2d 898, 901-02, <em>cert, denied, </em>276 Md. 741 (1975), the Court of Special Appeals indicated that our decision in <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 304 A.2d 826 (1973), had established an exception to the general rule that orders granting a new trial are not appealable. This interpretation of the holding of <em>Buck </em>is erroneous, however, for while it is true that an order granting a new trial is not generally appeal-able, <em>e.g., A.S. Abell Co. v. Skeen, </em>265 Md. 53, 59-60, 288 A.2d 596, 599 (1972); <em>Carlile v. Two Guys, </em>264 Md. 475, 477, 287 A.2d 31, 33 (1972), this applies only to such orders when they are issued by a trial court and not to the ordering of a new trial following review by an appellate court. As in <em>Buck, </em>the court in banc here was an appellate court for this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Consequently, in the present case, the Court of Special Appeals erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of a final appealable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Rule 2-551(b), effective July 1, 1986, requires that the notice for in banc review be filed within ten days after entry of judgment or, when a timely motion is filed pursuant to Rules 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534, within ten days of an order disposing of the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore the plaintiffs\u2019 request for in banc review should have been filed within ten days of November 17, 1986. Instead, it was filed twenty-nine days after November 17, 1986. Under these circumstances, it was error for the in banc court to have exercised jurisdiction over the appeal. Judge Arabian\u2019s order of November 17, 1986, not having been appealed in a timely manner, terminated this case. The in banc court should have dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">A situation very similar to that in the instant case was presented in <em>Walbert v. Walbert, </em>310 Md. 657, 531 A.2d 291 (1987), where an in banc court also entertained an appeal which had been noticed beyond the ten-day period set forth in Rule 2-551(b). In <em>Walbert, </em>as in this case, neither party brought to the in banc court\u2019s attention the untimeliness of the appeal. In ordering that the decision of the in banc court be vacated, we said (310 Md. at 662, 531 A.2d at 293):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that the timeliness of an order of appeal is \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019 and that if an appeal is not filed within the prescribed time, \u2018the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction and the appeal must be dismissed.\u2019 <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>305 Md. 407, 413, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986), and cases there cited. <em>See also State Highway Admin, v. Kee, </em>309 Md. 523, 528 n. 2, 525 A.2d 637 (1987) (\u2018Appealability is jurisdictional\u2019). Whether this means that the order of an appellate court, where the appellate court incorrectly or inadvertently assumes jurisdiction over an untimely appeal and decides the merits, is void and is to be treated as a nullity for all purposes, is a matter which we need not explore in the present case. It is sufficient to point out that when a case reaches this Court, we will, notice <em>sua sponte </em>the untimeliness of an earlier order of appeal in the same case, regardless of whether the issue had been raised by a party or considered by the trial court or by an intermediate appellate court. <em>See generally, e.g., State Highway Admin, v. Kee, supra, </em>309 Md. at 528, 525 A.2d 637; <em>Blucher v. Elstrom, </em>309 Md. 458, 524 A.2d 1235 (1987); <em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 231, 503 A.2d 239 (1986); <em>Snowden v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, </em>300 Md. 555, 560, 479 A.2d 1329 (1984); <em>Highfield Water Co. v. Wash. Co. San., </em>295 Md. 410, 414, 456 A.2d 371 (1983); <em>King v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>294 Md. 236, 240-241, 449 A.2d 390 (1982).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As in <em>Walbert, </em>we shall direct that the order of the in banc court be vacated, leaving intact as the final judgment Judge Arabian\u2019s order of November 17, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JANUARY 26, 1988, ORDER OF THE IN BANC COURT, AND TO REMAND, THE CASE TO ,THE IN BANC COURT WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THE IN BANC COURT DISMISS THE APPEAL. RESPONDENTS TO PAY COSTS IN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">. The same constitutional issue was raised in the <em>McNeece </em>case. This Court\u2019s judgment in that case, affirming the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal of an appeal from an in banc court, was not based upon a resolution of the constitutional issue. Nevertheless, four of the judges sitting in <em>McNeece </em>expressed the view that the ten-day provision of Rule 2-551(b) was constitutional, and three of the judges expressed the view that it was unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">. Rule 2-551 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c(a) Generally. \u2014 When a review by a court in banc is permitted by the Maryland Constitution, a party may have a judgment or determination of any point or question reviewed by a court in banc by filing a notice for in banc review. Issues are reserved for in banc review by making an objection in the manner set forth in Rules 2-517 and 2-520. Upon the filing of the notice, the Circuit Administration Judge shall designate three judges of the circuit, other than the judge who tried the action, to sit in banc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">(b) Time for Filing. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the notice for in banc review shall be filed within ten days after entry of judgment. When a timely motion is filed pursuant to Rule 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534, the notice for in banc review shall be filed within ten days after entry of an order denying a motion pursuant to Rule 2-533 or disposing of a motion pursuant to Rule 2-532 or 2-534. A notice for in banc review filed before the disposition of any of these motions that was timely filed shall have no effect, and a new notice for in banc review must be filed within the time specified in this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
