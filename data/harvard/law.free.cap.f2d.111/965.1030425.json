Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, 233 U.S. 157, 34 S.Ct. 550, 552, 58 L.Ed. 893, in that the present statute, as that there interpreted, likewise \u201ccreates a new liability and gives a special remedy for it, and upon well-settled principles the limitations upon such liability become a part of the right conferred, and compliance with them is made essential to the assertion and benefit of the liability itself\u201d, and the court being further of the view that the decision in United States for Use of A. Bryant Co. v. New York Steam Fitting Co., 235 U.S. 327, 35 S.Ct. 108, 59 L.Ed. 253, does not militate against this conclusion,</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-24\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment below be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
