From the order denying his petition, Bates appeals. The appellant contends, in his petition for the issuance of the writ, that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional and void by reason of the fact that said statute, as written at the time of his conviction, did not fix a maximum penalty for violation thereof. The statute, the constitutionality of which is doubted by Bates, at time of sentence read in part as follows: \u201cThat whoever shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or abet in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, any person who shall have been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kid-naped, abducted, or carried away by any means whatsoever and held for ransom or reward shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary for such term of years as the court, in its discretion, shall determine: Provided,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-19\">The appellant argues that the statute in question did not fix absolutely the maximum term for which he could be sentenced; that the Congress thereby illegally attempted to vest a legislative power in the judiciary; that the penalty for violating said Act is left entirely to the discretion of the court; \u201cthat no fixed penalty was incorporated therein and there was no general or related law which did have a maximum penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-20\">Harvey J. Bailey was one of appellant\u2019s codefendants; he was sentenced to life imprisonment and appealed from the judgment entered _upon conviction of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 408a, which is the identical section complained of here, and raised the same question as petitioner. The answer given by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Bailey v. United States, 74 F.2d 451, 452, concludes the matter:</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-21\">\u201cThe statute prescribes as punishment for the offense, \u2018imprisonment in the penitentiary for such term of years as the court, in its discretion, shall determine.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-22\">\u201cIt is our opinion that Congress did not use the phrase \u2018term of years\u2019 in the technical sense attributable to it when applied to estate in lands. Life being of limited duration and death being certain, a sentence for life is definite and certain. It is tantamount to a sentence for a definite term of years greater than the possible life span of the person sentenced. See Commonwealth v. Evans, 16 Pick [448], 33 Mass. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-23\">\u201cThe fixing of penalties for crimes is a legislative function. What constitutes an adequate penalty is a matter of legislative judgment and discretion, and the courts will not interfere therewith unless the penalty prescribed is clearly and manifestly cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-24\">\u201cWhere the sentence imposed is within the limits prescribed by the statute for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>offense committed, it ordinarily will not be regarded as cruel and unusual. [Cases cited.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">\u201cKidnaping is a heinous offense. A sentence to life imprisonment for transporting a kidnaped victim in interstate commerce, or for conspiracy so to transport a kidnaped person, is not, in our opinion, cruel and unusual punishment within the constitutional inhibition (Const.Amend. 8).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Entertaining the same view of the constitutionality of the provision for punishment of violators of the statute before us as the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, we affirm the order appealed from.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
