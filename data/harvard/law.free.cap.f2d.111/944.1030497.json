The item in dispute has to do with the base upon which depreciation on a certain building owned by the plaintiff is to be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">The plaintiff was incorporated May 6, 1931, as a means of refinancing the Pelham Hall Building in Brookline, Massachusetts. There were outstanding and in default $1,172,000 of bonds of the predecessor corporation, called Pelham Hall, Inc., which had constructed the building. The bondholders turned in their bonds to the plaintiff, in exchange for stock of the plaintiff at an agreed ratio. At the foreclosure sale the only bid on the building was one of $450,000 made on behalf of the plaintiff. The old bonds were surrendered in payment of the bid price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">In its income tax return for the fiscal year ending August 31, 1931, the plaintiff claimed the cost of the building to it to be $806,000 (which was its assessed value) and used this figure as the basis for calculating a deduction on account of depreciation. The Commissioner disallowed in part the claimed deduction for depreciation, insisting that the base must be reduced to $450,000, the bid price. Thereafter the plaintiff petitioned' the Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination of the deficiency, advancing in its petition the following proposition: \u201cThe price bid at the foreclosure sale of $450,000.00 is not conclusive as to the measure of cost of the property to the petitioner but that what occurred was an exchange of property (bonds of the old corporation) for property (assets of the old corporation) so that the basis for depreciation of the assets so received should be the fair market value of. the assets at the time of their receipt by the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">After taking evidence as to the fair .market value of the building when acquired by the plaintiff, the Board affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s determination. Recognizing that the cost of the building to the plaintiff was the value of the bonds given up in exchange for it, and that the bonds were worth the fair market value of the building mortgaged to secure them, the Board concluded that \u201calthough the bid itself does not conclusively establish the amount of the price actually paid, the evidence does not establish that the price was in fact more than the bid.\u201d Pelham Hall Co. v. Commissioner, 33 B.T.A. 329, decided October 30, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-18\">In its income tax return for the following fiscal year, ending August 31, 1932, the plaintiff again put down $806,000 as the cost of the building to it, and figured its deduction for depreciation on this basis. Again, the Commissioner reduced the cost basis to $450,000 and determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>a deficiency accordingly. On January 20, 1934, the plaintiff paid this deficiency assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">A claim for refund was filed with the Commissioner on January 15, 1936, in which the plaintiff stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">\u201cThe principal reason for the additional assessment was the disallowance of depreciation as claimed on the return, the Bureau of Internal Revenue claiming that the basis for depreciation of the building should be the bid-in price at the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">\u201cThe taxpayer contends that such bid-in price did not represent the fair value of the building when acquired and respectfully requests that the value as shown on the return be allowed and refund of the additional assessment be ordered accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">This refund claim was disallowed by the Commissioner on July 21, 1936, on the strength of the above-cited decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, dealing with the same issue which had arisen in the previous tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">On September 8, 1936, the present action was begun. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration set- forth that the deficiency assessment was erroneous, in that the Commissioner should have allowed the plaintiff \u201cto compute its depreciation as 2 percent of $806,000, the true capital base of the building known as Pelham Hall at the time it was acquired by the plaintiff\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-21\">Defendant\u2019s amended answer, which the District Court allowed to be filed on July 13, 1937, consisted of a general denial and an affirmative defense that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals in Pelham Hall Co. v. Commissioner, 33 B.T.A. 329, previously cited, rendered the issue presented in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-22\">Up to this point, the only dispute had been as to the \u201ccost\u201d of the building to the plaintiff under Section 113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-23\">Then came the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Commissioner v. Newberry Lumber &amp; Chemical Co., 94 F.2d 447, announced February 11, 1938, where the court held, in a transaction similar to that of the case at bar, that the refinancing operation was a tax-free reorganization and that under Section 114(a) in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Section 113(a) (7) of the Revenue Act the capital base for the reorganized corporation was the cost of the assets to the old corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Thereafter, on November 29, 1938, the ease came to trial. Taking its cue from the recent decision in the Newberry case, the plaintiff shifted from its ground for recovery set forth in the claim for refund, and sought to establish its right to take over the depreciation base of the predecessor corporation. The defendant adhered to the affirmative defense of res judicata, which the court below held was well taken. Judgment was given for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Without examining the res judicata point, we think there is a fatal defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case which we are bound to notice on the present record. The claim for refund filed by the plaintiff will not support a recovery of the alleged overpayment upon the new ground advanced for the first time at the trial in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Congress has made the filing of a timely claim for a refund a statutory prerequisite to the recovery back of taxes alleged to have been illegally collected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claim for refund filed by the plaintiff assumed the applicability of the general rule in Section 113(a) of the Revenue Act making the \u201ccost\u201d of the property to the taxpayer the basis for computing depreciation, and directed the Commissioner\u2019s attention' to an alleged error in this cost figure as allowed by him. No facts were set forth in the claim which would suggest to the Commissioner that another subsection \u2022 of the Revenue Act was applicable, that is, the exceptional provision in Section 113(a) (7) which would entitle the taxpayer to take over the cost base of the predecessor corporation. It may be that the facts as to the reorganization appeared in the Commissioner\u2019s files. This is immaterial. Dascomb v. McCuen, 2 Cir., 73 F.2d 417, 418. The Commissioner\u2019s attention was not directed to them as having a bearing on Section 113(a) (7) ; and it does not appear that the Commissioner was ever called upon to consider or ever did consider the reorganization provisions of the Revenue Act in passing on the claim for refund. Naturally enough, he did not, for the claim for refund set forth no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>facts indicating the cost of the building to the predecessor corporation, as would have been done, had the contention been advanced that Section 113(a) (7) was applicable. The claim for refund provoked quite a different line of investigation, involving a consideration of different questions, both of fact and law. Plainly, the claim for refund was not in compliance with the Commissioner\u2019s regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so far as the taxpayer seeks to interpret that claim as embracing the ground for recovery now insisted upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The exigencies of the case now put the plaintiff in somewhat of a dilemma. To combat the defense of res judicata it contends narrowly that the issues presently in question were never raised or litigated in the earlier proceedings, that: \u201cThe only question presented to the Board was \u00a3h,e fair value of the building at the. date of foreclosure. No evidence was ever presented to establish that there had been a tax-free reorganization or to establish the cost of the building to the predecessor company. These questions have never been adjudicated.\u201d But to sustain the adequacy of the claim for refund the plaintiff seeks to give the broadest possible interpretation of the issue there presented. In this connection it says: \u201cThe claim of refund clearly states that the plaintiff objects to the partial disallowance by the Commissioner of the plaintiff\u2019s deduction, for depreciation on the Pelham Hall building. This was and continues to be the dispute in regard to the tax in question. The Commissioner has insisted upon allowing depreciation on a base of only a rateable part of $450,-000, while the plaintiff has contended that it is entitled to use a base at least as great as $806,000'. Nothing can be clearer than that the claim of refund places this matter squarely in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">In the absence of a proper amendment or of an operative waiver by the Government,1 the taxpayer in suing for recovery back of taxes paid is confined to the scope of the grounds for refund asserted in the claim filed with .the Commissioner. United States v. Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg. Co., 283 U.S. 269, 272, 51 S.Ct. 376, 75 L.Ed. 1025; Real Estate-Land Title &amp; Trust Co. v. United. States, 309 U.S. 13, 60 S.Ct. 371, 84 L.Ed. \u2014; Snead v. Elmore, 5 Cir., 59 F.2d 312; Edwards v. Malley, 1 Cir., 109 F.2d 640, 645; Dascomb v. McCuen, 2 Cir., 73 F.2d 417, 418, 419; Taber v. United States, 8 Cir., 59 F.2d 568; H. Lissner Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 52 F.2d 1058. Looking at the claim for refund filed in this case we see that the \u201cground\u201d stated therein is not an unsupported assertion that the deduction for depreciation should have been larger; rather, the \u201cground\u201d is the specific reason assigned for a revision of this figure, namely, that the fair value of the building, rather than the bid price, should have been taken as the cost to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">It may be doubted whether after the lapse of the two years\u2019 statutory period for filing claims for refund the plaintiff could have amended the specific original claim, based upon an alleged erroneous determination of the cost of the building to the taxpayer, by shifting to the contention that the proper base was not the cost to the taxpayer but the cost to the predecessor corporation.. See United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., 302 U.S. 528, 58 S.Ct. 320, 82 L.Ed. 405; United States v. Andrews, 302 U.S. 517, 58 S.Ct. 315, 82 L.Ed. 398. No decision on this point is called for, however, because the taxpayer made no effort to amend the original claim and indeed in any event could not have made an effective amendment after the original claim had been disallowed by the Commissioner on July 21, 1936. See Edwards v. Malley, 1 Cir., 109 F.2d 640, 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">It is urged, however, that the. conduct of the defendant at the trial constituted a .waiver of any objection which the Government might have taken to the sufficiency of the claim for refund. Much reliance is placed upon Tucker v. Alexander, 275 U.S. 228, 48 S.Ct. 45, 72 L.Ed. 253. There the Commissioner had disallowed a refund claim based upon two specific grounds and the taxpayer in his suit abandoned the original grounds for refund and advanced a third ground which, by stipulation- of the parties, was the .sole issue litigated and decided. The case rests upon the fact that at the time the stipulation was' given, the taxpayer still could have filed a new claim for refund, the statutory period not yet hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ing run. The Government could have insisted at the trial that the claim for refund was insufficient to support a recovery on the new ground advanced; but not having done so, and having elected to litigate the new claim on its merits, it was obviously inequitable for the Government, after having caused the taxpayer to refrain from starting afresh by the filing of a new claim for refund, to raise this objection at a later stage. That this was a basis of the so-called \u201cwaiver\u201d was made clear in the later case of United States v. Garbutt Oil Co., 302 U.S. 528, 533-535, 58 S.Ct. 320, 82 L.Ed. 405, in which the court stated that the Conjmissioner had power, prior to the expiration of the period of limitation for the filing of claims for refund, to waive provisions of the Treasury Regulations as to the form of claims for refund; but held that no conduct by the Commissioner after the period for filing claims for refund had expired could amount 'to an effective waiver. See also Mohawk Mining Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 1939, 26 F.Supp. 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">In the present case it is doubtful whether there was any conduct by the G\u00f3vernment which could be even the starting point of a waiver.' No stipulation was filed as in Tucker v. Alexander, supra. It is true that the insufficiency of the claim for refund was not pleaded as a defense; but this was because the taxpayer\u2019s declaration in the court below was not a departure from the refund claim, and it was not until, the trial that the taxpayer advanced the new ground based upon the alleged tax-free reorganization. All that the defendant did was to adhere to the pleaded defense of res judicata. The ' defendant\u2019s failure at the trial to raise the additional point as to the insufficiency of the claim for refund did not prejudice the plaintiff in view of the fact that the statutory time for the filing of a claim for refund on the new ground advanced had long since elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">So far as the record shows, the plaintiff made no effort in the court below t\u00f3 prove its case on the ground asserted in the refund claim. Since no other ground was open to the plaintiff, it follows that the defendant was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-9\"> Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791:</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">\u201cSec.
