The difference between this total and the single premium payment of $23,069.75 was $7,564.25. This difference the petitioner treated in his 1935 income tax return as capital gain taxable under Section 117 of the Revenue Act of 1934, and reported thirty per cent thereof, or $2,269.27, as the amount to be \u201ctaken into account in computing net income.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commissioner determined that none of the $7,564.25 was capital gain but that all was ordinary income. The Board agreed with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Section 117(a) of the Revenue Act of 1934 provides that if a capital asset has been held for more than 10 years only 30 per cent of the gain \u201crecognized upon the <em>sale </em>or <em>exchange\u201d </em>thereof \u201cshall be taken into account in computing net income.\u201d 48 Stats. 680, 714. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The $25,000 payment was not received upon a \u201csale or exchange\u201d of the endowment contract unless Section 117(f) of the Revenue Act of 1934 is applicable. Fairbanks v. United States, 306 U.S. 436, 437, 59 S.Ct. 607, 83 L.Ed. 855; Bodine v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 103 F.2d 982, 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">Petitioner contends that Section 117(f) is applicable and that, consequently, under Section 117(a) only thirty per cent of the $7,564.25 is to be \u201ctaken into account in computing net income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">Section 117(f) provides that \u201c* * * amounts received by the holder upon the retirement of bonds, debentures, notes, or certificates or other evidences of indebtedness issued by any corporation * * *, with interest coupons or in registered form, shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-23\">The report of the Ways and Means Committee (73d Cong., 2d Sess. H. Rept. 704) states (p. 31) with reference to the provision enacted as Section 117(f^*: \u201cSubsection (f) provides that amounts received upon the retirement of corporate bonds and <em>similar </em>evidences of indebtedness shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-24\">The gross income provisions of Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932 included specific and separate provisions for the treatment of amounts received under life insurance, endowment and annuity contracts and prescribed a specific formula for the computation of the portion thereof to be included in gross income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specific and separate treatment was continued in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>gross income provisions of Section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1934,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which Act there appeared for the first time the provisions of Section 117(f). It is apparent that at least for purposes of the gross income provisions of Section 22, Congress did not regard endowment contracts as \u201csimilar\u201d to corporate bonds, but as so dissimilar as to warrant independent treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Petitioner\u2019s contention would require us to hold that the formula provided in the first sentence of Section 22(b) (2) either is not applicable or is superfluous in instances of payment at maturity of endowment contracts. The superfluous or useless character is illustrated by the fact that the act of computing gross income under Section 22(b) (2) would be without significance because the gain of which the percentage is taken under Section 117(a) is computed by a different formula. The difference in formula is illustrated by the fact that under the first sentence of Section 22(b) (2) the minuend is the total of the amounts received in the tax year and prior years or, here, $30,634, whereas in computing capital gain the minuend could not exceed $25,000 because under Section 117(f) it is provided that \u201camounts received * * * <em>upon the retirement' </em>of * * * shall be considered as amounts received in exchange therefor,\u201d and the most that could be considered as \u201creceived * * * <em>upon the retirement </em>* * * \u201d would be the $25,000 payment. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We are of the view that Congress did not intend that the specific formula for computation of the gain under an endowment contract to be included in gross income, provided by Section 22(b) (2), should be either in\u00e1pplicable or superfluous in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Petitioner contends that Section 117(f) was enacted for the purpose of overcoming the principle announced in John H. Watson, Jr. v. Com\u2019r, 27 B. T. A. 463, 465, that the loss sustained from the retirement at maturity of a corporate bond was not a capital loss because no sale or exchange was involved; that at the time of the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1934 there also was in effect I. T. 2661, XI \u2014 2 Cum. Bull. 39(1932), which provided: \u201cThe gain realized from the surrender of a combined annuity and life insurance contract held for more than two years may not be treated as capital gain and taxed under section 101 of the Revenue Act of 1932, but must be treated as ordinary income.\u201d and that the intent of Congress must have been to overcome this ruling as well as the principle announced in the Watson -case. We not\u00e9 that in enacting Section 117(f) Congress expressly used the word \u201cbond\u201d. If it had intended that Section 117(f) should apply to endowment contracts we are entitled to assume that it also would have referred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>express terms to them or the class into which they had been segregated, particularly in view of the peculiar treatment Congress had accorded them in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Petitioner also asserts that the purpose of Section 117(f) is to place the profit accruing to an individual upon the maturity of an obligation on an equal footing with the profit accruing to an individual who actually sold an obligation to a third person before maturity. However this may be, it should be noted that Section 117(f) is not all-inclusive. For example, it is limited to evidences of indebtedness of a <em>corporation, </em>and further limited to evidences of indebtedness of a corporation <em>\"with interest coupons or in registered form.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Petitioner further contends that what we are dealing with here is in fact an investment rather than a \u201ctrue policy of life insurance\u201d, and cites cases in support of the investment character of an endowment contract. It is argued that this investment character brings It within Section 117(f). As indicated previously, it is not every investment that is included within the limiting terms of Section 117(f), Moreover, assuming the investment character of an endowment contract, any similarity to bonds which may be drawn from this character is more than outweighed by the previously mentioned dissimilar treatment accorded by Congress to endowment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In view of this dissimilarity of treatment and as we are dealing with the scope of a legislative reduction of amount to be taken into consideration in computing net income,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we hold that in the absence of express statutory mention of life insurance or endowment contracts in Section 117(f) and in the absence of showing of a legislative history indicative of the intent that they come within its scope, Section 117(f) is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The bond interest received was upon street improvement bonds stipulated by the parties to have been <em>\u201cissued by </em>various California municipalities under the California Improvement Act of 1911, as amended, approved April 7, 1911, California Stats. 1911, page 730, Deering\u2019s General Laws of California, Act No. 8199.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Decision as to whether this interest was exempted by Section 22(b) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1934,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as \u201cInterest upon * * * the obligations of a State, * * * or any political subdivision thereof * * * \u201d is controlled by our decision in Bryant v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 111 F.2d 9, this day decided, holding interest of fhe character here involved exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">In summary, we agree with the Board as to the profit from the endowment contract and hold that none of it is capital gain; we disagree with the Board as to the bond interest and hold that it is exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">It appears that in reaching its decision that there is a deficiency of $1,375.68 the Board treated the bond interest as taxable and that a different decision may result if, in accordance with our holding, the bond interest is treated as exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">The decision is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-19\"> \u201cNew York Life Insurance Company Agrees to Pay</p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">\u201cEndowment to Insured to Moses N.
