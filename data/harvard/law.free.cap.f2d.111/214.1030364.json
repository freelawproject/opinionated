While the policy-was in effect, appellee Orteca, driving his automobile, collided with a 1931 Ford truck operated by an employee of the Coal Company. Orteca brought suit against the Coal Company in the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, but this action has not proceeded to judgment. The case is thus differentiated from Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corp. v. Ryan, 6 Cir., 109 F.2d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Appellant brought the instant action in the District Court against the assured and Orteca, asking that the court determine appellant\u2019s obligation under the policy and decide whether it is obligated to defend the pending action in the state court. The petition alleged that the Coal Company claims to have sold the 1931 Ford truck to its employee who was operating it at the time of the accident, the Coal Company retaining title thereto as security for the payment of the purchase price. If the truck was owned by the company, and was not a hired automobile, appellant claims to have no obligation under the policy. Orteca demurred to the petition in the District Court for the reason that no cause of action against him is stated, and that he is not a necessary or proper party to the action, and the demurrer was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The determinative factor is whether a controversy exists between Orteca and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">We think that the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed, upon the ground that no cause of action was stated against Orteca. The controversy which gives jurisdiction to the federal court under the Declaratory Judgment Act does not arise where one claiming that a right or interest is invaded by another has not chosen to assert his right. E. W. Bliss Co. v. Cold Metal Process Co., 6 Cir., 102 F.2d 105, 108. Orteca does not at present claim a right or interest against appellant, which is not a party to Orteca\u2019s action in the state court. No judgment has been rendered in that action against the Coal Company, hence the jurisdictional prerequisites for the filing of the supplemental petition against appellant provided for under Section 9510-4, General Code of Ohio, do not exist. While the circumstances contain \u201call of the elements out of which a controversy may arise\u201d (E. W. Bliss Co. v. Cold Metal Process Co., supra), as between Or-teca and appellant the controversy has not yet arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">We do not pass upon the question of appellant\u2019s right to a declaratory judgment against the assured, as that question is not presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
