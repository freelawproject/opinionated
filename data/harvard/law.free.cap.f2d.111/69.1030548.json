The case had previously been referred to a special master who concluded that the claims were invalid, but if valid, were not infringed. The claims are printed in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-22\">The patent is for a structure and relates to permanent molds to be used in the manufacture of agitators for washing machines. Permanent molds are made of cast iron or other metal. They are distinguished from sand molds, which are used but once, in that they may be used repeatedly in making castings. Molten metal is poured into permanent molds through openings called sprues, and in the patent in suit is introduced under gravity pressure created by the molten metal itself. If the metal is forced into the mold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>under external pressure, the process is die casting. The openings from the sprues into the mold cavity are called gates. A permanent mold is usually constructed in sections hinged together so that it will come apart to facilitate removal of the castings.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The washing machine agitator produced by the mold of the patent in suit is a thin casting of aluminum, having a shape resembling a bell, with wings projecting on the outer surface. The use to which it is put requires that it be as smooth as possible, but this quality is difficult of attainment, partly because of the irregular shape, and also because of the peculiar characteristics of aluminum as manifested in the process of casting. If the temperature of the metal is high, the crystals of the aluminum casting will be large, and loss of strength will result.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Another difficulty arises from the tendency of aluminum to shrink in an unusual degree when it solidifies, leaving so-called \u201chot spots\u201d or holes in the surface of the casting. In the freezing process, as the metal shrinks, it draws additional molten metal from the supply adjacent to compensate for the shrinkage, and unless this additional molten metal is supplied as the casting progressively freezes, \u201chot spots\u201d result which make the casting defective. Die casting does not assist in solving the problem, for when the metal is forced into the mold under external pressure, the air in the mold is unable to escape fast enough and is imprisoned in the metal as it solidifies, thus producing a porous and defective casting. It is essential, therefore, to pour the aluminum into the mold at the lowest temperature at which the metal remains liquid, to provide a structure so arranged that the metal will flow to all parts of the mold before it solidifies, and at the same time to prevent the unequal freezing which tends to concentrate the shrinkage at the points last to cool, thus avoiding the creation of the \u201chot spots\u201d in the castings.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Fahlman claimed that he solved the problem by his mold, in which the agitator is positioned vertically with the extended part or base at the bottom thereof. The molten metal is introduced simultaneously through the three sprues at the top of the mold and flows into a continuous ring-shaped sprue cavity at the base of the mold, thence through a narrow peripheral gate into the mold cavity filling it from the bottom toward the top until the excess metal appears in the risers at the top of the mold. Fahlman provides for a core \u201cto be moved upwardly intermediate said members to form said hollow stem portion.\u201d In Claim 4 Fahlman provides for the sprue cavities to be adjacent the wing cavities of the agitator so that as the molten metal is poured in the sprues, it will heat the mold around the wing cavities and thus prevent undue chilling, which retards the freezing at those points. The District Court found that \u201cUniformity of in-flow and distribution to avoid \u2018hot spots\u2019 and the consequent simultaneous freezing of the metal to form the casting\u201d were accomplished by the structure of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Appellant asserts the usual defenses of (1) want of invention, (2) anticipation by prior use, and (3) non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The provision for a circular sprue\u2019and a circular gate to feed the molten metal into the bottom of the cavity was concededly old in the molding art. See Parry, 6,805 (1849), and Trotz, 639,005 (1899). It is well established by patents too numerous to mention here that it was old in the foundry art to fill the mold through a \u201crelatively narrow gate.\u201d We regard Grey, 1,455,248 (1923), and Bungay, 1,516,667 (1924), relied upon by appellant, as inapplicable, for they relate to die casting, which does not produce a satisfactory aluminum casting because of its high porosity. Rowand, 41,786 (1864), and Hardin, 1,019,248 (1912), provide for hinged sectional permanent molds. None of the elements of the mold were new. However, the special master concluded, and the District Court found, that the claims in suit are not invalid for want of invention over the prior art because no one prior art patent discloses all of the elements of Fahl-man's structure in substantially the same combination, and the prior art patents taken collectively do not anticipate the precise disclosure of Fahlman.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Appellant urges that Fahlman is anticipated by the prior use of the Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation, which manufactured a support for a washing machine agitator and also the agitator itself. Much testimony and a large part of the master\u2019s report and the briefs of the parties are concerned with the question of Fahlman\u2019s date of conception and whether he was diligent in reducing his invention to practice so as to avoid the Bohn structure as being prior use. Assuming, but not deciding, that Bohn is prior to Fahlman, we do not regard the Bohn use as anticipating Fahlman. Bohn does not employ the peripheral sprue and gate of Fahlman, but has only an arcuate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>gate in the support mold and two separated arcuate gates in the agitator mold. Fahl-man feeds only from the bottom, while Bohn provides vertical feeder gates branching off from the sprues to the upper part of the mold cavity. Appellant follows Bohn rather than Fahlman, and its molds differ both structurally and functionally from the Fahlman mold.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Assuming, but not deciding, that the claims in suit are valid, we observe that Fahlman feeds exclusively from the bottom, filling the mold cavity from the bottom towards the top, while appellant\u2019s mold uses the bottom gating only for partially filling the mold and provides vertical gating, running the full length of two wings connected by cross sprues with the vertical feeder sprues, for filling the upper parts of the mold cavity. Fahlman has a continuous ring-shaped sprue cavity connecting with the peripheral gate communicating with the entire periphery of the base, while appellant\u2019s bottom gating and feeding sprue extend less than thirty per cent of the total circumference of the base of the mold cavity. This small arcuate sprue and gate cannot be regarded as covering \u201csubstantially the entire periphery of said base portion,\u201d as provided in Claim 3. Nor does appellant employ vertical sprue cavities adjacent the wing mold cavities as in Fahlman\u2019s Claim 4, for pre-hea.ting the mold cavity. Appellant has but two feeder sprues while Fahl-man has three.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In addition, appellant does not adopt Fahlman\u2019s principle of simultaneous freezing to avoid \u201chot spots,\u201d but, as said by the District Court in its opinion, employs \u201cprogressive filling and solidification.\u201d In appellant\u2019s structure, as the metal freezes in the bottom portions of the mold, the deficiency resulting from the shrinkage is supplied from the molten metal in the bottom sprue cavity. The upper part of the cavity is supplied with metal through the vertical gates fed by cross sprues connecting with the vertical sprues which function when the bottom gate is frozen and the molten metal backs up in the vertical sprues and overflows into the cross sprues. Thus the mold is progressively filled and the casting solidifies from the bottom toward the top. The District Court was in error in holding that a mold which provides for progressive filling and solidification of the casting infringes a patent for a mold of different structure which causes simultaneous freezing. That which is not literally within the claim of the patent does not infringe. Goodrich v. Ford Motor Co., 6 Cir., 97 F.2d 427, 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The decree is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-15\"> \u201c3.
