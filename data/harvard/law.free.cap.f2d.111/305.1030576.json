Diversity of citizenship does not exist. The defendant Wrecking Company removed the case to the court below. In its petition for removal it stated that the accident occurred and plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued on the site of the Federal Building in Kansas City, Missouri, which was owned by the United States and was subject to its exclusive jurisdiction and control, and \u201cthat said alleged accident occurred on United States property and arose under the laws of the United States, and that said laws of the United States apply exclusively to- the controversy between said parties and that therefore said controversy is one of which the District Courts of the United States have original jurisdiction.\u201d The plaintiff moved to remand the case. His motion was denied. He refused to proceed further, and the judgment from which he now appeals was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-26\">The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint does not disclose that the accident resulting in plaintiff\u2019s injuries occurred upon the site of the Federal Building, but, upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the argument of the motion to remand, it was conceded by the parties that that was the fact and that the site of the building was owned in fee by the United States, and that the State of Missouri had relinquished to the United States all jurisdiction over it, except the right of the State to serve and execute process upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The sole question presented is whether this is a suit which \u201carises under the Constitution or laws of the United States\u201d and is therefore within the original jurisdiction of the District' Courts of the United States by virtue of \u00a7 41, Title 28 U.S.C., 2S U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for that reason subject to removal under \u00a7 71, Title 28 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <em>71.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The court below concluded that the suit was within its jurisdiction upon the ground that the cause of action asserted arose under laws governing territory which was owned by, and was under the exclusive jurisdiction of, the United States, and that the laws governing such territory were of necessity laws of the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court based its conclusion upon the facts stated in the petition for removal and the concessions of the parties made upon the argument of the motion to remand, and did not base it upon the allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s amended' complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">What counsel and the court below completely overlooked was that, in order to raise the question which was argued and decided, it would have been necessary to amend the amended complaint, upon' which jurisdiction depended. The allegations of that complaint, constituting the statement of plaintiff\u2019s claim, were all that could be considered in determining whether the case was within the jurisdiction of the District Court and was removable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the amended complaint obviously failed to show that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was based upon any law of the United States, and failed to disclose any dispute or controversy existing between the parties relative to the construction, operation or effect of the Constitution or laws of the United States; the court below was without jurisdiction of the case and should have remanded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">The fact that the question of the insufficiency of the amended complaint to show jurisdiction was not presented or argued in the court below, is of no consequence, since it is the duty of this Court to determine questions relating to that court\u2019s jurisdiction, whether they are argued or not.
