The defendant had filed with the trustee certain proofs of claim \u2014 whose nature does not definitely appear \u2014 which the trustee moved to expunge unless the creditor should repay certain sums which he asserted were preferences within \u00a7 60, sub. b of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96, sub. b. The referee entered an order declaring that the sums here in suit had been preferential payments, and that no dividend should be paid upon the claims challenged until the defendant had repaid them. Upon the motion for summary judgment the judge held that the findings so made in the bankruptcy proceeding were res judicata, and entered judgment for the trustee. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">When the trustee moved to expunge the proof of claim, it became necessary for the referee to decide whether the defendant had received any preference, and, if so, how much;, otherwise he could not have disposed of the motion. A creditor who has received a preference does not lose his right to file absolutely, but only contingently upon failing to return the amount received. In re Fixen, 9 Cir., 102 F. 295, 50 L.R.A. 605; In re Dernburg, 2 Cir., 5 F.2d 37. Thus, the amount of the preference was as necessary to the referee\u2019s decision as the fact that there had been one. All the conditions were fulfilled which made his findings res .judicata, and there was nothing left to be decided in the action at bar. Fayerweather v. Ritch, 195 U.S. 276, 25 S.Ct. 58, 49.
