SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Casey Bond appeals his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Bond pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that included an appeal-waiver provision, he argues that he still has the right to appeal by virtue of a provision in the agreement that authorizes appeal of sentences exceeding the \u201cstatutory maximum.\u201d \u2022 He reasons that <em>Booker </em>changes the definition of \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d \u2019\u25a0 to the maximum term of incarceration that is authorized by facts admitted to by the defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because, however, post <em>-Booker, </em>\u201cstatutory maximum\u201d assumes its ordinary definition of the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by the statute of conviction-for purposes of a plea agreement, and because Bond was sentenced below the statutory maximum as so defined, we dismiss -the appeal as barred by the valid plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-20\">Bond pleaded guilty -to one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and one count of possession with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marihuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). According to his written plea agreement, he waived the right to appeal, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP7\">Except as otherwise provided in this agreement, the Defendant expressly waives the right to appeal the sentence on all grounds, including -an appeal of sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3742. The Defendant further agrees not to contest sentencing in any. post, conviction proceeding including, but not limited to, a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 2255. The Defendant, however, reserves the right to appeal the following: (a) any punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum; '(b) any upward departure from the guidelines range deemed most applicable by the sentencing court; (c) arithmetic errors in the guidelines calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>lations; and (d) a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that affects the validity of the waiver itself. The Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal in exchange for the concessions made by the Government in this agreement and with full understanding that the Court has not determined the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Bond was explicitly advised in the plea agreement that he could receive a maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment on count one and a maximum of five years on count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Pursuant to recommendations in the presentence report, the district court engaged in fact-finding \u2014 determining that Bond had possessed the firearm -in connection with another felony, possession with the intent to distribute marihuana \u2014 that increased the applicable sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Kl.l(b)(5). The resulting range was 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Bond was sentenced at the bottom of the range, to 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In response to the PSR, Bond objected based on Blakely, which held a state sentencing scheme unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment because it allowed a defendant to receive a sentence higher than that based on facts found by a judge and not admitted to by the defendant or found by a jury. The district court overruled Bond\u2019s objections based on <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1003, 160 L.Ed.2d 1006 (2005), which held that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the. federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Bond argues that his sentencing is infirm under <em>Booker </em>because it is based in part on facts that he neither admitted to, nor were found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government, to the contrary, asserts that we should dismiss the appeal on the ground that by his plea agreement, Bond waived the right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">To determine whether an appeal of a sentence is barred by an appeal waiver provision in a plea agreement, we conduct a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary and (2) whether the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand, based on the plain language of the agreement. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005). Under this test, Bond has waived appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">A defendant may waive his statutory right to appeal his sentence if the waiver is knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bond does not allege, and there is no indication in the record, that his ratification of the plea agreement was anything but voluntary. Because he indicated that he read and understood the agreement, which includes an explicit, unambiguous waiver of appeal, the waiver was both knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Bond does not contest that the waiver language \u2014 waiving the right to appeal \u201con all grounds, including an appeal of sentencing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 3742\u201d \u2014 is broad enough to cover an appeal based on <em>Booker </em>and its progeny. Rather, notwithstanding that broad wording, Bond argues that he is p\u00e9rmitted to appeal his sentence because, he claims, the explicit exception for \u201cany punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum\u201d is met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In defining \u201cstatutory maximum,\u201d Bond looks to <em>Blakely, </em>later quoted in <em>Booker: </em>\u201cOur precedents make clear, however, that the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 <em>for Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Bond\u2019s calculations are.correct, this definition of \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d would allow him an escape from the appeal waiver provision, because he was sentenced to 24-months, and he claims that the facts admitted in his guilty plea authorized a maximum of only 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Unfortunately for Bond, however, as astutely observed in <em>United States v. Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d 1330, 1334-35 (11th Cir.2005), the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for purposes of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>has a meaning and import that is significantly different from its meaning for purposes of Bond\u2019s appeal waiver, when the context in which the terms are used is carefully scrutinized.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIn the <em>Apprendi!Booker </em>line of decisions, the Supreme Court used the term \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 to describe the parameters of the rule announced in those decisions, a rule that had nothing to do with the scope of appeal waivers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334. In that context it was used in a \u201cspecialized,\u201d \u201cnon-natural\u201d sense, used \u201cnot only for semantic convenience but also in order to justify and explain the holdings the Court entered in those decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEveryone knows that a judge must not impose a sentence in excess of the maximum that is statutorily specified for the crime. By labeling a sentence that the judge may not impose under the <em>Apprendi/Booker </em>doctrine as one in excess of the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 the Court may have sought to call into play that well-known principle of law-.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">We must interpret the plea agreement like a contract, in accord with what the parties intended.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no indication that they meant for the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d to be accorded the non-natural definition it assumed in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>In the absence of evidence that the parties to the agreement intended such a specialized, non-natural definition, we apply the term\u2019s usual and ordinary meaning, \u201cthe upper limit of punishment that Congress has legislatively specified for violation of a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">This is the approach taken most recently by this court in <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 2005 WL 1404944 (5th Cir. June 16, 2005) (per curiam) (on rehearing). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Cortez \u201cargue[d] that he did not waive the right to appeal a sentence above the statutory maximum as that term was defined in <em>Blakely.\u201d Id. </em>at *1, at 503. Citing <em>McKinney, </em>406 F.3d at 746-47, the <em>Cortez </em>panel reasoned that \u201c[t]he language in the appellate waiver must be afforded its plain meaning in accord with the intent of the parties at the time the plea agreement was executed.\u201d <em>Cortez, </em>413 F.3d at 503, 2005 WL 1404944, at *1. The court concluded that there was \u201cno indication that the parties intended that the exception in the appellate waiver for \u2018a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum punishment\u2019 would have a meaning other than its ordinary and natural meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Thus, citing <em>Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d at 1334-35, the <em>Cortez </em>panel reasoned that in this context, the term \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d in an appeal waiver means \u201cthe upper limit of punishment that Congress has legislatively specified for violations of a statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The same result obtains here. Under the ordinary definition of \u201cstatutory maximum,\u201d Bond has a maximum sentence of 10 years on count one and 5 years on count two. Because his sentence of 24 months does not exceed either of those amounts, that exception to his appeal waiver is not met, and the blanket prohibition of appeal applies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And, because Bond waived his right to appeal his sentence under the present circumstances, we do not need to address his Sixth Amendment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-16\">. Bond\u2019s briefs actually argue in terms of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We update his argument in light of <em>Booker, </em>which extended the <em>Blakely </em>holding to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">.
