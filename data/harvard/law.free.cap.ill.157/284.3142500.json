Secondary evidence of an agreement is admissible where its existence is established, and the original draftsman and custodian testi\u00f1es that he has caused search to be made for it and it cannot be found, and it is shown to be beyond the jurisdiction of the court and in the possession or under the control of the adverse party, who, after being notified, declines to produce it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AXa\" pgmap=\"282\">Contracts \u2014 public policy \u2014 combination of all interests in a certain business, void.

The declaration consisted of three counts, the first being for goods wrongfully taken, the second for goods wrongfully detained, and the third being a count in trover. An order was subsequently entered discontinuing the cause as to the last count. The pleas were non cepit, non detinet, property in defendant, and a fourth plea, setting up that on, to-wit, the 1st day of March, 1888, the defendant was doing business in Chicago, under the name of the Michigan Fruit Butter Company, and was sometimes styled A. D. Bishop &amp; Company and was engaged in the manufacture of fruit butters, jellies, preserves and like products, and that the greater proportion of the goods mentioned in the declaration were then and there the property of the defendant and used by him in carrying on his said business, and that the residue of said articles was subsequently bought by the defendant in carrying on his said business under his said name of the Michigan Fruit Butter Company; that in March, 1888, Benjamin Fenton and B. E. Ryan approached the defendant and laid before him a scheme to form a \u201ctrust,\u201d to be called the American Preservers\u2019 Trust, to be organized for the purpose of bringing into one com-: bination all manufacturers throughout the United States of fruit butters, jellies, preserves and like products, which the defendant avers are staple articles of food, and are in general use and demand by the inhabitants of the State of Illinois and of the United States, and for the further purpose of raising the price of said products, to prevent competition and to secure a virtual monopoly thereof, and to crush out any manufacturer who would not join said trust, and the defendant then and there refused to enter into such combination; that then and there said Fenton told the defendant that unless the defendant joined the trust the same would ruin his business; that upon, to-wit, the 20th day of May, 1888, said B. E. Ryan, the now secretary of the plaintiff and a confederate of said Fenton, came to the defendant and stated to him that all the leading manufacturers of said products in the United States had signed, or agreed to sign, a trust agreement, and that if any manufacturer did not sign said agreement he would be forced out of business and his business ruined, and the defendant, fearing that said threats would be carried into execution, on, to-wit, the 20th day of May, 1888, signed a trust agreement.

E. Ryan, one of the trustees mentioned in the trust agreement, caused an inventory to be made of the defendant\u2019s merchandise and equipment, and appraised the same at the sum of \u00a79063.03, and informed the defendant that he would have to assign and transfer the same, by bill of sale, to the American Preservers\u2019 Trust, and that, at the time and place last aforesaid, the said B. E. Ryan directed the defendant to open a new set of books in the name of the_ American Preservers\u2019 Trust; that pursuant to said scheme, to-wit, upon the 20th day of June, 1888, the said trustees caused, or attempted to cause, a pretended corporation to be organized under and by virtue of the laws of West Virginia, under the name and style of the American Preservers\u2019 Company, with a capital of \u00a7600, which corporation is the plaintiff in this suit; that the incorporators were the said A. R. Bremer, B. E. Ryan, Henry Williams, B. Fenton, C. A. Max Wiehle and F. R. Jennings, all of whom were trustees of the said American Preservers\u2019 Trust; that subsequently, to-wit, in July, 1888, said Ryan came to the said defendant\u2019s said place of business in said city of Chicago, and stated to the defendant that in order to carry out the scheme of said trust it was necessary for the defendant to execute a bill of sale of his business, inventoried as aforesaid, to the American Preservers\u2019 Company, said pretended corporation organized under the laws of West Virginia by said trustees for the purpose of forming a channel through which said trust could purchase and control the business of the defendant and purchase and control the entire manufacture and sale of fruit butters, jellies, preserves and like products, and then and there, at the time above mentioned, said Ryan handed to the defendant a certain bill of sale already drafted, running to the said pretended American Preservers\u2019 Company, as vendee of the articles inventoried as aforesaid, and then and there directed the defendant to execute the same as part and parcel of said scheme for the organization of said trust, which the said defendant then and there, under the compulsion and threats of said Ryan, executed, and also then and there said Ryan handed to the defendant 331 shares of stock in said American Preservers\u2019 Company, of the pretended par value of $33,100, and directed the defendant to assign said shares to the trustees of said trust, which the defendant, under said direction and by compulsion and threats, then and there did; that at the time of the execution of said bill of sale said Ryan took said certificates of stock so assigned under the direction and compulsion of the said Ryan, and handed the defendant, to-wit, 662 certificates of trust in said American Preservers\u2019 Trust, at the pretended pair value of $66,200, which certificates were known as American Preservers\u2019 Trust certificates, and the defendant avers that said bill of sale to said American Preservers\u2019 Company was procured to be made by the said company to aid said American Preservers\u2019 Trust, as one of the agents and instruments employed and controlled by the trustees of said American Preservers\u2019 Trust in controlling the entire manufacture and sale of said products, and that the pretended title acquired by the plaintiff under said bill of sale is the only title the said plaintiff acquired or had to the goods and chattels in said declaration described, and to the articles named in said bill of sale, or to the property and good will of the defendant\u2019s business, and that the procuring of the execution of said bill of sale was part of said scheme for the organization of said trust and the prevention of competition in the manufacture and sale of said products, for the raising of the market price of the same, and for securing a virtual monopoly therein, under the control of the American Preservers\u2019 Trust; that the trustees of the American Preservers\u2019 Trust and the plaintiff, by their agents, after procuring the defendant to sign said trust agreement and execute said bill of sale to plaintiff, permitted and required the defendant to carry on the'said business under his own firm name and style, to-wit, \u2018The Michigan Fruit Butter Company,\u2019 or \u2018A. D. Bishop &amp; Co.,\u2019 and to account to and make returns thereof to the plaintiff, or to said trustees of said American Preservers\u2019 Trust; that it was not intended by the incorporators that said American Preservers\u2019 Company should have an independent existence as a corporation, but that the said plaintiff company submitted itself to be used, and was used, as a mere channel through which the trust acquired title to the interests of individuals, partnerships and corporations engaged in the manufacture of said staple articles of food, and to this end the majority or controlling interest in shares of stock in said American Preservers\u2019 Company were issued by the plaintiff to the said trustees of the American Preservers\u2019 Trust; that in December, 1888, the defendant tendered his trust certificates to the general manager of the trust, and demanded that said trust return to him the articles inventoried in said bill of sale, which said general manager, B. E. Ryan, then and there refused to do, whereupon the defendant refused to make any reports to the trust until March, 1889, when the defendant again presented his trust certificates to said trustees for cancellation, and demanded the return of the property and business so taken from him, and thereupon the president of said trust called upon the defendant, and by threats induced the defendant to continue making reports of business until the first of March, 1891, and that in April, 1891, a representative of said trust came to the defendant and asked the defendant to return said trust certificates, and to take in lieu thereof 221 shares of stock in said American Preservers\u2019 Company, stating that all the members of the said trust were going into said American Preservers\u2019 Company, which the defendant refused to do, because the defendant avers that the said American Preservers\u2019 Company was a mere agent of said trustees in and about the organization of said trust, and that he states the fact to be that the said trustees sought to avoid the appearance that said trust was a partnership of corporations, by canceling said trust certificates and abandoning the charters of the various corporations organized by the said trust, except the charter of the American Preservers\u2019 Company, and intending to give to the stockholders in the corporations whose charters were to be abandoned, shares of stock in said American Preservers\u2019 Company, to be held in trust by the said trustees of the American Preservers\u2019 Trust, as trustees for the stockholders of the American Preservers\u2019 Company, for which purpose said trustees of said trust caused the capital of the plaintiff to be increased, thereby substituting said American Preservers\u2019 Company in the place of said American Preservers\u2019 Trust, and the defendant avers that said trust, whether under the name of the American Preservers\u2019 Trust or of said American Preservers\u2019 Company, is a combination organized for the purpose of raising the price of staple articles of food and preventing competition therein, and securing a virtual monopoly thereof, and is contrary to public policy and void in law, for which reason the defendant then and there refused to return the said certificates of trust; that upon, to-wit, March 1, 1891, the defendant was advised that said trust agreement was illegal, and since said time has refused to render any reports to said trust. All of which acts and doings of the plaintiff the defendant avers are contrary to public policy and void in law, and so the defendant, in fact, saith that the goods in the first and second counts mentioned, at the time when, etc., were the property of him, the defendant, and not of the plaintiff, wherefore,\u201d etc. Here follows usual conclusion to pleas in bar in replevin.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\" pgmap=\"288(248) 289(208)\">The fourth plea was demurred to but the demurrer was overruled, and plaintiff replied to said fourth plea. The second replication sets up that long prior to the commencement of the action the plaintiff was the sole and absolute owner of the property in question; that in July, 1888, the defendant, in consideration of 831 shares of the capital stock of the plaintiff, transferred his entire business property to the plaintiff, and that the defendant continued to manage the business as the agent of the plaintiff until, to-wit, April 1, 1891, at which time he claimed ownership of the property in question, without this, etc. The third replication says that, after the time of the alleged trust agreement mentioned in the plea as having been made, the defendant, in consideration of 331 shares of the capital stock of the plaintiff, then and there delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant, sold therefor his goods and chattels and machinery, etc., and that the defendant acted as the agent of the plaintiff, and received and bought goods and chattels mentioned in the declaration, as the agent of the plaintiff, until, to-wit, April 1, 1891, at which time the defendant attempted to repudiate his agency and asserted title to the property, and refused to account to the plaintiff, and that the property then in the hands of the defendant was the property originally sold, together with the additions and improvements made by the defendant, as plaintiff\u2019s agent; without this, that the plaintiff purchased or held said goods as agent of said trust, or acted as tool or agent of said trust. The fourth replication to the third plea says, that on, to-wit, June 20, 1888, the plaintiff was legally incorporated by virtue of the laws of West Virginia, and became thereby, and has continued, a legal corporation, and since its incorporation has increased its stock to 82,500,000, and that subsequently to the incorporation of the plaintiff, to-wit, in July, 1888, in consideration of 331 shares of the capital stock of the plaintiff, the defendant sold his machinery, stock of goods and business for manufacturing mince meats, etc., and after that the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant, whereby the defendant was to carry on the business as the agent of the plaintiff; that he did so up to April, 1891, and the additions and improvements made in said time were made by the defendant as the agent of the plaintiff, and that in April, 1891, the defendant, disregarding his duties, refused to recognize the title of the plaintiff; that the plaintiff was organized and continued to exist as an independent corporation, having no connection with the American Preservers\u2019 Trust, without this, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\" pgmap=\"289\">Upon the trial of the cause the defendant offered in evidence a copy of the agreement mentioned in the fourth plea, after introducing evidence tending to account for the non-production of the original agreement and to establish a foundatiofi for the introduction of secondary proof.

Of course, that may be small consideration to you for having sat here for a day or so to hear it; but at the same time, there was no evidence introduced on the part of the defendant which shows this American Preservers\u2019 Company, the plaintiff in this case, to have been in an illegal combination. It may have been so, but we can\u2019t find it so from this testimony. There is only one cause here shown, and as it is a prima facie case for the plaintiff I am going to instruct you as follows: \u2018The court instructs the jury that the defendant, Bishop, has failed to make out a defense, and that the plaintiff, the American Preservers\u2019 Company, has made out a prima facie case. You are therefore instructed to find for the plaintiff, the American Preservers\u2019 Company, and your verdict should be in the following form: We, the jury, find the issues for the plaintiff, and find the property described in the writ in the plaintiff, and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages at one cent,\u2019 I will ask one of you to sign that, as foreman. You are doing that under compulsion, and'you need not feel that it is your verdict, as it is a mere form.\u201d (The defendant, by his counsel, then and there duly excepted.) \u201cYou are simply doing what the court tells you to do.

The plaintiff then examined one B. E. Ryan, the secretary and general manager of said company, and who was also the secretary of the \u201cAmerican Preservers\u2019 Trust\u201d and one of the trustees of said trust. Ryan testified that he made demand upon appellant for the property before bringing this suit; that he received the bill of sale from appellant and delivered to him a certificate for 331 shares of the stock of said company, but, at the same interview and \u201cwithin an hour or two,\u201d took back said shares and delivered to appellant 662 certificates of trust of the \u201cAmerican Preservers\u2019 Trust;\u201d that as secretary of the company he delivered the 331 shares of stock; that as secretary of the trust he delivered the trust certificates; that he received back the 331 shares of stock as an officer of the trust; and that, at the same interview and upon receipt of the bill of sale, he then and there appointed appellant manager and custodian of the property described in the bill of sale, with directions to conduct the business and report to him, Ryan, all the purchases and sales and receipts and disbursements. After the examination of Ryan, the plaintiff rested.</p> <p id=\"b303-4\" pgmap=\"303\">The defendant then offered to introduce evidence, oral and written, tending to sustain the averments of his fourth plea. Some of this evidence was rejected when offered, some of it was admitted when offered, but all of it, upon motion of the plaintiff, was finally ruled out, and the jury were instructed to find the issues for the plaintiff. We cannot notice all the objections to specific offers of testimony, nor pass upon the rulings of the court in detail. We deem it sufficient to consider the general ground upon which the action of the trial court was based, and the general theory, which the defendant sought to - maintain by his offered and rejected testimony.</p> <p id=\"b304-3\" pgmap=\"304\">The court below seemed to take the view, that the plaintiff was an independent and legally organized corporation, and that, as the defendant had executed a bill of sale of his property and business to that corporation, and then assumed to act as its custodian and agent in the management of the property and business, he was estopped from denying the plaintiff\u2019s title or right of possession.</p> <p id=\"b304-4\" pgmap=\"304\">On the other hand, it was claimed by the defendant below, that a combination was formed among all the manufacturers of and dealers in fruit butters, jellies, preserves and like products in the United States under the name of the \u201cAmerican Preservers\u2019 Trust,\u201d for the purpose of controlling the manufacture and sale of said products, and preventing competition therein, and raising the market price thereof, and thereby securing a monopoly therein; that this combination was organized, and sought to effect its purpose, under and in pursuance of a written agreement signed by the parties to the * combination; that the plaintiff company was formed in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and for the purposes of accomplishing the objects of the trust; that those objects were illegal and against public policy; that the agreement was illegal and void, as providing for a combination in restraint of trade in staple articles of food in general use and demand by the inhabitants of Illinois; and that the transfer of defendant\u2019s goods and machinery and business by means of a bill of sale to the plaintiff, and the delivery of the shares of stock to defendant, and the re-delivery thereof to the trustees of the combination in exchange for trust certificates, and the appointment of defendant as custodian of the property and agent to carry on the business theretofore exclusively his own, were all parts of the illegal scheme and aids in the accomplishment of the unlawful objects of the trust.</p> <p id=\"b305-3\" pgmap=\"305\">We are inclined to think that the claim thus made by the d\u00e9fendant, and which is set up in his fourth plea, would have constituted a good defense to the action, if he had been allowed to establish it by proper evidence.</p> <p id=\"b305-4\" pgmap=\"305\">First \u2014 A preliminary question arises as to the action of the trial court in excluding the offered copy of the trust agreement. The original agreement was not in the possession of the defendant, and it is claimed that a proper foundation was not laid for the introduction of secondary evidence. Proof of the contents of a document may be established by secondary evidence when it is in the possession of the adverse party who withholds it at the trial, provided that a notice to produce the original has been duly served where such notice is requisite. &lt;1 Taylor on Evidence, part 2, sec. 440; 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, pages 984, 985). Secondary evidence may be offered to prove the substance of a document which it is out of the power of the party to produce; and this rule applies to papers out of the jurisdiction of the court, provided due effort be made to obtain such papers. (1 Wharton on Evidence, sec. 130; 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, page 986). The notice to produce the original may be given either to the adverse party himself or to his attorney. (21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, page 989).</p> <p id=\"b305-5\" pgmap=\"305(132) 306(222)\">In the case at bar, notice to produce the original agreement and the by-laws of the company and of the trust was served upon the attorneys of the plaintiff, including Mr. A. L. Weil hereinafter named. Subpoena duces tecum was also served upon Ryan, the secretary and manager of the company and secretary and manager of the trust, and upon A. R. Bremer, president of the company and one of the trustees of the trust. Ryan swears, that he was present and saw the defendant, Bishop, sign the trust agreement, and that, after it was signed, it was put into the hands of \u201cthe custodian of the agreement, the solicitor of the trust, A. Leo Weil, this gentleman here,\u201d and that he saw it within a day or two thereafter. Weil, a resident of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, where the principal office or place of business of the plaintiff was required by its charter to be kept, and whose name was signed to the replications as one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and who assisted in the conduct of the trial, was examined as a witness at the trial, and swore, that Bishop signed the agreement; that there were two copies of the agreement; that one was deposited with a safe deposit company in Pittsburgh; that the other was in his possession in accordance with the terms of the agreement; that the trust had been dissolved; that a large number of papers had been left in Pittsburgh when it was dissolved; that he had caused search to be made in his office at Pittsburgh to obtain these papers and had been unable to find them; and that the by-laws were attached to the trust agreement. Ryan and the defendant do not speak of more than one original agreement as having been signed by the defendant, but, if there was a duplicate original, it sufficiently appears that both were within the control of Weil, who drew the agreement, and was the legal adviser and solicitor both of the plaintiff and of the trust, in which plaintiff was an associate member.</p> <p id=\"b306-4\" pgmap=\"306(155) 307(135)\">Prior to the trial a bill in chancery had been filed by one Meyer in the circuit court of Cook county against the president and secretary of the plaintiff, Bremer and Ryan, and other parties, setting up the trust agreement, and Ryan had filed an answer thereto, admitting the existence of the trust agreement in words and figures as pleaded in the bill. The defendant below, upon the trial, offered in evidence the said bill and answer, as showing a copy of the trust agreement which had been admitted to be correct by the plaintiff, or its officers and managers. This copy was shown to the defendant when he testified, and he swore that he signed the original agreement in the latter part of May, 1888; that Ryan and Weil were present; that he \u201cnever saw it but that once;\u201d that, when he saw it, it was lying'on the table, and Ryan was very particular about it, and (\u201cI think\u201d) took it in his hands; that they would not let him make a copy of it; that he could not compare any copy of it with the original without having the original, and never had the original except at that time; that he read it through, but there was a great deal of it, and he could not remember its entire language; that the copy shown him, set out in said bill, \u201cis a copy of the agreement I signed as near as I can tell.\u201d It furthermore appears from the testimony of Mr. Weil, that during the trial he had a copy of the trust agreement in his possession which he had found in the office of the plaintiff company, but he declined to produce it.</p> <p id=\"b307-4\" pgmap=\"307\">We are referred by counsel for appellee to the case of Dickinson v. Breeden, 25 Ill. 186. There, it was held, that, where a party, desiring to introduce secondary evidence of the contents of a deed, had knowledge of the grantee\u2019s residence, the latter\u2019s deposition should be taken to prove the existence of the original, and that it was lost, or so mislaid that it could not be found after diligent search. We cannot see why the facts of the present case do not bring it within the doctrine of the Breeden case.The existence of the original trust agreement was established by the testimony of three witnesses; and the original draftsman of the agreement and the custodian to whose possession it had been entrusted, was examined orally as a witness, and swore that he had caused search to be made for it, and that .it could not be found. But if the evidence was not conclusive-as to the loss or destruction of the original, the defendant showed that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the court and in the possession or under the control of the plaintiff, and that the latter, after being notified, declined to produce it. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the trial court erred in not receiving in evidence the offered copy, if it would have been material testimony when introduced.</p> <p id=\"b307-5\" pgmap=\"307(20) 308(52)\">Second \u2014 It is contended, however, by counsel for appellee, that, \u201ceven had a proper foundation been laid and proper secondary evidence of the alleged trust agreement been offered, its reception would have established no material fact, and its rejection was not error.\u201d Hence, the next matter presented for consideration relates to the pertinency or materiality of the agreement, and of the other excluded evidence offered in connection with it.</p> <p id=\"b308-4\" pgmap=\"308\">There can be no doubt, that this trust agreement is an illegal contract as providing for such a combination in restraint of trade as is forbidden by public policy.</p> <p id=\"b308-5\" pgmap=\"308\">In Craft v. McConoughy, 79 Ill. 346, where certain firms made an agreement, by the terms of which they attempted to form a combination for stifling competition and controlling the price of grain, cost of storage and expense of shipment, and thereby monopolizing the entire grain trade of the town and surrounding country, we said: \u201cThat the effect of this contract was to restrain the trade and commerce of the country, is a proposition that can not be successfully denied. We understand it to be a well settled rule of law, that an agreement in general restraint of trade is contrary to public policy, illegal and void.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b308-6\" pgmap=\"308\">In People ex rel. v. Chicago Gas Trust Co. 130 Ill. 268, we held, that an agreement, tending to prevent competition and create a monopoly, is void by the principles of the common law, because it is against public policy; and that public policy favors competition in trade to the. end that its commodities may be afforded to the customer as cheaply as possible, and is opposed to monopolies, as tending to advance market prices to the injury of the general public.</p> <p id=\"b308-7\" pgmap=\"308(66) 309(80)\">Again in More v. Bennett, 140 Ill. 69, we held that contracts restraining the freedom of trade, or diminishing competition, or regulating the prices of commodities or services, are prohibited by the law; and that all combinations of capitalists or of workmen for the purpose of influencing trade in their especial favor by raising or reducing prices are so far illegal, that agreements to combine cannot.be enforced by the courts.

Ency. of Law, pages 884, 895, 896.</p> <p id=\"b309-3\" pgmap=\"309(287) 310(268)\">The agreement recites, that it is designed by its signers to form a trust for the purpose of securing cooperation in the business of manufacturing preserves, etc., and of selling and dealing in the same in home and foreign markets. This co-operation, to be secured through the extraordinary powers conferred upon the nine trustees named in the agreement six of whom are designated by name and authorized to elect three others, could not result otherwise than in a grinding monopoly, controlling all trade in the business specified, and raising or depressing prices therein at the will of the trustees. Such trustees are empowered to organize corporations with all or any of the powers specified in the purposes of the agreement; and the stock of such corporations is to be issued to or purchased by said trustees. For this stock the trustees are to issue certificates of trust. The agreement is to go into effect within sixty days from the time those, holding the majority of the stock in seven specified corporations formed or to be formed, shall transfer the same to the trustees. Each signer of the agreement agrees to assign and transfer to said trustees absolutely all the shares, which he may own in said corporations formed or to be formed, and is to receive therefor, not money, but trust certificates, equal to the appraised amount of the earning capacity of his stock as fixed by the trustees and the stockholder. The trustees are authorized to purchase in the same way, by the issue of trust certificates, other stocks of the same companies, and also the property and business of any firm or individual engaged in the business of manufacturing and dealing in said products. The trustees are to exercise supervision over the corporations whose stocks are transferred to them, and are empowered to \u00e9lect themselves directors and officers in such corporations, and procure such management of the same as will be conducive to the interests of the holders of the trust certificates. These trust certificates are divided into shares of the par value of \u00a7100.00 each, and are prepared by the trustees. They provide, that the holders thereof, shall be bound by the terms of the trust agreement and of the by-laws passed in pursuance thereof, and are intended to show the interest of each beneficiary in the trust. The trustees hold the stocks transferred to them in trust for the holders of the certificates, and are to receive and hold the dividends or interest upon said stocks, and are to distribute the same by declaring dividends upon the certificates. The stocks so transferred to the trustees are to be held by them for the benefit of all the owners of the trust certificates. The trust is to continue for twenty-five years, subject to the right of 75 per cent of the holders of the certificates to terminate it after the expiration of one year, and of 65|- per cent of such holders to terminate it at the end of five years; and the trustees can not sell or surrender any of the stocks held by them during the continuance of the trust, without the consent of a majority in number and value of the holders of the trust certificates.</p> <p id=\"b310-3\" pgmap=\"310\">It will thus be seen, that the agreement in question makes provision for welding together all the interests, , engaged in the business named in the agreement, into one giant combination or partnership under the absolute dominion and control of a board of nine trustees. Its illegal purpose is apparent upon its face, and, therefore, under the decisions above referred to, it must be held to be void as being injurious to the public interest.</p> <p id=\"b310-4\" pgmap=\"310(20) 311(371)\">The object of the testimony of the defendant, upon the trial below, was to show that the plaintiff, the American Preservers\u2019 Company, was a party to this illegal combination, and that the execution of the bill of sale to it was to enable it to carry out the unlawful designs of such combination. If this testimony as offered had been received, it would have tended to show, not only that the plaintiff company was under the control of this board of trustees, but that it was in a partnership with other corporations. The corporators named in plaintiff\u2019s charter and whose names are signed to the agreement therein set out, upon the basis of which they were declared to be a corporation, were trustees in the trust. The court below ruled out testimony, showing that these trustees held stock in more than a dozen different corporations in the different States of the Union, besides the stock in the plaintiff company transferred to it by the defendant and others. 'The agreement was illegal as providing for a partnership among corporations. It is a violation of law for corporations to enter into partnership. The provisions of the general Incorporation act'of Illinois are to the effect, that every corporation organized in this State must manage its own affairs separately and exclusively, and cannot enter into any contract or relation, by which it is divested of such power of exclusive management, or by which its franchises are vested in a partner or any outside board, with equal power to direct its business. (Whittenton Mills v. Upton, 10 Gray, 582 ; People v. N. R. S. R. Co. 121 N. Y. 582). The appellee here, a foreign corporation, so far as it was doing business in this State through any control which it assumed to exercise over the business transferred to it by appellant, was subject to the same restrictions and duties as corporations formed in this State, and could have no other or greater powers. (1 Starr &amp; Cur. Stat. page 619, chap. 32, sec. 26). It was, therefore, unlawful for it to be operating in this State as a member of a partnership of corporations. (State v. Nebraska Distilling Co. 29 Neb. 700 ; Mallory v. Oil Works, 86 Tenn. 598; People ex rel. v. Chicago Gas Trust Co. supra).</p> <p id=\"b312-3\" pgmap=\"312\">But it is urged that, even if the trust agreement was illegal in the respects and for the reasons above indicated, yet its illegality could not prevent a recovery in this action of replevin for the alleged reasons, that the motive of parties forming a corporation cannot be inquired into in a collateral proceeding; that the contract' evidenced by the bill of sale was an executed one; and that defendant having received the goods as agent of the plaintiff could not assert a claim adverse to his principal.</p> <p id=\"b312-4\" pgmap=\"312(278) 313(134)\">It is not necessary to discuss the doctrine contended for by appellee, that, where a corporation, as indicated by its articles of association, is legal, and the incorporation is effected in the manner prescribed by law, the intention of the corporators is immaterial. The purpose of the offered testimony was to show, that the sale made to the appellee was an illegal sale, and that the bill of sale, upon which appellee relied to show its title and right of possession, was executed to accomplish an unlawful object. Such proof was entirely consistent with the defacto existence and legal organization of appellee as a corporation. Appellant offered to prove, that he was compelled by Ryan to sign the trust agreement in May, 1888, by the threat, that his business would be ruined by the manufacturers and dealers who had agreed to form the trust; and he swore that he had never heard of appellee until the following July, when Ryan came to him and told him that he must sign the bill of sale to the company, in order to put the stock into the trust. It may be a serious question, whether there was any real sale of the property described in the bill of sale. A sale presumes a vendor on one side and a vendee on the other, each having life and existence and the power and ability to contract, and each acting independently and of his own free choice. But here the vendor, Bishop, and the vendee, the American Preservers\u2019 Company, were controlled and directed by an outside force, the trustees named in the trust agreement acting through Ryan, their representative. Ordinarily, the vendee becomes owner and does what he pleases with his own, but, here, the trust agreement in effect directs the vendee upon what terms it shall hold the property transferred to it, and limits the further sale of the same. Ordinarily, the vendor fixes the price of what he sells, but, here, the trust agreement virtually leaves the fixing of the value of what is sold to the trustees. The proof introduced showed, that appellant had nothing to do with arranging for 331 shares of stock in the appellee company as the value of his property and business, nor did he determine that 662 certificates of trust were a fair equivalent for the stock. All this was settled and arranged beforehand by Ryan. (People v. N. R. S. R. Co. supra).</p> <p id=\"b313-5\" pgmap=\"313\">But if it be assumed, that appellant executed the bill of sale and submitted himself to the control of the trustees, or of appellee, voluntarily and of his own free will, then it follows that he was particeps criminis with them in the unlawful venture. He, as well as appellee, was a party to the unlawful contract evidenced by the bill of sale. If appellee had been an individual, instead of a corporation, and appellant had executed the bill of sale for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, it will not be contended that the bill of sale could be relied upon as a basis of recovery by either party.</p> <p id=\"b313-6\" pgmap=\"313(119) 314(73)\">In Kirkpatrick v. Clark, 132 Ill. 342, the action was ejectment by the grantee in a deed against the grantor therein, who was in possession of the premises. The defendant offered to show, that the deed had been executed for the purpose of defrauding the defendant\u2019s creditors, but the evidence was rejected, and we reversed the case holding that the ruling was erroneous. In that case, we applied the maxim in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis et possidentis, and held that, where parties concerned in illegal agreements are in pari delicto, the law will not aid either, but will leave them without remedy against each other; and it was also there held, that the above maxim applied to executed transactions as well as to those which are executory, and would be enforced by courts of law as well as courts of equity. \u201cWhatever the parties to an action have executed for fraudulent or illegal purposes, the law refuses to lend its aid to enable either party to disturb.\u201d (Smith v. Hobbs, 10 Me. 71). See also Craft v. McConoughy, supra, and Halloran v. Halloran, 137 Ill. 100.</p> <p id=\"b314-3\" pgmap=\"314\">In the case at bar, the appellant never parted with the possession of the property. After he executed the bill of sale, he still continued his business the same as before, though subject to the orders and direction of the trust. The beginning of the action of replevin admits his possession, as replevin does not lie against one not in possession. (Wells on Replevin, 77; Hall v. White, 106 Mass. 599). We see no reason why the doctrine of the' Kirlcpatriclc case does not apply here, although the action is replevin and not ejectment, and although the property involved is personalty and not real estate. The bill of sale rests under the ban of the law, as well when executed to carry out the illegal agreement hereinbefore set forth, as if it had been made for the purpose of defrauding creditors. The law will not aid the appellee to recover the property, but will leave both it and appellant where they were when the suit was begun.</p> <p id=\"b314-4\" pgmap=\"314(116) 315(110)\">Counsel for appellee claim, that, by the bill of sale, appellee became the owner of the property and then turned over the possession of it to appellant under an arrangement by which the latter was to manage it for appellee. Under this view of the case, the agreement, thus made after the sale, was as unlawful as the contract embodied in the bill of sale itself, because appellant thereby agreed to aid in carrying out the illegal purpose of the trust agreement. Letters from Ryan to appellant were introduced in evidence but finally excluded by the court, directing appellant to advance the price on jellies in Chicago so many cents; not to sell at lower prices without referring the matter to him (Ryan); not to offer any goods in Indiana; not to go below a certain price, \u201cbut in competition with outsiders * * * not (to) hesitate to make any price that will do the business;\u201d to send schedules of the stock on hand and estimates of the fruit needed for the season; how to charge paper given and received in the course of business; and how to make entries on the books, etc. These letters, and other offered proof, showed that appellant was holding the property and managing the business under the direction of the trust and under the instructions of its secretary.</p> <p id=\"b315-3\" pgmap=\"315\">The general rule of law is, that a contract made in violation of a statute is void, and that, when a plaintiff cannot establish his cause of action without relying upon an illegal contract, he cannot recover. (Miller v. Ammon, 145 U. S. 421; Penn v. Bornman, 102 Ill. 523; Comrs. of Drainage District v. People, 138 id. 87). In Shaffner v. Pinchback, 133 Ill. 410, we held that, where two persons contribute money to be used by one of them for the purpose of betting or wagering the same on horse races, or if they are partners in the business of betting on horse races, and the money advanced by the plaintiff to the defendant is in furtherance of such business, the plaintiff cannot recover of the defendant any money so contributed or advanced, upon the ground that betting money on a horse race is gaming and in violation of law, and a contract in aid of the offense of gaming is prohibited by statute and void, and no recovery can be had on it; and we there said, that plaintiff and defendant, being jointly engaged in a business which was in violation of law, \u201cwere, in respect to such business, in pari delicto, and the law will refuse its aid to assist either, but will leave them in the positions in which they have placed themselves.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b315-4\" pgmap=\"315(29) 316(18)\">Cobbey in his work on the Law of Replevin (sec. 149) says: \u201cOne who has parted with his property under a contract which is against public policy cannot maintain replevin for it. The law will leave the parties in the situation in which they have placed themselves.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b316-3\" pgmap=\"316\">In Stout v. Watson et al. 19 Ore. 251, the action was replevin, and the plaintiff relied upon a bill of sale in the nature of an assignment, which was void under the statute as not being for the benefit of all the creditors; and the court held, that a motion for a non-suit, made by the defendant at the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, was improperly disallowed, because' the plaintiff had no other evidence of title to the property in controversy except the bill of sale, which had been executed in violation of the statute, or contrary to its provisions, and was therefore void.</p> <p id=\"b316-4\" pgmap=\"316\">In Hutchins v. Weldin, 114 Ind. 80, the action was replevin to recover possession of a horse; plaintiff claimed that he was the owner and entitled to the possession of the horse, and that the defendant had possession of it without right, and unlawfully detained it; there was evidence authorizing the jury to find, that the plaintiff, by an executed contract, had parted with his title to and right to the possession of the horse, but that the contract, although fully executed by the parties thereto, was contra bonos mores and void as against public policy; verdict and judgment below were for the defendant, and the Supreme Court of Indiana, in affirming the judgment, said: \u201cThe law in such a case will leave the parties just where it finds them. If the contract has not been executed, it will not be enforced; if it has been executed, the law will not extend relief. Where a contract void as against sound morals or public policy has been fully executed by both parties, and suit brought under, upon or against such contract, potior est conditio defendentis.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b316-6\" pgmap=\"316\">When the issue in an action of replevin is one of title, the plaintiff must prove a title, on which he can base a lawful possession. (20 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, page 1054).</p> <p id=\"b317-2\" pgmap=\"317\">As to the claim that the relation of agent and principal existed between appellee and appellant, we do not think that the existence of snch a relation, if it had been found by the jury to exist, would authorize a recovery by appellee, if the facts offered to be proven by the defendant had been established by his evidence. It may be admitted to be true, as a general principle in the law of agency, that the agent may not dispute his principal\u2019s title; but there are exceptions to this general principle. (Mechem on Agency, sec. 525). The law will not enforce the performance of an agency, which has for its object, or tends directly to promote, the commission of an illegal act, or an act opposed to public policy, such as the creation of fictitious and unnatural values, or the control or monopoly of traffic in the staple articles of commerce, or the prevention of free and natural competition therein. Ordinarily in such case it will assist neither party. (Mechem on Agency, secs. 20, 35). In illegal transactions prohibited by law, or morals or public policy, an agent cannot recover either for his services, or for his advances and disbursements, nor will the law assist the principal to recover his property or its proceeds. The guilt of both is deemed to be equal, and the maxim is, in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentis. \u201cBach party is left precisely where he is found at the time of the controversy to bear the burden of his own abandonment of his duty to the law of his country.\u201d (Story on Agency\u2014 8 ed. \u2014 secs. 195, 330, 344).</p> <p id=\"b317-3\" pgmap=\"317(94) 318(36)\">In Samuels v. Oliver, 130 Ill. 73, where it appeared that a principal had employed an agent to buy and sell grain with the illegal purpose of controlling the market and price thereof, and this fact was known to the agent, we held, that such principal would not be permitted to recover against the agent for moneys received by him in the course of such business; and it was there said: \u201cWhen the employment of an agent relates to the performance of an immoral or illegal act, * * * neither party can make the contract the basis of a suit against the other. Advances for illegal purposes fall within the same rule, and cannot be recovered by the principal of the agent, or the agent of the principal.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b318-3\" pgmap=\"318\">There are cases, which hold that, if the contract is founded on a new consideration, although in relation to property respecting which there had been unlawful transactions between the parties, it will not be regarded as unlawful. If the promise be unconnected with the illegal act and founded on a new consideration, it will not be tainted by the act. For instance, a principal may recover from his agent money paid to the agent by a third person from whom such money may have been due to the principal upon an illegal transaction, because the contract of the agent to pay the money to the principal is not immediately connected with the illegal transaction. But the law will not assist the principal to recover against the agent, where the contract between them grows directly out of the illegal transaction, and the agent has been concerned in the execution of the illegal transaction and participated in it. The maxim above quoted has application as between the immediate parties to an illegal contract. Here, the offered testimony was for the purpose of showing, that the agent aided and assisted the principal in carrying out the objects of the illegal combination, and was a party to the contract of sale executed in the interest of the illegal transaction, and that the assumed agency, if there was one, had for its object the accomplishment of the unlawful purpose.</p> <p id=\"b318-4\" pgmap=\"318\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the action of the trial court in refusing to admit the defendant\u2019s offered testimony and in excluding that which was admitted, can not be sustained upon any of the grounds urged in support of it, and that, in the rejection and exclusion of such evidence, said court committed error.</p> <p id=\"b318-5\" pgmap=\"318(18) 319(93)\">Other points, some of them of much force, are discussed by counsel. These relate to the admitted abandonment of the trust, and defendant\u2019s alleged rescission of the contract and attempted withdrawal from the trust, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit the case to the jury upon such proof as was before them. We do not deem it necessary, however, to discuss the questions growing out of these other matters, or to pass any opinion upon them. For the reasons above indicated, the judgments of the Appellate and circuit courts are reversed, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p> <p id=\"b319-4\" pgmap=\"319\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
