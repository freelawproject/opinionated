Watson, 54 Ill. App. 432, affirmed.</history><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-10\" pgmap=\"667\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District; \u2014 heard in that court on appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon. Philip Stein, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-11\" pgmap=\"667(146) 668(70)\">The bill in this case was filed in the Superior Court of Cook county by the village of Riverside, setting up that it is a municipal corporation, and that it is the owner in fee simple, for the public use, of all public parks, grounds, streets and commons in said village, and also of certain other lands described in the bill; that appellee proposes to construct a bridge across the Desplaines river, which bridge, if constructed, will be wholly upon the public park and ground belonging to appellant. The bill prays, in substance, as follows: \u201cThat title of your orator to said premises may be established; that said premises be declared and decreed public park and commons; that title to the same vest in your orator in trust, and that defendants, their agents and attorneys, be perpetually enjoined from erecting said bridge,\u201d and for general relief and injunction. The abutments and approaches of the proposed bridge on the north side of the Desplaines river are intended to rest upon a strip of ground alleged to be twenty-five feet off the east side of block 14 of that part known as \u201cSecond Division of Riverside,\u201d while on the south side they are proposed to rest upon what is known in a certain plat as Columbus boulevard.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\" pgmap=\"668\">The answer of appellee denies that appellant was ever seized of any interest in block 14, but claims title to a twenty-five foot strip, being part of block 14, on the north side of the river, in himself, and sets forth that while a plat was made by him of his lands on the south side of the river, on which was located Columbus boulevard parallel with and extending to the river, said plat was made merely for convenience, and that roads and streets were made subservient to the rights of private owners, and that they have not been dedicated to public use, and that said plat was not approved by the village of Riverside.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-6\" pgmap=\"668(180) 669(41)\">While, indirectly, part of the relief asked for in this bill is for an injunction to restrain the construction of this bridge, and indirectly, also, the question of the boundary line of Columbus boulevard and the portion of block 14 aforesaid are involved, the main question presented by the pleadings in this cause is as to whether title to this property is in appellant or appellee. The cause was referred by the Superior Court to the master in chancery to take proofs and report the same to the court, with his conclusions. The master reported that he found appellee to be the owner of the easterly twenty-five feet of block 14, and that the equity of the cause was with the appellee, and that the temporary injunction should be dissolved and the bill dismissed for want of equity. The Superior Court, upon a hearing, overruled all exceptions to the master\u2019s report and dismissed the bill. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Court, and that court, on motion, dismissed the appeal on the ground that a freehold was involved and that it had no jurisdiction of the cause. The case comes to this court solely upon the question as to whether or not it was error in the Appellate Court to refuse to entertain this appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-3\" pgmap=\"669\">Frank F.

Adjudication must first determine that question before the injunction would be permitted to stand. If title to this property is in the village of Riverside as public grounds, then the relief should be granted. It is not for us, however, at this time to determine that question or pass any opinion upon the merits of this case. The pleadings show, very clearly, that a freehold is involved and that the appeal should have been taken directly to this court. No briefs are filed by either appellant or appellee on the merits of the controversy. We have heretofore held that an appeal of this character only brings to this court such matters as might lawfully have been considered in the Appellate Court by virtue of an appeal to that court, and therefore only the question of jurisdiction can be considered here. If it be found that no freehold is involved,\" correct practice would require that the order of dismissal be reversed and the cause remanded to the Appellate Court, with instructions to find upon the issues of fact and render final judgment upon errors assigned. If a freehold is involved, the court is powerless to do more, on this appeal, than to affirm the order of the Appellate Court. Oswald v. Wolf, 126 Ill. 542.</p> <p id=\"b670-5\" pgmap=\"670\">Finding, as we do, that a freehold is here' involved, and that the order of the Appellate Court dismissing the appeal to that court was properly entered, the judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing the appeal must be affirmed. Leave will be given appellant to withdraw the record filed herein, to be re-filed for writ of error from this court, if it so desires. \u2019</p> <p id=\"A9nd\" pgmap=\"670\">T \u201e , Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
