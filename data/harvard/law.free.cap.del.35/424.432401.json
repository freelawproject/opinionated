Such appeal to be taken and bond given within five (5) days from the time of conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">This provision of the statute is clearly for the benefit of the person convicted and may, therefore, be waived by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The defendant voluntarily paid the fine and costs imposed on him by reason of his plea of guilty and has, therefore, waived his right of appeal in this case. <em>State v. Cohen, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>45 <em>Nev. </em>266, 201 <em>P. </em>1027, 18 <em>A. L. R. </em>864; <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1913E, 300, <em>Note; State v. People\u2019s Ice Co., </em>127 <em>Minn. </em>252, 149 <em>N. W. </em>286, <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1916C, 618; 17 <em>C. J. </em>48, \u00a7\u00a7 3326, 3327.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Conceding that there may be some cases that have adopted a contrary rule (Com. <em>v. Fleckner, </em>167 <em>Mass. </em>13, 44 <em>N. E. </em>1053; <em>Johnson v. State, </em>172 <em>Ala. </em>424, 55 <em>So. </em>226, <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1913E, 296; <em>People v. Marks, </em>64 <em>Misc. </em>679, 120 <em>N. </em>F. <em>S. </em>1106) they do not represent the weight of authority, or, as I view it, the most reasonable view of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The defendant points out that under the <em>Motor Vehicle Act (Sections </em>66, 81), the revocation of a driver\u2019s license automatically follows a conviction of driving while intoxicated and contends that he has the right to clear himself of that stigma. But it is not even contended that that is a part of the sentence imposed by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The State\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is, therefore, granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
