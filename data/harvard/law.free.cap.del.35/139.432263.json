At any rate, being no such contention, this Court is not called upon to consider that question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> Technically defined, a contract is an agreement upon a sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing. If, therefore, it was mutually and definitely agreed between Mrs. Saxton and the plaintiff that, in return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>for boarding and caring for her, during the remainder of her life, Mrs. Saxton was not only to pay the plaintiff $15.00 per week board, but if by such agreement, at the death of Mrs. Saxton, Mrs. Rash was also to have the entire balance or residue of her estate, that would amount to a contract to bequeath such balance or residue of her estate to Mrs. Rash, by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">If, however, Mrs. Saxton in appreciation of the care given her by Mrs. Rash merely expressed a purpose or intent to bequeath the residue of her estate to Mrs. Rash, at her death, and did not definitely and specifically agree to do so, as a part of the consideration for being boarded and cared for by Mrs. Rash, she would not be bound to carry out any such expressed intent; and her executor would not be liable in damages, though she failed to make a will to that effect. <em>Van Horn v. Demarest, </em>76 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>386, 77 <em>A. </em>354; <em>Cromwell v. Simons (C. C. </em>A.), 280 <em>F. </em>663.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">But, whether there was a contract in this case, as claimed by the plaintiff, or whether the words attributed to Mrs. Saxton, if made, were mere expressions of a purpose or intent which she was not bound to carry out, as claimed by the defendant, are questions of fact for you to determine from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">As we have already repeatedly stated, the plaintiff\u2019s declaration is based entirely on the existence of a contract with Mrs. Saxton, and her case must, therefore, stand wholly on proof of the making of such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In the language of <em>Walls\u2019 Appeal, </em>111 <em>Pa. </em>460, 5 A. 220, 224, 56 Am. <em>Rep. </em>288, perhaps we might state .that \u201cclaims of this nature against dead men\u2019s estates, resting entirely in paroi, based largely upon loose declarations * * * and when the lips of the party principally interested are closed in death, require the closest and most careful scrutiny to prevent injustice being done.\u201d See, also, <em>Reynolds v. Williams, </em>282 <em>Pa. </em>148, 127 A. 473; <em>Van Horn v. Demarest, </em>76 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>386, 77 A. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(The Court here charged on the preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Whether your verdict shall be for the plaintiff or for the defendant, is for you to determine from the evidence produced before you, when applied to the law as we have . stated it to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">If, however, you believe that there was a contract between Mrs. Saxton and the plaintiff, whereby the plaintiff was to board and care for Mrs. Saxton during the remainder of her life, and Mrs. Saxton was in return to pay her $15.00 per week and was also to bequeath her the residue of her estate, your verdict should be for the plaintiff, though Mrs. Saxton lived at the plaintiff\u2019s house only a few months before her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">But, if you believe that Mrs. Saxton never made any such contract with the plaintiff, and that any statements made by her, if any were made, were merely statements of a purpose or intention to make a will in Mrs. Rash\u2019s favor, your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">If your verdict should be for the plaintiff, it should be for the entire balance of Mrs. Saxton\u2019s personal estate, which is conceded to be, at least, $4,150.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">If your verdict should be for the defendant, it should merely be, \u201cwe find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\"> That there is sufficient mutuality of obligation to make such a contract binding, see, however, <em>Howe v. Watson, </em>179 <em>Mass. </em>30, 60 <em>N. E. </em>415; <em>Garard v. Yeager, Adm\u2019r, </em>154 <em>Ind. </em>253, 56 <em>N. E. </em>237; and <em>Peterborough Savings Bank v. Hartshorn, </em>67 <em>N. H. </em>156, 33 A. 729. See, also, <em>Day v. Washburn, </em>76 <em>N. H. </em>203, 81 A. 474; <em>Johnson v. Hubbell, </em>10 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>332, 66 Am.

Watson, </em>1 <em>Houst. </em>209; <em>Heitz v. Sayers, </em>2 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(32 <em>Del.) </em>207, 216, 219,121 A. 225. See, also, <em>Jack v.
