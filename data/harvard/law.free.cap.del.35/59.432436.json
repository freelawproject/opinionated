Naudain, </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>248, 75 A. 609. It differs from <em>Ross v. Ross, 4 W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>7, 130 A. 677, in that there is nothing to indicate that the facts upon which the charge is based were personally known to the petitioner, while in that case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>charge was extreme cruelty by the respondent toward the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">From certain statements of the Court in <em>Ross v. Ross, </em>it is contended that in an affidavit based on information and belief the sources of the information upon which it is based should be set out; but such statements were . not necessary to the decision of that case and appear to be inconsistent with the decision of the Court in the earlier case of <em>Naudain v. Naudain, </em>1 <em>Boyce </em>248, 75 <em>A. </em>609, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Perhaps we might also add that the <em>Naudain Case </em>was not called to the attention of the Court in the <em>Ross Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">For the reasons above given, the defendant\u2019s motion is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
