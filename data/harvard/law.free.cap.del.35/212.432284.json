From the language of the book entry attached to the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of demand and which forms the basis of his cause of action, it is fairly apparent that the transaction recorded was based on a lease, either verbal or written,' whereby it is claimed that the defendant agreed to pay rent for the plaintiff\u2019s hotel building at the rate of $300 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">While the original scope of the old shop book rule, on which book accounts are based, may have been somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>extended in modern times <em>(Chamb. Hand Book on Ev., </em>\u00a7 993) a contract of this character does not come within that rule and must be proved in the regular way. <em>Ward v. Powell, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>379; <em>Sayers v.
