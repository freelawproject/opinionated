See <em>Hess v. Pawloski, </em>250 <em>Mass. </em>945; <em>Hess v. Pawloski, </em>274 <em>U. S. </em>352; <em>Wuchter v. Pizzutti, </em>276 <em>U. S. </em>13; <em>State v. Belden </em>(Wis.), 211 <em>N. W. </em>916; 39 <em>Harv. Law Rev. </em>563.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The agency in question also applies in \u201cany civil action against any such non-resident owner or operator growing-out of any accident or collision occurring within this State,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The provision to the effect that process served in accordance with its terms shall be as effectual as if served personally in this State is equally broad and unrestricted. This as well as the other language of the statute must, therefore, be given effect in accordance with its usual plain and obvious meaning and without the addition of limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tians or exceptions that do not fairly appear in it. <em>Van Winkle v. State, </em>4 <em>Boyce </em>578 (610); <em>In re Elder, </em>3 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(33 <em>Del.) </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The contention of the defendant company is almost entirely based on <em>Pizzutti v. Wuchter (N. </em>J.), 134 <em>A. </em>727, and <em>State v. Belden </em>(Wis.), 211 <em>N. W. </em>916. In the first of these cases, the Court, in considering a somewhat similar statute, said: \u201cSuch laws seem but the reasonable exercise of the rights of the State for the protection of its citizens.\u201d In the <em>Belden Case, </em>the Court also said: \u201cWhile it is true that constitutional rights may not be subordinated to administrative convenience, we perceive no just reason why a non-resident coming within the State, using the special facilities provided by the State, and afforded the protection of its laws, may not be subjected to the jurisdiction of the State in respect to acts done by him in violation of its law and be compelled to respond in damages for wrongs done its citizens while within the State in the operation of its automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Both of these cases involved suits by resident plaintiffs. The language used by the courts was, therefore, pertinent to the facts before them, but it has no application to this case. Even if it be conceded that the real reason for the enactment of <em>Chap. </em>225, <em>Vol. </em>35, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>was the protection of citizens of the State, there is nothing whatever in the broad and general language used to indicate that it merely applied to the service of process in suits by residents of Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether a statute so limited by its provisions would violate the equal privilege laws of the <em>Constitution of the United States (Sec. 2, Art. </em>4). See, however, <em>Black v. Seal, </em>6 <em>Houst. </em>541; <em>Chambers v. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., </em>207 <em>U. S. </em>142; <em>Paul v. Virginia, </em>8 <em>Wallace </em>168. See, also, Argument of Counsel in <em>Wuchter v. Pizzutti, </em>276 <em>U. S. </em>13, as to the meaning and effect of the clause in the similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>New Jersey statute, which made the Secretary of State the agent of the defendant for the acceptance \u201cof process in any civil suit or procedure by any resident of the State of New Jersey. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The motion of the defendant company to quash the service of process on it is, therefore, refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
