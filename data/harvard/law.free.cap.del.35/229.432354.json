Without offering any evidence to show that they were correct, he then stated that they had been made pursuant to a rule issued by the Court <em>(Rule </em>92, <em>Sup. Ct. Rules) </em>and as he understood it were, therefore, in evidence, but to avoid any question he would offer them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The defendant\u2019s attorneys objected to their admission because they had not. been proved by any competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The Court sustained the objection. <em>Short v. Cummins, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>261; <em>Cann v. Thompson, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>398; <em>Woolley\u2019s Del. Pr., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1498, 1603, 1607, and 1609.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney then produced evidence tending to show that such plots were correct and made from actual surveys in laying down his pretensions. He then renewed his offer and they were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">A witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal after testifying that he was familiar with government maps was shown a map, having a small scale, certified to by a United States Government Department. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney then read <em>Section </em>882 of the <em>U. S. Revenue Act</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in response \u2022 to a question to that effect the witness stated that the map in question was a Government topographic map of a' certain portion of Sussex County, Delaware, designated as the \u201cCape Henlopen Quadrangle\u2019\u2019; that it included the lands in dispute and showed whether they were marsh or upland. For the purpose of showing that such lands were marsh lands, plaintiff\u2019s attorney then offered the map in evidence. The defendant\u2019s attorneys objected to its admission on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ground that, in a controversy of a private nature, the character of the disputed land and whether marsh or upland could not be shown by a mere printed map not made by the witness and not offered as the record of a p'ast recollection. <em>Stev. Dig. on Ev., </em>115, 116, and <em>note; Grossman v. Del. Elec. Poiver Co., </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>521, 155 <em>A. </em>806.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u2022 They further objected that independent of any other question such a topographic map of the general locality would not be a safe guide to show that a particular piece of land, comprising about seven acres, though covered by it, was marsh <em>(Stevens Dig. on Ev., </em>115, 116) ; and that the Federal statute cited by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney had no bearing on copies of records or documents the originals of which were not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The objection was sustained by the Court on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Producing a government pamphlet which was attached to the certified map above referred to, the witness was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cQ. Is this pamphlet a record of the U. S. Government describing the soil at this place (referring to the general locality of the disputed lands) ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201cQ. Does that record describe the lands in dispute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">\u201cA. It does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">\u201cQ. Is there any distinction between tidal and salt marsh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">\u201cA. Not in soil classification; the terms are synonymous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">For the purpose of showing that the lands in dispute were marsh lands, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney then offered in evidence all that portion of the pamphlet that referred to tidal marshes.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">Defendant\u2019s attorneys also objected to its admission because it had not been written by the witness, was not offered as the record of a past recollection <em>(Grossman v. Del. Elec. Power Co., </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(34 <em>Del.) </em>521, 155 A. 806), and merely contained what the author deemed was a correct general description of the lands along the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>coastline of Sussex County. They, therefore, contended that it violated the hearsay rule even if it was conceded to be a recognized standard treatise<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on soils. They further contended that, like the map, it was entirely too general in its scope to be of any assistance in determining the character of the particular lands in dispute. The objection was sustained on both grounds. <em>Stev. Dig. on Ev., </em>115, 116; <em>Chamb. Handbook on Ev., </em>\u00a7 877; <em>Wharton\u2019s Crim.
