Having cooperated with the United States authorities investigating others involved in such criminal activity, Lin sought to avoid his own removal from this country. He now seeks review of a November 23, 2009 order of the BIA, which affirmed the August 13, 2009 decision of immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Steven R. Abrams denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal but reversed IJ Abrams\u2019 grant of relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jiu Tuan Lin, </em>No. A045 700 623 (B.I.A. Nov. 23, 2009), <em>aff'g </em>No. A045 700 623 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 13, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">As a preliminary matter, because Lin does not challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusions that he was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal, we deem any challenge to those conclusions waived. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998). As a result, we review only the BIA\u2019s determination that Lin was not eligible for deferral of removal under the CAT. Lin argues that, in reaching this conclusion, the BIA engaged in impermissible fact-finding, a question of law over which we retain jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir.2004); <em>De La Rosa v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 103, 107-08 (2d Cir.2010). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">To establish his eligibility for deferral of removal under the CAT, Lin was required to demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that government officials in China would \u201cknow of or remain willfully blind to\u201d anticipated acts of torture by persons against whom Lin had cooperated and \u201cthereafter breach their legal responsibility to prevent it.\u201d <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir.2004). The BIA determined that Lin\u2019s evidence \u2014 that a human trafficker with whom he worked \u201chas a lot of power in China\u201d and that the trafficker\u2019s father \u201cis a high ranking official in China\u201d \u2014 was insufficient as a matter of law to establish official Chinese government acquiescence in the feared retribution or an inability or unwillingness to prevent it. In reaching this legal conclusion, the BIA characterized the evidence about the position of the trafficker\u2019s father as derived from an uncorroborated cellmate, when, in fact, Lin stated that he had this information from the trafficker himself. No matter. The BIA did not disturb the IJ\u2019s factual determinations as to the father\u2019s position or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>other point in reaching its legal conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to establish government acquiescence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3); <em>De La Rosa v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 103, 107-09 (2d Cir.2010) (BIA reviews legal question of official acquiescence <em>de novo </em>and related findings of fact for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
