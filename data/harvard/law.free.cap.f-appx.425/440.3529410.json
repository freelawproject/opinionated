Fitch, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing his civil rights action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because Fitch has not stated a facially plausible claim, affirmance is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In November 2008, Fitch filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, seeking $30 million in damages, along with declaratory and injunctive relief against nineteen named defendants \u2014 employees at USP-Big Sandy, employees at USPMcCreary, and several federal officials \u2014 in their individual and official capacities. Fitch\u2019s complaint stems from an incident that occurred while he resided in Big Sandy. He alleged that, in June 2006, two Big Sandy employees plotted to instigate an altercation between Fitch and other prisoners, which led Fitch into a physical altercation with one of the employees. Fitch was thereafter indicted on two federal assault counts. The jury returned a not-guilty verdict on one count, but a guilty verdict on the other, for which Fitch received a six-month sentence. We affirmed the sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Fitch, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 871 (6th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The district court dismissed, sua sponte, Fitch\u2019s civil rights action, finding that Fitch failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and alternatively that his complaint failed to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b). The district court issued orders denying Fitch\u2019s motion to recuse and certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">On appeal, Fitch challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies and that he did not have valid reasons for the delay in filing his grievances. He also claims that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint, ignoring his request to amend his complaint, denying his motion to re-cuse, and certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">We review de novo a dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. <em>Jones v. Smith, </em>266 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir.2001). The district court should not have dismissed Fitch\u2019s complaint sua sponte for failure to exhaust, because exhaustion is an affirmative defense that may serve as a basis for dismissal only if raised and proven by the defendants. <em>See Kramer v. Wilkinson, </em>226 Fed.Appx. 461, 462 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007)). Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s error was harmless because Fitch\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim. <em>Cf. City Mgmt. Corp. v. U.S. Chem. Co., </em>43 F.3d 244, 251 (6th Cir.1994) (court of appeals can affirm on any grounds supported by the record, even if different from the grounds relied on by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">A complaint dismissed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(b) for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo. <em>Thomas v. Eby, </em>481 F.3d 434, 437 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000)). \u201c[A] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>-U.S.-,-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Fitch\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims relate to his prosecution and conviction for assault, as he alleged that the defendants conspired against him to bring charges and thwart his defense, and that they selectively set him up because he is an African-American. These claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 action because his conviction or sentence has not been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). As for Fitch\u2019s vague claim that the federal government has sought to violate his human rights for a number of years, it was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Fitch\u2019s remaining arguments lack merit. Even if the district court erred by ignoring his request to amend his complaint, it would be harmless because his proposed amendments would have failed to save his complaint from dismissal. Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Fitch\u2019s motion to recuse, which was filed after his case had been dismissed. <em>See Briggs v. City of Cincinnati, </em>76 Fed.Appx. 605, 607 (6th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Sammons, </em>918 F.2d 592, 599 (6th Cir.1990). Finally, the district court did not err in certifying that Fitch\u2019s appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
