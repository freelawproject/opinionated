For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Goodman alleges the following facts, which we accept as true and we construe in the light most favorable to him, <em>see Schatz v. Rosenberg, </em>943 F.2d 485, 489 (4th Cir.1991), recognizing that liberal construction of his pleadings is especially appropriate here because he is a pro se litigant raising civil rights issues, <em>see Smith v. Smith, </em>589 F.3d 736, 738 (4th Cir.2009). Goodman is incarcerated at the Mount Olive Correctional Complex in West Virginia. On December 9, 2008, he received a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine from a nurse employed by Wexford Health Sources, Inc. (\u201cWexford\u201d). At that time, the nurse gave Goodman a pamphlet issued by the federal government that explained the vaccine and its associated risks. Further, she advised him to seek medical attention in the event he suffered any allergic reaction to the vaccine injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">On December 11, 2008, Goodman experienced adverse reactions to the vaccine, including swelling and redness in his arm, breathing problems, and hives. He asked a prison official<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cfor medical assistance\u201d and \u201cto see the doctor, or nurse, for reactions from the shot,\u201d J.A. 7, 14, but the prison official denied Goodman\u2019s request and threatened him with a \u201cwrite up\u201d if he was not having any reactions. Goodman then \u201ctold the CO to forget about it\u201d and that he would \u201cact as if it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d J.A. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">Goodman instituted this \u00a7 1983 action seeking monetary damages for violations of his Eighth Amendment right to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the case was screened by a magistrate judge, who submitted a proposed recommendation to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. Goodman filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Goodman\u2019s complaint. Goodman now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss de novo, <em>Schatz, </em>943 F.2d at 489, and we will dismiss a complaint \u201cif it does not allege \u2018enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>facts to state a claim to relief that is <em>plausible </em>on its face,\u2019 \u201d <em>Giarratano v. Johnson, </em>521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). The complaint must allege facts sufficient \u201cto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment protects prisoners from the \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\u201d which includes \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To prevail on an Eighth Amendment claim, \u201ca prisoner must prove two elements: (1) that objectively the deprivation of a basic human need was sufficiently serious, and (2) that subjectively the prison officials acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Quinones, </em>145 F.3d 164, 167 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The first element \u201cis satisfied by a serious medical condition,\u201d while the second element \u201cis satisfied by showing deliberate indifference by prison officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mere negligence does not constitute deliberate indifference; \u201c[bjasically, a prison official \u2018must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). Thus, a prison official may be held liable for deliberate indifference only where \u201cthe official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Viewing the allegations of the complaint in the light most favorable to Goodman, we conclude the district court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Goodman alleges that after requesting to see a doctor or nurse, the prison official warned him that he would receive a \u201cwrite up\u201d if he was not having the complained-of reactions. At that point, Goodman admits that he withdrew his request for assistance and told the prison official to \u201cforget about it.\u201d The official could have reasonably inferred from Goodman\u2019s response that he was not experiencing any of the alleged reactions; regardless, having received the instruction to \u201cforget about it,\u201d and under the facts of this case, no prison official could be deliberately indifferent to a prisoner\u2019s medical need by taking no further action. Therefore, we conclude that Goodman\u2019s factual allegations do not support a finding that the prison official had a sufficiently culpable state of mind of deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Goodman also argues that the factual assertions made in his objections should be considered and liberally construed along with the allegations in his complaint in determining whether to dismiss his complaint for failure to state a claim. As such, Goodman contends that dismissal of his complaint was improper because he asserts in his objections that the nurse, in addition to the prison official, knew of but disregarded his medical condition. J.A. 29. Thus, regardless of whether he had withdrawn his request to the prison official, Goodman argues the nurse still had an independent obligation to respond to his request and failure to do so constituted deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. However, Goodman cites' no supporting authority, nor have we found any, for the proposition that, when reviewing a complaint for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, factual assertions contained in the plaintiffs objections to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation <em>must </em>be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>viewed in the same light as factual contained in the initial complaint. <em>Cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) (requiring district court to make de novo review of proposed findings and to which objection is made, and permitting the court to receive further <em>Doe v. Chao, </em>306 F.3d 170, 183 n. 9 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c[Wjhether to consider such evidence rests within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AxC\">We decline to decide this issue here because even if we accept as true all of the factual assertions made in Goodman\u2019s and objections and construe those facts in a light most favorable to him, we conclude he has failed to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Good-man does not allege that he spoke directly to the nurse to inform her of his medical condition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor does he allege that anyone told the nurse of his condition. All he alleges is that the nurse knew. This with nothing more, is not sufficient to support a finding that the nurse had a sufficiently culpable state of mind of indifference to a serious medical condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">Therefore, because Goodman has failed to allege facts sufficient to support a that the prison official and nurse were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, he has failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim against Wexford.</p>\n<p id=\"pAhn\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"AnP\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Good-man\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AAFs\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-13\">. It appears from Goodman\u2019s complaint that he directed his request toward \"the night worker, or the CO\u201d <em>{i.e. </em>correctional officer), whom he also refers to elsewhere in his filings as simply a \"prison official.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AcZ\">. Goodman's counsel acknowledged during oral argument that Goodman does not allege he actually talked to the nurse, but only that the nurse knew of his condition. Moreover, Goodman's complaint and objections indicate that his communication to the nurse was rather than direct. For example, he told the CO \"to tell the nurse\u201d to write him up, J.A. 14; and he \"aslc[ed] to see a nurse, or doctor,\u201d J.A. 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AdC\">. We note that, to the extent the nurse was aware of Goodman's condition, on this record it was necessarily the result of the prison official informing her. And, assuming the prison official did communicate Goodman's request to the nurse, there is no basis to believe he failed to convey Goodman's full conversation, including the fact that he had withdrawn his request for assistance. Nothing in Goodman\u2019s complaint suggests the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
