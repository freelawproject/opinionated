We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because it was untimely, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and petitioners failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in Fiji to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-25\">We reject petitioners contention that the BIA faded to consider the evidence because they have not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-26\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
