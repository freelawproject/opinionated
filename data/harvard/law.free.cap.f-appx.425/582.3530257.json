We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s adverse credibility findings. <em>Saval v. Holder, </em>623 F.3d 666, 670 (9th Cir.2010). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-22\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Romero-Bonilla\u2019s failure to explain adequately the discrepancy between his mother\u2019s TPS application and his testimony as to the date he entered the United States. <em>See Kasnecovic v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2005). It follows that Romero-Bonilla\u2019s due process challenge to the IJ\u2019s decision fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Romero-Bonilla\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that he failed to establish prejudice from his former counsel\u2019s representation. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 899-900 (prejudice results when counsel\u2019s performance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-24\">In light of our disposition, we do not address Romero-Bonilla\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-25\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
