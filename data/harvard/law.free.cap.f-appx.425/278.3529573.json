He argues that the district court should have considered the merits of his petition pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dretke v. Haley, </em>541 U.S. 386, 394, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed.2d 659 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">To challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence through a Section 2241 petition, Williams must affirmatively show that the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). This requires him to make a showing of both actual innocence and retroactivity. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Specifically, he must establish that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Williams has not done so. <em>Haley </em>does not establish that his convictions were for nonexistent offenses, nor does it provide a new avenue for postconviction relief or a means of bypassing the statutory scheme of postconviction relief. <em>See Haley, </em>541 U.S. at 392-95,124 S.Ct. 1847.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(h) &amp; 2244(b)(3)(C); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 897-98. Williams is CAUTIONED that future attempts to circumvent the successive-motion requirements of Section 2255 will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
