Mills contends that (1) his waiver of appearance was not knowing or voluntary and he should have been present at resen-tencing, and (2) the sentence was procedurally unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">We conclude that the district court was without jurisdiction to resentence Mills ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>cept to the extent that it granted Mills\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2006) habeas corpus petition and directed that restitution be modified. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) (2006); <em>see Timms v. Johns, </em>627 F.3d 525, 530 (4th Cir.2010) (district court\u2019s authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is not without limits). We further conclude that given Mills\u2019 signed statement waiving his right to be present at resentencing and that the court granted him the relief he sought in his \u00a7 2241 petition, we find no plain error regarding his absence. <em>See United States v. Rhodes, </em>32 F.3d 867, 874 (4th Cir.1994) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We affirm the amended judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
