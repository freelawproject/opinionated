We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review de novo due process claims. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-22\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Simon-Francisco\u2019s motion to reopen because the record shows that he was personally served with an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(a)(l)-(3) (1995), and he also failed to allege exceptional circumstances for missing his hearing, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">Simon-Francisco\u2019s contention that the agency violated due process by failing to consider his declaration fails where the record shows that a declaration was never filed with the agency. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error to prevail on a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">Simon-Francisco\u2019s remaining contention is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
