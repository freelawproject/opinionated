Based on an enhancement pursuant to his previous guilty plea to possession of cocaine, Hall was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii), 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Hall appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. He relies on: the retroactive amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for crack-cocaine offenses; <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny; and the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) (reduced disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses), which, he contends, should apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases in which the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion; its interpretation of the Guidelines, <em>de novo. United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Because Hall received the mandatory minimum sentence, he was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief under the recent crack-cocaine Guideline amendments. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 851; <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 430-31 (5th Cir.1994). Hall\u2019s assertion that he is entitled to re-sentencing under the FSA is without merit: the FSA does <em>not </em>apply retroactively. <em>United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011). To the extent Hall urges our court to consider the effect of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny, his contention is unavailing. The principles of <em>Booker </em>and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than the reduction allowed under Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10 (limits circumstances \u25a0under which defendant is entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on retroactive Guideline amendments). <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
