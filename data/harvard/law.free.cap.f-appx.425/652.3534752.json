We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">Absent showings of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice,\u201d not established by Alvarez here, federal habeas relief is unavailable when \u201ca state court [has] declined to address a prisoner\u2019s federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,\u201d and \u201cthe state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729-730, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). The Supreme Court recently held that denial of habeas relief by the California Supreme Court on the ground that the application for relief was filed untimely was an independent and adequate state procedural ground requiring denial of a subsequent habeas petition in federal court, overturning this court\u2019s precedent to the contrary. <em>Walker v. Martin, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1120, 179 L.Ed.2d 62 (2011). The California Supreme Court denied Alvarez\u2019s petition with a citation to <em>In re Clark, </em>5 Cal.4th 750, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729 (1993). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>citation to <em>Clark </em>signals the court\u2019s conclusion that the petition was untimely. <em>Walker, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Alvarez\u2019s petition did not qualify for equitable tolling, in any event. He did not demonstrate an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d standing in his way to prevent timely filing, under <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), nor attorney action that rose to the level of \u201cegregious\u201d misconduct, as described in <em>Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 801 (9th Cir.2003). <em>See Miranda v. Castro, </em>292 F.3d 1063, 1066-67 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001); and <em>Green v. White, </em>223 F.3d 1001, 1003 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b676-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b677-9\">WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A81\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">I concur in the memorandum disposition except for the last paragraph which is unnecessary for our decision. <em>Walker v. Martin </em>decides the appeal. \u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1120, 179 L.Ed.2d 62 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">I write separately to express my disappointment that neither counsel cited <em>Walker </em>by a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure Rule 280(j) letter and one attorney was unaware of its existence. We rely on counsel to provide pertinent authority so that we can make correct decisions. I had found <em>Walker </em>myself and am perplexed that Alvarez\u2019s counsel missed it. I am also perplexed that counsel for the State of California failed to provide <em>Walker </em>to us. At oral argument, counsel stated she was aware of <em>Walker </em>but chose not to file a 280(j) letter. Nevertheless, she was prepared to and did argue that <em>Walker </em>was controlling precedent. By failing to provide <em>Walker </em>in a 280(j) letter, the State\u2019s counsel deprived Alvarez\u2019s counsel of the chance to respond, and thereby deprived us of possibly helpful oral argument.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
