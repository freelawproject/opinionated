The City filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. We VACATE and REMAND Christopher Zamora\u2019s retaliation claim to the district court for reconsideration in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. With respect to the remaining claims, we AFFIRM the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">I. RETALIATION<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">Christopher argues that the district court erred in finding that he had not shown a genuine issue of fact with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>to his prima facie case of retaliation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee who opposes an employment practice made unlawful by Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must provide evidence that: (1) he engaged in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>See, e.g., Stewart v. Miss. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>586 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir.2009). We have defined protected activity as \u201copposition to any practice rendered unlawful by Title VII, including making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in any investigation, proceedings, or hearing under Title VII.\u201d <em>Ackel v. Nat\u2019l Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 376, 385 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Here, with respect to the first prong, the district court ruled that Christopher did not demonstrate that he participated in an activity protected by Title VII; instead, it concluded that Christopher\u2019s retaliation claim was based on the protected activity engaged in by his father, Manuel. Citing Fifth Circuit precedent, the district court ruled that Christopher\u2019s \u201callegation is legally insufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, which requires that a plaintiff demonstrate retaliation because of <em>his own </em>protected activity.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">. Very recently, however, the Supreme Court held that an employee could bring a Title VII claim on the basis of retaliation that he suffered in response to protected activity engaged in by a co-worker who was a close family member. <em>Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 863, 178 L.Ed.2d 694 (2011). In <em>Thompson, </em>Eric Thompson and his fian-c\u00e9e, Miriam Regalado, were both employed by North American Stainless (NAS). <em>Id. </em>at 867, 131 S.Ct. 863. Regalado filed an EEOC complaint alleging sex discrimination, and three weeks later, NAS terminated Thompson\u2019s employment. <em>Id. </em>Applying the Burlington<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> test, the Supreme Court thought \u201cit obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fiance would be fired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868. Nonetheless, NAS argued that if the <em>Burlington </em>standard is applied to \u201cthird-party reprisals,\u201d then the \u201cemployer [will be] at risk any time it fires any employee who happens to have a connection to a different employee who filed a charge with the EEOC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court rejected NAS\u2019s argument, concluding that \u201cthere is no textual basis for making an exception to it for third-party reprisals, and a preference for clear rules cannot justify departing from statutory text.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court declined to provide a \u201cfixed class of relationships for which third-party reprisals are unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the Court opined that \u201cfiring a close family member will almost always meet the <em>Burlington </em>standard, and inflicting a milder reprisal on a mere acquaintance will almost never do so, but beyond that we are reluctant to generalize.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>When ruling on the instant motion for summary judgment, the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent pronouncement that a plaintiff may bring a retaliation claim based on a close family member\u2019s engaging in protected activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the district court found that Christopher made an insufficient showing on the first prong of the test, it did not address the remaining two prongs of the test (1) whether the employer took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (2) whether a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. Under these circumstances, we vacate and remand Christopher\u2019s claim of retaliation to allow the district court to reconsider the motion for summary judgment in light of <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">II. DISPARATE TREATMENT</p>\n<p id=\"AK-\">A. Manuel</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Manuel contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to his claims of disparate treatment with respect to the denial of his three requests to be transferred to other lieutenant positions. The district court recognized our holding that \u201cthe denial of a transfer <em>may </em>be the objective equivalent of the denial of a promotion and thus qualify as an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, </em>492 F.3d 605, 614 (5th Cir.2007). Nonetheless, the district court ruled that Manuel did not provide evidence showing that the three positions constituted anything more than purely lateral transfers, which do not qualify as adverse employment actions. <em>Burger v. Cent. Apartment Mgmt., Inc., </em>168 F.3d <em>875, </em>879 (5th Cir.1999). After having reviewed the evidence cited by Manuel, we agree with the district court that Manuel has failed to raise a fact issue with respect to whether the three other lieutenant positions were objectively better than Manuel\u2019s current lieutenant position. We thus affirm the grant of summary judgment as to Manuel\u2019s disparate treatment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">B. Christopher</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Christopher contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against his claim of disparate treatment based on HPD transferring him to a less desirable patrol assignment. The district court ruled that Christopher had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether race discrimination was a motivating factor for his transfer. Indeed, the court found that he \u201cfail[sj even to argue that race discrimination was the reason for [his] transfer. [Christopher\u2019s] theory of the case ... is that HPD personnel forced [him] to transfer out of the Crime Reduction Unit, and to take a less prestigious patrol position, in order to retaliate against him for the EEOC charge and lawsuit filed by his father.\u201d We have reviewed Christopher\u2019s claim and agree with the district court that Christopher\u2019s theory of this claim was not actually discrimination, but is instead one of retaliation. Thus, the City\u2019s motivation for transferring him to a purportedly lesser position did not involve discrimination. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to Christopher\u2019s claim of disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">III. DISPARATE IMPACT</p>\n<p id=\"pA7\">Manuel contends that the district court erred in granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment on his claim of disparate impact based on HPD\u2019s procedures for promotion to the rank of captain. The district court ruled that the \u201cPlaintiffs have provided inadequate explanation of the statistics, and have made no proffer of expert testimony to interpret them.\u201d The court further noted that their briefing did not \u201ccontrol or account for other variables that may affect the promotion decisions cited.\u201d Finally, the court found that Manuel did not satisfy the requirement of showing causation by conducting a systemic analysis of the disparate effects of all the promotional criteria for each rank. <em>See Johnson v. Uncle Ben\u2019s, Inc., </em>965 F.2d 1363, 1367 (5th Cir.1992). On appeal, Manuel has failed to show that the district court erred in its ruling, and thus we AFFIRM, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">For the above reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">. In the district court, Manuel also raised a claim of retaliation, which the district court ruled did not raise a genuine issue of material</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4. fact. In his brief on appeal, Manuel mentions his retaliation claim in the statement of issues, but does not brief it. Thus, Manuel has abandoned any retaliation claim. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., Inc., </em>985 F.2d 824, 831 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. Because the two Plaintiffs-Appellants are father and son and share the same last name, this opinion refers to them individually by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">. <em>Burlington N. &amp; S.F.R. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (explaining that \"a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. Indeed, at the time of its ruling, the district court was bound by pur precedent that required a plaintiff\u2019s claim of retaliation be based on the plaintiff's engaging in his own protected activity. <em>See, e.g., Holt v. JTM In</em>dus., 89 F.3d 1224, 1227 (5th Cir.1996) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act claim); <em>DeHart v. Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc., </em>214 Fed.Appx. 437, 441 (5th Cir.2007) (Title VII claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
