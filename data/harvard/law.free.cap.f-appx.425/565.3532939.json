Case argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision should be reversed because it did not contain the requisite \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons\u201d for rejecting her treating rheumatologist\u2019s opinions about her residual functional capacity (RFC). <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 600 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the ALJ properly \u201cset[ ] out a detailed and thorough summary of the facts and conflicting clinical evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted), we conclude that several of the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discounting the treating physician\u2019s RFC were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">The ALJ erred by discounting the treating physician\u2019s RFC because it was completed \u201cfor obvious litigious purposes.\u201d \u201cThe purpose for which medical reports are obtained does not provide a legitimate basis for rejecting them\u201d unless there is additional evidence demonstrating impropriety, and the ALJ identified no such evidence. <em>Lester v. Chater, 81 F.3d 821, </em>832 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 726 (9th Cir.1998). Athough this error, standing alone, might not have required reversal, the ALJ also erred by assuming that Case\u2019s shoulder impairment should be disregarded because it was only recently diagnosed. The ALJ must consider impairments even if they were diagnosed after the alleged date of disability onset. <em>See Carmickle v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1164 (9th Cir.2008) (holding that the ALJ erred by rejecting limitations because they were based on a \u201crecent\u201d diagnosis of a \u201cnon-severe\u201d impairment).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">The ALJ also noted that Case\u2019s shoulder injury was treated conservatively. A-though we have held that conservative treatment of allegedly disabling conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>may undermine a finding of disability, <em>see Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1433 (9th Cir.1995), it is unclear whether or to what extent this factored into the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In any event, even if the conservative treatment of the shoulder impairment suggests that this particular injury is not severe, \u201c[t]he ALJ is required to consider all of the limitations imposed by the claimant\u2019s impairments, even those that are not severe,\u201d because in combination with other impairments, non-severe limitations may contribute to rendering a claimant disabled. <em>Carmickle, </em>533 F.3d at 1164. Notably, in the first and second hypothetical RFCs that the ALJ asked the vocational expert (VE) to consider, the ALJ included no limitations on the ability to push and pull with the upper extremities, and the VE testified that jobs would be available. By contrast, the VE testified that there would be no work available under the third hypothetical, where the ALJ had introduced additional impairments, including limitations to the upper extremities consistent with Dr. Butler\u2019s opinions about Case\u2019s shoulder impairment. Although this conclusion may have been due to limitations other than the shoulder impairment, because it is unclear on appeal which limitations made the difference, we cannot conclude the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
