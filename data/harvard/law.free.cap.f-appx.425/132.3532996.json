Berg, filed this diversity suit against Orly Taitz and a number of individuals and organizations apparently allied with her. The complaint included claims of defamation, slander, and libel, arising out of defendants\u2019 alleged mass publication of Liberi\u2019s name, social security number, and other identifying and purportedly false biographical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">On June 25, 2009, at the plaintiffs\u2019 request, the District Court entered an order dismissing without prejudice two of the defendants to maintain diversity jurisdiction. On June 4, 2010, the District Court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, severed the litigation into two independent matters and transferred the cases to the Central District of California and the Western District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Defendants then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">While the appeal was pending, a divided motions panel, without opinion, denied the plaintiffs motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction. After further briefing by the parties submitted at the direction of the Court, we have again reviewed the litigation and now direct that this appeal be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Defendants contend that the jurisdictional matter was settled by the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. However, under our Internal Operating Procedures, jurisdictional questions are reserved for the merits panel. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.3.5 (\u201cIf ... the [motions] panel votes not to grant the motion [to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction], the motion is referred by order, without decision and without prejudice, to the merits panel\u201d); <em>Reilly v. City of Atlantic City, </em>532 F.3d 216, 223 (3d Cir.2008) (motions panel\u2019s denials of motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction \u201ceffectively constituted ... referrals\u201d of motions to merits panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">\u201cIt is entirely settled ... that an order granting ... a motion to transfer venue under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1404(a) ... is interlocutory in character and not immediately appealable under Section 1291.\u201d 15 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3855, at 319 (3d ed.2007). There being no basis for this Court to adjudicate the issues raised by defendants, it is ordered that the appeal be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>All unresolved motions shall be decided by the transferee courts because we lack jurisdiction to determine the merits. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3846, at 69 (after grant of motion to transfer venue and lodging of papers with transferee court\u2019s clerk, \u201cthe transferor court \u2014 and the appellate court that has jurisdiction over it \u2014 loses all jurisdiction over the case and may not proceed further with regard to it\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 79 (once transfer order is entered, \u201call further proceedings in the action merely are referred to and determined by the transferee tribunal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Order accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-14\">. In response to our request for briefing on the appealability of the transfer order, defendants asked that we treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus. Because there were no \u201cexceptional circumstances amounting to a 'judicial usurpation of power\u2019 \u201d on the part of the District Court, see <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967), and the issue of subject matter jurisdiction may be addressed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the transferee court, <em>see Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of Cal., </em>426 U.S. 394, 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (writ should not issue where other adequate remedies exist), the alternative request for mandamus relief is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
