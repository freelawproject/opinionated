McNeil was convicted in 2006 of illegal firearms possession .and sentenced to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. He now appeals from a sentence of ten months\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release for violation of various conditions of his original term of supervised release. McNeil asserts that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 .3583(e)(4) by imposing a two-month curfew condition on his supervised release at the same time that it imposed a ten-month prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The government has moved to dismiss this appeal as moot because McNeil, who was arrested yet again for violating his release conditions during the pendency of this appeal, was sentenced by the district court to time-served without any further supervised release. In opposing dismissal, McNeil argues that his appeal still presents a live controversy because \u201cthe district court retains jurisdiction beyond a term of supervised release to reimpose a term of imprisonment and/or supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(i).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opp\u2019n \u00b6 4. That provision, however, authorizes a district court to impose further punishment for a defendant\u2019s violation of release conditions after the expiration of his supervision term only \u201cif, before its expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(i). That is not this case. No violation proceedings remain pending in the district court that would authorize future imposition of any punishment. Thus, McNeil\u2019s challenge to conditions to which he is no longer subject is moot. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>446 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We have considered McNeil\u2019s other arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion is GRANTED and McNeil\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
