We review whether a criminal offense constitutes an aggravated felony de novo. <em>Martinez-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 1022, 1025 (9th Cir.2005). In addition, Agbor argues that he is entitled to deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17. We apply a substantial evidence standard of review to claims under the CAT. <em>Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 936 (9th Cir.2004). Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we need not recite them here. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review and hold that Agbor is not entitled to deferral of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">Agbor pled guilty to one count of manslaughter, in violation of Utah Code \u00a7 76-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>5-205. He argues that the statute is not a crime of violence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We first consider whether the criminal offense \u201cis categorically a crime of violence by assessing whether the full range of conduct covered by the statute falls within the meaning of that term.\u201d <em>United States v. Grajeda, </em>581 F.3d 1186, 1189 (9th Cir.2009). If the statute of conviction punishes some conduct that would qualify as a crime of violence and some conduct that would not, it does not categorically constitute a crime of violence. <em>See id. </em>The statute here proscribes both reckless and intentional conduct. \u201cNeither recklessness nor gross negligence is a sufficient <em>mens rea </em>to establish that a conviction is for a crime of violence.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 1121, 1130 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). As the \u201cstatute\u2019s greater breadth is evident from its text,\u201d the statute cannot categorically be a crime of violence under \u00a7 16. <em>United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1082 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\u201c[T]he modified categorical approach is appropriate when the statute of conviction is divisible into several crimes, some of which fall under the relevant category, and some of which do not.\u201d <em>Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 1147, 1159-60 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Carty v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir. 2005)). The court may consider \u201cthe statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snellenberger, </em>548 F.3d 699, 701 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In this case, the plea agreement indicates that Agbor was convicted of \u201ccriminal homicide ... under circumstances where the actor reasonably believes the circumstances provide a legal justification or excuse for his conduct although the conduct is not legally justifiable or excusable under the existing circumstances.\u201d More to the point, the plea agreement includes a statement of the conduct leading to his plea, in which Agbor states that he \u201cshot and killed\u201d another person. Thus, Agbor was convicted under subsection (l)(b) of Utah Code \u00a7 76-5-205. Because this subsection addresses conduct involving the intentional, use of physical force against another in the course of committing the offense, it thereby constitutes a crime of violence under <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Agbor also appeals the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of his deferral of removal under the CAT. We have jurisdiction to review Agbor\u2019s claim for deferral of removal. <em>See Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir.2008) (jurisdiction retained to review IJ\u2019s deferral of removal under the CAT when decision is on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Article III of the CAT provides that the United States should not return any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir.2005). Agbor bears the burden of showing \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured in [Nigeria].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.17(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">We hold that Agbor has not met his burden and that substantial evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the record supports the IJ\u2019s determination. The IJ found Agbor credible; however, he described his testimony as \u201cspeculative and conjectural,\u201d noting that Agbor testified only to what he <em>believed </em>to be the current state of affairs in Nigeria. The IJ noted that Agbor\u2019s testimony was speculative and without foundation as to why Ag-bor\u2019s mother\u2019s role as a student activist in the distant past would lead to his torture upon his return. As to Agbor\u2019s fear that his Christian beliefs would lead to torture, the IJ noted that there was no corroboration of his fear in the Department of State\u2019s country report, which noted that Christians comprise a majority of the population in some states in Nigeria. As there is nothing in the record that would compel a reasonable fact finder to conclude differently, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
