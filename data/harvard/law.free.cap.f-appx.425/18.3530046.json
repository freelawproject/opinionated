We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Unusually in the annals of New York City real estate,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiffs complaint stems from a co-op board\u2019s <em>approval </em>of his application to purchase an apartment. In 2007, plaintiff agreed to purchase a $14 million ground-floor co-operative unit in a Manhattan apartment building, intending to rent the unit to a commercial tenant\u2014 an arrangement that Malley, a real estate broker, had allegedly assured him would be possible and lucrative. After plaintiff had signed a contract to purchase the property, agreeing to submit a completed application to the co-op board, and put down a $250,000 initial deposit on the unit \u2014 but before the closing \u2014 he learned that the co-op\u2019s bylaws and the property deed would bar him from renting the unit to a commercial tenant, because the unit could be used only as an artist live-work space. Plaintiff admits that this restriction was fully disclosed in the documents referenced in the contract, and that the defendants had provided these documents to plaintiffs attorney, but that he had failed to read them.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">When plaintiff failed to close on the purchase, he lost his $250,000 deposit, which the contract permitted the unit\u2019s sellers to keep as liquidated damages if plaintiff defaulted, unless that default was the result of the co-op board\u2019s rejection of his application. Plaintiff then sued nearly everyone involved in the failed transaction \u2014 the broker, Malley; the sellers, the Luskers; the attorney he had hired to help him purchase the unit, Steven Ebert, and the attorney\u2019s firm, Ebert &amp; Associates (collectively \u201cEbert\u201d); and the co-op \u2014 alleging New York state-law claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, negligence, fraud, and professional malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">Malley and the Luskers separately moved to dismiss his complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The co-op answered the complaint, and subsequently moved for a judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). The district court (McMahon, J.) granted the motions. <em>See Stokes v. Lusker, </em>No. 08 Civ. 3667, 2009 WL 612336, at *5-9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that he set forth sufficient allegations to survive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Rule 12(b)(6) and 12(c) motions. Additionally, for the first time on appeal, plaintiff suggests that the Luskers entered into an \u201cillicit deal\u201d with the co-op board, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13, whereby the Luskers paid the board \u201cmoney (a bribe) to approve Stokes as a member they would not otherwise approve\u201d so that the Luskers could retain the $250,000 deposit, <em>id. </em>at 9-10. Plaintiff argues that by dismissing his complaint, the district court \u201cheld that the Luskers were in fact permitted to use such illicit methodology,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12, and \u201cimplicitly said such actions were permissible,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion de novo, and \u201cconsider the legal sufficiency of the complaint, taking its factual allegations to be true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir.2009). We apply the same standard to Rule 12(c) motions. <em>See Bank of N.Y. v. First Millennium, Inc., </em>607 F.3d 905, 922 (2d Cir.2010). Thus, to survive a motion under either Rule, \u201cthe complaint \u2018must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Hayden v. Paterson, </em>594 F.3d 150, 160 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Upon an independent and de novo review, we conclude that defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) and 12(c) motions were properly granted, for substantially the same reasons stated in the district court\u2019s memorandum and order. Plaintiffs fraud claims fail because, even assuming that defendants made oral misrepresentations to plaintiff regarding the possible uses of the unit, plaintiff cannot show that he reasonably relied on those misrepresentations. In the contract, the parties expressly disclaimed reliance on oral representations, Contract \u00b6 14.1, and plaintiff represented that he had \u201cexamined and is satisfied with\u201d the relevant documents, or \u201caccepts and assumes the risk of not having examined\u201d them, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 5. Furthermore, plaintiff admits that he signed the agreement without reviewing the proprietary lease or the co-op offering plan, which the sellers made available to him, and which fully disclosed the very facts he claims were misrepresented to him. The district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs pleadings and admissions revealed that \u201che had the means to learn about the Property\u2019s commercial use restrictions before he signed the contract ... but he failed to take advantage of those means. After expressly assuming the risk of any consequences that flow from not having read those documents, he cannot now claim that he is a victim of fraud.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>2009 WL 612336, at *6 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Plaintiffs negligent-misrepresentation claim against Malley fails for the same reason. Plaintiff alleged that Malley misrepresented to plaintiff that plaintiff would be able to lease the unit to a commercial tenant, and that Malley could find a commercial tenant for plaintiff after the purchase. But plaintiff cannot show that he reasonably relied on Malley\u2019s alleged misrepresentations, as the restrictions on the property were clearly described in the contractual documents that plaintiff received but did not read. Furthermore, the district court correctly concluded that Malley\u2019s alleged assurance that he could secure a commercial tenant for plaintiff is not actionable under New York law. An alleged misrepresentation cannot be \u201cpromissory or relating to future events that might never come to fruition.\u201d <em>Hydro Investors, Inc. v. Trafalgar Power, Inc., </em>227 F.3d 8, 20-21 (2d Cir.2000). Nor can it be \u201cconelusory [or] constitute mere puffery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, quoting <em>Sheth v. N.Y. Life </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>273 A.D.2d 72, 709 N.Y.S.2d 74, 75 (1st Dep\u2019t 2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Plaintiffs breach-of-contract claim against the Luskers is equally merit-less. Their retention of the $250,000 deposit after plaintiff failed to close on the property was expressly permitted by the contract. Nor did they breach any duty they owed to plaintiff, under the contract itself or the duty of fair dealing, by failing to try to persuade the board to reject plaintiffs application. As the district court noted, by signing the contract, plaintiff \u201ccommitted himself to buying the Property, and assumed the risk that the Co-Op would approve him.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>2009 WL 612336, at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">As to plaintiffs appellate speculation that the Luskers may have bribed members of the co-op board, we need not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Bogle-Assegai v. Connecticut, </em>470 F.3d 498, 504 (2d Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any case, even if we give this waived argument consideration, plaintiff has failed to assert \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Plaintiffs speculation about bribes cannot \u201cnudge[] [his] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, \u201cthe well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged \u2014 but it has not \u2018show[n]\u2019 \u2014 \u2018that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Plaintiffs unjust-enrichment claim against the Luskers also fails, because the liquidated damages clause of the contract, which plaintiff admits he did not read, specifically provided that the Luskers could retain the deposit in the event plaintiff defaulted, which he admits he did. <em>Stokes, </em>2009 WL 612336, at *8-9. Finally, as to plaintiffs civil conspiracy claim, the district court correctly concluded that because New York state law does not recognize an independent tort of conspiracy, and because no underlying primary tort supports plaintiffs claim, the claim fails. <em>Id. </em>at *6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">We have considered plaintiffs other arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-9\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Sylvia Shapiro, <em>The New York Coop Bible </em>105 (2d ed.2005) (citing examples of prominent individuals rejected by co-op boards).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-14\">. The district court permitted plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim against Ebert to go forward. <em>Stokes, </em>2009 WL 612336, at *9-11. Ebert subsequently settled with plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\">. The complaint does not allege that Malley violated any fiduciary duty to plaintiff. Thus, we do not address whether Malley owed plaintiff any such duty, or whether, if such a duty was owed, plaintiff would be required to show reasonable reliance on Malley\u2019s alleged misrepresentations in order to state a claim for breach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\">. In his complaint, plaintiff did allege that the co-op board \"approved the plaintiff to purchase the unit despite the fact that it knew [he] could not financially undertake the transaction. It did this in connection with [the Luskers] to allow the Sellers to fraudulently and unjustly retain plaintiff\u2019s deposit of $250,000.00.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 23. Plaintiff further alleged in the complaint that the co-op \"either negligently approved the purchase or upon information and belief did so in conspiracy with [the Luskers].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 28. However, nowhere in the complaint did plaintiff claim that the Luskers bribed the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
