We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-19\">On September 10, 2003, McCreary pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to Count 1 of the superseding indictment, which specified that the government was charging McCreary with a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. McCreary agreed that, if he went to trial, the government would be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, inter alia, McCreary \u201cintended to participate in the unlawful agreement that at least 5 kilograms of a mixture or substance containing cocaine was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant as being within the scope of the conspiracy.\u201d The parties agreed that the basis for the entry of the guilty plea included a conspiracy to distribute both cocaine and cocaine base and that at least 50 but not more than 150 kilograms of cocaine was the amount involved in defendant\u2019s relevant conduct encompassed in Count 1 of the superceding indictment. They also agreed that McCreary would be sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3) and 2Dl.l(c)(2), the latter of which provides a base offense level of 36 for relevant conduct involving at least 50 but less than 150 kilograms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>cocaine. McCreary agreed to entry of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On appeal, McCreary contends that the district court erred in rejecting his request for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on the retroactive application of Crack Cocaine Guideline Amendment 706. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, Supplement to Appendix C, 253 (Amendment 713) (2007). McCreary argues that his sentence was based on amounts of both cocaine base (also known as \u201ccrack\u201d) and powder cocaine (also known as \u201ccocaine\u201d) and that he is therefore potentially eligible for a reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. Given that McCreary only pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2), and not crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not apply to his sentence, and a reduction under Section 3582(c) is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Where a defendant is eligible for a sentencing reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review a district court\u2019s ruling under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Borden, </em>564 F.3d 100, 104 (2d Cir.2009). However, the threshold question of whether the original sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d we review de novo, \u201cbecause this determination is a matter of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Main, </em>579 F.3d 200, 202-03 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">A court is generally prohibited from modifying a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). However, \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o),\u201d then a court, \u201cupon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion ... may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The determination of whether a defendant is eligible for a reduction pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) hinges on whether the term of imprisonment was \u201cbased on\u201d a Guidelines range that has subsequently been lowered. <em>See, e.g., Main, </em>579 F.3d at 203 (reasoning that where a defendant\u2019s \u201csentence was \u2018based on\u2019 his Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement with the government, and not a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered,\u201d then \u201cthe district court was without authority to reduce the sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d). Accordingly, where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d a reduction is not warranted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>accord United States v. Martinez, </em>572 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2009) (holding that a defendant convicted of crack cocaine offenses, but sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, is not eligible for resentencing under the amendments to the crack cocaine Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">McCreary\u2019s offense conduct included both trafficking in powder cocaine and crack cocaine. However, McCreary only pleaded guilty to relevant conduct involving between 50 and 150 kilograms of <em>cocaine. </em>Indeed, the plea agreement only mentioned cocaine in describing the elements of the crime that the government would be required to prove at trial. Based on the amount of cocaine, not crack, attributed to McCreary, McCreary was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2), for offenses involving \u201c[a]t least 50 KG but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>less than 150 KG of Cocaine.\u201d Amendment 706 reduces by two the offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See Martinez, </em>572 F.3d at 84. The offenses under Section 2D1.1 that pertain to cocaine offenses are, by their terms, unaffected by the crack cocaine amendments. McCreary ultimately pleaded guilty to a cocaine offense and was sentenced pursuant to Section 2D1.1 accordingly. McCreary\u2019s sentence was thus based only on the amount of cocaine attributable to him. <em>See id. </em>at 84 n. 3 (\u201c[T]o determine which Guideline a defendant\u2019s sentence is \u2018based on\u2019 we look only to the end result of the overall calculus ... and not the \u2018interim\u2019 steps taken by the District Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Given that McCreary agreed to a sentencing range that was based on relevant conduct expressed in terms of cocaine, and not cocaine base, McCreary\u2019s sentence was not technically \u201cbased on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>551 F.3d 182, 185 (2d Cir.2009). The district court was correct in determining that McCreary was ineligible for a reduction in sentence under the crack cocaine amendments, pursuant to Section 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
