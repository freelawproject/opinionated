He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He points out that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and, therefore, there is no reasoned basis for the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal record in establishing his Guidelines range. Romero asserts that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to a sentence calculated under this Guideline. He further urges that the Guidelines failed to account for his family history, including that Romero lived in the United States since he was five-years-old and has several children who are U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">Because Romero did not object to the reasonableness of the sentence at the sentencing hearing, review is for plain error only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">This court has previously rejected Romero\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry Guideline is not empirically based and results in the double counting of his criminal history.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Romero\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because his reentry offense was a mere trespass offense has also been rejected by this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, the court has determined that a sentence calculated under \u00a7 2L1.2 is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>unreasonable simply because the alien entered the country to find work, lived in the United States for most of his life, or reentered to be with his family.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court gives \u201cgreat deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the district court considered Romero\u2019s arguments and rejected them, noting that Romero had an extensive criminal history and that his conduct warranted a Guideline sentence to deter his criminal behavior and to protect the public from his drug-trafficking activities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Romero has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-Guidelines sentence and has not shown reversible plain error on the part of the district court in imposing sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
