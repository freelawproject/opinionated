To the extent that Valencia challenges the underlying BIA removal order, this court lacks jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5), (b)(1), (b)(6); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(6) (1988 Supp. V) (recodified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6))). To the extent that Valencia seeks an order from this court to reopen his proceedings based on <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), this court lacks jurisdiction over that claim as well as Valencia did not fairly present such a claim to the BIA, raising it for the first time in his brief before this court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 317-19 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">Valencia\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion to reopen is unavailing. He argues that he had presented a \u201cnew argument\u201d on an issue that the immigration judge (IJ) had pretermitted, Valencia\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal or ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>justment of status. <em>See </em>Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) \u00a7 245, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255; INA \u00a7 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). However, he relies on <em>Padilla, </em>- U.S. -, 180 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284, in support of his argument. <em>Padilla </em>was issued after Valencia filed his motion to reopen with the BIA and thus could not have formed the basis for the motion. Moreover, to the extent that he is asserting that the IJ and BIA should have considered, in spite of Valencia\u2019s inadmissibility, the availability of cancellation of removal, he presents no new facts establishing prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status or cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c); <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104,108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Valencia has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Altami-rano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
