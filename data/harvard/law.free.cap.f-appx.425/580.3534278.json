Stat. ch. 212. <em>See New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001). RHC\u2019s failure to pay the final PRC judgment was \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with RHC\u2019s stipulation to the California court that it would \u201cabide by any final judgment rendered in the civil action commenced in China.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808. Moreover, accepting RHC\u2019s argument that the PRC judgment is no longer enforceable would create the perception that the California court was \u201cmisled\u201d in granting RHC\u2019s forum non conve-niens motion and would \u201cimpose an unfair detriment\u201d on Hubei. <em>See id. </em>at 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (quoting <em>Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>690 F.2d 595, 599 (6th Cir. 1982)). The balance of equities in this case tips in favor of Hubei. <em>Id. </em>at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808. Therefore, in the interest of \u201cprotecting] the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d we decline to consider RHC\u2019s argument regarding the PRC\u2019s domestic statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (quoting <em>Edwards, </em>690 F.2d at 598).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">RHC\u2019s stipulation to the California court that it would \u201csubmit to [the] jurisdiction of the appropriate civil court in China\u201d bars it from arguing for nonrecognition of the PRC judgment on the basis of the PRC court\u2019s alleged lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proe.Code \u00a7 1713.5(a)(3) (2006). The district court\u2019s factual finding that Robinson received sufficient actual notice of the PRC action was not clearly erroneous, <em>see United States v. Bell, </em>602 F.3d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir.2010), and therefore Robinson\u2019s argument for non-recognition of the PRC judgment on the basis of a lack of adequate notice, <em>see </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1713.4(b)(1) (2006), also fails. Finally, because RHC has not shown that California courts may refuse to recognize foreign money judgments on grounds other than those listed in the UF-MJRA, any technical non-compliance with the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, Nov. 15, 1965, 20 U.S.T. 361, T.I.A.S. No. 6638, cannot serve as an independent basis for non-recognition of the PRC judgment. <em>Cf. </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1713.3 (2006); <em>Manco Contracting Co. (W.W.L.) v. Bezdikian, </em>45 Cal.4th 192, 85 Cal.Rptr.3d 233, 195 P.3d 604, 610 (Cal.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
