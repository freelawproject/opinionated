Eguez-Avila argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Specifically, he argues that the court committed clear error by finding his status as a courier dispositive and failing to properly weigh the applicable factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-23\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1320 (11th Cir.2010). This review is highly deferential, which reflects the \u201cconsiderable discretion [of the district court] in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-24\">The proponent of the reduction has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his role in the offense was minor. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>(en banc). \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 -not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. The court may also examine the defendant\u2019s role in relation to other discernible participants, to the extent they are involved in the relevant conduct itself. <em>Id. </em>at 944-45. \u201c[W]hen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to her own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942^43.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">After thorough review, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Eguez-Avila\u2019s request for a minor role reduction. To the contrary, the district court made two factual findings that render the sentence permissible. First, the court concluded that, based on Eguez-Avila\u2019s statements, he was equally culpable to others involved in the conduct for which he was being held accountable. Second, it also concluded that Eguez-Avila was an \u201cintegral\u201d part of the smuggling operation. This is consistent with the analysis we set forth in <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944-45, and more importantly is the same rationale upon which we affirmed a district court\u2019s identical denial of a minor-role reduction in <em>Boyd, </em>291 F.3d at 1278. Thus, as we did in <em>Boyd, </em>we hold that the district court did not clearly err in denying Eguez-Avila\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">As a result, we affirm Eguez-Avila\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
