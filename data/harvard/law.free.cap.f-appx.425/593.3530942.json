We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribar-ria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir. 2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-22\">The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying You\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where he filed the motion more than four years after his deportation order was entered, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(l) (motion to reopen must be filed within 180 days of deportation order entered in absentia), and You failed to show that he acted with the due diligence required to warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline. <em>Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (a petitioner may obtain equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel as long as he \u201cact[ed] with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
