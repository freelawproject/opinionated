R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendants was entered on the docket on July 14, 2010. However, Valderrama\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, which we treat as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> stayed the appeal the period. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). The district court denied the Rule 59(e) motion by order entered on September 15, 2010. Valderrama had thirty days, or until October 15, 2010, to file her notice of appeal. The notice of appeal was not filed until January 7, 2011. Because Valderrama failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal of these orders for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Valderrama also appeals the district court\u2019s order granting in part Defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions and denying Valderrama\u2019s motion to renew. On appeal, we confine our review to issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Valderrama\u2019s informal appellate brief alleges no relevant claim of error by the district court. We conclude that Valderrama has forfeited appellate review of this order, <em>see Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>562 F.3d 599, 607 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1140, 175 L.Ed.2d 991 (2010), and therefore affirm it. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AUy\"> Valderrama\u2019s motion for relief from judgment sought reconsideration of the district court's July 14 order granting summary judgment to Defendants and was filed on July 21, 2010, within the twenty-eight-day time limit for filing Rule 59(e) motions. Accordingly, we treat the motion as a Rule 59(e) motion. <em>Dove v. CODESCO, </em>569 F.2d 807, 809 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
