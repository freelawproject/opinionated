We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">Bowens raises four claims of error on appeal: (1) his conviction was based on insufficient evidence; (2) the district court impermissibly limited the scope of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>cross-examination of a government witness; (3) the court erred in overruling his challenge to a sentence enhancement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; and (4) the district court miscalculated the amount of drugs accountable to him. For the reasons that follow, we reject each claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Bowens does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence forming the basis of his convictions for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base. Rather, he argues that the Government did not meet its burden to show that he was engaged in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Foster, </em>507 F.3d 233, 245 (4th Cir.2007). We review a sufficiency of the evidence challenge by determining whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005). We review both direct and circumstantial evidence, and accord the government all reasonable inferences from the facts shown to those sought to be established. <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 333 (4th Cir.2008). In reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of the witnesses, and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>510 F.3d 433, 440 (4th Cir.2007). We will uphold the jury\u2019s verdict if substantial evidence supports it, and will reverse only in those rare cases of clear failure by the prosecution. <em>Foster, </em>507 F.3d at 244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Because this case involved a conspiracy charge under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the Government was required to prove (1) an agreement between Bowens and another person to engage in conduct that violated a federal drug law; (2) Bowens\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy; and (3) Bowens\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 384-85 (4th Cir.2001). Since a conspiracy is by its nature clandestine and covert, it is generally proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 857 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). Evidence tending to prove a conspiracy may include a defendant\u2019s relationship with other members of the conspiracy, and the existence of a conspiracy may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 858. \u201cCircumstantial evidence sufficient to support a conspiracy conviction need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the summation of the evidence permits a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">It is unnecessary that the conspiracy have a \u201cdiscrete, identifiable organizational structure.\u201d <em>United States v. Banks, </em>10 F.3d 1044, 1054 (4th Cir.1993). An important consideration is \u201cwhether the actor demonstrated a substantial level of commitment to the conspiracy, for example by engaging in a consistent series of smaller transactions that furthered its ultimate object of supplying the consumer demand of the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">We have reviewed the record, and conclude that sufficient evidence supports Bowens\u2019s conspiracy conviction. While Bowens is correct that there was no direct evidence of a formal, structured drug enterprise, numerous -witnesses testified that they purchased large quantities of cocaine base from Bowens, while others testified to selling large quantities of powder cocaine and cocaine base to Bowens. The volume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of narcotics Bowens transacted clearly implies an effort to \u201cfurther [his] object of supplying the consumer demand of the market\u201d thereby satisfying the elements of a conspiracy charge. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Bowens devotes much of his brief to attacking the credibility of the witnesses against him, as many were indicted as co-conspirators. It is axiomatic, of course, that we do not review the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Kelly, </em>510 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II. Scope of Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Bowens next argues that the district court improperly limited the scope of his cross-examination of Dr. Hacene Boudries, an expert witness for the Government. Boudries, an analytic chemist, testified about the functionality of the GE Itemiser 3, a device that, in this case, identified traces of cocaine on currency that was taken from Bowens\u2019s person at the time of his arrest. Boudries testified that if used properly, the Itemiser 3 would only produce a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d in two percent of cases or less. During cross-examination, Bowens sought to have Boudries characterize the machine\u2019s results as \u201copinions\u201d or \u201cfact.\u201d The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">Q. ... Let me ask you, any of these test or results performed by the itemiser 3, are they fact? The conclusion, is that a fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">A. [Y]eah, the results are \u2014 it\u2019s telling you with a high level of confidence that something \u2014 a drug has been detected ... You can look at the level or the intensity of the peak. That\u2019s what it is. I mean, it\u2019s an analytical tool that results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">Q. But that\u2019s a high level opinion, isn\u2019t\u2019 it, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">A. Sorry? Can you repeat your question, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">Q. Your answer was the test results are considered fact, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">THE COURT: That\u2019s argumentative, counselor. You may move on to something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">Q. Does a fact ever have less than a two percent failure rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">THE COURT: Same ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">Q. Is it a fact that Charles deGualle [sic] is dead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">THE COURT: Same ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-17\">MR. FORRESTER [defense counsel]: No further questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-18\">Bowens challenges the court\u2019s actions on appeal. Because he did not object to, or otherwise challenge the court\u2019s decision in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cTo establish plain error, [Bowens] must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>478 F.3d 247, 249 (4th Cir.2007). Even if Bowens satisfies these requirements, \u201ccorrection of the error remains within [the Court\u2019s] discretion, which [the Court] should not exercise ... unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-19\">A defendant has the right to have a \u201c \u2018meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d, 209, 221 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 329, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998)). Accordingly, \u201cthe right of cross examination is a precious one, essential to a fair trial,\u201d and the defendant should be given \u201ca reasonable opportunity to conduct cross-examination that might undermine a witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>er, the district court may \u201cimpose reasonable limits on cross-examination, [based] on such concerns as prejudice, confusion, repetition, and relevance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Based on our review of the record, we do not conclude that the district court plainly erred. Bowens\u2019s line of cross-examination had been explored thoroughly. Boudries acknowledged an error rate of two percent even in a properly administered test; Bowens effort to have Boudries characterize this outcome was argumentative at best and invaded the province of the jury at worst. Moreover, Bowens could have changed his line of questioning to emphasize the incidence of false positive outcomes, but chose instead to end his examination. We cannot conclude, on these facts, that the district court erred, much less plainly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">III. Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Bowens next claims that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the \u00a7 841 enhancement because the underlying state felony conviction was not a proper predicate for the purposes of \u00a7 841. He was convicted in 2003 in North Carolina court of felony possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) imposes a ten year mandatory minimum sentence for violations of \u00a7 841(a) if the defendant violates \u00a7 841(a) \u201cafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Whether a district court properly interpreted the term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) \u201cinvolves a pure question of law,\u201d which we review de novo. <em>United States v. Burgess, </em>478 F.3d 658, 661 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Section 841 does not define the term \u201cfelony drug offense,\u201d but 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (2006) does, \u201cin plain and unambiguous terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. Section 802(44) defines felony drug offense as \u201can offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44). This court has held that \u201cbecause the term \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 is specifically defined in \u00a7 802(44), and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) makes use of that precise term, the logical, commonsense way to interpret \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) is by reference to the definition in \u00a7 802(44).\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>478 F.3d at 662 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Bowens does not argue that his 2003 North Carolina conviction for felony possession of cocaine was not punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment or that it was unrelated to narcotics. Rather, he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006) implicitly abrogated \u00a7 802(44). In <em>Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court held that conduct that is a felony under state law but a misdemeanor under the Controlled Substances Act does not qualify as a \u201cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d sufficient to be considered an aggravated felony for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>Lopez, </em>549 U.S. at 50, 127 S.Ct. 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">We conclude that Bowens\u2019s reliance on <em>Lopez </em>is misplaced. <em>Lopez </em>involved a matter of statutory interpretation where Congress was silent, i.e., the issue of whether certain state felonies are also aggravated felonies under the Controlled Substance Act. <em>See Lopez, </em>549 U.S. at 54, 127 S.Ct. 625 (\u201cCongress can define an aggravated felony ... in an unexpected way. But Congress would need to tell us so[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Here, Congress has clearly willed that a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d is one that is \u201cpun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States <em>or of a State </em>[.]\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (emphasis added). Because Bowens\u2019s 2003 conviction was for a felony drug offense, the district court did not err in overruling Bowens\u2019s objection to the \u00a7 841 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">IV. Drug Amount Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Finally, Bowens argues that the district court erred in finding that he was responsible for over 3.5 kilograms of powder cocaine and over three kilograms of cocaine base. This court reviews a drug quantity finding for clear error. <em>United States v. Kellam, </em>568 F.3d 125, 147 (4th Cir.2009). Under the clear error standard of review, we will reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Jeffers, </em>570 F.3d 557, 570 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). At sentencing, the government need only establish the amount of drugs involved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>524 F.3d 549, 561-62 (4th Cir.2008). \u201cWhere there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.12) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We conclude the district court did not err. While Bowens contests the veracity of witness testimony against him, that testimony is sufficient to form the basis for the drug amount attributed to Bowens. Again, this court will not revisit questions of witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
