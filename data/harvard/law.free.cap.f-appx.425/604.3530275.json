We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny Vera\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-21\">Substantial evidence supports that Board\u2019s conclusion that Vera was not targeted on account of a protected ground. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that the Board\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless \u201cthe applicant shows that the evidence <em>compels </em>the conclusion that the asylum decision was incorrect\u201d). Here, the record indicates that Vera \u201cwas threatened by police in Argentina for seeking redress for an attack (rape) upon\u201d his brother. Thus, Vera \u201cfears harm because of a personal matter between him\u201d and a few rogue police officers \u2014 not based on a protected ground. <em>See Molino-Morales v. I.N.S., </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir.2001). Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tionally, the severity of harm that Vera experienced in Argentina \u2014 including his brief detention, an isolated threat from police, and a single incident of physical mistreatment \u2014 does not compel the conclusion that Vera was subjected to past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. I.N.S., </em>47 F.3d 336, 339 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that an applicant who was \u201chit and kicked while being briefly detained\u201d did not compel a finding of persecution). Only in \u201cextreme cases\u201d involving \u201crepeated and especially menacing death threats\u201d have we held such threats to establish past persecution. <em>See Lim v. I.N.S., </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We also conclude that Vera\u2019s due process claim lacks merit. There is no evidence suggesting that the immigration judge abandoned her role as a neutral adjudicator. <em>See Reyes-Melendez v. I.N.S., </em>342 F.3d 1001, 1007 (9th Cir.2003). Instead, the record indicates that Vera had a \u201creasonable opportunity to present\u201d his case and that he received the \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d to which he was entitled. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. I.N.S., </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). To the extent that Vera seeks due process relief on the basis that his brother was granted asylum, it is clear that his brother\u2019s case involves circumstances materially different from those at issue here. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1019 n. 2 (9th Cir.2003) (indicating that our immigration system should not permit \u201cinconsistent treatment\u201d of family members that assert claims based on identical facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
