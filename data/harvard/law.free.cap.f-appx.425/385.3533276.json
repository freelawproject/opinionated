In that regard, Rojas does not contest the BIA\u2019s holding that his motion is untimely to the extent it seeks reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal; therefore, that issue is abandoned. <em>E.g., Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Our court lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erred by denying Rojas\u2019 motion to reopen his claim that he was entitled to cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>see also Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004). Under section 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), no court has jurisdiction to review a judgment involving the exercise of discretion, including judgments regarding relief under \u00a7 1229b. <em>E.g., Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). We likewise lack jurisdiction to consider Rojas\u2019 Convention Against Torture claim because he failed to exhaust it by fairly presenting it before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>e.g., Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The BIA\u2019s denial of Rojas\u2019 motion to reopen so that he could pursue his asylum and withholding-of-removal claims is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). Contrary to his contentions, the BIA held correctly that he was required, in his motion to reopen, to establish a prima facie case for each claim. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Rojas was required to show that he had a well-founded fear of persecution based upon a protected ground to establish a prima facie case for his asylum claim; to establish a prima facie case for withholding of removal, he was required to satisfy an even higher standard. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1135-38 (5th Cir.2006). By fading to challenge the BIA\u2019s ruling that he identified no protected ground that would serve as a viable basis for either claim, Rojas has abandoned such an assertion. <em>Calderon-Ontiveros, </em>809 F.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
