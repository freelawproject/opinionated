We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, \u201cassuming all well-pleaded, non-conclusory factual allegations in the complaint to be true.\u201d <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>621 F.3d 111, 124 (2d Cir. 2010). To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). A \u201cdocument filed <em>pro se </em>is to be liberally construed and a <em>pro se </em>complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Boykin v. KeyCorp, </em>521 F.3d 202, 214 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such liberal construction is especially appropriate where, as here, the plaintiff is an inmate using a boilerplate \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d complaint provided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">To state a viable claim against an individual under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant, while acting under the color of law, \u201cdeprived the plaintiff of a right guaranteed by the constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Maffucci, </em>923 F.2d 979, 982 (2d Cir.1991). It is uncontested that the prison guard, John Doe # 1, was acting under the color of law when he strip searched Bennett. The district court concluded that Bennett\u2019s complaint failed to raise a reasonable inference that John Doe # 1 violated Bennett\u2019s constitutional rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">The district court concluded that Bennett\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim against John Doe # 1 for three reasons: (1) It did not specify which of Bennett\u2019s constitutional rights were violated; (2) It did not allege that John Doe # 1 lacked reasonable suspicion to strip search Bennett; and (3) It did not allege that John Doe # 1 intentionally violated the Fourth Amendment. None of these reasons is persuasive. The complaint\u2019s allegation that Doe Guard # 1 violated the McBean Settlement \u2014 the result of litigation over New York City\u2019s unconstitutional policy of strip searching misdemeanants without reasonable suspicion \u2014 creates the reasonable inference that Bennett is claiming a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and that he is alleging the search lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>reasonable suspicion. <em>Shain v. Ellison, </em>273 F.3d 56, 63 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that strip search of misdemeanants upon intake to correctional facilities without reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment). Similarly, while Bennett does not specifically allege that John Doe # 1 acted intentionally, such allegation is reasonably implied by the complaint\u2019s other allegations; Bennett\u2019s failure to specifically allege John Doe # l\u2019s mental state is insufficient to render deficient a <em>pro se </em>complaint set-out on a government-furnished form that does not ask about mental state. We therefore conclude that Bennett\u2019s complaint states a viable \u00a7 1983 claim against John Doe # 1, and we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bennett\u2019s complaint as to John Doe #1.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">To state a viable claim of municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the violation of his constitutional rights was caused by an official policy or custom of the municipality. <em>Zahra v. Town of Southold, </em>48 F.3d 674, 685 (2d Cir.1995). An official policy may be a formal written policy or \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d in the face of \u201ca pattern of misconduct.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Giuliani, </em>506 F.3d 183, 192 (2d Cir.2007). The district court concluded that Bennett\u2019s complaint failed to plausibly allege any such policy, custom, or deliberate indifference. We agree. Bennett\u2019s complaint, even construed liberally, never alleges any facts from which a court could reasonably infer that New York City had any pattern, policy, or custom of violating misdemeanants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights. Nor does the complaint contain facts from which a court could reasonably infer deliberate indifference by New York City: Other than the inclusion of \u201cNew York City\u201d in the caption, Bennett\u2019s complaint does not mention New York at all. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bennett\u2019s complaint as to New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">On appeal, Bennett concedes that the district court correctly dismissed his complaint as to the New York City Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d). We therefore affirm this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The district court dismissed Bennett\u2019s claims against all the defendants on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds, without considering the impact, if any, of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Because the district court did not reach the PLRA issue, we likewise decline to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Finally, we review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to grant leave to amend a deficient complaint, and it is within a district court\u2019s discretion to deny leave to amend implicitly by not addressing the issue and simply dismissing the complaint with prejudice. <em>In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., </em>466 F.3d 187, 220 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c[W]here amendment would be futile, denial of leave to amend is proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that Bennett already received one opportunity to amend his complaint, that he concedes he cannot sue the DOC, that he already states a valid \u00a7 1983 claim against John Doe # 1, and that nothing in his complaint suggests he could show the type of policy or deliberate indifference necessary to state a valid claim against New York City, it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that a second leave to amend would be futile. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s implicit denial of leave to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We hereby VACATE in part the judgment of the district court, REVERSE the dismissal of the complaint as to John Doe # 1, AFFIRM the dismissal of the complaint as to the City of New York and the New York City Department of Corrections, AFFIRM the denial of leave to amend the complaint, and REMAND the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
