The district court calculated Batts\u2019 Guidelines sentence on the firearm count at eighty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) (2007). At sentencing, the Government moved for an upward departure under USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s., and 5K2.9, p.s. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion, imposed an upward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K2.9, p.s., and sentenced Batts to 142 months\u2019 imprisonment on the firearm count, to be served consecutively to a fifty-seven month prison sentence on the drug conspiracy count, for a total imprisonment term of 199 months.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> On appeal, Batts challenges his sentence on the firearm count, arguing that the district court erred in imposing the upward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.9, p.s. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This abuse-of-discretion standard of review involves two steps; under the first, we examine the sentence for significant procedural errors, and under the second, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>review the substance of the sentence. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (examining <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Significant procedural errors include \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2006) ] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If there are no significant procedural errors, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctakfing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">When the district court imposes a departure sentence, we consider \u201cwhether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir. 2007). This court has recognized, however, that a district court\u2019s error in applying a departure sentence is harmless if the sentence is ultimately justified by the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 165 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201c[Ejven assuming the district court erred in applying the Guideline departure provisions, [the defendant\u2019s] sentence, which is well-justified by [the] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, is reasonable.\u201d); <em>see Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1432, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (stating that \u201cprocedural errors at sentencing ... are routinely subject to harmlessness review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Citing <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754 (4th Cir.1996), Batts argues that the district court erred in imposing an upward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K2.9, p.s. However, even assuming the district court erred in upwardly departing under USSG \u00a7 5K2.9, p.s., in view of the court\u2019s thorough and meaningful articulation of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors that also justified the imposition of the 142-month sentence, we conclude that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We therefore affirm the amended judgment of conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-13\"><em> </em>We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s imposition of the fifty-seven month prison sentence on the drug conspiracy count but vacated the sentence on the firearm count and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Batts, </em>317 Fed.Appx. 329, 332-33 (4th Cir. 2009). At resentencing, the Government moved for an upward departure, but the district court refused to allow the motion, reasoning that our opinion precluded the granting of an upward departure on remand. The Government appealed, and we again vacated the sentence on the firearm count and remanded for resentencing, concluding that the district court misunderstood the scope of our mandate. <em>United States v. Batts, </em>363 Fed. Appx. 230, 232 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
