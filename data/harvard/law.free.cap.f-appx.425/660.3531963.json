Alliance of Child and Family Services v. Allenby, </em>589 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir.2009) <em>(Allenby).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">In Appeal No. 09-17649, the State appeals the scope of the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction order in favor of Alliance that enjoins the implementation of a ten percent reduction in foster care maintenance payment rates mandated by recently-enacted state legislation. <em>See </em>Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.Code \u00a7 11462(g)(5), (f)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">We review the scope of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion. <em>See Internet Specialties West, Inc. v. Milon-DiGiorgio Enterprises, Inc., </em>559 F.3d 985, 993 (9th Cir.2009). In both appeals, the State contends that the district court abused its discretion by granting injunctive relief that requires California to increase funding for the approximately forty-one percent of resident foster children who do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Child Welfare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 670 <em>et seq. See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 672(a)(l)-(3) (defining eligibility criteria). This argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The State did not waive its objection to the district court\u2019s inclusion of non-federally eligible children within the terms of the injunction. The State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment challenge may be raised at any time. <em>See Oregon v. Legal Services Corp., </em>552 F.3d 965, 969 (9th Cir.2009); <em>see also Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 678, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974) (\u201c[T]he Eleventh Amendment defense sufficiently partakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar so that it need not be raised in the trial court[.]\u201d). \u201cWe review de novo whether Eleventh Amendment immunity applies.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Audubon Soc\u2019y Inc. v. Davis, </em>307 F.3d 835, 846 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment and preliminary injunction order did not exceed its jurisdiction, the scope of the pleadings, or our remand in <em>Allenby, </em>589 F.3d at 1023. \u201cIn determining the scope of an injunction, a district court has broad latitude, and it must balance the equities between the parties and give due regard to the public interest.\u201d <em>California ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>575 F.3d 999, 1020 (9th Cir.2009), <em>as amended </em>(citation omitted). The district court extended injunctive relief to all California foster children based on our interpretation of the Child Welfare Act in <em>Allenby, </em>589 F.3d at 1023. The district court\u2019s undisputed finding was that because the State does not distinguish between federally-eligible and non-federally eligible children when making group home program placements or setting payment rate levels, reimbursing foster care providers at lower rates for non-federally eligible children inevitably dilutes funds for federally-eligible children.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">There was no violation of the Eleventh Amendment because the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction order and judgment fall squarely within the doctrinal exception of <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 159-60, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). <em>See, e.g., Cardenas v. Anzai, </em>311 F.3d 929, 934-35 (9th Cir.2002). A district court may enjoin state officials from future violations of a federal statute, \u201ceven if it might require substantial outlay of funds from the state treasury, provided that it does not award retroactive relief for past conduct.\u201d <em>Natural Resources Def. Council v. Cal. Dept. of Transp., </em>96 F.3d 420, 422 (9th Cir.1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The district court\u2019s permanent injunction in Appeal No. 10-15593 is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s preliminary injunction order in Appeal No. 09-17649 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
