GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">A Wyoming jury convicted Charles Allen Haynes of two counts of sexual assault. Mr. Haynes appealed his conviction but the Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed. He then filed a motion in federal district court, seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court rejected Mr. Haynes\u2019s motion and denied his application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Mr. Haynes now appears before us to renew his request for a COA. We may, of course, grant a COA only if Mr. Haynes makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation omitted). And, where a claim \u201cwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d we may grant habeas relief only if the state court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>There is only one issue Mr. Haynes presented on direct appeal in state court and in his \u00a7 2254 petition to the district court and so preserved for our possible review under these standards. That is the question whether the state trial court should have revisited its earlier decision that Mr. Haynes was competent to stand trial in light of a forensic psychologist\u2019s report prepared later at sentencing. Before the Wyoming Supreme Court, Mr. Haynes explained his argument in these terms: \u201cIt would have been far more reassuring if [the trial court judge] had said that he considered the new evidence in conjunction with the earlier testimony.... [But the trial judge] simply refused to consider mental competence at all [at sentencing], treating it as a closed issue.\u201d App. Br. at 15-16. Mr. Haynes charges that this decision, to treat the issue as settled and closed, ran afoul of constitutional due process doctrine which requires trial courts to assess a defendant\u2019s competence whenever \u201ca reasonable judge should have had a bona fide doubt as to [the defendant\u2019s] competence at the time of trial.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Mullin, </em>302 F.3d 1166, 1178 (10th Cir.2002) (internal quotation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The Wyoming Supreme Court discussed and rejected Mr. Haynes\u2019s argument. It did so by explaining that, in fact, the state trial court <em>had </em>considered the forensic psychologist\u2019s report and its potential impact on the court\u2019s earlier competency decision. Consequently, the Wyoming Supreme Court held, Mr. Haynes was afforded due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">[\u00b6 43] On appeal, Mr. Haynes claims that when evidence was presented at sentencing indicating that he lacked the mental capacity to understand the nature of the sentencing proceedings, the district court was required to address the issue before sentencing him. Mr. Haynes relies on the following excerpt from the hearing, which he incorrectly attributes to the district court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">The risk assessment itself was designed to consider what his chances of reoffending are. Not designed to determine whether or not he was competent to stand trial, not designed to determine whether or not he was responsible for his criminal conduct. In short, that report was directed at an entirely different set of issues, and does not constitute new evidence. <em>The case has been closed as to the issue of competency by the Court\u2019s determination that Mr. Haynes was competent to stand trial as a matter of law. The issue of criminal responsibility has been closed by the jury by their guilty verdicts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">(emphasis added). Citing \u00a7 7-11-303(a), <em>deShazer v. State, </em>2003 WY 98, \u00b6 20, 74 P.3d 1240, 1248 (Wyo.2003), and other authorities, Mr. Haynes asserts this was a \u2018glaring misstatement of the law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it is clear that the district court had a continuing obligation throughout the legal proceeding, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ing sentencing, to raise and consider the issue of his mental competency....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">[\u00b644] Mr. Haynes is correct that the district court had a continuing obligation to address the issue of his mental competency. However, the statement quoted above was not made by the district court; the statement was made by the prosecutor during his argument in opposition to the new trial motion. The record clearly reflects, contrary to Mr. Haynes\u2019 assertion, that the district court compared the statements contained in the risk assessment with the earlier testimony presented on the competency issue and found that no new evidence was presented. Mr. Haynes\u2019 argument that the district court did not fulfill its obligation and ruled the matter of competency \u2018closed\u2019 is not supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>Haynes v. State, </em>186 P.3d 1204, 1214 (Wyo. 2008) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The record reveals no basis on which we might disagree with this analysis, finding unreasonable either the Wyoming Supreme Court\u2019s factual determination that the trial court did consider the psychologist\u2019s report or its application of the law in concluding any due process requirement was satisfied. The request for a COA is therefore denied and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-12\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-5\">. Although Mr. Haynes\u2019s COA application focuses on this issue, along the way it also seeks to raise a number of related but different arguments. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Haynes did not raise these arguments in his direct state court appeal. That procedural default barred him from raising them as grounds for state-court collateral relief. <em>See </em>Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 7-14-101 &amp; 7-14-103(a)(1). And it also precludes us from considering them. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 93, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (holding that \"if the petitioner procedurally defaulted ... claims [for state-court review], the prisoner generally is barred from asserting those claims in a federal habeas proceeding\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
