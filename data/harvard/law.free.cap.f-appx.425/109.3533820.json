We will summarily affirm because we agree that Crosby cannot challenge his solicitation to murder conviction with a \u00a7 2241 petition, and that he instead must do so pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">In August 1996, Crosby was sentenced to 365 months of imprisonment after being convicted on two counts of solicitation to murder a federal probation officer. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed his sentence and conviction, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. In April 2009, Crosby filed what appears to be his fourth collateral attack on his conviction, and his third attempt at proceeding under \u00a7 2241. After concluding that Crosby\u2019s claims did \u201cnot fall within the narrow exception outlined in <em>[In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997) ], in which \u00a7 2241 would be available,\u201d the District Court treated the \u00a7 2241 petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Crosby appealed, and moved to stay the appeal pending his release from administrative segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). A certificate of appeala-bility is not required to appeal from the denial of Crosby\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions, and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002). Summary affir-mance is proper when \u201cit clearly appears that no substantial question is presented or that subsequent precedent or a change in circumstances warrants such action.\u201d Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">The presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence is by motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, unless such a motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Lack of success in a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, without more, does not render \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective; nor do AEDPA\u2019s restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002). We agree with the District Court that Crosby\u2019s case does not fit within the narrow class of circumstances where a \u00a7 2255 motion would in fact be inadequate or ineffective to challenge a conviction, and that its dismissal on jurisdictional grounds was proper. <em>See Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139-40 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Therefore, because no \u201csubstantial question\u201d is presented by this appeal, we will affirm the order of the District Court. For Crosby\u2019s benefit, we note that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>he choose to file a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion, he must obtain authorization to do so in accordance with the procedures outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244 and 2255. Crosby\u2019s motion to stay the appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
