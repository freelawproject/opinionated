Additionally, he asserts that the district court was entitled to sentence Nunez anywhere within the statutory range of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The Government moves for summary af-firmance on the ground that circuit precedent forecloses Nunez\u2019s argument and, alternatively, requests an extension of time to file a responsive brief. Nunez has filed an unopposed motion for leave to file an out-of-time response to the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Nunez has not shown that his sentence did not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represented a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors; his arguments merely reflect his disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the weighing of factors that were properly considered. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). As a result, he has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-the-guidelines sentence on appellate review. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Nunez has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a substantively unreasonable within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE AND FOR LEAVE TO FILE OUT-OF-TIME RESPONSE GRANTED; MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
