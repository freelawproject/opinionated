Kirksey argues that the district court violated <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1102 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136, 1137-38 (11th Cir.1993), in failing to elicit objections from him after the imposition of his sentence. Kirksey also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-20\">We first consider Kirksey\u2019s argument that the district court erred by failing to elicit objections after the imposition of his sentence. In <em>Jones, </em>we established a rule requiring district courts to \u201celicit fully articulated objections, following imposition of sentence, to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d as well as to \u201cthe manner in which the sentence is pronounced.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1102. We later extended the objection-elicitation requirement of <em>Jones </em>to revocation of supervised release proceedings. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-21\">In this case, the district court did not expressly elicit objections after imposing Kirksey\u2019s sentence. Instead, the district court merely asked Kirksey: \u201cAnything else? Any other question?\u201d Kirksey answered: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIn applying the <em>Jones </em>rule, this court has held that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>the district court merely asks if there is \u2018anything further?\u2019 or \u2018anything else?\u2019 and neither party responds with objections, then the court has failed to elicit fully articulated objections and has therefore violated <em>Jones.\u201d Id. </em>We therefore conclude that the district court violated <em>Jones. </em>Indeed, the government concedes the <em>Jones </em>violation, but argues that this Court should still affirm Kirksey\u2019s sentence because the record is sufficient for meaningful appellate review of the substantive reasonableness of Kirksey\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1347. Normally, \u201c[wjhere the district court has not elicited fully articulated objections following the imposition of sentence, this court will vacate the sentence and remand for further sentencing in order to give the parties an opportunity to raise and explain their objections.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1103. \u201cA remand is unnecessary, however, when the record on appeal is sufficient to enable review.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1347. We find that the record with respect to this issue would not be further developed in any significant way upon remand. As such, we turn now to the merits of Kirksey\u2019s claim that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Kirksey argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to consider his rehabilitative needs, as well as other forms of punishment such as extending the term of his supervised release or sentencing him to home detention. A sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">When imposing a sentence upon revocation of supervised release, the court must consider the following factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a): (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to afford adequate deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the sentencing guideline range and pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (cross-referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)(D), (a)(4)(7)). We consider the final sentence in its entirety in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006), and are mindful that the district court is \u201cpermitted to attach great weight to one factor over others,\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">In reviewing sentences imposed for a violation of supervised release, we are mindful that the guidelines for such sentences were never considered mandatory. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe have consistently held that the policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding.\u201d). Indeed, the Commentary in Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines recognizes that a district judge may be inclined to consider the sentence she imposed on the original conviction when imposing a sentence for a supervised release violation. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 cmt. n.4 (Nov. 1, 2009) (\u201cWhere the original sentence was the result of a downward departure <em>(e.g., </em>as a reward for substantial assistance), or a charge reduction that resulted in a sentence below the guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>range applicable to the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct, an upward departure [in the sentence for the supervised release violation] may be warranted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Nevertheless, even when punishing a supervised release violation, the district court \u201cmust give \u2018serious consideration\u2019 to the extent of any departure from the guidelines, and must offer \u2018sufficient justifications\u2019 for its conclusion that an unusually harsh or light sentence is appropriate.\u201d <em>United, States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). If the sentence imposed lies outside of the guideline range, the degree of the variance is relevant to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence and, in general, \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. But we \u201cmay not apply a presumption of unreasonableness\u201d to a sentence outside the guideline range, and we must \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We observe that Kirksey\u2019s 24-month sentence is the maximum allowed by statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also represents a significant upward variance from the advisory guideline range of 6 to 12 months imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But we cannot say that this sentence is unreasonable given Kirksey\u2019s extensive criminal record, and his repeated failure to comply with the conditions of his supervised release. In explaining the variance from the guideline range, the district judge told Kirksey: \u201cI just don\u2019t think [the guideline range is] appropriate in your case.\u201d In imposing a 24-month sentence instead, the court noted that Kirksey had a \u201chorrible record,\u201d with a \u201cworld of convictions.\u201d Indeed, Kirksey\u2019s criminal history reveals over twenty adult convictions before his underlying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction in this case, most of which did not result in criminal history points and therefore were not reflected in the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Moreover, we reject Kirksey\u2019s assertion that the sentence failed to account for his rehabilitative needs and the other available forms of punishment. To the contrary, prior to revoking Kirksey\u2019s supervised release, the district court twice elected to continue Kirksey\u2019s revocation hearing for six months following earlier violations of his supervised release, primarily to ensure that Kirksey was attending drug rehabilitation programs and submitting to drug screens. The district court only revoked Kirksey\u2019s supervised release and imposed a maximum term of imprisonment after Kirksey consistently failed to follow the terms of his supervised release and committed multiple additional violations. On these facts, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Kirksey to 24 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">For all of these reasons, we affirm Kirk-sey\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).
