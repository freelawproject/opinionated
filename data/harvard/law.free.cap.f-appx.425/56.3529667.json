Pereyra was convicted after, inter alia, trying to shove a police officer of the United States Park Police, resisting being handcuffed, and grabbing the police officer\u2019s holstered gun, while on a crowded beach. Pereyra principally argues that \u201c[t]he trial court committed clear error in both crediting the contradictory accounts of the two witnesses and in failing to resolve the sharp factual disputes between those witnesses.\u201d Per-eyra also contends that the arresting officer\u2019s testimony about how Pereyra grabbed his gun described a \u201cphysically impossible\u201d maneuver that the court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>not have credited. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u201cWhen reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, \u2018the standard of review is exactly the same regardless whether the verdict was rendered by a jury or by a judge after a bench trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. </em>Pierce, 224 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2000). \u2018We will not disturb [a] conviction if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>631 F.3d 608, 613 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Xiao Qin Zhou, </em>428 F.3d 361, 370 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In light of these principles, we conclude for substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court that the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support Pereyra\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We have considered all of Pereyra\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
