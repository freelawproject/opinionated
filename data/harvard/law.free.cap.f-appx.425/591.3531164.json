We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for an abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-23\">The BIA properly construed Bolvito\u2019s October 10, 2008, filing as a motion to reopen. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir.2005). The agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Bolvito\u2019s third motion to reopen as untimely because he filed the motion more than nine years after his removal order was entered, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (motion to reopen must be filed within 180 days of removal order entered in absentia), and Bolvito failed to show that he acted with the due diligence required to warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline, <em>Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (a petitioner may obtain equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel as long as he \u201cact[ed] with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b615-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
