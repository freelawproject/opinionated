We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-25\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b905-26\">Mr. D\u00e9la Cruz, a citizen of the Philippines, was employed in various positions by the Department of the Navy at the former U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Those positions included Senior Guard (September 1946 to June 1948), Machinist (September 1948 to November 1948), Guard (November 1948 to May 1949), Laborer (June 1965 to September 1965), and Motorboat Captain (December 1965 to April 1981). His separation from the position of Motorboat Captain in 1981 was due to his attainment of the mandatory retirement age. In 1985, Mr. D\u00e9la Cruz sought a CSRS retirement annuity by filing a Standard Form 2801, Application for Immediate Retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>OPM denied Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s request for an annuity after finding that he had never been employed in a position that was subject to the Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In 2008, Mr. Dela Cruz submitted a Standard Form 2803, Application to Make Deposit or Redeposit (Civil Service Retirement System). He sought to make a deposit in order to make up for CSRS deductions that he believed should have been taken from his salary during his employment between 1965 and 1981. OPM denied that request on the ground that Mr. Dela Cruz was not currently employed in a position subject to retirement deductions, nor was he entitled to an annuity. OPM explained that he was not entitled to an annuity because his creditable civilian service was not covered under the CSRS. On appeal to the Board, the administrative judge determined that Mr. Dela Cruz was not eligible to make CSRS deposits because his employment had been temporary or indefinite and that he was therefore not in \u201ccovered service\u201d for purposes of CSRS benefits. The administrative judge noted that the Standard Form 50 (\u201cSF-50\u201d), Notice of Personnel Action, that was issued at the time of Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s retirement indicated that he was covered under a non-CSRS retirement plan. The full Board denied Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s petition for review. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Under circumstances prescribed by statute and regulation, an employee with civilian service for which retirement deductions were not made may make a later deposit of those deductions and thereby obtain credit toward a retirement annuity. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334. The right of deposit is limited to persons designated as \u201cemployees.\u201d That term is defined to mean persons currently employed in CSRS-eligible positions or persons formerly employed in such positions who are eligible for a retirement annuity. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112(a). In order to be eligible for a retirement annuity, an employee must have completed at least five years of \u201ccreditable service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8331(12), 8332, 8333(a). In addition, at least one of the final two years of employment prior to separation must have been \u201ccovered service,\u201d i.e., \u201ccreditable civilian service during which [the employee] is subject to the [CSRA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8333(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Mr. Dela Cruz argues that an employee is eligible for a CSRS retirement annuity merely by virtue of undertaking creditable service during one of the final two years of employment prior to separation. That position has been squarely rejected by this court. <em>Herrera v. United States, </em>849 F.2d 1416, 1417 (Fed.Cir.1988). The \u201cone-out-of-two\u201d requirement refers to \u201ccovered service,\u201d i.e., service that is subject to the Civil Service Retirement Act. <em>Id. </em>The administrative judge found that Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s final two years of service as a Motorboat Captain, while creditable, were not covered under the CSRS.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That finding is clearly supported by the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The administrative judge found that Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s appointment as a Motorboat Captain from 1965 to 1981 was nonper-manent or indefinite. Service under indef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>inite appointments made after 1955 is excluded from CSRS retirement coverage. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(13); <em>Quiocson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>490 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007). Mr. Dela Cruz contends that, as of his reappointment to the position of Laborer in September 1965, he was in a position of covered service under the CSRA. However, the case on which Mr. Dela Cruz relies, <em>Avila v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>79 F.3d 128, 130 (Fed. Cir.1996), clearly states that certain types of employees are excluded from CSRS coverage. As previously mentioned, those exclusions include employees with nonper-manent or indefinite appointments. Mr. Dela Cruz argues that much of his employment with the Navy did not occur under an indefinite appointment because he worked full-time. His full-time status, however, does not make his position subject to the CSRA. If an employee\u2019s position is indefinite, he is not eligible for an annuity under the CSRS, regardless of whether he is employed full-time. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The administrative judge\u2019s decision also finds support in Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s SF-50 form pertaining to his final separation from the Navy. That form indicates that his retirement benefits were not \u201cCS\u201d or \u201cCivil Service Retirement System.\u201d Rather, he received \u201cother\u201d retirement benefits, specified as 18 months of retirement pay corresponding to his creditable service \u201cin accordance with the [Collective Bargaining Agreement] of 11 April 1979.\u201d Receipt of retirement benefits under a non-CSRS plan indicates that the employee\u2019s service was not \u201ccovered service.\u201d <em>Quiocson, </em>490 F.3d at 1360. We have specifically held that a severance package such as the one given to Mr. Dela Cruz constitutes \u201canother retirement system\u201d that precludes eligibility for a retirement annuity under the CSRS. <em>Dela Rosa v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>583 F.3d 762, 765-66 (Fed.Cir.2009); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(1)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Mr. Dela Cruz asserts that the statutory provision allowing employees to make deposits under the CSRS, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(c), does not require that those employees meet the covered service requirement of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333(b). That argument has been considered and rejected by a previous decision of this court. In <em>Dela Rosa v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>583 F.3d at 765, we held that a former employee not covered under the CSRS is not entitled to make a deposit pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(c). We interpreted OPM regulations to restrict deposits to employees that are already eligible for CSRS retirement annuities. <em>Id.-, see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">We have considered Mr. Dela Cruz\u2019s remaining arguments and find them without merit. Accordingly, we uphold the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">No costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. We need not consider Mr. Dela Cruz's employment prior to his appointment to the position of Motorboat Captain because his cumulative service in all other positions did not exceed five years. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333(a). Thus, he cannot be eligible for a CSRS retirement annuity based on any separations from the Navy prior to his mandatory retirement in 1981. <em>See Guevara v. United States, 229 </em>Ct.Cl. 595, 598 (1981) (denying CSRS annuity for initial separation based on failure to meet five-year creditable service requirement and for later separation based on failure to meet \u201cone-out-of-two\u201d requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
