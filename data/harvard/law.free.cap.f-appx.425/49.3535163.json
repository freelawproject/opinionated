Jul. 7, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 741 082 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo, N.Y. June 5, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and offers additional commentary, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Mahmood v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 466, 469 (2d Cir.2009). Although we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary denial of adjustment of status, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006); <em>Ruiz v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 269, 275 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2009), we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2006), including whether an alien is eligible for adjustment of status, <em>see Aslam v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 110, 115 (2d Cir.2008). Because the question of eligibility for adjustment of status is one of law, our standard of review is <em>de novo. See Lecaj v. Holder, </em>616 F.3d 111, 114 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Torres-Castillo contends that his release from Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) custody upon posting a $1,500 bond, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a)(2)(A) (2006), constituted \u201cparole into the United States,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1182(d)(5)(A), such that he is (1) no longer inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), and (2) eligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). In support of this claim, he submits that \u201cthere is only one source of parole authority which is found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5) and that any release of an applicant for admission is a parole pursuant to\u201d that provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19-20. This argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>Cruz-Miguel v. Holder, </em>\u2014 F.3d-, (2d Cir.2011), and the BIA\u2019s precedential opinion in <em>In re Castillo-Padilla, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 257 (B.I.A.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">In <em>Cruz-Miguel, </em>we explicitly rejected the \u201cunitary view of parole\u201d under the INA upon which Torres-Castillo\u2019s claim rests, <em>see </em>\u2014 F.3d at \u2014\u2014\u25a0 n. 4, and held that Congress did not intend to extend eligibility for adjustment of status to aliens who, like Torres-Castillo, are released from DHS custody under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a)(2) pending a final removability determination, <em>see id. </em>at---. Further, unlike the petitioners in <em>Cruz-Miguel </em>who were released from custody on \u201cconditional parole,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at -, Torres-Castillo was required to post a bond to secure his release, which renders any claim that he was \u201cparoled\u201d into the United States even less tenable than that of the <em>Cruz-Miguel </em>petitioners. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in concluding that Torres-Castillo was removable and ineligible for adjustment of status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>We have considered Torres-Castillo\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the petition is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the court previously granted in this petition is VACATED and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. The BIA further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Torres-Castillo's constitutional challenge to the INA and immigration regulations. Torres-Castillo has abandoned this challenge by failing to raise it in his brief to this court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>see also Norton v. Sam's Club, </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (\"Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
