We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Simmonds challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding that his false statements were material. A material statement for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 has \u201c \u2018a natural tendency to influence, or [is] capable of influencing, the decision of the decision-making body to which it was addressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995) (quoting <em>Kungys v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 759, 770, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988)). Simmonds argues that his false statements \u2014 \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers to questions regarding compliance with supervised release conditions\u2014 were incapable of affecting the probation officer\u2019s investigation because (1) the reports by releasees are inherently unreliable, and (2) a probation officer would rely on other, more reliable investigative tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">At the threshold, we do not focus on whether an investigator believes that a statement is true, because it \u201cwould be exceedingly strange\u201d to \u201cmak[e] the existence of this crime turn upon the credulousness of the federal investigator (or the persuasiveness of the liar).\u201d <em>Brogan v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 398, 402, 118 S.Ct. 805, 139 L.Ed.2d 830 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">In any event, even if the probation officer relied exclusively on other investigative tools, a rational jury could have credited her testimony that she would have adjusted her investigation had Simmonds answered the questions truthfully; the evidence of materiality is thus sufficient. <em>See United States v. Madori, </em>419 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Simmonds challenges the substantive reasonableness of his within-Guidelines 30-month sentence. A within-Guidelines sentence is not presumptively reasonable, but \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, [it] will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Friedberg, </em>558 F.3d 131, 137 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court properly considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), which include his criminal history and the conduct underlying the false statements. Although Simmonds discounts such conduct as \u201conly illegal because he was on supervised release,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 35, it was within the court\u2019s broad discretion to weigh the supervised release violations (and the concealment thereof). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (instructing a court to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>pose a sentence \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Simmonds\u2019s sentence therefore \u201cfalls within the broad range that can be considered reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 174 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We have considered Simmonds\u2019s other arguments and conclude that they lack merit. For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
