The district court concluded that Gilbert\u2019s prior conviction under North Carolina law for taking indecent liberties with children triggered the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) and sentenced him to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and a lifetime term of supervised release. Gilbert appeals, contending that the district court erred in applying the enhancement and imposed an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In June 2008, a North Carolina probation officer found child pornography on Gilbert\u2019s computer during a surprise visit to his home. A forensic examination of Gilbert\u2019s computer revealed 159 still images and 8 videos of child pornography. Among those images were depictions of children under the age of twelve engaged in sadistic conduct and other violent acts. Gilbert admitted to using his computer and a peer-to-peer file sharing program to download images and videos from the Internet. At the time this child pornography was discovered, Gilbert was on probation for his 2007 North Carolina felony convictions for second degree kidnapping and taking indecent liberties with children. Under the terms of his probation, Gilbert was not permitted to possess a computer or have access to the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">On March 18, 2009, a federal grand jury returned a one-count indictment charging Gilbert with knowingly possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). On August 4, 2009, Gilbert pled guilty to the indictment without the benefit of a plea agreement. At the plea hearing, the probation officer who found the child pornography testified that Gilbert\u2019s North Carolina offenses involved \u201csexual contact\u201d with \u201ca six-year-old child.\u201d Gilbert did not contest this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Gilbert\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his total offense level as 30 with a criminal history category of III, which carried an advisory Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Gilbert\u2019s conviction also carried a statutory mandatory term of supervised release, ranging from five years to life. Gilbert did not object to the calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the Guidelines calculation contained in the PSR. The court further found that based on Gilbert\u2019s North Carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with children he was subject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), which requires a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years when the defendant \u201chas a prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d Ultimately, the district court sentenced Gilbert to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Gilbert timely noted this appeal challenging the district court\u2019s imposition of the statutory enhancement and his sentence, particularly the lifetime term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">Gilbert contends that the district court erred in finding that his North Carolina conviction for indecent liberties with children triggered the sentencing enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ment in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2). We review his claim of error <em>de novo. See United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">A defendant convicted of possessing child pornography faces an increased statutory sentencing range under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">such person has a prior conviction under this chapter, chapter 71, chapter 109A, or chapter 117, or under section 920 of title 10 (article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), or under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The district court applied a categorical approach in determining that North Carolina\u2019s indecent liberties statute constituted such an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Under a categorical approach, courts analyze offenses \u201cgenerically \u2014 that is, by relying solely on [their] essential elements, rather than on the particular underlying facts.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>571 F.3d 365, 368 (4th Cir.2009); <em>see James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (explaining categorical approach requires \u201clooking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the predicate offense, rather than to the particular underlying facts\u201d). Under this approach, Gilbert argues that the district court erred in concluding that the North Carolina statute at issue triggered the enhancement in \u00a7 2252A(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The Government makes two arguments in this regard. First, the Government contends that this court need not apply the categorical approach because the language of \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) \u201cclearly permits a broader inquiry ... into whether a prior offense \u2018relates to\u2019 sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13 (quoting <em>United States v. Mills, </em>224 Fed.Appx. 232, 234-35 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. McCutchen, </em>419 F.3d 1122, 1126-27 (10th Cir.2005)) (noting that <em>\u201cTaylor </em>did not impose the categorical approach as a universal requirement of all sentencing enhancements\u201d and concluding that the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d \u201cindicates [Congress\u2019s] intent to allow a sentencing court to look beyond the mere elements of a prior state conviction in determining whether such conviction is sufficient to trigger application\u201d of the identical sentencing enhancement in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2)). According to the Government, then, we can look beyond the elements of North Carolina\u2019s indecent liberties statute to Gilbert\u2019s underlying conduct to assess whether the sentencing enhancement applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The Government also argues that even under a categorical approach \u2014 looking only to the elements of the state statute\u2014 North Carolina\u2019s indecent liberties with children offense triggers the enhancement in \u00a7 2252A(b)(2). Because we ultimately agree with this argument, we will assume, without deciding, that the categorical approach applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">The state law at issue here provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">A person is guilty of taking indecent liberties with children if, being 16 years of age or more and at least five years older than the child in question, he either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-15\">(1) Willfully takes or attempts to take any immoral, improper, or indecent liberties with any child of either sex under the age of 16 years for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-16\">(2) Willfully commits or attempts to commit any lewd or lascivious act upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>or with the body or any part or member of the body of any child of either sex under the age of 16 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">N.C. Gen-Stat. \u00a7 14-202.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The gravamen of Gilbert\u2019s argument is that because one can offend, the indecent liberties statute without making physical contact with a minor, the statute does not categorically \u201crelat[e] to aggravated sexual abus\u00e9, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Every, </em>157 N.C.App. 200, 578 S.E.2d 642, 648-49 (2003) (affirming conviction when \u201cdefendant repeatedly engaged the victim in extremely graphic and explicit [telephone] conversations that were sexual in nature\u201d); <em>State v. McClees, </em>108 N.C.App. 648, 424 S.E.2d 687 (1993) (affirming conviction of high school principal who secretly videotaped a female student undressing). According to Gilbert, the enumerated offenses of \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) necessarily involve \u201csome type of harmful physical contact.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. We disagree.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Turning first to the text of the statutory provision, \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) does not expressly require that predicate state laws criminalize only sexually-based physical <em>contact. </em>Nor does chapter 110 generally define \u201csexual abuse\u201d or \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d to require physical contact. In fact, the chapter does not define these terms at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Chapter 109A does define similar federal offenses to require physical contact. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (aggravated sexual abuse); \u00a7 2242 (sexual abuse); \u00a7 2243 (sexual abuse of a minor or ward); \u00a7 2244 (abusive sexual contact). Critically, however, \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) does not instruct us to apply these federal definitions. Congress certainly could have done so and has done so in other provisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (providing for a life sentence when the defendant \u201chas previously been convicted of ... a state offense that would have been [a federal] offense\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3559(e)(2)(B) (defining \u201cState sex offense\u201d as an offense that \u201cconsists of conduct that would be a Federal sex offense\u201d). Moreover, \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) enumerates \u201cabusive sexual <em>conduct </em>involving a minor\u201d (emphasis added), which is not defined in chapter 109A. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 2244 (criminalizing abusive sexual contact). Accordingly, we find \u201cno indication that Congress intended to import the definitions of chapter 109A to chapter 110.\u201d <em>United States v. Sonnenberg, </em>556 F.3d 667, 670 (8th Cir. 2009); <em>see also United States v. Sinerius, </em>504 F.3d 737, 742-44 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hubbard, </em>480 F.3d 341, 347-48 (5th Cir.2007); <em>but see United States v. Osborne, </em>551 F.3d 718, 720-21 (7th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Moreover, \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) encompasses prior convictions under federal law that by definition <em>do not </em>require physical contact. For example, the Uniform Code of Military Justice criminalizes indecent liberty with a child and defines \u201cindecent liberty\u201d as \u201cindecent conduct, but physical contact is not required.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(j), (t)(ll). Like the Fifth Circuit, \u201c[w]e discern no intent on the part of Congress to impose such a limitation with regard to prior convictions under state law.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>480 F.3d at 347. Indeed, Congress expressly included within \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>prior convictions under state law relating to the possession of child pornography, which does not involve physical contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Because Congress has not defined the terms at issue, \u201cwe interpret [them] by employing the common meaning of the words.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, 522 </em>F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir.2008). <em>See also Sonnenberg, </em>556 F.3d at 671 (giving the identical terms in \u00a7 2252(b)(1) their \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning\u201d); <em>Sinerius, </em>504 F.3d at 743 (noting \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to define \u2018sexual abuse\u2019 as a generic offense, understood by its ordinary and common meaning\u201d). In <em>Diaz-Ibarra, </em>we defined the term \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d found in the Sentencing Guidelines to mean \u201cthe \u2018perpetrator\u2019s physical or <em>nonphysical </em>misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u2019 \u201d 522 F.3d at 352 (quoting <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis added)). <em>See also Sonnenberg, </em>556 F.3d at 671 (adopting identical definition). We find that definition instructive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Accordingly, we assess whether North Carolina\u2019s offense of taking indecent liberties with children is an offense \u201crelating to\u201d the \u201cphysical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d In doing so, we are mindful that \u201cCongress chose the words \u2018relating to\u2019 for a purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Weis, </em>487 F.3d 1148, 1152 (8th Cir.2007) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cThe phrase \u2018relating to\u2019 carries a broad ordinary meaning, i.e., to stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In light of the broad scope of \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) and our holding in <em>Diaz-Ibarra </em>that abuse need not involve physical contact, we have little difficulty concluding that Gilbert\u2019s prior conviction triggers the enhancement. Under the terms of North Carolina\u2019s statute, a perpetrator must be at least five years older than the victim, who must be under 16 years of age. <em>Cf. Osborne, </em>551 F.3d at 719-20 (concluding state statute that lacked four-year age difference did not trigger identical enhancement in \u00a7 2252(b)(1)). The perpetrator must engage in some \u201cimmoral, improper, or indecent liberties\u201d with the minor \u201cfor the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire.\u201d In our view, such conduct \u201crelat[es] to\u201d the \u201cnonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Diaz-Ibarra, 522 </em>F.3d at 352. Accordingly, we hold that North Carolina\u2019s indecent liberties with children offense triggers the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 2252A(b)(2). <em>See Sonnenberg, </em>556 F.3d at 671 (holding prior conviction under Iowa\u2019s lascivious acts with children offense, which required either physical or <em>nonphysical </em>misuse or maltreatment of a minor with the intent to seek libidinal gratification, triggered the enhancement); <em>Hubbard, </em>480 F.3d at 350-51 (holding that the defendant\u2019s prior state conviction for lewd or indecent proposals to a child under 16 years of age triggered the identically-worded enhancement in \u00a7 2252A(b)(l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Gilbert next contends that his sentence is unreasonable. We apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard to determine the reasonableness of Gilbert\u2019s sentence, looking first to whether the district court committed any procedural error in fashioning the sentence. <em>Layton, </em>564 F.3d at 335. \u201cA district court commits a procedural er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ror if it fails to properly calculate the Guidelines, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the statutory factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), bases a sentence on facts that are clearly erroneous, or fails to adequately explain the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335-36 (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). In the absence of any significant procedural error, \u201cwe then examine the sentence for substantive reasonableness in light of all relevant facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Gilbert argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its rationale for imposing the 121-month term of imprisonment, the very bottom of the Guidelines range, because the court failed to address Gilbert\u2019s lengthy argument for a downward variance. Gilbert acknowledges, however, that this argument rests on the conclusion that the district court erred in applying the enhancement in \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), which set a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. In light of our holding that the district court did not so err, and thus could not have sentenced Gilbert to a term of imprisonment shorter than 120 months, Gilbert\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Moreover, the district court provided an adequate \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d of Gilbert\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence to \u201cpermit meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009). The district court considered Gilbert\u2019s prior criminal history of \u201cdeviant conduct involving children,\u201d the nature and circumstances of the current offense, Gilbert\u2019s need for treatment and monitoring, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>JA 257-58; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Having found that the district court committed no significant procedural error, we address Gilbert\u2019s claim that the lifetime term of supervised release is substantively unreasonable in that \u201cit is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20. He asserts that possessing child pornography is one of the \u201clesser offenses for which a lifetime term of supervised release can be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gilbert does not dispute, however, that his crime made him eligible for the lifetime term. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k) (\u201c[T]he authorized term of supervised release for any offense under section ... 2252A ... is any term of years not less than 5, or life.\u201d). Nor does he dispute that the Guidelines recommend \u201cthe statutory maximum term of supervised release,\u201d when \u201cthe instant offense of conviction is a sex offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2 (policy statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">In accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), the district court considered relevant sentencing factors in fashioning the term of supervised release. <em>See </em>JA 258-59. The court considered the nature of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant, citing Gilbert\u2019s prior conviction for a sexually-based crime involving a minor and that Gilbert was on probation for that offense when he committed the present offense. Further, the court considered that Gilbert downloaded a significant number of images in a short period of time using a peer-to-peer file sharing program. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court also found that the lifetime term was necessary to reduce the likelihood that Gilbert would reoffend and to protect the public, particularly children, from further crimes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Lastly, the district court determined that the lifetime term would provide an opportunity for Gilbert to receive long-term treatment and monitoring of that treatment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>In light of the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review, we cannot conclude that the supervised release term was \u201csubstantively unreasonable in light of all the relevant facts.\u201d <em>Layton, </em>564 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">AGEE, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">I join in Parts I'and III of the majority opinion, which rejects Gilbert\u2019s argument that his sentence was unreasonable, and concur in the judgment. I also agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in Part II that Gilbert\u2019s sentence was properly enhanced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) based on his prior North Carolina conviction for indecent liberties with a child. However, I write separately because I would neither assume nor decide that the categorical approach should be used to reach that conclusion. (Majority Op. at 7 (assuming without deciding categorical approach applies).) Instead, for the reasons set forth herein, I would follow the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. McCutchen, </em>419 F.3d 1122 (10th Cir.2005), and this Court\u2019s unpublished decision in <em>United States v. Mills, </em>224 Fed.Appx. 232 (4th Cir.2007), which concluded that an elements-based categorical approach was unnecessary given the breadth of provisions identical to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The categorical approach, set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), was applied to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>604 F.3d 169, 175 (4th Cir.2010) (explaining that the categorical approach was \u201c[o]riginally developed in the context of [the ACCA]\u201d and \u201chas been extended to the career offender provisions under the [United States Sentencing] Guidelines\u201d). As the <em>McCutchen </em>court explained, <em>Taylor </em>determined, based on the specific language and background of \u00a7 924(e), that the word \u201cburglary\u201d as used therein was meant by Congress in the \u201cgeneric sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\u201d 419 F.3d at 1126 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143). Thus,</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">a person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\"><em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143. And, as we noted in <em>Mills, </em>\u00a7 924(e) requires by its plain terms an elements of the crime analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">The [ACCA] provides for a sentencing enhancement only if the defendant is convicted of a felony that <em>\u201chas as an element </em>the use ... of physical force\u201d or \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, <em>involves </em>the use of explosives or otherwise <em>involves </em>conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-15\"><em>Mills, </em>224 Fed.Appx. at 234 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">Accordingly, the language of \u00a7 924(e), as interpreted in <em>Taylor, </em>dictates that courts examine the \u201cessential elements\u201d of a defendant\u2019s previous crime, in order to determine whether it is a predicate offense for ACCA purposes. <em>See United States v. White, </em>571 F.3d 365, 368 (4th Cir.2009) (under a categorical approach, \u201cthe offense is analyzed generically \u2014 that is, by relying solely on its essential elements, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>than on the particular underlying facts\u201d); <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (in addressing the residual clause of \u00a7 924(e), \u201cthe proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In contrast to \u00a7 924(e), the language in the enhancement statute at issue here, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), is completely different. <em>McCutchen </em>examined an identically-worded provision found in \u00a7 2252(b)(2). As the <em>McCutchen </em>court explained, unlike \u00a7 924(e), which was triggered by a felony that \u201cis burglary,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az3\">\u00a7 2252(b)(2) does not state that a prior state crime will trigger the sentence enhancement provisions if it <em>\u201cis </em>\u201d aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor. Rather, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) states that \u201ca prior conviction ... under the laws of any State <em>relating to </em>aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d will trigger the sentence enhancement provisions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2) (emphasis added). As the Supreme Court has indicated, the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d carries a \u201cbroad\u201d \u201cordinary meaning,\u201d i.e., \u201cto stand in some relation to; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with,....\u201d\u2019 <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, </em>504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">419 F.3d at 1126-27 (emphases in original); <em>see also United States v. Rezin, </em>322 F.3d 443, 448 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201c[tjhere is no mention of elements in section 2252(b)(2)\u201d). Thus, the <em>McCutchen </em>court concluded that the categorical approach was inapplicable and that defendant\u2019s prior conviction for sexual battery fell within the scope of the enhancement provision. 419 F.3d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\"><em>McCutchen </em>was also cited with approval and followed by our unpublished decision in <em>Mills. </em>While <em>Mills </em>is not binding authority, I find its reasoning persuasive. In <em>Mills, </em>this court determined that a Virginia conviction <em>for </em>\u201caggravated sexual battery\u201d was a proper predicate offense under \u00a7 2252A(b)(1). 224 Fed.Appx. at 234. The <em>Mills </em>court noted first that the language in the enhancement provision was \u201cnotably broader\u201d than that of the ACCA, and that the enhancement provision \u201cclearly permits a broader inquiry\u201d \u2014 not \u201ctied to federal law definitions \u2014 into whether a pri- or offense \u2018relates to\u2019 sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. It thus concluded that the categorical approach was inapplicable and that the district court was not limited to considering only \u201cthe statutory elements of the state offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">I would follow the same approach as <em>McCutchen </em>and <em>Mills </em>in this case. In short, Gilbert\u2019s offense of indecent liberties with a child<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is one that clearly falls within the language of the enhancement provision, for it is \u201ca prior conviction ... under the laws of any State <em>relating to ... </em>abusive sexual conduct involving a minor .... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) (emphasis added). I would apply this plain language to conclude that sentencing courts tasked with deciding whether a North Carolina conviction for indecent liberties with a child is a proper predicate offense under \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) may examine the facts of a defendant\u2019s conviction, without requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>an analysis limited to the elements of that offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See McCutchen, supra; Mills, supra; see also United States v.

Even assuming <em>Begay </em>applies in this context, Gilbert's argument rests on his contention that the enumerated offenses of \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) criminalize only \"harmful physical contact,\u201d a contention we reject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 215-16 (describing statutory language); <em>see id. </em>at 214 (noting Gilbert did not contest that his offense involved \u201csexual contact\u201d with \"a six-year-old child\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">.

The language of that statute, however, is a differently-worded (and narrower) enhancement provision. <em>See id. </em>at 143-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581.
