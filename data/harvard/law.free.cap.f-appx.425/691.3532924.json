We then dismissed the remainder of Mr. McCon-nel\u2019s appeal and ordered briefing on this one issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-21\">The government filed a merits brief and Mr. McConnel has replied. The government urges a remand so the district court can resolve any issues of deficient performance and prejudice, which may include developing the facts. <em>See Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Jones v. Gibson, </em>206 F.3d 946, 959 (2000) (ineffective assistance of appellate counsel). Mr. McConnel argues that this court should decide the issue on the merits, as well as several others in his favor. We agree with the government and remand for the district court to reconsider this one issue (and only this issue) as discussed in our order granting a COA, a copy of which is attached. <em>United States v. McConnel, </em>No. 10-6109, Order Granting and Denying Certificate of Appealability at 5-8 (Aug. 26, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-22\">REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">ORDER GRANTING AND DENYING CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b715-24\">Defendant-Appellant Joseph Edward McConnel, proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>him to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. To obtain a COA, Mr. McConnel must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>see Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Mr. McConnel has made the requisite showing with respect to the fifth claim in his COA brief, ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to appeal the sentencing court\u2019s inadequate notice of an upward departure. Therefore, we grant his application for a COA on this claim. But because Mr. McConnel has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right on his other claims, we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal as to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In 2002, a jury convicted Mr. McConnel on four counts of firearms violations: one count of dealing in firearms without a license, two counts of selling firearms to a felon, and one count of possession of semiautomatic assault weapons, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A), (d)(1), (d)(3), &amp; (v)(l). 1 R. 38. Mr. McConnel received a sentence of seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment, which he has already served, and three years of supervised release, which he is currently serving. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. This court affirmed Mr. McConnel\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and the Supreme Court denied Mr. McConnel\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. McConnel, </em>464 F.3d 1152, 1164 (10th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1361, 127 S.Ct. 2085, 167 L.Ed.2d 803 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In his timely federal habeas petition, Mr. McConnel presented eleven claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. 1 R. 52-69. Of those eleven claims, Mr. McConnel has raised seven in his COA application and brief, namely his counsel\u2019s failure to: (1) pursue remedies under the Speedy Trial Act; (2) argue that the government presented insufficient evidence for count one, dealing in firearms without a license; (3) appeal the sufficiency of the evidence on count four, possession of assault weapons; (4) raise entrapment on appeal; (5) attack the district court\u2019s inadequate sentencing notice on appeal; (6) raise the issue of sentencing entrapment on appeal; and (7) file a competent appellate brief. Pet. Br. at 1-19. Mr. McConnel has abandoned the other issues not raised in his COA brief. <em>See United States v. Redcorn, </em>528 F.3d 727, 738 n. 4 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Where, as here, the district court has rejected the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims on the merits, to obtain a COA \u201c[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The district court\u2019s resolutions of the bulk of Mr. McConnel\u2019s claims are not reasonably debatable. First, Mr. McCon-nel has not demonstrated an underlying Speedy Trial Act violation. His argument falls far short of the <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), burden of showing that this counsel was deficient in not filing a motion to dismiss and that a motion to dismiss would have changed the outcome. 1 R. 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Second, regarding sufficiency of the evidence on count one, Mr. McConnel does not challenge the district court\u2019s key point: \u201cThere appears to be no question McCon-nel did not possess the required license to sell firearms and that he indeed did sell firearms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. Instead, according to Mr. McConnel, the trial court\u2019s <em>sentencing </em>finding that the government had not proven the illegality of 105 out of more than 125 guns presented at trial means that the government should never have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>been able to present them. Pet. Br. at 3-4. Mr. McConnel\u2019s argument does not change the fact that sufficient evidence existed to convict him on this count. Reasonable jurists cannot debate that counsel was not deficient in not making this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Mr. McConnel\u2019s third and fourth grounds for relief suffer similar problems \u2014 his appellate counsel was not constitutionally deficient for \u201cwinnowing out weaker arguments on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 394 (10th Cir.1995) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). According to Mr. McConnel, his appellate counsel should have contested the sufficiency of the evidence on count four because of Mr. McConnel\u2019s ignorance of the nature of the assault weapon in his possession. Pet. Br. at 7-10. Mr. McConnel points to the absence of a federally required stamp on the weapon. <em>Id. </em>Noting the ample evidence of Mr. McConnel\u2019s knowledge and that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment does not require an attorney to raise every nonfrivolous issue on appeal,\u201d the district court denied relief. 1 R. 165-66 (citing <em>Cook, </em>45 F.3d at 394-95). On the fourth claim, the district court also found that Mr. McConnel\u2019s appellate counsel \u201cexercised his professional judgment\u201d in not appealing the jury\u2019s rejection of his entrapment defense. <em>Id. </em>at 166. Reasonable jurists cannot debate the district court\u2019s resolution of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The district court\u2019s order does not show that it considered Mr. McConnel\u2019s sixth claim for relief, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to appeal the issue of sentencing entrapment. Pet. Br. at 16-17. Nonetheless, we have the benefit of both parties\u2019 briefing below and find that Mr. McConnel has not shown that counsel\u2019s omission was constitutionally deficient or that it prejudiced him. <em>See Inman v. Kansas, </em>No. 04-3503, \u2014 Fed. Appx.-,-, 2005 WL 1519109, at *3 n. 3 (10th Cir. June 28, 2005) (denying COA on issue not addressed by the district court). For that reason, no reasonable jurist could question the district court\u2019s decision to deny relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Mr. McConnel\u2019s seventh claim is that his counsel\u2019s appellate brief amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel because of various typographical and citation errors. Pet. Br. at 17-19. Reasonable jurists cannot debate the district court\u2019s resolution: that Mr. McConnel did not explain how the correction of these errors would have changed the outcome of his case. 1 R. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Only one of Mr. McConnel\u2019s arguments deserves this court\u2019s more detailed attention: his fifth claim, that his counsel should have appealed the sentencing court\u2019s lack of notice of the upward criminal history departure. Pet. Br. at 14-15. The day before Mr. McConnel\u2019s sentencing, December 3, 2003, the government\u2019s sentencing memorandum announced for the first time that it was seeking an upward departure on his criminal history, based on a post-conviction firearms sale in July 2002. 3 R. pt. 11, at 166, 186. Although the presentence report had given notice of some departures, it did not disclose the government\u2019s intent to seek this departure based on post-conviction conduct. 2 R. 8, 14. The ATF agent assigned to Mr. McConnel\u2019s case admitted at the sentencing hearing that he did not disclose the information to defense counsel until \u201ctwo days ago,\u201d despite learning of the incident \u201cwithin the last several months.\u201d 3 R. pt. 11, at 93. At 3:30 p.m. the day before sentencing, the agent turned over the name of an exculpatory witness regarding the July 2002 sale, without any contact information. <em>Id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The government presented witnesses of the firearms sale at the sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 100-65. Over defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>sel\u2019s protests, the sentencing court considered the government\u2019s recently disclosed evidence and found that Mr. McConnel\u2019s July 2002 firearms sale was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, 68-70, 91-95, 177, 182, 190. According to the court, this \u201cidentical offense\u201d to the offense of conviction \u201ccertainly reflects [Mr. McConnel\u2019s] continuing propensity to be a criminal and highlights recidivous [sic] tendency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186. Because of this post-conviction conduct, the court increased Mr. McConnel\u2019s criminal history category from I to II, thereby increasing the applicable guidelines range from fifty-one to sixty-three months to fifty-seven to seventy-one months. <em>Id. </em>at 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Two ambiguities cloud the district court\u2019s decision to increase Mr. McCon-nel\u2019s criminal history category. First, it is not clear under which section of the Sentencing Guidelines the district court departed. The court mentioned U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 (2000), which does not seem to apply, but cited <em>United States v. Forten-bury, </em>917 F.2d 477, 479 (10th Cir.1990), which upheld an upward criminal history departure based on post-conviction conduct under \u00a7 4A1.3, departure based on under-representation of criminal history. Second, in its district court response to the habeas petition, the government denied that the criminal history increase was a departure, but rather characterized it as \u201can increase in offense level based on an increased criminal history level.\u201d 1 R. 106. We find this characterization questionable, given the district court\u2019s mention of <em>Fortenbury </em>and that both the court and the government labeled the increase a \u201cdeparture.\u201d 3 R. pt. 11, at 171, 186. In any case, Mr. McConnel\u2019s petition makes this issue at least debatable, and therefore appropriate for the court to sort out on a full merits review.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Mr. McConnel\u2019s habeas petition argued that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue of lack of sentencing notice constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. 1 R. 63-64. The district court found this argument without merit \u201c[b]e-cause these same sentencing arguments have been raised and decided on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167. This is factually incorrect. On direct appeal, counsel argued that the sentencing court\u2019s fact-finding violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Brief of Defendant/Appellant, <em>United States v. McConnel, </em>464 F.3d 1152 (10th Cir.2006), 2005 WL 1151613, at *24-28. This court correctly recognized the <em>Booker </em>argument and deemed the <em>Booker </em>errors harmless. 464 F.3d at 1162-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether Mr. McConnel\u2019s fifth claim states the denial of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. The lack of adequate notice may have been one of the stronger arguments on appeal in light of <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (holding that Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires reasonable notice \u201cbefore a district court can depart upward\u201d). With the benefit of hindsight, this court might have received such an argument well. <em>See United States v. Dozier, </em>444 F.3d 1215, 1217-18 (10th Cir.2006) (holding Rule 32(h)\u2019s notice requirement survives <em>Booker); United States v. Redmond, </em>388 Fed.Appx. 849, 855 (10th Cir.2010) (noting Rule 32(h)\u2019s notice requirement applies only to \u201c \u2018non-Guideline sentences imposed under the framework set out in the Guidelines\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008))). Mr. McConnel has alleged sufficient prejudice: (1) proper notice may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>have afforded counsel the opportunity to develop an impeachment strategy against the government\u2019s witnesses and to present an exculpatory witness; and (2) the surprise testimony caused the district court to increase his criminal history category and, therefore, his sentence by eight months. Pet. Br. at 15. These allegations merit a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We GRANT a COA as to the fifth claim, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to appeal the issue of inadequate sentencing notice, DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal as to the remaining claims, and GRANT IFP status. Within 45 days of the date of this order, the government shall file a response brief. Defendant may file an optional reply brief within 21 days of the date the response brief is served.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
