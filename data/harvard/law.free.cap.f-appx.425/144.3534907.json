For the following reasons, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-26\">Lakew, a citizen of Ethiopia, was admitted to the United States in December 1989, with authorization to remain until June 5, 1990. Lakew overstayed his admission period, however, and, in May 1996, was charged with deportability pursuant to former Immigration and Nationality Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(B) ]. He conceded deportability, but applied for asylum, withholding of deportation, and voluntary departure. An Immigration Judge denied relief. The BIA agreed that Lakew was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of deportation because he participated in the persecution of others. Nevertheless, the Board remanded the matter to the IJ so Lakew could present evidence regarding his eligibility for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). While his application for CAT relief was pending, Lakew submitted to the IJ an application for adjustment of status based on an approved 1-130 petition filed by his mother. Ultimately, the IJ granted Lakew\u2019s request for deferral of deportation under the CAT, but denied the application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. Lakew appealed the denial of his adjustment application and, on November 19, 2002, the BIA affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Almost seven years later, in September 2009, Lakew filed a motion to reopen with the BIA. He again sought to apply for adjustment of status, this time based on an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The Board denied the motion on December 30, 2009, holding that it was untimely and that none of the exceptions to the time-bar was applicable. Lak-ew next filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that the Board \u201cdid not examine [his September 2009] motion [to reopen] in light of all the circumstances,\u201d that he \u201cdeserve[d] a favorable exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion,\u201d and that his \u201cdeportation proceeding should be reopened because he is eligible to adjust his status based upon his marriage to his United States citizen wife.\u201d He also suggested that the BIA should have reopened the proceedings sua sponte. On March 26, 2010, the BIA denied the motion to reconsider, finding that it \u201clargely reiterate[d] the matters set forth in the prior motion which have already been considered by the Board.\u201d The BIA stated that it found \u201cno adequate basis set forth to warrant reconsideration\u201d and held that the reconsideration motion did \u201cnot demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of [its] discretion sua sponte.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Lakew filed a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to INA \u00a7 242 [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252], and review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005). The Board\u2019s decision is entitled to \u201cbroad deference.\u201d <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>325 F.3d 396, 409 (3d Cir.2003). Thus, to succeed on the petition for review, Lakew must demonstrate that the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration was somehow arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. <em>Zheng v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>549 F.3d 260, 265 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">A motion to reconsider must specify the errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). In this case, the BIA\u2019s prior decision denied Lakew\u2019s motion to reopen because it was not timely filed and because Lakew did not qualify for an exception to the filing deadline. Lakew\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to specify an error of law or fact in those dispositive determinations. Although he alleged that the BIA \u201cdid not examine [his September 2009] motion [to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>reopen] in light of all the circumstances,\u201d he did not identify the circumstances that the Board allegedly overlooked. Lakew also claimed that he was eligible to adjust his status, but such eligibility has no bearing on whether the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen as untimely. Finally, Lakew asserted that the Board should have reopened the proceedings sua sponte. The Board explicitly rejected this request, and we lack jurisdiction to review a challenge to that denial. <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>820 F.3d 472, 475 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Because Lakew has not shown that the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion for reconsideration was arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">. We cannot review the BIA's November 19, 2002, final administrative decision or its December 30, 2010, denial of Lakew\u2019s motion to reopen because the petition for review was only timely as to the BIA's denial of reconsideration on March 26, 2010. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); <em>McAllister v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>444 F.3d 178, 184-85 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
