Because Gonzalez\u2019s motion lacked any allegations of error in the initial decision, Gonzalez\u2019s motion to reconsider did not raise proper grounds for reconsideration. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23. The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Gonzalez\u2019s motion to reconsider because the motion was solely based on a new legal argument, and a new form of relief, that could have been raised in the initial IJ hearing. <em>See Doissaint v. Muka-sey, </em>538 F.3d 1167, 1170-71 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 792 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ca motion to reconsider does not present new law or facts, but rather challenges determinations of law and fact made by the BIA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
