BATCHELDER, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because we find that the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">On or about August 12, 2002,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Janet Sparks issued a check from Entech Personal Services Inc. (Troy, Mich.) to Betty Sampson (now Betty Crawford, plaintiff) in the amount of $200,000 (this is the \u201cOriginal Check\u201d). The Original Check was drawn on an account at Bank One (now JP Morgan Chase, or \u201cChase\u201d). Crawford was and is a Florida resident and Sparks\u2019s sister. The record contains no explanation of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the Original Check.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-19\">On that same day, Crawford took the Original Check to a Chase branch in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and presented it for payment. Chase determined that funds were available in Entech\u2019s account, honored the Original Check, and issued a $200,000 cashier\u2019s check (\u201cthe Cashier\u2019s Check\u201d) made payable to Crawford. Crawford then returned home to Florida and, on August 21, 2002, attempted to deposit the Cashier\u2019s Check in her local bank. The record contains no explanation of why Crawford had immediately converted the Original Check into the Cashier\u2019s Check.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-20\">Meanwhile, on August 19, 2002, Entech had been subjected to involuntary bankruptcy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requested that Chase stop payment on the Original Check and the Cashier\u2019s Check. Chase credited $200,000 back to Entech\u2019s account and stopped pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ment on the Cashier\u2019s Check. When Crawford\u2019s local (Florida) bank on August 24 or 26, 2002, presented the Cashier\u2019s Check to Chase for payment through the interbank system, Chase dishonored it and it was returned unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Although the Cashier\u2019s Check was dishonored in August 2002, Crawford did not sue to obtain payment for almost six years. Crawford filed her first complaint in Oakland County (Mich.) Circuit Court on May 22, 2008, asserting four causes of action against Chase, all premised on provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted in Michigan. Chase removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds on June 20, 2008, and moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Crawford amended her complaint to add common law claims for breach of contract and promissory estop-pel, and a -violation of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The district court held oral argument on February 24, 2009, at which time Crawford dismissed the EFAA claim because it was barred by the EFAA\u2019s statute of limitations. On March 11, 2009, Crawford moved for leave to amend her first amended complaint to add a common law claim of unjust enrichment. Chase opposed the motion on the ground that the claim would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">On June 30, 2009, the district court dismissed Crawford\u2019s complaint. The district court held that, pursuant to M.C.L. \u00a7 440.3301 (i.e., UCC \u00a7 3-301), Crawford was not entitled to enforce<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Original Check against Chase because she was not in possession of the Original Check, nor could she satisfy the statutory requirements for a \u201cperson not in possession who is entitled to enforce the instrument,\u201d <em>see </em>M.C.L. \u00a7 440.3309 (i.e., UCC \u00a7 3-309).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court also held, in the alternative, that even if Crawford could satisfy \u00a7 440.3309, Chase had discharged its obligations on the Original Check by issuing the Cashier\u2019s Check. The district court further held that any claims based on the Cashier\u2019s Check were time barred by the three-year statute of limitations that applies to enforcement of cashier\u2019s checks, a portion of the opinion that Crawford does not contest on appeal. Finally, the district court held that the UCC preempts common law claims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment. The district court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">We conduct a de novo review of a district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Mezibov v. Allen, </em>411 F.3d 712, 716 (6th Cir.2005). We construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and accept all plausible, well-pled factual allegations as true. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cTo state a valid claim, a complaint must contain direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements under some viable legal theory.\u201d <em>Commercial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Money Ctr., Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co., </em>508 F.3d 327, 336-37 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We accept Crawford\u2019s factual allegations as true. We will also assume (without deciding) that Chase accepted the Original Check from Crawford and that Crawford has a statutory right to enforce the Original Check against Chase. Given these facts and assumptions, the dispositive question in this appeal is a purely legal one: whether Chase\u2019s issuance of the Cashier\u2019s Check served as payment-on-presentation that fulfilled and discharged any and all underlying obligations on the Original Check.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u201cUnless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier\u2019s check, or teller\u2019s check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation.\u201d M.C.L. \u00a7 440.3310(1). Crawford gave the Original Check to Chase and took the Cashier\u2019s Check (of equal value) in return. Crawford\u2019s taking of the Cashier\u2019s Check operated to discharge any obligation that anyone (e.g., Entech, Chase, etc.) might owe to her on the Original Check. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Crawford argues that \u2014 prior to her presenting the Original Check at the Chase branch \u2014 Chase did not owe her any \u201cpreexisting obligation\u201d and, therefore, the Cashier\u2019s Check was not \u201ctaken for an obligation\u201d because Chase did not have any obligation to \u201cdischarge\u201d when it issued the Cashier\u2019s Check to her. Under this theory, \u00a7 440.3310(1) is inapplicable and Chase\u2019s obligation to Crawford remains. This is incorrect. Crawford took the Cashier\u2019s Check in exchange for the Original Check; i.e., an \u201cobligation\u201d to pay the amount of the Original Check. There is no provision in \u00a7 440.3310 that the issuance of a cashier\u2019s check discharges <em>only </em>pre-existing obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Crawford also argues that, even if \u00a7 440.3310(1) applies, discharge of the obligation is not accomplished until the bank makes \u201ca separate act of payment\u201d; i.e., follows through with the transfer of funds represented by the cashier\u2019s check. This too is incorrect. Section 440.3310 does not require a further act of payment on a cashier\u2019s check in order to discharge the underlying obligation. Quite the contrary, \u201cthe obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result ^/an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument <em>were </em>taken in payment of the obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>See also </em>2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 20-4 at 350 (5th ed.2008) (rejecting the argument Crawford urges).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Chase points out that Crawford could have redeemed the Original Check for cash, but did not. She could have sued Chase to enforce the Cashier\u2019s Check and, if she had done so within the three-year statute of limitations, she would have had a colorable claim. She did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Crawford cannot sue Chase on the Original Check because Chase\u2019s obligation stemming from the Original Check was discharged by Crawford\u2019s taking the Cashier\u2019s Check. Crawford cannot sue Chase on the Cashier\u2019s Check because the three-year statute of limitations has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Furthermore, because Chase\u2019s obligations stemming from the Original Check have been discharged, Crawford cannot state a viable claim for any other (i.e., common law) causes of action relating to that check. That is, Crawford cannot state any claim based on the Original Check.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Because we find that the plaintiff has failed to state any claim upon which relief can be granted, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-14\">. While both parties and the district court stated that this was August 2, 2002, we conclude from our review of the record that August 2 is almost certainly a typographical error that has been reproduced unchecked throughout the course of these proceedings. The Original Check is dated Friday, August 9, 2002; the Cashier\u2019s Check is dated Monday, August 12, 2002; and all parties have acknowledged that Crawford received the Original Check from Sparks and redeemed it for the Cashier\u2019s Check at the Chase branch on the same day, most likely August 12, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-22\">. According to the E.D. Michigan Bankruptcy Court docket, Entech\u2019s bankruptcy case was terminated on October 15, 2002. <em>See In re Entech Personal Servs., Inc., </em>No. 02-bk-59054 (E.D.Mich. Bankr.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">. The district court used the term \"standing\u201d in reference to Crawford's statutory \u201cright to enforce\u201d the Original Check. While the district court\u2019s intention was clear, this is not a question of constitutional or Article III \u201cstanding\u201d and need not \u2014 indeed cannot \u2014 be analyzed as such. We have, therefore, refrained from using the term \"standing\u201d in this analysis and are not required to proceed as we would be if this were truly a question of \"standing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b471-14\">. The district court also explained that Crawford could not satisfy the requirements for \"payment or acceptance by mistake,\u201d M.C.L. \u00a7 440.3418(4). This was never actually at issue and Crawford does not press it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
