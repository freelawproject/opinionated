Both vehicles were traveling on the wrong-side of the road, and the suspect\u2019s vehicle struck head on a vehicle driven by plaintiffs decedent, causing his death. Plaintiff, in her representative capacity, brought a multi-count complaint against, among others, the City of Ozark and Ozark Police Sergeant Culbreath for damages and other relief, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for the violation of the decedent\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, Counts I and II, and for the violation of the decedent\u2019s rights under Alabama tort law, Counts VII, VIII, XI, and XII. This interlocutory appeal by the City and Culbreath relates to these tort law counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">The City and Culbreath moved to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claims and the tort law claims for failure to state a claim for relief, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). They also sought dismissal of the tort law claims on grounds of immunity \u2014 the City claiming immunity under Ala.Code \u00a7 11-47-190 (municipal immunity) and Culbreath claiming immunity under Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-338 (state-agent immunity). The district court, in an order dated November 22, 2010, granted their motions to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claims, and, without mentioning the immunity defenses, ruled that the tort law claims against the City and Culbreath would be \u201cbest resolved at summary judgment or trial.\u201d Order at 12. The City and Culbreath are entitled to a ruling on their motions to dismiss based on the immunity grounds. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order \u2014 to the extend that it deals with the tort law claims \u2014 and remand the case for such ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
