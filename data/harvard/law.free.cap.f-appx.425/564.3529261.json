Petitioner also contends that she met the standard for CAT relief because she will be tortured due to her resistance to the ORPA guerillas.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Diaz-Morales failed to establish that she was targeted for harm because of her actual or imputed political opinion, or failed to establish a nexus to any other protected ground. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997) (persecution by antigovernment guerillas may not \u201cfrom that fact alone be presumed to be \u2018on account of political opinion\u201d). Because Diaz-Morales did not establish a nexus to a protected ground, petitioner\u2019s asylum claim fails. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because petitioner did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006). Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s request for CAT relief because Diaz-Morales failed to show that it was more likely than not that she will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the Guatemalan government. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
