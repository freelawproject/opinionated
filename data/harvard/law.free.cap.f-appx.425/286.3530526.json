She objects to the district court\u2019s failure to award her a two-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, for her minor role in the offense. Nino-Ibarra contends that she is entitled to the reduction because she was only a courier and thus far less culpable than the persons who hired her.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">The district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for a mitigating role is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). It is not sufficient for Nino-Ibarra to show that she was less involved than other participants; rather, she must show that she was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Larraga, </em>517 F.3d 258, 272 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">The record reflects that Nino-Ibarra admitted that she knowingly transported narcotics into this country. She acknowledged that she had crossed the border in the vehicle \u201ca couple of times before,\u201d including on the evening preceding her arrest. As the district court observed, the instant case involves the transportation of ten kilograms of high purity cocaine secreted in the van that Nino-Ibarra was driving. The district court\u2019s finding that Nino-Ibarra\u2019s role was not peripheral is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
