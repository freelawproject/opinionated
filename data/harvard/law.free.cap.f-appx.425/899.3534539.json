United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1900, 179 L.Ed.2d 957 (2011), for consideration of the Government\u2019s argument that it does not have an obligation to share its superior knowledge \u201cwith respect to \u2018highly classified information,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cwhen (as was the case here) the agreement specifically identifies information that must be shared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1909-10. In addition, on remand, we must determine whether those issues \u201ccan safely be litigated without endangering state secrets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-25\">On June 30, 2011, the parties submitted a joint motion for entry of a scheduling order in this case for briefing of the remanded issues. The Government\u2019s arguments, however, were never squarely addressed by the Court of Federal Claims in the first instance. In addition, the Supreme Court\u2019s remand requires factual determinations most appropriately undertaken by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-26\">Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b923-27\">It is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b923-28\">(1) The parties\u2019 joint motion for entry of a scheduling order is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-29\">(2) We remand to the Court of Federal Claims for further proceedings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>General Dynamics Corp. v. United States.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
