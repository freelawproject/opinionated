Dilks seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2010) motion, construing the motion as a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, and dismissing it as an abuse of the writ. Dilks also seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order imposing a pre-filing injunction against him. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T] he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">The district court\u2019s dismissal order was entered on the docket on October 27, 2010. The notice of appeal was filed on January 10, 2011. Because Dilks failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss this portion the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">Turning to the court\u2019s order imposing a pre-filing injunction, Dilks timely appealed that order. On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in the Appellant\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Dilks\u2019 informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s imposition of the pre-filing injunction, Dilks has forfeited appellate review of the court\u2019s order. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
