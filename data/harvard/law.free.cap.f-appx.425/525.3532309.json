Gregory Wallace, Esq., successfully represented Brandy Wilson in an appeal from a denial of Social Security disability benefits. This court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), but the United States Treasury offset the fee award against debts Wilson owed to the government. We issued an order in this case on September 15, 2008, finding that an EAJA attorneys\u2019 fee award \u201cshould not be offset against debts owed by the successful claimant.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Astrue, </em>No. 06-3627 (8th Cir. Sept. 15, 2008). Subsequently, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed this court\u2019s judgment for the reasons articulated in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Astrue v. Ratliff, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2521, 177 L.Ed.2d 91 (2010). <em>Astrue v. Wilson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3450, 3450-51, 177 L.Ed.2d 1048 (2010). Consequently, to the extent the Supreme Court did not vacate our prior order, we do so now.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
