Cueva\u2019s application was denied based on a finding that she was not credible. After review, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">On appeal, Cueva argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An asylum applicant must show, with specific and credible evidence, either past persecution or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>\u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on a protected ground. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While credible testimony \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s burden without corroboration,\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), the weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroboration. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Conversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may support a denial of an asylum claim, but if the applicant produces evidence other than her testimony, the IJ and the BIA must consider this evidence as well. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In making an adverse credibility finding, the IJ must be explicit and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the finding. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), as amended by the REAL ID Act, the IJ, in evaluation credibility, must consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written or oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence in the record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see also Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">The IJ and the BIA gave specific, cogent reasons for finding Cueva not credible. Specifically, the IJ noted inconsistencies between: (1) Cueva\u2019s hearing testimony and her asylum application as to her membership in the Women\u2019s' Group and the Entrepreneurs Association; (2) Cueva\u2019s hearing testimony that her brother Claudio was attacked by the Mara 18 and a police report indicating that two unknown individuals shot at Claudio and that friends had no idea why Claudio was attacked and Claudio\u2019s own \u201cdenunciation\u201d filed with the Honduran police indicating he was attacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>by an unknown person; (3) Cueva\u2019s hearing testimony that her brother Ramon was killed by the Mara 18 and an article about the incident stating that a relative affirmed that Ramon had no enemies and another article suggesting the motive may have been revenge; (4) Cue-va\u2019s claim in her application that the Mara 18 targeted her because of her political activity with the National Party and membership in the Entrepreneurs Association and her admission in her addendum that the Mara 18 targeted her because she filed a \u201cdenunciation\u201d with the Honduran police after her brother Ramon\u2019s assassination. The IJ also identified implausibilities, including: (1) Cueva\u2019s proffer of evidence of her brother Claudio\u2019s membership in the Entrepreneurs Association, but not her own membership in that organization; and (2) the unlikelihood that the Mara 18 was targeting National Party members given that the State Department\u2019s 2007 Country Report for Honduras did not mention it and the National Party is one of two major political parties in Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Finally, the IJ noted that Cueva provided no corroborating documentary evidence to support her testimony that: (1) the Mara 18 attacked her twice, first shooting bullets into her home and then shooting at her car as she exited it to pick up her son from school; (2) that the Mara 18 was involved in the attacks on her brothers; or (3) that the Mara 18 was targeting National Party members.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The reasons given for discrediting Cue-va are supported by substantial evidence. Although Cueva offered explanations for some of these inconsistencies or lack of corroboration, the IJ considered them and found them to be without merit. Further, Cueva\u2019s tenable explanations do not compel a conclusion that she was credible. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233. Finally, Cue-va does not argue that the other evidence in the record, absent her (discredited) testimony, compels a conclusion that she was persecuted or had a well-founded fear of persecution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">. Cueva\u2019s son, Andre Velasco Artola, was included on her application as a derivative beneficiary. Although our opinion refers to Cueva, our holding as to the asylum and CAT claims apply equally to Artola. We deny Artola\u2019s withholding of removal claim because \"there are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal.\" <em>See Delgado v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-9\">. On appeal, Cueva does not challenge the denial of CAT relief, and, thus, we do not address that claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-16\">. The BIA affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility finding and elaborated upon some of the IJ's reasoning. Thus, we review the IJ's credibility finding as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Savoury v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006). Our review of credibility determinations is \"highly deferential\u201d and we \"may not substitute our judgment for that of the Board.\u201d <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). Credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we will overturn them only if the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\">. Similarly, an applicant for withholding of removal must show that it was more likely than not that she will be persecuted on a protected ground. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. The IJ\u2019s credibility findings for purposes of determining eligibility for withholding of removal are also governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B), as amended by the REAL ID Act. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C). Because Ceuva filed her application on May 19, 2008, the REAL ID Act amendments apply to her case. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 305 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b824-14\">. Cueva\u2019s claim that the BIA\u2019s citation to Seventh Circuit precedent is reversible error is without merit. The BIA cited the Seventh Circuit case merely as an example of an IJ\u2019s denial of asylum being affirmed based on an adverse-credibility finding. Further, the proposition that an asylum application may be denied if the applicant\u2019s testimony is vague and lacking in internal consistency, plausibility and corroboration is supported by our precedent and the REAL ID Act amendments cited in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">. Because Cueva failed to establish her eligibility for asylum, she likewise failed to establish her eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
