HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">Roy Dean Bullcoming seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the denial of his motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (requiring COA to appeal denial of relief under \u00a7 2255). \u201cA certificate of appealability may issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, an applicant must show that the district court\u2019s resolution of the constitutional claim was either \u201cdebatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">No reasonable jurist could debate the resolution of Mr. Bullcoming\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion. <em>See United States v. Bullcoming, </em>No. CR-08-0055-F, 2011 WL 195652 (W.D.Okla. Jan. 18, 2011). We therefore deny his application for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
