The district court properly denied the motion to suppress filed by Defendant-Appellant Juan Aparicio-Lopez (AparicioLopez). The Border Patrol Agent had reasonable suspicion for the initial traffic stop. The agent observed Aparicio-Lopez\u2019s evasive slowing behavior, extremely nervous appearance, his vehicle\u2019s type and Baja license plates, and the time he crossed the checkpoint. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Barron, </em>116 F.3d 1305, 1307 (9th Cir.1997) (listing factors to consider in determining whether a vehicle stop was justified by reasonable suspicion).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The initial traffic stop was not unlawfully extended by the agent\u2019s questioning of Aparicio-Lopez regarding his business in the United States. The questioning did not unreasonably prolong the duration of the detention, and therefore required no additional Fourth Amendment justification. <em>See United States v. Mendez, </em>476 F.3d 1077, 1080-81 (9th Cir.2007) (stating that because \u201cofficers\u2019 questioning did not prolong the stop, we are compelled to hold that the expanded questioning need not have been supported by separate reasonable suspicion\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Turvin, </em>517 F.3d 1097, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2008) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">The waiting period necessitated by the agent\u2019s call for the K-9 unit did not transform the investigatory detention into a functional arrest because the agents \u201cused no threats of force, unnecessary delays, exaggerated displays of authority or other coercive tactics.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Sanchez, </em>83 F.3d 1123, 1129 (9th Cir.1996), <em>as amended </em>(citations omitted). Moreover, Aparicio-Lopez\u2019s consent to the canine sniff search justified the additional detention while he and the agents waited for the K-9 unit to arrive. <em>See United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 882-83, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (noting that further detention or search unjustified by border patrol agents\u2019 reason for initial stop must be based on \u201cconsent or probable cause\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Aparicio-Lopez\u2019s arguments regarding the validity and scope of his consent were waived because he did not advance them in his motion to suppress before the district court. <em>See United States v. Keesee, </em>358 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">2. The district court did not clearly err in denying Aparicio-Lopez\u2019s request for a safety-valve reduction because, \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, [Aparicio-Lopez] ha[d][not] truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence [he] ha[d] concerning the offense ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\"><em>United States v. Shrestha, </em>86 F.3d 935 (9th Cir.1996), does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>Shrestha </em>held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cperjury at trial should [not] automatically defeat a claim for [safety valve relief!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 939-40, and determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that, although the defendant had perjured himself in his prior testimony, he was entitled to a safety-valve reduction because, before sentencing, he \u201cappear[ed] to have timely provided the Government with all the information at his disposal concerning the offense for which he was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. In this case, however, the district court found that Aparicio-Lopez appeared to have proffered incomplete, inconsistent, and untrue information to the government before sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
