Jaiyeola sought relief on the basis that if he were to be deported, his two U.S.citizen daughters would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). In this court, Jai-yeola raises a single argument \u2014 that the BIA\u2019s decision ran afoul of its earlier prec-edential decision in <em>Matter of Ige, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 880 (BIA 1994), because the BIA failed to consider whether Jaiyeola\u2019s daughters would face exceptional and extremely ususal hardship if they were to accompany him to Nigeria. However, Jai-yeola failed to raise this argument before the immigration judge or the BIA, contending only that his daughters would suffer hardship as a result of their separation from him and his inability to provide for them financially. Indeed, Jaiyeola testified before the immigration judge that if he were to be deported, his children would remain in the United States with their mothers, and he presented no evidence concerning how they would fare in Nigeria. Because Jaiyeola failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to consider his petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Kane v. Holder, </em>581 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>F.3d 231, 237-38 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
