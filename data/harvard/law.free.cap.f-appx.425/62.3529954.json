Feb. 19, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A095 405 335 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 21, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). The agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Corovic v. Muka-sey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). Questions of law, and the application of law to undisputed facts, are reviewed de novo. <em>Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. We will not disturb adverse credibility determinations when they are based on \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements ... about matters material to [an applicant\u2019s] claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). In making the adverse credibility determination in this case, the IJ found Sesay not credible because of inconsistencies between his testimony and his statements in his amended asylum application regarding: (1) the length of time his father was missing after the rebels kidnapped him; (2) when his legs were burned during a rebel attack; and (3) when he left Sierra Leone. As the IJ pointed out specific inconsistencies related to the rebel attacks on Sesay\u2019s family, there is no basis for reversal of the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74; <em>Secai-da-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (providing that an adverse credibility determination must be based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding); <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201ceven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, ... the cumulative effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder\u201d (internal citations omitted)). We further find no error in the IJ\u2019s refusal to credit Sesay\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies, as his explanations do not compel a finding of credibility. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.3(c)(2) (providing a rebuttable presumption that an asylum applicant is aware of the contents of the application at the time it is filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Because Sesay\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims share the same factual predicate, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination precludes either form of relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 157 (2d Cir.2006). Because the adverse credibility determination is dispositive, we do not reach the agency\u2019s alternate burden of proof findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
