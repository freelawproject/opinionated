Grunley opposes. AOC replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-26\">In April 2004, AOC issued to Grunley a fixed-price contract to provide construction services to modernize portions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The contract required that \u201c[cjertain events during the construction period will require the Contractor to suspend work for given periods of time, including but not limited to key events indicated on the Court calendar.\u201d That clause further provided that for bidding purposes \u201cthe Contractor shall anticipate sixteen (16) days per calendar year of interrupted work days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-27\">During the course of performance, the Marshal of the Supreme Court began imposing work restrictions during days the court was in session or in conference. Grunley alleges that those restrictions effectively precluded it from performing the work on time and on budget as expected. In October 2005, Grunley shifted some day work to night shifts as a result of the Marshal\u2019s imposed restrictions. In late 2006, however, Grunley determined that it would be more productive to work all but specified night trades in the normal work day and to have crews sit out the hours on court days.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-28\">On October 1, 2008, Grunley certified a single claim seeking an equitable adjustment from the contracting officer (CO) for $1,095,128 as a result of the Marshal\u2019s imposed restrictions. Grunley alleged that the restrictions constructively changed the contract resulting in increased costs associated with the work between October 2005 and December 2007. Grunley\u2019s claim consisted of two components: (1) costs for night shift premiums and night-time inefficiency costs from October 2005 through December 31, 2006; and (2) standby costs incurred during the day. The CO denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Grunley\u2019s claim on the grounds that pursuant to the events clause Grunley budgeted for delays during court days.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Contract Appeals Board held that Grunley\u2019s claim for an adjustment for standby costs incurred during the day was prohibited under the contract\u2019s \u201cno damage for delay\u201d clause. However, with regard to its night shift premium and inefficiency cost argument, the Board disagreed with the CO\u2019s interpretation of the events clause. Instead, the Board agreed with Grunley that any interruptions more than 16 days per calendar year could be entitled to compensation but only under the \u201csuspension of work\u201d clause. The Board held that \u201cGrunley is entitled to recover the night shift differential that was necessarily incurred and was not for work otherwise required to be performed at night, so long as the conditions of the suspension of work clause are met.\u201d The Board expressly declined to reach certain issues on summary judgment, e.g., declining to decide whether the contracting officer engaged in any acts to suspend work because of \u201cinsufficient undisputed facts in the record.\u201d Grunley filed an appeal seeking review in this court. The issue of Grunley\u2019s entitlement to compensation under the suspension clause remains open.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The AOC contends that Grunley\u2019s appeal from the Board\u2019s summary judgment order is not final. We agree. Although Grunley presents its claim as having multiple cost components, it certified only a single claim arising out of essentially interrelated services and closely connected facts. <em>See Teller Envtl. Sys. v. U.S., </em>802 F.2d 1385, 1389 (Fed.Cir.1986) (rejecting characterizing of multiple claims when the demands for adjustments involved interrelated services and closely connected facts). The matter of Grunley\u2019s entitlement to an adjustment remains open. Allowing for an appeal from an order resolving in part motions for summary judgment, before all issues are determined, would undermine the primary purpose of the final judgment rule in avoiding the inefficiencies of piecemeal litigation. <em>See Catlin v. U.S, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">(1) The motion to dismiss is granted. Both appeals are dismissed. Grunley may appeal the matter after final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
