Amiah, through counsel, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) decision denying her motion to reconsider its denial of her second motion to reopen. On appeal, she attempts to challenge the underlying BIA decision denying her second motion to reopen. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-23\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Amiah\u2019s arguments regarding the denial of her second motion to reopen because she did not file a petition, much less a timely one, seeking review of the BIA\u2019s October 2009 order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see also Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (noting the filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by a motion to reopen). We have jurisdiction to review only the BIA\u2019s May 19, 2010, order denying Amiah\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of her second motion to reopen, as the instant petition, filed less than 30 days later, is timely with respect to only that order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-24\">Amiah advances no argument that the BIA abused its discretion in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>her motion to reconsider, and has thus abandoned the only issue properly on appeal. <em>See Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[A]n appellant\u2019s simply stating [in her brief] that an issue exists, without further argument or discussion, constitutes abandonment of that issue and precludes our considering the issue on appeal.\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition to the extent Amiah seeks to challenge the underlying order denying her second motion to reopen and deny the petition to the extent that she challenges the BIA\u2019s order denying reconsideration of the second motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, PETITION DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
