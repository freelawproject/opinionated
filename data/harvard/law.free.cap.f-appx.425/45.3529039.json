Civil Rights Law \u00a7 40-c, and N.Y. Executive Law \u00a7 296, and for breach of contract. We assume familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-21\">We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering whether there was a genuine issue as to any material fact and, if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). We \u201cresolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the burden rests on the movant to show that no genuine factual dispute exists, <em>see Nationwide Life Ins. Co. v. Bankers Leasing Ass\u2019n, </em>182 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir.1999), a moving defendant is not required to file affidavits (or other materials) disproving the plaintiffs claims, <em>see Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>22 F.3d 1219, 1223-24 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he moving party may obtain summary judgment by showing that little or no evidence may be found in support of the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Upon an independent review of the record, we conclude that summary judgment in favor of defendants was warranted for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned and thorough opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We have considered Ockimey\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
