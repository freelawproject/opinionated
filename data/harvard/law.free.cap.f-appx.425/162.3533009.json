He appeals the application of a four-point enhancement to the calculation of his Guidelines range and the sufficiency of the District Court\u2019s consideration of his plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-27\">In 2009, Mayo was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and possession of body armor by a person convicted of a violent felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a)(1). In 2010, Mayo and the Government entered into a plea agreement on the firearm count and the Government agreed to dismiss the body armor count. The plea agreement contemplated a Guidelines range based on an offense level of 21. The District Court, however, applied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>four-point enhancement to reach a new offense level of 25 and sentenced Mayo within the Guidelines range for that offense level. The enhancement was for possession of \u201cany firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The term \u201canother felony offense\u201d may apply to an act \u201cregardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 app. n. 14(C). The other felony offense at issue was possession of body armor by a violent felon. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931(a). Mayo does not deny possession of body armor (a bullet proof vest) but denies that his firearm possession was \u201cin connection with\u201d possession of the body armor. He notes that he was shot a few days prior to his arrest and contends that he possessed both the firearm and the body armor for self-defense purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Aquino, </em>555 F.3d 124, 127 (3d Cir.2009). However, the District Court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts is entitled to \u201cdue deference,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127 n. 5, and we review that application for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Tupone, </em>442 F.3d 145, 149 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Mayo argues that the District Court should not have applied the four-point enhancement because there was no evidence of a connection between the possession of the firearm and possession of the body armor. We disagree. This court construes the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d broadly, noting that it \u201cexpresses some relationship or association, one that can be satisfied in a number of ways such as a causal or logical relation or other type of relationship.\u201d <em>United States v. Loney, </em>219 F.3d 281, 284 (3d Cir.2000). The District Court found that Mayo possessed the firearm in connection with possessing body armor, \u201cwhether he carried the firearm to gain revenge or whether he carried it to protect himself.\u201d App. at 62. Under either justification, there is a \u201clogical relation\u201d between the firearm and the body armor sufficient to satisfy the <em>Loney </em>standard. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in applying the four-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) and imposing a within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Mayo also claims that the District Court did not give proper consideration to the plea agreement\u2019s contemplation of a total offense level of 21. This claim lacks merit. The District Court need not consider the parties\u2019 suggested sentence when imposing its sentence. <em>See United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201cThe reasonableness of a sentence depends not on the district court\u2019s adherence to the range recommended by ... the parties.\u201d). Rather, it must assess the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>The record in this case reflects the District Court\u2019s consideration of those factors when crafting a substantively reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">For the above-stated reasons, we will affirm the judgment and the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-28\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
