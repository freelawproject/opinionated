(\u201cSchupak\u201d) is a sponsor for an ERISA plan, which the complaint alleges was victimized by Bernard L. Madoff s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Defendant-Appellee Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (\u201cTravelers\u201d) had provided the ERISA compliance bond, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a), which insured Schupak\u2019s plan against fraud and other dishonest acts committed by any \u201cemployee,\u201d which was defined in relevant part in the insurance policy as \u201c[a] trustee, an officer, employee, administrator or manager, except an administrator or manager who is an independent contractor, of any Employee Welfare or Pension Benefit Plan (hereafter called Insurance Plan) covered by this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">After Madoffs arrest, the Sehupak Group, through Donald Sehupak, filed a claim with Travelers seeking to recover the value of its investment losses. In the \u201cProof of Loss\u201d form, Mr. Sehupak stated that Madoff was \u201cCustodian and Investment Trustee,\u201d as \u201cdelegated by the Plan Trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Shortly thereafter, Travelers sent a letter to Mr. Sehupak acknowledging receipt of the Proof of Loss. In that letter, Travelers also requested \u201ccopies of any agreements, contracts or other documents between the Insured and Bernard L. Madoff Securities, LLC,\u201d because \u201cthere [was] a question as to if Mr. Bernard Madoff [was] considered an \u2018Employee\u2019 \u201d under the terms of the bond. Travelers further explained that \u201c[f]rom the information you have provided it seems that Mr. Madoff would not be considered an \u2018employee\u2019 ... rather, an independent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Mr. Sehupak responded by letter, refusing to produce any documentation of the relationship with Madoff and instead insisting that Madoff \u201cwas squarely within the definition of trustee,\u201d which definition Mr. Sehupak quoted from Webster\u2019s Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Travelers responded to Mr. Sehupak by letter, again requesting copies of relevant documents. Specifically, Travelers wrote: \u201cIf the Insured Plan has a plan instrument naming Bernard L. Madoff as a trustee of the Insured Plan; a document confirming that Bernard L. Madoff accepted being named or appointed a trustee of the Insured Plan; an agreement, contract or other document pursuant to which the Insured Plan appointed Bernard L. Madoff an investment manager to manage some or all of the assets of the Insured Plan; and any other contract agreement or document which the Insured Plan contends establishes that Bernard L. Madoff is within the definition of \u2018Employee\u2019 in the Bond, Travelers again requests that they be provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Mr. Sehupak again refused to produce any documents relating to Madoffs appointment as trustee, insisting that he was not required to do so. He also stated: \u201cRespectfully, the policy is written in English, which is a language I do understand. Your letter is replete with obfuscations [sic] and irrelevant references, which do not and cannot limit or modify Traveler\u2019s [sic] obligations under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Travelers then denied coverage, and Sehupak filed suit. The district court dismissed Schupak\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim because Sehupak failed to plead that it had adequately complied with its obligations under the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the remaining facts, procedural history and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Legnani v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A., </em>274 F.3d 683, 685(2d Cir.2001). The plaintiffs complaint must, however, \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp.v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)); <em>accord Ruston v. Town Bd. for Town of Skaneateles, </em>610 F.3d 55, 59 (2d Cir.2010). A claim is plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is hable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. \u201cWe may affirm a district court decision based on \u2018any ground appearing in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>624 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Under New York law, a breach of contract claim requires proof of (1) an agreement, (2) adequate performance by the plaintiff, (3) breach by the defendant, and (4) damages. <em>First Investors Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>152 F.3d 162, 168 (2d Cir.1998); <em>Harsco Corp. v. Segui, </em>91 F.3d 337, 348 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Schupak\u2019s complaint, read liberally, contains no factual allegations giving rise to a reasonable inference that Madoff was a \u201ctrustee\u201d for the purposes of the Bond. Indeed, the complaint is utterly conclusory with respect to Madoffs status under the Bond. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6 19. Moreover, the complaint asserts, on its face, that funds in question were placed in Madoffs control after passing through a third party intermediary, FGLS, LLC, <em>see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10, thereby negating the plausibility of any assertion that Madoff was affiliated with the ERISA plan whose assets the Bond insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">We have considered all of Schupak\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
