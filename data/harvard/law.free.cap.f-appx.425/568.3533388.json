We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gil\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed over 90 days after the BIA\u2019s final administrative decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and because Gil failed to demonstrate changed country conditions material to her claim in order to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>Al-maraz v. Holder, </em>608 F.3d 638, 640-41 (9th Cir.2010) (denying petition for review where evidence of changed country conditions was not material to petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-25\">To the extent Gil contends the BIA failed to consider all of the evidence she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>submitted with the motion to reopen, she has not overcome the presumption that the BIA did review the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Gil submitted additional evidence with her opening brief to this Court, which cannot be considered on review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
