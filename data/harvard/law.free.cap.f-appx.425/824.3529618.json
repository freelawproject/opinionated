Williams, an Alabama state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, of his amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. Williams asserts two issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">Williams first asserts the district court erred when it dismissed his \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim because the applicable statute of limitations had expired. Williams alleged he was deprived of his constitutional rights involving his state criminal proceedings and confinement in the Jefferson County jail from February 2005 to February 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">A district court may dismiss a \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim if the action would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 214-15, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). \u201cAll constitutional claims brought under \u00a7 1983 are tort actions, subject to the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state where the \u00a7 1983 action has been brought.\u201d <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008). The governing limitations period in Alabama is two years. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 6-2-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">The district court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019s claims as time barred because the alleged injury occurred more than two years before the filing of his December 2009 complaint. <em>See Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 214-15,127 S.Ct. 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">Williams next asserts the district court erred in finding that his remaining claims against Alabama State Judge Clyde E. Jones were barred by absolute judicial immunity. Williams alleged his constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>tional rights were violated by Judge Jones in March 2010 when he refused to appoint Williams\u2019 attorney of choice and hindered Williams from pursuing and maintaining his civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">\u201cJudges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (citations omitted and emphasis added). Absolute judicial immunity \u201capplies even when the judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether a judge\u2019s actions were made while acting in his judicial capacity depends on whether: (1) the act complained of constituted a normal judicial function; (2) the events occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers or in open court; (3) the controversy involved a case pending before the judge; and (4) the confrontation arose immediately out of a visit to the judge in his judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.2005). Further, the district court may dismiss a claim based on absolute judicial immunity if it represents an \u201cobvious bar\u201d based on the allegations in the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1070 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019 claims against Judge Jones because all of Williams\u2019 claims related to the actions of Judge Jones acting within his judicial capacity and performing a \u201cnormal judicial function.\u201d <em>See Sibley, </em>437 F.3d at 1070. To the extent Williams argues Judge Jones acted out of anger or for personal gain, his argument is without merit, as this does not show that the judge\u2019s actions were in \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1239. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019 amended \u00a7 1983 complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-11\">. \u201cA district court's decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>taking the allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-12\">. Specifically, Williams alleged his constitutional rights were violated when: (1) he was prevented from representing himself in a state court action, (2) his <em>pro se </em>filings were not accepted by the state court, and (3) trial proceedings were conducted outside of his presence. He further claimed he was kept in unsanitary conditions in the jail and that current and former county commissioners failed to respond to his grievances regarding the conditions in the jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b850-20\">.
