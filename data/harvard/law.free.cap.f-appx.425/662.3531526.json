Vaden asserted a claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Additionally, Vaden raised an uncertified issue concerning the trial judge\u2019s failure to appoint substitute counsel to present Vaden\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">1. We agree with the district court that the state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland. </em>\u201c[A] defendant claiming ineffective counsel must show that counsel\u2019s actions were not supported by a reasonable strategy and that the error was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). The state court did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland, </em>because as it observed, the medical records were not especially probative regarding Vaden\u2019s intoxication defense. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">2. The district court was correct in denying habeas relief for Vaden\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to call an expert witness to support his claim of intoxication. Assuming, without deciding, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Vaden failed to establish prejudice, <em>ie., </em>\u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052. As the magistrate judge noted, Vaden did not provide a declaration from any expert to support his claim that Activan increased his intoxication. This lack of supporting documentation precludes a finding of prejudice. <em>See Wildman v. Johnson, </em>261 F.3d 832, 839 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">3. We do not address Vaden\u2019s uncerti-fied claim, because he failed to \u201cma[k]e a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d to warrant issuance of a certificate of appealability. <em>Rhoades v. Henry, </em>598 F.3d 511, 518 (9th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
