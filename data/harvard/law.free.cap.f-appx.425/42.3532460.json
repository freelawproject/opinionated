We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cconstruing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Costello v. City of Burlington, </em>632 F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir.2011). We will uphold such an award only if the record reveals no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). In applying these standards, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">Having ourselves reviewed the relevant Jayms Blonde and <em>You Don\u2019t Mess With the Zohan </em>images, we affirm the judgment for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its thorough and well-reasoned opinion. <em>See Cabell v. Sony Pictures Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>714 F.Supp.2d 452 (S.D.N.Y.2010). Aside from the unprotectable ideas of (1) brandishing a blow dryer as a weapon, and (2) the characters\u2019 fighting poses, there is no plausible basis for a reasonable jury to find that the parties\u2019 respective expressions of the concept of a crime-fighting hairdresser are substantially similar. <em>See Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. Simone Dev. Corp., </em>602 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>57, 68 (2d Cir.2010); <em>see also Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., </em>784 F.2d 44, 48 (2d Cir.1986) (\u201cThe copyright protection granted to appellant\u2019s book extends only to its particular expression of ideas, not to the ideas themselves....\u201d); <em>Mattel, Inc. v. Az-rak-Hamway Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>724 F.2d 357, 360 (2d Cir.1983) (holding that \u201csuperhuman muscleman crouching in what since Neanderthal times has been a traditional fighting pose\u201d was unprotectable idea).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the district court correctly dismissed the New York unfair competition claim as preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Copyright Act. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301; <em>Kregos v. Associated Press, </em>3 F.3d 656, 666 (2d Cir.1993) (holding New York unfair competition claim based solely on copying of protected expression preempted by \u00a7 301 of Copyright Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We have considered Cabell\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. Although the complaint also alleged infringement based on the plotline of the <em>Zohan </em>film, <em>see </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 48, which claim the district court rejected, <em>see Cabell v. Sony Pictures Entm't, Inc., </em>714 F.Supp.2d at 460-61, Cabell argues on appeal that his infringement claim is predicated solely on the visual images used in the promotion of the <em>Zohan </em>film, <em>see </em>Appellant's Br. at 9, 22-23. Accordingly, we deem any infringement claim based on plot-line abandoned. <em>See, e.g., Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., </em>953 F.2d 731, 734-35 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
