DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">A. Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">This court reviews the granting of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp., </em>531 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.2008). Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) allows courts to grant injunctions against defendants in an action brought by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) provided there is a \u201cproper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the Commission\u2019s likelihood of ultimate success, [granting the injunction] would be in the public interest____\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53(b) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings and concluding that the FTC had demonstrated a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success on the merits\u201d and that the equities involved support the preliminary injunction. Kl<em>ay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1097 (11th Cir.2004). The district court order granting the preliminary injunction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-19\">B. Scope of Asset Freeze</p>\n<p id=\"b821-20\">This court reviews an asset freeze for abuse of discretion. <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Levy, </em>541 F.3d 1102, 1110 (11th Cir.2008). Bishop claims the district court abused its discretion by granting a preliminary injunction that froze all of his assets,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> other than an allowance for personal expenses, inconsistent with principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-21\">The FTCA\u2019s grant of authority to issue an injunction carries the full range of equitable remedies, among which is the power to grant restitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Wilshire, </em>531 F.3d at 1344 (quoting <em>Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n v. Gem Merck Corp., </em>87 F.3d 466, 468-69 (11th Cir.1996)). Restitution is an equitable remedy designed to cure unjust enrich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ment of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1345 (citation omitted). Specifically, restitution and disgorgement deprive the defendant of his ill-gotten gains; these equitable remedies do not take into consideration the plaintiffs losses. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The \u201cburden for showing the amount of assets subject to disgorgement (and, therefore available for freeze) is light: \u2018a reasonable approximation of a defendant\u2019s ill-gotten gains [is required] ... Exactitude is not a requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. ETS Payphones, Inc., </em>408 F.3d 727, 735 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Calvo, </em>378 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The district court abused its discretion by imposing too broad of an asset freeze without making any reasonable approximation of Defendant-Appellant\u2019s ill-gotten gains. Therefore, we remand this case to the district court to determine whether the asset freeze corresponds with a reasonable approximation of Bishop\u2019s unjust enrichment, in accordance with equitable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">C. Modification of Asset Freeze</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Defendant-Appellant\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion to modify the terms of the preliminary injunction is moot in light of our decision to vacate and remand the asset freeze.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The granting of the preliminary injunction is affirmed, the asset freeze is vacated and remanded, and the appeal of the denial of the motion to modify the preliminary injunction is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part, and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-14\">. All of the defendant\u2019s assets that existed on November 13, 2009 were frozen, including assets obtained prior to the activities alleged and assets held jointly with his wife, but excluding $9,500 per month for living expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-23\">. Here, the FTC seeks equitable relief, as evident from the FTC\u2019s own complaint. (R. 1 at 13-15, \u00b6 45 &amp; Prayer for Relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
