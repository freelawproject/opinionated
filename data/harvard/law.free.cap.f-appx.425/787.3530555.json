The district court ruled that Williams\u2019s speech did not involve a matter of public concern and that Williams\u2019s complaint of discrimination based on race, gender, and disability was untimely. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">In 2007, Gwinnett County Public Schools hired Williams at Sweetwater Elementary School as a \u201cstellar substitute teacher.\u201d In 2008, Williams met with the principal of Sweetwater, Georgann Eaton, to discuss four instances in which he had made inappropriate comments to students and staff. On February 25, 2009, Eaton gave Williams an interim performance rating of satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">The school administered a program called Read 180 that used therapy dogs as part of the curriculum and, on March 13, 2009, Williams emailed to faculty and staff a four-page essay criticizing the program and its director. In the essay, which Williams titled \u201cMy Life is not a Life of Dogdom,\u201d he berated an unnamed staff member for acting \u201cselfish[lyj\u201d by bringing a dog into the school cafeteria, discussed his severe allergy to dog dander and the \u201ccompromise\u201d reached in his marriage in which his wife donated her German Shepherds to a drug detection agency, and urged the staff member to respect persons in her \u201ccommunity\u201d by \u201ckeep[ing] [dogs] where they belong, in their natural habitats (at home, in shelters, with breeders, etc.).\u201d Williams stated that persons \u201care not subject to animal authority nor those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>who place the life, safety, and sanctity of dogs above ours.\u201d Williams asked the staff member to balance her \u201cneed to rescue animals (dogs specifically),\u201d \u201csubject[ ] others to [her] fetish,\u201d and right to \u201cwalk [her] dogs (unquestioned) ... around the school\u201d with her responsibility to \u201ccare about faculty, staff and students\u201d who might be allergic to dogs. In closing, Williams asked the staff member to \u201crespect ... the fact that [Williams\u2019s] rights to eat, and teach in a place free of pet dander must be acknowledged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">After Eaton learned about the essay, she met with Williams. Eaton requested that Williams discuss in private his \u201cissues or concerns ... regarding staff members.\u201d Eaton also requested that Williams to \u201cshare ... important wellness issues that could cause [him] harm or threaten [his] health,\u201d and Eaton \u201cimmediately made arrangements\u201d to \u201cassign[ ] [Williams] to classrooms closely monitored\u201d to avoid the type of severe allergy attack that he had described in his essay.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">On March 30, 2009, Eaton gave Williams a \u201cletter of direction\u201d stating that his \u201cuse of Lotus Notes Email was inappropriate and unacceptable.\u201d Eaton explained that Williams\u2019s conduct \u201c[did] not project the professional, authority figure image expected of and necessary for a teacher\u201d and, although Williams had \u201ca marked improvement regarding the' expectations for following procedures for professional relationships with students and faculty since [an] April 21, 2008 conference held to review concerns presented at that time,\u201d the \u201cmisuse of the school\u2019s email address system raise[d] new concerns for this area of expectation.\u201d Nevertheless, because of Williams\u2019s \u201cimproved performance this year,\u201d Eaton gave Williams \u201can additional opportunity to demonstrate that [he][was] able to carry [his] duties and responsibilities\u201d as long as he \u201cconducted] [him]self in a professional manner at all times,\u201d refrained from making \u201cinappropriate comments to or about staff or other members of the Sweetwater community,\u201d and \u201cfollow[ed] procedures for professional relationships with faculty.\u201d Eaton stated that the violation of \u201cany one of [the] expectations\u201d would result in \u201ca recommendation to terminate [his] position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Eaton required that Williams meet with \u201cMr. Russ Fleenor our Director for Human Resources\u201d at a time \u201cdetermined by Mr. Fleenor.\u201d Eaton also instructed Williams to \u201crespond to [the] letter in writing by the end of the day on April 1, 2009, indicating that [he] understood] the[ ] directives and [was] willing to abide by them.\u201d Williams signed the letter on March 31, 2009, but Williams never responded to Eaton\u2019s letter. On April 2, 2009, Eaton sent Williams an email message that instructed him to meet with Fleenor \u201cat the Instructional Support Center on Friday, April 3, 2009 at 9:00 AM.\u201d Williams sent Eaton an email stating that he would \u201chave to contact my attorney first and see what time he will be able to make it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">On the morning of April 3, 2009, Williams reported for work, but he did not attend the meeting scheduled with Flee-nor. Afterward, Fleenor met with his supervisor, Dr. Sidney Camp, who agreed with Fleenor\u2019s recommendation to fire Williams. Later that day, Eaton escorted Williams to Fleenor\u2019s office, and Fleenor fired Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Williams argues that he was terminated in retaliation for his email essay, but even if we accept that argument as true, Williams\u2019s essay \u201ccannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern\u201d that is protected by the First Amendment. <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 1690, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). To prevail on a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of retaliation for protected speech, an employee must establish that the \u2018\u201cpurpose of [his] speech was to raise issues of public concern,\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyce v. Andrew, </em>510 F.3d 1333, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Maggio v. Sipple, </em>211 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir. 2000)), which can be discerned from the content of the speech, the audience to whom the speech is delivered, and the motivation of the speaker, <em>Mitchell v. Hillsborough Cnty., </em>468 F.3d 1276, 1283 (11th Cir.2006). The title, tenor, and audience of Williams\u2019s essay reveals that it \u201cdid not address any subject not personal to [his] working conditions\u201d at the school. <em>Boyce, </em>510 F.3d at 1344. Williams distributed to his coworkers an essay that communicated his disdain for dogs in his workplace and his personal grievance against a staff member. Williams\u2019s brief statements that students and staff might have similar allergies did \u201c \u2018not transform [his] personal grievance into a matter of public concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ferrara v. Mills, </em>781 F.2d 1508, 1516 (11th Cir.1986)); <em>see Ren-froe v. Kirkpatrick, </em>722 F.2d 714, 715 (11th Cir.1984). Because Williams\u2019s essay addressed \u201cmatters only of personal interest,\u201d we will not \u201creview the wisdom of\u2019 the decision by Gwinnett County to terminate Williams. <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 147, 103 S.Ct. at 1690.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Williams also argues that the charge of discrimination that he filed on October 1, 2009 was timely, but we disagree. To exhaust his administrative remedies, Williams was required to file a charge of discrimination within 180 days after the alleged act of discrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l); <em>Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., </em>324 F.3d 1252, 1258 (11th Cir. 2003). Williams argues that the limitations period began to run on May 21, 2009, when he received a letter from the Board of Education stating that he had been terminated, but a \u201ccollateral review of an employment decision[] does not toll the running of the limitations period[].\u201d <em>Del. State Coll. v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 261, 101 S.Ct. 498, 506, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980). The 180-day period began to run on April 3, 2009, when Fleenor fired him, and Williams included that date on his charge of discrimination. Williams\u2019s charge of discrimination was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The summary judgment against Williams\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
