Frias-Flores brought a \u00a7 1326(d) collateral attack, challenging the deportation proceeding underlying his \u00a7 1326(a) conviction as being constitutionally deficient. We find that Frias-Flores\u2019s due process rights were violated by defects in the deportation proceeding and that Frias-Flores does state a plausible claim for relief. We reverse Frias-Flores\u2019s \u00a7 1326(a) conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">To successfully challenge the underlying deportation hearing, Frias-Flores must (1) have \u201cexhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order\u201d; (2) demonstrate that \u201cthe deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review\u201d; and (3) demonstrate that \u201cthe entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">This court has held that an alien \u201cis exempted from the exhaustion bar\u201d and \u201cwas deprived of the opportunity for meaningful judicial review\u201d where the IJ \u201cdid not inform [the alien] that he was eligible for relief from deportation.\u201d <em>United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2004). Because the IJ did not inform Frias-Flores of his statutory eligibility for pre-conclusion voluntary departure before Frias-Flores waived his right to appeal, Frias-Flores has been exempted from or met the first two requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Additionally, the entry of the removal order against Frias-Flores \u201cwas fundamentally unfair\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) because (1) Frias-Flores\u2019s due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding, and (2) Frias-Flores suffered prejudice as a result of the defects. <em>See Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1048. From the record, it is clear that the IJ did not conduct the necessary evaluation of the \u201cfavorable and unfavorable factors\u201d relevant to a decision regarding pre-conclusion voluntary departure. <em>Campos-Granillo v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 849, 852 (9th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). Although the grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure is discretionary, the IJ must \u201cevaluate] all of [the favorable and unfavorable factors], assigning weight or importance to each one separately and then to all of them cumulatively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and citation omitted). The IJ did not properly weigh both favorable and unfavorable factors here. Nor did the IJ allow Frias-Flores to introduce evidence to support his claim for voluntary departure; rather, it appears from the transcript that the only evidence before the IJ when he made that decision was \u201csome conviction documents\u201d provided by the government and Frias-Flores\u2019s Notice to Appear. These defects demonstrate that the deportation proceeding underlying Fri-as-Flores\u2019s 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) conviction was constitutionally defective. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d)(3); <em>see Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Frias-Flores suffered prejudice because of the lack of due process in his deportation proceeding and that, had he been given the process required, he would have stated a \u201cplausible\u201d claim for voluntary departure. <em>Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1050. The unfavorable factors in Frias-Flores\u2019s record are counterbalanced by the moderate nature of his crimes (i.e., no convictions for drug sales or trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>or for violent crimes); his twenty-five year residence in the United States; the U.S. citizenship and residency of his wife, their ten children, his six siblings, and his parents\u2019 U.S. permanent residence; his work skills, certification, and work history, as reflected in the record by Social Security records and testimonials submitted by his immediate family that he is their \u201cso[le] provider\u201d [E.R. 123]; and his U.S. family\u2019s strong support of him [E.R. 123-153]. These favorable factors \u2014 none of which were considered by the IJ before it deprived Frias-Flores of pre-conclusion voluntary departure \u2014 render Frias-Flores\u2019s claim plausible. <em>See Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1051 (finding the alien\u2019s work ethic, U.S. citizen wife and two U.S. citizen children, substantial family ties in the U.S., and his active role in this children\u2019s lives \u201csignificant\u201d favorables).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We find that Frias-Flores\u2019s 2008 deportation order cannot be the basis of a conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and we reverse Frias-Flores\u2019s conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
