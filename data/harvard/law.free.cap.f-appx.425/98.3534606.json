Thompson brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking to reverse or reopen his prior unsuccessful application for Social Security disability benefits. He now appeals from an order of the District Court denying his motion for recusal and dismissing his complaint for lack of jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-23\">On April 15, 1996, Thompson filed a claim for disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and Supplemental Security Income under the Social Security Act. His applications were denied initially, and upon reconsideration by an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who issued a decision denying his applications on December 23, 1998. On February 20, 1999, Thompson requested review of the decision by the Appeals Council. On September 11, 1999, while his appeal was pending, Thompson filed another application for DIB. His second application was denied on December 14, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-24\">On January 28, 2000, Thompson brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking judicial review of the denial of his claims for DIB. Because the Appeals Council had not yet rendered a final decision for either of Thompson\u2019s claims, the District Court dismissed Thompson\u2019s request for judicial review for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court also rejected Thompson\u2019s claim that his due process rights had been violated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the agency. We affirmed. <em>See Thompson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>281 F.3d 224 (3d Cir.2001) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">On January 31, 2002, the Appeals Council denied Thompson\u2019s request for review. Thompson then commenced a second civil <em>action </em>in the District Court seeking judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s December 23, 1998 decision. See D.N.J. No. 02-cv-01150. The District Court affirmed the agency\u2019s decision. We affirmed the decision of the District Court. <em>Thompson v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>112 Fed.Appx. 868 (3d Cir.2004) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On September 14, 2009, Thompson commenced the civil action upon which his present appeal is based, seeking to reverse the denial of his prior claims, or to reopen his claims and/or remand his claims for a further hearing. He alleges that the Social Security Administration\u2019s prior decisions were not based on substantial evidence and that the ALJ and the District Court violated his due process rights. Compl. \u00b6 3-4, 6. He also alleges that he has new evidence supporting his claim for disability. Compl. \u00b6 1-2. The Commissioner of Social Security moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that (1) the District Court lacked jurisdiction to reopen a final decision of the Commissioner, and (2) Thompson\u2019s attacks on the agency\u2019s prior decisions were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On December 3, 2009, Thompson moved for District Judge Peter G. Sheridan to remove himself for bias, prejudice, obstruction of justice, civil rights violations, and criminal activities, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455. On July 8, 2010, Judge Sheridan held a hearing on Thompson\u2019s motion for recusal and the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ruling from the bench, the District Court denied Thompson\u2019s recusal motion and dismissed his complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will summarily affirm if Thompson\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss Thompson\u2019s complaint on the basis of res judicata. <em>See Elkadrawy v. Vanguard Grp., Inc., </em>584 F.3d 169, 172 (3d Cir.2009). We review a judge\u2019s decision not to recuse, under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 or \u00a7 455, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Jones v. Pittsburgh Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>899 F.2d 1350, 1356 (3d Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">We first address Thompson\u2019s appeal of the District Judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself based on Thompson\u2019s allegations of bias and prejudice. Under \u00a7 144, a judge must recuse if a party files a \u201csufficient affidavit\u201d establishing that the judge has a personal bias or prejudice against the party seeking recusal, or in favor of the adverse party. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144; <em>see also Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1356. Under \u00a7 455, a judge must recuse where the judge\u2019s impartiality \u201cmight reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). After a careful and independent review of the record, we find nothing in it to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that the District Judge in Thompson\u2019s case was personally biased against him under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, or that a reasonable person would \u201charbor doubts concerning the judge\u2019s impartiality\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Thompson\u2019s allegations of prejudice relate to two prior occasions when Thompson appeared before Judge Sheridan, and Judge Sheridan issued adverse rulings against him, both having to do with Thompson\u2019s inability to practice law without a license. We agree with the District Court that Thompson\u2019s allegations amounted to mere disagreement with the court\u2019s adverse rulings, which does not form a sufficient basis for recusal under \u00a7 144 or \u00a7 455(a). <em>See Securacomm, </em>224 F.3d at 278. Moreover, we find nothing in the record to suggest that Judge Sheridan has developed \u201ca deep-seated favoritism or antagonism\u201d toward Thompson that would \u201cmake fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). In short, we discern no abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion in the denial of Thompson\u2019s recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We next address whether the District Court erred in dismissing Thompson\u2019s complaint, which sought to reopen or overturn the denial of his prior claims for benefits under the Social Security Act. To the extent that Thompson\u2019s complaint seeks to reopen a final decision of the Commissioner, our precedent is clear that the District Court has no authority under Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act to do so. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), (h); <em>see also Tobak v. Apfel, </em>195 F.3d 183, 187 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201cIt is well settled that federal courts lack jurisdiction under \u00a7 205 to review the Commissioner\u2019s discretionary decision to decline to reopen a prior application or to deny a subsequent application on res judicata ground.\u201d) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Social Security Act does provide that the District Court may remand a matter to the Commissioner based on new and material evidence, provided there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence in the prior proceeding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>see also Szubak v. Sec\u2019y of Health, &amp; Human Servs., </em>745 F.2d 831, 833 (3d Cir.1984). Here, the \u201cnew evidence\u201d Thompson seeks to introduce is evidence that his condition has worsened in the time since the Commissioner denied Thompson\u2019s prior claim. This is not \u201cnew\u201d evidence under \u00a7 405(g) because it is not evidence that was available for consideration at the time the Commissioner rendered the challenged decision. Such evidence does not relate to the time period for which benefits were denied, nor is it material to the decision the Commissioner arrived at ten years ago. <em>Szubak, </em>745 F.2d at 833 (noting that an implicit materiality requirement is that the new evidence \u201cnot concern evidence of a later acquired disability or of the subsequent deterioration of the previously non-disabling condition\u201d). Therefore, there is no basis to disturb the Commissioner\u2019s prior decision based on Thompson\u2019s proffered new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Nor is this \u201cone of those rare instances where the Secretary\u2019s denial of a petition to reopen is challenged on constitutional grounds.\u201d <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 109, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>see also Penner v. Schweiker, </em>701 F.2d 256, 260 (3d Cir.1983). In the first instance, this civil action does not arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>from the denial of a petition to reopen. Further, Thompson did not raise any constitutional issues before the District Court that were not barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Thompson\u2019s claims in the present suit \u2014 that the Commissioner\u2019s prior denial of benefits was not supported by substantial evidence and that the agency violated his due process rights \u2014 are essentially identical to those made in his prior suits. These claims were litigated between the same parties, and a final decision was reached on the merits. <em>See Thompson, </em>112 Fed.Appx. at 868 (affirming District Court\u2019s decision affirming Commissioner\u2019s final decision to deny Thompson\u2019s claim for Social Security benefits); <em>Thompson, </em>281 F.3d at 224 (affirming the District Court\u2019s decision rejecting Thompson\u2019s due process claim after finding no evidence of bad faith, dilatory motive, or lack of even handedness on the part of the agency). Thus, the District Court was correct to dismiss these claims as barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See Elkadrawy, </em>584 F.3d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Because this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. Appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file a response in excess of the page limitation is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. Thompson was informed of the hearing but did not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-15\">. The Commissioner took no position on Thompson\u2019s recusal motion before the District Court, and does not address the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">. At the outset, Thompson has never asked the agency to reopen his claim. Regardless, even assuming that this action arose from an agency denial, the District Court is not permitted to review a decision by the agency not to reopen. <em>See Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107-08, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Tobak, </em>195 F.3d at 187.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
