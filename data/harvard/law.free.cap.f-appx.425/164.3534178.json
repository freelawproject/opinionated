We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b188-24\">Because we write for the parties, we recite only the essential facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-25\">In May 2004, Curran had bilateral artificial hip prostheses surgically implanted. According to Curran, after the surgery the prostheses failed, resulting in pain and limited motion in her hip joints. In December 2007, Curran sued Howmedica Os-teonics Corp.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the manufacturer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>prostheses, in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County asserting product liability and negligence claims. Howmedi-ca removed Curran\u2019s suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Howmedica gave notice of the removal to Curran\u2019s counsel, Michael J. Flanagan, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Four years before the case was removed, in January 2004, Flanagan registered with the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\u2019s electronic case filing (ECF) system and consented to receive electronic filings pursuant to Local Rule 51.2(8). On September 3, 2008, Howmedica filed a motion to dismiss Curran\u2019s complaint. Service of the motion was properly made on Flanagan via the ECF system. Because Flanagan failed to respond to Howmedica\u2019s motion, the District Court dismissed Curran\u2019s complaint with prejudice on October 9, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">According to Flanagan, on October 20, 2008, he went to the Clerk\u2019s Office to inquire about the status of the action and discovered that the complaint had been dismissed. Flanagan contacted Kim Ca-tullo, Howmedica\u2019s counsel, and claimed that he had not received notice of Howmedica\u2019s motion to dismiss. Catullo responded that Howmedica\u2019s motion had been filed electronically and that court records indicated that Flanagan had received notice of the motion via e-mail on the day it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Flanagan took no further action until October 8, 2009 \u2014 364 days after Curran\u2019s complaint had been dismissed \u2014 at which time he filed a motion for relief from dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1). Therein, Flanagan averred that he had not received notice of Howmedica\u2019s motion to dismiss and argued that this \u201ctechnological failure\u201d constituted excusable neglect sufficient for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1). The District Court denied the motion for relief, reasoning that Rule 60(b) motions must be filed within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d and that Flanagan had not provided any explanation for the 364-day delay between dismissal of Curran\u2019s suit and the motion for relief. Alternatively, the Court held that Curran failed to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances necessary for relief. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Reform Party of Allegheny Cnty. v. Allegheny Cnty. Dept. of Elections, </em>174 F.3d 305, 311 (3d Cir.1999). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found when \u2018the district court\u2019s decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Int'l Union, UAW v. Mack Trucks, Inc., </em>820 F.2d 91, 95 (3d Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">\u201cRule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances including fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Gonzalez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 528, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). \u201cThe general purpose of Rule 60 ... is to strike a proper balance between the conflicting principles that litigation must be brought to an end and that justice must be done.\u201d <em>Boughner v. Sec\u2019y of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, </em>572 F.2d 976, 977 (3d Cir.1978). Because parties have a strong interest in the finality of judgments, \u201c[tjhis Court has ... cautioned that relief from a judgment under Rule 60 should be granted only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">On appeal, Flanagan essentially repeats the arguments he presented to the District Court. His principal argument emphasizes the alleged inequity of the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Curran\u2019s complaint with prejudice. This argument contravenes the rule that \u201can appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Moreover, appellant\u2019s brief fails entirely to address the District Court\u2019s primary reason for denying the motion for relief, <em>i.e., </em>the extensive delay between the time Flanagan learned of the dismissal of Curran\u2019s complaint and the filing of his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">As the District Court correctly noted, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require motions for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) to be made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1) (\u201cA motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time \u2014 and ... no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d). The one-year limitation serves as an outer bound, and establishes that motions filed within one year are <em>ipso facto </em>reasonable. Here, according to Flanagan, 353 days passed between the day he first learned of the dismissal of Curran\u2019s complaint and the day he filed the motion for relief. On appeal, Flanagan neither offers any explanation for his dilatory conduct, nor even acknowledges that this delay formed the basis for the District Court\u2019s holding. His failure to do so is, unfortunately for Cur-ran, fatal to her appeal. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\">. In her complaint, Curran listed Howmedica Osteonics Corp.; Stryker Corp.; Stryker Instruments; Stryker Orthopaedics; and Stryker Howmedica Osteonics Corp. as separate defendants. According to Stryker's corporate disclosure statement, Howmedica Osteonics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stryker Corporation. Stryker Instruments and Stryker Orthopaedics are not separate corporate entities, but rather are operating divisions within Stryker Corp. and Howmedica, respectively. For ease of exposition, we will refer to the defendants collectively as Howmedica.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\"><em>. </em>The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.
