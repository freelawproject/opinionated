We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Ghahre-mani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2007), we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">The BIA abused its discretion by refusing to equitably toll the time and number bars for Shams\u2019s motion to reopen despite his demonstrated due diligence in discovering and attempting to redress the ineffectiveness of his former attorneys. <em>See id. </em>at 999-1000 (petitioner showed due diligence where he \u201cdemonstrated a steadfast pursuit of his case\u201d even while being represented by deficient counsel, and quickly filed a motion to reopen after retaining competent counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-24\">We therefore grant the petition for review and remand to the BIA for consideration of the merits of Shams\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
