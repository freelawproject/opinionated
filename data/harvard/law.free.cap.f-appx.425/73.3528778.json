POOLER, RICHARD C. WESLEY, DEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b98-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Appellants John-Joseph Forjone and Christopher Earl Strunk, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the complaint raising various claims related to the National Voter Registration Act (\u201cNVRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973gg <em>et seq., </em>and the Help America Vote Act (\u201cHAVA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15301 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">As a threshold matter, we lack jurisdiction over Strunk\u2019s appeal. A notice of appeal must \u201cspecify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice.... \u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(A). Forjone\u2019s timely notice of appeal was not filed on behalf of Strunk, as it did not reference Strunk or even \u201cplaintiffs\u201d more generally, and was signed by Forjone only. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(2) (\u201cA pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer ... unless the notice clearly indicates otherwise.\u201d). Additionally, the amended notice of appeal that was filed on behalf of Strunk was untimely, as it was filed over 60 days after entry of the judgment and over 14 days after Forjone\u2019s timely notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) and 4(a)(3). The requirements set forth in Fed. RApp. P. 3 and 4 are jurisdictional in nature and may not be waived. <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 317, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988). Strunk\u2019s appeal is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, leaving Forjone as the only remaining appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">II. The District Court\u2019s Venue Transfer Order</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">In his brief, Forjone challenges the order issued by the district court for the Western District <em>of </em>New York transferring the case to the district court for the Northern District of New York. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), \u201c[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d \u201cThe determination whether to grant a change of venue requires a balancing of conveniences, which is left to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Filmline (Cross-Country) Productions, Inc. v. United Artists Corp., </em>865 F.2d 513, 520 (2d Cir.1989). \u201cThat discretion will not be disturbed upon appeal without a clear showing of abuse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in transferring the case to the Northern District of New York on the ground that a substantially similar case, <em>Loeber v. Spargo, </em>N.D.N.Y. No. 04-cv-1193 (N.D.N.Y. July 31, 2008) (E.C.F. No. 109), had been previously filed and was pending in that District. As compared to the instant action, the action in <em>Loeber </em>was brought by several of the same plaintiffs against several of the same defendants and involved substantially similar claims. Under these circumstances, the district court reasonably concluded that hearing the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>actions in the same district would be more efficient and convenient for both the court and the parties, and would minimize the risk of reaching inconsistent results.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">III. Decision By a Single Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Forjone also challenges the district court\u2019s decision not to hear the case before a three-judge panel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284. Under that section, \u201c[a] district court of three judges shall be convened ... when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284. Although Section 2284 is jurisdictional, \u201cit has long been held that a single judge may dismiss a claim that must normally be heard by a three judge court if it is \u2018insubstantial.\u2019\u201d <em>Kalson v. Paterson, </em>542 F.3d 281, 287 (2d Cir.2008) (collecting cases). The Supreme Court has described an \u201cinsubstantial\u201d claim in this context as one \u201cobviously without merit or clearly concluded by [the Supreme Court\u2019s] previous decisions.\u201d <em>McLucas v. De Champlain, </em>421 U.S. 21, 28, 95 S.Ct. 1365, 43 L.Ed.2d 699 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Here, although the district court did not explicitly deny the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a three-judge panel, we affirm the implicit denial of that request on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were insubstantial. <em>See Freedom, Holdings, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>624 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir.2010) (\u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground appearing in the record.\u201d). To the limited extent that their claims were comprehensible, the plaintiffs appeared to object to the manner in which federal funds were distributed to states under HAVA. However, the plaintiffs have not identified any right of action that would entitle them to act on behalf of the federal government, the State of New York, or any other state in this context. <em>See Sandusky County Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>387 F.3d 565, 572 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cHAVA does not itself create a private right of action.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court was not required to hear the case before a three-judge panel pursuant to 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">IV. Decision Granting the Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for lack of standing pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., </em>584 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir. 2009). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a) for abuse of discretion. <em>See Simmons v. Abruzzo, </em>49 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.1995). Having conducted an independent review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its well-reasoned decision. Forjone has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dispositive order by failing to raise such a challenge in his brief. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir. 1995). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
