Martinez\u2019s petition for review as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-30\">On October 22, 2010, an administrative judge issued an initial decision, affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>OPM\u2019s denial of Martinez\u2019s claims, and notifying Martinez that, absent an appeal to the Board, the decision would become final on November 26, 2010. The Board further informed Martinez that any petition for review must be received by this court within 60 calendar days of the date the initial decision became final. Martinez did not appeal the initial decision to the Board. Martinez\u2019s petition for review was received by the court on January 27, 2011, 62 days after the Board\u2019s decision became final on November 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">A petition for review must be received by the court within 60 days of receipt of notice of the Board\u2019s final order. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). To be timely filed, the petition must be received by this court on or before the date that the petition is due. <em>Pinat v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>931 F.2d 1544, 1546 (Fed.Cir.1991) (petition is filed when received by this court; court dismissed petition received nine days late).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Because Martinez\u2019s petition was not timely received by this court, it must be dismissed based on controlling precedent of this court. <em>See Oja v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>405 F.3d 1349, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2005) (\u201cSeeing no specific authorization for the equitable tolling of section 7703(b)(1), we find that the congressionally approved statements of Rules 15(a)(1) and 26(b)(2) require the conclusion first reached in <em>Monzo </em>and herein followed. Compliance with the filing deadline for 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) is a prerequisite to our exercise of jurisdiction over this case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">(1) OPM\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
