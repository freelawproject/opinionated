STRAUB, REENA RAGGI, and RICHARD C. WESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Defendant Jason Torres, who stands convicted on a guilty plea of unlawful possession of a firearm following a felony conviction, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), challenges his 77-month Guidelines-range sentence, faulting the district court for failing to award him a two-level minor-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. We assume familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Torres contends that whether he was entitled to a minor role adjustment is a question of legal interpretation of the Guidelines that is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6 (citing <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir.2001)). As the government observes, \u201cthis circuit has not always been consistent in describing the standard of review for role adjustments,\u201d variously indicating that abuse of discretion, <em>de novo, </em>or clear error review is applicable. <em>United States v. Labbe, </em>588 F.3d 139, 145 n. 2 (2d Cir.2009) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 7-8. We need not resolve this question here, because our analysis would reach the same result regardless of the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">A defendant seeking a two-point offense-level reduction under \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) bears the burden of demonstrating that he is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in the crime of conviction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A); <em>see United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d at 234. Torres contends that he qualified for a minor-role adjustment because he possessed the firearm in question only briefly, in the course of acting as an intermediary in the sale of the firearm to an undercover agent. The district court considered Torres\u2019s argument and carefully explained why it rejected it. Specifically, the court found that Torres was \u201cmore than just a possessor\u201d of the charged firearm; he was more even than just a \u201cdelivery person.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 26. He was \u201cthe person who set up the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, he was \u201cintricately involved\u201d in the sale transaction, <em>id. </em>at 24, acting as a \u201cbroker\u201d and thereby giving \u201ccomfort\u201d to both the gun seller and the gun buyer that in \u201ca couple of trips and a couple of phone calls\u201d he could finalize their illicit exchange, <em>id. </em>at 26-27. Upon an independent review of the record, we conclude that these facts support the denial of a minor-role adjustment and imposition of the challenged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">We have considered Torres\u2019s other arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
