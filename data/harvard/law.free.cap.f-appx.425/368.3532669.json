He further asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u00a7 4B1.1 is not empirically based and thus not entitled to deference or a presumption of reasonableness on appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Because Garza failed to object in the district court to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007). To prevail, Garza must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes the required showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Even if the career offender guideline lacks an empirical basis, a presumption of reasonableness still applies to Garza\u2019s sentence on appellate review. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.) (rejecting notion that this court should examine the empirical basis behind each Guideline before applying the presumption of reasonableness), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Garza has failed to rebut this presumption. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). His \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The district court considered Garza\u2019s arguments for a below-guidelines sentence. In rejecting the arguments, the court expressed its awareness that the Guidelines produced a range that was only advisory, considered the circumstances of Garza\u2019s prior controlled substance offenses, but noted Garza\u2019s extensive history in drug trafficking and the amount of drugs involved in the instant offense. With explicit reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court determined that a sentence within the advisory sentencing guidelines range was indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Garza has shown no clear or obvious error. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
