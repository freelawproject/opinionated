Kazakova argues on appeal that she and her family experienced past persecution on account of their Russian heritage, and that the BIA impermissibly engaged in <em>de novo </em>fact finding. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 408 F.3d </em>1361, 1368 (11th Cir. 2005). We review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2003). We defer to the agency\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of its own regulations unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Mu-humed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). Under the substantial evidence test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will not reverse a factual determination unless \u201cthe record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Whether an alien has proved persecution is a factual determination that we review under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), the BIA shall not \u201cengage in <em>de novo </em>review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The BIA may only review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations to assess whether those determinations were clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts, the BIA is not permitted to engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). However, the BIA \u201cmay review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(h). The BIA reviews <em>de novo </em>whether the established facts amount to past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>Matter of A-S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008). In determining whether established facts are sufficient to meet a legal standard, the BIA \u201cis entitled to weigh the evidence in a manner different from that accorded by the [IJ], or to conclude that the foundation for the [IJ\u2019s] legal conclusions was insufficient or otherwise not supported by the evidence of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily protected ground will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. An applicant for asylum who has established past persecution on a protected ground is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">If the alien \u201ccannot show past persecution, then the petitioner must demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be proved by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution, while the objective component can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he or she has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The term persecution is not defined in the INA or accompanying federal regulations, but we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted). We have held that \u201c[mjinor physical abuse\u201d does not amount to persecution. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009). However, we also have rejected a rigid physical injury requirement, noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>that we will consider the cumulative impact of mistreatment, which considered alone, may not amount to persecution. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 525 </em>F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerrillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. In addition, \u201cemployment discrimination which stops short of depriving an individual of a means of earning a living does not constitute persecution.\u201d <em>Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>275 F.3d 1334, 1340 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that, although petitioner suffered employment discrimination, lost his job as a taxi driver, and was forced to take menial work, he was not persecuted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">In this case, the BIA considered the evidence submitted in support of Kazakova\u2019s asylum application and found that she had failed to present facts that legally amounted to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. As the record shows, the BIA did not engage in factfinding but, rather, considered <em>de novo </em>whether the facts in the record, including those incidents alleged in Kazakova\u2019s credible testimony, amounted to persecution on account of a protect ground, which was within its purview to do. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); <em>Matter of A-S-B-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 496. In addition, the BIA was entitled to re-weigh the evidence as it did, to conclude that Kazakova\u2019s evidence was insufficient to meet her burden of proof to establish a fear of future persecution. <em>Matter of A-S-B-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 497. Thus, the importance that the BIA placed on portions of a professor\u2019s testimony over others was not impermissible \u201ccherry picking\u201d of facts by the BIA, and the BIA did not err in its <em>de novo </em>consideration of whether Kazakova\u2019s evidence met the legal standard of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Kazakova failed to establish past persecution. Specifically, with regard to the attack on her husband on the street and the attack on her daughter by classmates, the record does not demonstrate that these incidents were more than isolated acts and, therefore, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237. The attacks, while reprehensible, also were not as severe as other instances of oppressive acts that we have held to constitute persecution. <em>See Mejia v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that threats and attempted attacks over an 18-month period, culminating in an attack at gunpoint during which FARC members threatened the petitioner and broke his nose with the butt of a rifle, constituted persecution); <em>Niftaliev v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that numerous beatings, arrests, searches and interrogations, culminating in a 15-day detention, cumulatively constituted past persecution); <em>see also Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353 (stating that minor physical abuse does not amount to persecution). In addition, the record indicates that these attacks were private acts of violence, which generally do not amount to persecution. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Similarly, although Kazakova could not find employment as a fashion designer, she was able to find other work, such that the alleged employment discrimination did not constitute persecution. <em>See Barreto-Claro, </em>275 F.3d at 1340. Accordingly, taking Kazakova\u2019s allegations in the aggregate, substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners had not demonstrated past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Likewise, Kazakova did not sufficiently establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Kazakova left Estonia in 1999. The government offered evidence from the 2008 Country Report, which indicated that there was no pattern of human rights abuses against ethnic Russians in Estonia, and that acts of violence between the ethnic groups were infrequent. Since the BIA was entitled to rely heavily on the country report, the evidence does not compel a reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision that Kazakova did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that the BIA is entitled to rely heavily on country reports, and that the substantial evidence test does not allow us to reweigh the importance to be placed on a particular country report). All told, the record does not compel the conclusion that Kazakova demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
