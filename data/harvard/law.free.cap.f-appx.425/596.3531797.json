R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b620-19\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">Harcharan Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order summarily affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decisions affirming the agency\u2019s termination of Singh\u2019s conditional residency status and denying Singh\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Damon v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh\u2019s conditional residency status was properly terminated and Singh was subject to removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a, where Singh\u2019s citizen-spouse disclosed she divorced her husband to marry Singh, her ex-husband\u2019s brother, for immigration purposes, and the marriage was not consummated. <em>See Damon, </em>360 F.3d at 1089 (test for a bona fide marriage is whether the couple intended to establish a life together at the time they were married); <em>see also Bark v. INS, </em>511 F.2d 1200, 1201-02 (9th Cir.1975) (conduct of parties after marriage is relevant to show intent at time of marriage).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In addition, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh\u2019s experiences in India, including one detention and mistreatment by Indian police, did not constitute persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-21 (9th Cir. 2006). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Singh failed to establish he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005) (evidence did not compel finding that petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Because Singh failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
