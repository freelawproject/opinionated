In a separate opinion, we address two issues: (1) Raytheon\u2019s contention that we lack jurisdiction over Zeinali\u2019s employment discrimination claims and (2) the merits of Zeinali\u2019s discrimination claim with respect to his termination from employment with Raytheon. We now address the parties\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">I. Failure to Promote</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">The record does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Zeinali was not promoted because he lacked a security clearance. Rather, Raytheon contends that Zeinali was not promoted because he was not among the top quartile of his peer group. The record, examined in a light most favorable to Zeinali, shows that Zei-nali was offered a promotion. Zeinali has accordingly raised a triable issue of fact to dispute Raytheon\u2019s contentions that (1) he was not qualified for a promotion and (2) Raytheon had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for not promoting him. <em>See Guz v. Bechtel Nat\u2019l Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1113-14 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">Because the district court did not address Raytheon\u2019s contention that Zeinali\u2019s failure-to-promote claim is time-barred, we refrain from addressing that issue here. <em>See Golden Gate Hotel Ass\u2019n v. City &amp; Cnty. of S.F., </em>18 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cAs a general rule, a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">II. Discovery Order</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">Contrary to the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusions (which were adopted in relevant part by the district court), Zeinali has shown that his co-workers were similarly situated in all material respects for purposes of his failure-to-promote claim. Raytheon\u2019s promotion policies required employees to be in the top quartile of their pay grade cohort, and Zeinali claims that his quartile ranking was inaccurate. Although Zeinali did not share the same job titles and duties as the other E04-grade employees, they were his competition for promotions. Thus, they are similarly situated for purposes of the failure-to-promote claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">In addition, there is no evidence in the record to support the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Zeinali conceded that his failure-to-promote claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse and remand the orders of the district court and magistrate judge denying Zeinali\u2019s request to obtain the job performance records of his coworkers. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). We leave to the district court\u2019s discretion whether to require redaction of identifying information.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">III. California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The parties agree that the district court analyzed Zeinali\u2019s California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5 claim under subsection (b) rather than subsection (c) as is alleged in the Complaint. We vacate and remand this cause of action so that the district court may analyze it under the relevant subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">IV. Tortious Termination in Violation of Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">As pleaded in his Complaint, Zeinali\u2019s cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is premised on the same facts as his unlawful discrimination and Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5 claims. <em>See Tameny v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>27 Cal.3d 167, 164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 1336-37 (1980) (recognizing cause of action for employee terminated after refusing to participate in illegal activity); <em>Phillips v. St. Mary Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>96 Cal.App.4th 218, 116 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 779 (2002) (recognizing cause of action for employee terminated on account of race). Because we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s order with respect to the unlawful discrimination and Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5 causes of action, we do the same with respect to the tortious termination in violation of public policy cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">V. Leave to Amend the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Zeinali\u2019s proposed amendment \u201cwould prejudice Defendant substantially,\u201d would \u201cprevent the efficient resolution of [the] case,\u201d and contained causes of action that could have been alleged at the time of Zeinali\u2019s initial Complaint. These reasons, are valid grounds for denying leave to amend. <em>See, e.g., AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Dialysist West, Inc., </em>465 F.3d 946, 953 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that eight month delay before seeking amendment is unreasonable, particularly where plaintiff could have pleaded the new \u201ctheory in its original complaint\u201d); <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 980, 986 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that motion to amend was properly denied where it was filed at end of discovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">VI. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">We REVERSE AND REMAND with respect to the discovery order and the failure-to-promote, California Labor Code \u00a7 1102.5, and tortious termination in violation of public policy causes of action. We AFFIRM with respect to the \u2022 denial of leave to amend the complaint. Costs are awarded to Zeinali.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
