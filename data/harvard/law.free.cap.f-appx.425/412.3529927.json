Zapata asserts that his sentence was higher than necessary to achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Because Zapata did not raise his objections in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Zapata has failed to show clear or obvious error regarding the length of his sentence. The record reflects that the district court properly weighed numerous \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing Zapata\u2019s 100-month sentence. We have affirmed similar departures and variances. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 717, 723-24 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 491-93 &amp; n. 40 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Zapata\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">We note that the supplemental brief submitted by Zapata\u2019s assigned counsel, Wayne Frost, also raises a number of patently frivolous claims: (1) that the district court erred in basing the sentence on Zapata\u2019s particular characteristics and personal history, rather than strictly on his offense \u2014 under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court is <em>required </em>to consider the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; (2) that the district court did not give Zapata notice that it was considering an upward departure \u2014 the district court\u2019s Statement of Reasons made it clear that it was imposing a \u201csentence outside of the advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>guideline[s],\u201d and not an upward departure requiring prior notice; and (3) that the sentence constitutes a due process violation \u2014 Mr. Frost provides no supporting argument, legal authority, or record citations to support this assertion. Mr. Frost has clearly failed to comply with this court\u2019s previous order to file a \u201csupplemental brief that adequately covers the issues in the case in the form required by Fed. R.App. R. 28(a) and that employs legal analysis to support each request for relief.\u201d Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that no payment be made to Mr. Frost for the time spent working on this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
