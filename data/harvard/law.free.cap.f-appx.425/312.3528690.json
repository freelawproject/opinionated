The district court denied Williams\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving to proceed IFP, Williams is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants and dismissed Williams\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint after determining that the complaint was not timely filed because Williams knew the basis of his claim in 1991 and, at the very latest, in 2006, and he did not file his complaint until 2009. In Louisiana, a prisoner has one year from the event(s) complained of in which to bring a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Elzy v. Roberson, </em>868 F.2d 793, 794-95 (5th Cir.1989). A \u00a7 1983 claim accrues \u201cwhen [a] plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Lavellee v. Listi, </em>611 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1980) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">Williams now argues that the one-year limitations period should not apply to his complaint because he has been incarcerated since 1972, which he contends is prior to the limitations period\u2019s enactment and thus makes the limitations period impermissibly retroactive as applied to his complaint. However, even if Williams\u2019s retro-activity argument had merit, prior to 1972 Louisiana had a one-year limitations period for tort actions, and civil rights actions borrowed the forum state\u2019s limitations period. <em>E.g., Huson v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>430 F.2d 27, 32 (5th Cir.1970); La. Civ.Code art. 3536 (1971) (moved in 1984 to La. Civ.Code art. 3492).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Williams makes no further argument with respect to the district court\u2019s determination that his complaint was untimely. As Williams has not demonstrated that his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, his request for IFP is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of the instant appeal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Williams is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
