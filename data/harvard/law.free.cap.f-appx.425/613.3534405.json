The plaintiffs argue that the fines they received for these infractions exceed limits set by Revised Code of Washington section 46.63.170 and that payment provisions in the cities\u2019 contracts with the camera companies violate statutory restrictions on the form of compensation. They also contend the defendant cities should have had the Notices of Infraction (NOIs) used to issue the camera citations approved by the Washington Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The plaintiffs sued in state court, and the defendants removed to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The fines the defendant cities charge for infractions captured on traffic safety cameras do not exceed limits imposed by section 46.63.170. Under section 46.63.170(2), \u201cthe amount of the fine issued for an infraction generated through the use of an automated traffic safety camera shall not exceed the amount of a fine issued for other parking infractions within the jurisdiction.\u201d Here, the camera fines plainly do not exceed the fines imposed for certain other parking infractions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Wash. Rev.Code. \u00a7 46.16.381(7)-(9) ($250 fine for disabled parking); Seattle, Wash., Mun.Code \u00a7 11.31.121 (same). They are therefore within statutory limits. Nothing in the statute limits camera fines to the amount charged for \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d parking infractions, or to the amount charged for infractions authorized solely by local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">Because the plain language of section 46.63.170(2) unambiguously authorizes the fines the defendants impose, we are precluded from considering the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the legislative history compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See State ex rel. Evergreen Freedom Found, v. Wash. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>140 Wash.2d 615, 999 P.2d 602, 611 (2000) (\u201cWhen words in a statute are plain and unambiguous, this Court is required to assume the Legislature meant what it said and apply the statute as written.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">The district court also correctly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to two types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>compensation provisions in the contracts between the defendant cities and camera companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The plaintiffs first challenge the \u201cstop-loss\u201d or \u201ccost neutrality\u201d provisions that allow the cities to delay payment of any fees greater than the amount of revenues generated by citations that month until revenues exceed monthly fee obligations. The plaintiffs argue that these provisions violate the statutory directive that \u201cthe compensation paid ... must be based only upon the value of the equipment and services provided ..., and may not be based upon a portion of the fine or civil penalty imposed or the revenue generated by the equipment.\u201d Wash. Rev. Code. \u00a7 46.63.170(1)\u00a9. We disagree. The cost neutrality provisions alter the timing of fee payments in accordance with monthly revenue fluctuations, but they do not base the amount of fees upon a <em>portion </em>of the revenue generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We likewise reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that supplemental fee provisions in some of the defendants\u2019 contracts constitute fees improperly \u201cbased upon a portion of ... the revenue generated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The relevant provisions obligate certain cities to pay a $5 service fee per citation issued above the first 800 citations per camera per month. These fees are permissible because they constitute \u201ccompensation ... based ... upon the value of the ... services provided or rendered in support of the system.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The plaintiffs next argue the NOIs the cities issued to them violate statutory rules for approval of such notices. Under Revised Code of Washington section 46.63.060(2) and Infraction Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (IRLJ) 2.1(a), \u201cthe form used to file cases alleging the commission of a parking, standing or stopping infraction shall be approved by the Administrative Office of the Courts.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that because section 46.63.170(2) requires that camera infractions \u201cbe processed in the same manner as parking infractions,\u201d the NOIs generated for camera infractions must receive AOC approval in accordance with the IRLJ 2.1(a) command that NOIs \u201calleging the commission of a parking, standing or stopping infraction\u201d be AOC-approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">We reject this argument for two reasons. First, we agree with the district court that section 46.63.170(2)\u2019s directive that camera infractions \u201cbe processed in the same manner as parking infractions\u201d must be construed in light of the accompanying list of purposes for which camera infractions are processed like parking infractions. All of the provisions listed concern aspects of post-infraction procedure rather than initial notification. <em>See </em>Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.63.170(2), 3.50.100, 35.20.220, 46.16.216, 46.20.270(3). Second, section 46.63.170(l)(e) explicitly addresses the form and content of camera infraction notices, suggesting that the legislature expressed relevant restrictions on camera NOIs in this provision alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Finally, we decline to address the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the use of traffic cameras at three-arterial intersections or their claim that the defendants use \u201cfaulty traffic camera system technology.\u201d These claims were not articulated in the briefing on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and are therefore waived on appeal. <em>See Walsh v. Nev. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>471 F.3d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the merits, we do not address the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>contention that the claims are barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The district court correctly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the defendants\u2019 camera fine amounts, compensation arrangements and camera infraction NOIs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The order granting the motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED. The defendants\u2019 motion for judicial notice is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\">. We do not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the district court should have remanded this case to state court under CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A). The plaintiffs forfeited this argument by not raising it in the district court, <em>see Hillis v. Heine-man, </em>626 F.3d 1014, 1019 (9th Cir.2010), and the potential applicability of the local controversy exception does not undermine the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Serrano v. 180 Connect, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 1018, 1022-24 (9th Cir.2007) (\"Implicit in ... subsection[] [1332](d)(4) is that the court <em>has </em>jurisdiction, but the court ... must decline to exercise such jurisdiction.\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
