Moots, a state prisoner, appeals <em>pro se </em>the dismissal of his complaint that prison officials Walter McNeil, Sandeep Rahangdale, Tammy Blankenship, and Larry Baker violated his civil rights under the Eighth Amendment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court ruled that the prison officials had not been deliberately indifferent to Moots\u2019s medical condition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Moots\u2019s complaint fails to allege that he has a serious medical condition or, even assuming that his condition is serious, that prison officials have been indifferent to Moots\u2019s medical needs. After Moots was imprisoned, he was diagnosed with gyneco-mastia, a condition that causes an enlargement of male breast tissue. Moots \u201creceived medical test[s] to determine\u201d if \u201cthere [had been] an underlying cause for his condition\u201d and if he had cancer, but the tests revealed Moots\u2019s gynecomastia requires only cosmetic treatment. Moots\u2019s \u201c \u2018medical need [is not] one that, if left unattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mann v. Taser Intern., Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1307 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003)). Moots has received ibuprofen for pain and \u201cpsychiatric treatment\u201d to combat his \u201cemotional suffering, depression, anxiety,\u201d and problems with his self-image, and prison officials have housed him in a segregation unit to prevent any potential mistreatment by fellow inmates. Moots requested a mastectomy, but prison officials required that Moots first undergo a mammogram, which Moots refused. Moots\u2019s disagreement with the course of treatment provided by the prison officials does not \u201csupport a claim of cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Thig-pen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">The dismissal of Moots\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
