On appeal, Wallace asserts the district court erred in applying a two-level obstruction enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 because his trial testimony was truthful in material respects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm Wallace\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">To obtain a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice at sentencing, the burden is on the Government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed ... the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; <em>see also United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 572 (11th Cir. 2010) (\u201cThe government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement.\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">For sentencing purposes, obstructive conduct includes the commission of perjury. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(b). Perjury occurs when a witness, testifying under oath, \u201cgives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94-95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). For \u00a7 3C1.1 purposes, material matters are those that \u201cif believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">The district court did not clearly err in imposing a two-level obstruction enhancement. At trial, Wallace\u2019s testimony, found to be untrue, undercut the offense element that he must knowingly possess the gun and ammunition charged. <em>See United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1336 n. 27 (11th Cir.2010) (observing that the record fully supported an obstruction enhancement because the defendant gave false testimony that went to an element of the offense). His false statements undermining the credibility of the government\u2019s primary witness were a similar attempt to undercut the government\u2019s ability to prove this element. Wallace was aware of as much, explicitly arguing before the jury that the defense he presented established his possession was not knowing. Because Wallace testified falsely to facts that went directly to a required element of the offense, we affirm his two-level obstruction enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\">. At trial, Wallace testified on his own behalf to facts that were contradicted by the Government. Based on Wallace\u2019s testimony, the Government sought a two-level Guidelines enhancement for obstruction of justice. The district court applied this enhancement over Wallace\u2019s objection, finding portions of Wallace's testimony \"to be untrue\u201d and designed to instill sympathy in the jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-15\">. We review the district court\u2019s application of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1324 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
