First, Al-locco appeals the district court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>granting summary judgment to Met Life on her bad faith tort claim. Second, she appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Met Life $30,928.40 in attorneys\u2019 fees under Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12-341.01. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount additional facts except as necessary to explain the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Broussard v. Univ. of Cal., </em>192 F.3d 1252, 1255 (9th Cir.1999). We review the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Velarde v. PACE Membership Warehouse, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 1313, 1318 (9th Cir.1997). Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the bad faith claim and reverse the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">1. The bad faith tort claim</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Met Life on Allocco\u2019s bad faith claim. Under Arizona law, the tort of bad faith requires both a contract and a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the parties. <em>Burkons v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., </em>168 Ariz. 345, 813 P.2d 710, 720 (1991). However, contractual privity is not required if the defendant is a third-party administrator of an insurance contract. <em>See Sparks v. Republic Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>132 Ariz. 529, 647 P.2d 1127, 1137-38 (1982); <em>Farr v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., </em>145 Ariz. 1, 699 P.2d 376, 386 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Here, there is no contractual relationship between Allocco and Met Life because Met Life is the third-party administrator of her employer\u2019s salary continuation plan. Moreover, we cannot accept Alloeco\u2019s argument that contractual privity is unnecessary because the record does not support her assertion that the salary continuation plan is an insurance contract. <em>See Guaranteed Warranty Corp. v. State ex. rel Humphrey, </em>23 Ariz.App. 327, 533 P.2d 87, 90 (1975) (establishing a five-factor test for analyzing whether a contract is insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">2. Attorneys\u2019 fees</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">We reverse the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Met Life. The court made several errors in its analysis of the factors trial courts should consider in deciding whether to award fees under Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12-341.01. <em>See Assoc. Indemnity Corp. v. Warner, </em>143 Ariz. 567, 694 P.2d 1181, 1184 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The district court drew unreasonably negative conclusions about merits of Alloc-co\u2019s claim in its discussion of the first <em>Associated Indemnity </em>factor. The fact that Allocco prevailed in the first trial and the fact that her employer eventually paid her the disputed benefits weigh against granting attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">In its discussion of the third factor, the court elected to give \u201cvery little weight\u201d to Alloceo\u2019s financial circumstances because \u201c[pjlaintiffs without significant resources must not be free to pursue frivolous contract litigation.\u201d This rationale, however, is inapplicable to Allocco because her suit was not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Additionally, in considering the fourth factor, the district court concluded that Met Life had prevailed on all issues, relying in part on American Express\u2019s decision to pay Allocco salary continuation benefits. This reasoning improperly penalizes Alloc-co for her success in obtaining the disputed benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Finally, the district court\u2019s conclusion that the novelty of Allocco\u2019s claim weighed in favor of granting fees is contrary to Arizona precedent. <em>See Rowland v. Great States Ins. Co., </em>199 Ariz. 577, 20 P.3d 1158, 1168 (2001); <em>Scottsdale Mem\u2019l Health Sys., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Inc. v. Clark, </em>164 Ariz. 211, 791 P.2d 1094, 1099 (1990). A court \u201cby definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Judgment Affirmed but Modified by Vacating the Attorneys\u2019 Fees Award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
