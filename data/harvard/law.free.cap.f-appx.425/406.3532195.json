Webb argues that, even though he was sentenced as a career offender, the district court erred by ruling that it had no authority to reduce his sentence based upon the crack cocaine amendments because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), allows district courts to sentence defendants below guidelines ranges based upon career offender enhancements. He maintains that the Fair Sentencing Act also gave the district court authority to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The crack cocaine amendments did not give the district court authority to reduce Webb\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Webb was sentenced as a career offender, and \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). While <em>Booker </em>allowed district courts to sentence career offenders below their guidelines sentence ranges, <em>Booker </em>did not give the district court authority to reduce Webb\u2019s sentence because <em>Booker </em>does not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). The Fair Sentencing Act did not give the district court authority to reduce Webb\u2019s sentence because Webb was sentenced and had filed his direct appeal before its passage, and the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply retroactively. <em>See United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
