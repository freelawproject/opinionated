(DAI), appeals the district court\u2019s order remanding this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>case to the state court from which it was removed. Because we determine that we are without jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Big Country Vein Relief (Big Country), a Texas citizen, filed this lawsuit against DAI on July 6, 2009, seeking to enjoin pending arbitration proceedings. After DAI, a citizen of Connecticut, timely removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, the subject arbitration occurred. Big Country then moved for remand. DAI opposed remand, arguing that because the arbitration had already occurred, the motion was moot. Big Country subsequently filed an unopposed motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint added four non-diverse entities as additional defendants, and also sought a declaratory judgment that the arbitration award against Big Country was unenforceable. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas thereafter issued an order denying Big Country\u2019s original motion to remand, but upon motion for reconsideration, reversed course and remanded the case to state court on November 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Almost eight months later, on July 16, 2010, Big Country filed a motion in state court to vacate the arbitration award. The certificate of service for that motion indicated that only DAI, and not the four additional defendants, was served. DAI subsequently appeared at a state court hearing on August 5, arguing unsuccessfully that the lawsuit should be stayed. On August 16, DAI again removed to federal court. Big Country moved for remand, asserting that the removal, filed more than a year after the original lawsuit was filed on July 6, 2009, was untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). DAI acknowledged that the removal was untimely, but urged the district court to ignore that defect pursuant to the equitable tolling exception to \u00a7 1446(b)\u2019s one-year time limit recognized by this court in <em>Tedford, v. Warner-Lambert Co.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>DAI argued that application of the equitable exception was warranted because Big County had engaged in forum manipulation, as evidenced by its assertion of purportedly non-viable claims against, and lack of service upon, the additional non-diverse defendants. Unpersuaded, the district court granted Big Country\u2019s motion to remand. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The threshold issue in this case is whether federal law permits us to review the district court\u2019s remand order. Our authority to review district court orders remanding removed eases to state court is substantially limited by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). That statute provides, subject to an exception not relevant here, that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d Despite this seemingly broad prohibition on appellate review, the Supreme Court has \u201cinterpreted \u00a7 1447(d) to cover less than its words alone suggest.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, \u201c \u00a7 1447(d) should be read <em>in pari materia </em>with \u00a7 1447(c), so that only remands based on the grounds specified in the latter are shielded by the bar on review mandated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the former.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1447(c), in pertinent part, provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Section 1447(d), then, precludes review \u201conly of remands for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for defects in removal procedure.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Here, DAI correctly concedes that its failure to remove within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)\u2019s one-year time limit is a defect in removal procedure for the purposes of \u00a7 1447(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On its face, this concession seems to end our jurisdictional inquiry: we lack jurisdiction when a remand order is based on a defect in removal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">DAI nevertheless posits that review is not foreclosed by \u00a7 1447(d), pointing to several decisions concerning discretionary remands of supplemental state law claims, including the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Carlsbad Technology, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, the Supreme Court held that when a district court\u2019s remand is premised on its decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims, appellate review is not barred by \u00a7 1447(c) and (d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that a district court\u2019s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction is \u201cnot based on a jurisdictional defect but on its discretionary choice not to hear the claims despite its subject-matter jurisdiction over them.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> DAI asserts that the district court\u2019s refusal to apply equitable tolling in this case was likewise discretionary, and therefore a non \u00a7 1447(c) ground for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">This argument fails because the district court\u2019s equitable tolling decision goes to the merits of whether a procedural defect in removal existed. Had the district court applied equitable tolling, DATs removal would have been considered timely, eliminating the procedural defect. By contrast, a district court\u2019s decision either to exercise or to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction has no bearing on whether a jurisdictional defect exists in a case. We also note that we have previously rejected, in an unpublished opinion, the same argument now advanced by DAI.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">The district court determined that equitable tolling did not apply and entered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>order remanding based on DAI\u2019s untimely removal, a procedural defect within the bounds of \u00a7 1447(c). Whether the district court correctly applied the doctrine of equitable tolling in this case does not concern us, as our precedent \u201cprohibit[s] us from reviewing a remand order entered pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c) whether erroneous or not.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
