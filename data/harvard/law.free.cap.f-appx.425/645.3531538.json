Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1057 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5)). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the BIA erred in ruling that Cestari-Cuenca failed to establish extraordinary circumstances, and we remand so that the agency can consider in the first instance whether her delay in filing was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We conclude that Cestari-Cuenca exhausted her claim regarding Tomaszewski\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel before the IJ and BIA. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d). We also conclude that Tomaszewski was ineffective in representing Cestari-Cuenca and her husband. A petitioner seeking to establish ineffective assistance of counsel need only establish \u201cthat counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and ... that she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir.2005). Cestari-Cuenca intended to apply for asylum and would have done so but for the deficient legal advice provided by Tomaszewski. This deficient advice prejudiced Cestari-Cuenca when she missed the one-year deadline in which to file an application for asylum after entering the country. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Tomaszewski\u2019s ineffective assistance constituted extraordinary circumstances that were directly related to Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s failure to file a timely asylum application. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5)(iii) (extraordinary circumstances include ineffective assistance of counsel). Given Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s undisputed testimony that her failure to file a timely application was due to Tomaszewski\u2019s advice, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that she did not demonstrate \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Viridiana v. Holder, </em>630 F.3d 942 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Lopez v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Because of its determination that Cestari-Cuenca did not establish extraordinary circumstances, the BIA did not expressly address the separate question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>whether her delay in filing her asylum application after learning of Tomaszewski\u2019s fraud was reasonable under the circumstances. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1058 (\u201c[T]he regulations make clear that the reasonableness determination [under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5) ] must be made \u2018under the circumstances\u2019 on a case-by-case basis.\u201d). To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision could be construed as determining that Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s delay was unreasonable, the record evidence is insufficient to support any such ruling. At the asylum hearing, the IJ cut off Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s attempt to explain the interactions between petitioners and Salazar during the time after Tomaszewski\u2019s fraud was discovered. Moreover, it was unrealistic to expect Salazar\u2019s associate to develop vigorously the facts that would establish his own firm\u2019s ineffectiveness. Whether Salazar and his associates provided ineffective assistance of counsel and whether such assistance was the cause of any delay can be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Accordingly, on remand, the agency should fully develop the record regarding the circumstances of Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s delay in filing her asylum application and, if warranted, the merits of her asylum claim. We also remand the claims for withholding of removal, and relief under CAT so that petitioners, with the assistance of their new counsel, may offer additional evidence and argument regarding past persecution, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">PETITION GRANTED and REMANDED for further proceedings</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">. Flores-Camacaro sought asylum and withholding relief through his wife, Cestari-Cuen-ca, who was treated as the lead applicant. Therefore, references to Cestari-Cuenca include Flores-Camacaro unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. Cestari-Cuenca\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5)(iii)(A)-(C), <em>see also Matter of Lozada, </em>19 1. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), does not preclude her extraordinary circumstances argument because Tomaszewski's ineffectiveness is clear on the face of the record and because she had already been disbarred at the time Cestari-Cuenca and her husband discovered the fraud. <em>See Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b672-6\">IKUTA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aze-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In order to be excused from complying with the one-year time bar for applications for asylum, Cestari-Cuenca and Flores-Camacaro (Petitioners) were required to show that extraordinary circumstances prevented them from filing a timely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5). Petitioners attempted to show that Tomaszewski\u2019s ineffective assistance was the cause of their untimeliness, but as the IJ and BIA held, Petitioners failed to establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances and did not offer any explanation for the 17-month delay between the revelation of Tomaszewski\u2019s ineffective assistance in February 2002 and the tardy filing of their asylum applications in July 2003. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5). Accordingly, the BIA properly denied their asylum claim. <em>See Hu-syev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">On appeal, and for the first time, Petitioners argue that the 17-month delay was caused by Salazar\u2019s ineffective assistance in failing to file their asylum applications. Petitioners did not exhaust that argument before the IJ or the BIA, as they were required to do. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Petitioners introduced their ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Salazar in their second motion to reopen, but that claim was limited to Salazar\u2019s failure to file a timely direct appeal to the BIA\u2019s January 28, 2005 order, and his failure to inform them that their voluntary departure had not been tolled. Because Petitioners did not offer any explanation for the 17-month delay to the IJ and BIA, and did not argue that Salazar\u2019s ineffective assistance in failing to file their asylum applications was the cause of that delay, those arguments are not exhausted, and we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
