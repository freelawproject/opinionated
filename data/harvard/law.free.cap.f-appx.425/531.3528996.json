Bellinger appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. Upon de novo review, <em>see Martise v. Astrue, </em>641 F.3d 909, 920-21 (8th Cir.2011), we conclude that Belling-er has raised no basis for reversal. Specifically, the administrative law judge (ALJ) did not err by declining to find Bellinger\u2019s plantar fasciitis a severe impairment, <em>see Kirby v. Astrue, </em>500 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>705, 707-08 (8th Cir.2007) (impairment is not severe if it amounts only to slight abnormality that would not significantly limit claimant\u2019s physical ability to do basic work activities; it is claimant\u2019s burden to establish his impairment is severe); and he properly developed the record by arranging for medical and psychological consultative examinations following the hearing. Further, the ALJ\u2019s determination of Bellinger\u2019s residual functional capacity was based on consideration of her medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and Bellinger\u2019s own description of her limitations, and it was also supported by some medical evidence, as required. <em>See Jones v. Astrue, </em>619 F.3d 968, 971 (8th Cir.2010). Finally, the vocational expert\u2019s testimony in response the ALJ\u2019s properly formulated hypothetical constituted substantial evidence that Bellinger was not disabled. <em>See Partee v. Astrue, </em>638 F.3d 860, 865 (8th Cir.2011). The district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\">.
