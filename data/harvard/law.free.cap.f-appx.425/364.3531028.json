The district court dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition on the basis that Quintero\u2019s claims must be brought via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and Quinte-ro failed to show that \u00a7 2255 relief was inadequate or ineffective for purposes of the \u00a7 2255 savings clause. Quintero now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA), leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP), and appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-21\">Quintero does not require a COA to appeal because he is proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, his motion for a COA is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-22\">Quintero\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry is limited to whether his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-23\">Quintero\u2019s claims all relate to his conviction and sentence and do not come within the narrow confines of the savings clause, which is limited to a claim (1) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court case establishing that he may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (2) that was previously foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904, 906 (5th Cir.2001). As Quintero has not shown that his appeal has any arguable legal merit, we deny his motion to proceed IFP, and we dismiss the appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 and n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Quintero\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; IFP DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
