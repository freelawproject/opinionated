In two previous appeals by the United States we held that the district court erred in finding a loss amount of zero, <em>United States v. Gupta (Gupta II), </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1199-1200 (11th Cir.2006), and in selecting arbitrarily $1.5 million as the amount of loss, <em>United States v. Gupta (Gupta III), </em>572 F.3d 878, 888-89 (11th Cir.2009). The district court attributed to Gupta a loss amount of $3.4 million. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">Gupta argues that the district court failed to make findings of fact to support its selection of $3.4 million as the loss amount and that the procedural error caused the district court to miscalculate the amount of restitution, but we disagree. The district court was presented with two opinions about the amount of loss and ruled that it was \u201cgoing to go with the 3.4 figure\u201d provided by Jeff Litvak, the expert for the United States. The district court rejected Gupta\u2019s arguments that the loss amount was zero and that $1.4 million in expenses that Alegheny incurred should not be included in the amount of loss. Gupta criticizes Litvak\u2019s calculations and argues that the district court should have credited the testimony of the defense expert witness, but the district court was presented with two means of calculating the amount of loss and its \u201cchoice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Saingerard, </em>621 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">Gupta argues, for the first time on appeal, that Litvak was not qualified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>provide an expert opinion, but his argument fails. Gupta did not challenge Lit-vak\u2019s qualifications in the district court, and he does not argue that Litvak\u2019s experience in making hospital valuations rendered his testimony inadmissible. Gupta fails to cite any authority to establish that Litvak, a certified public accountant, was incapable of examining the operations of Allegheny Management Company and quantifying the amount of loss caused to Medicare. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Gupta also argues that the district court erroneously believed it was required to find some amount of loss, but we disagree. Although the district court stated that \u201cit would appear ... that the Eleventh Circuit has made it very clear that they feel there is a loss, and it\u2019s my responsibility to pick what the loss was,\u201d the court explained it knew it \u201ccouldn\u2019t pick a number\u201d and had to base its calculation on evidence and the burden of proof about the amount of loss rested with the United States. The district court fairly assumed that the only way it could find a loss amount of zero was if the United States failed to satisfy its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The district court did not err when it calculated the amount of restitution. The parties agreed that the amount of restitution is dependent on the amount of loss and that the district court had to \u201csubtract! ] $1,208,763 ... from its loss finding.\u201d The district court correctly ordered Gupta to pay $2,191,237 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We AFFIRM Gupta\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
