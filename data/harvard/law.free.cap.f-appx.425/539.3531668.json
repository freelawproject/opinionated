Because the district court incorrectly applied well-established law to conclude that plaintiffs asserted no property interest to which due process attached, and because genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the notice HACLA provided satisfied the requirements of due process, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">1. Perhaps misconstruing plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 due process claim, the district court improperly concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 property interest in Section 8 benefits did not require adequate notice that their benefits were subject to the planned reduction. Although the district court based this conclusion on its determination that plaintiffs could not claim a property interest in the \u00a7 982.505 notice requirement, plaintiffs\u2019 claim does not depend on finding a \u201cright to notice.\u201d Rather, plaintiffs claim that they are statutorily entitled to benefits under Section 8, and that the statute in tandem with the regulatory requirements \u201crestricting] the discretion\u201d of HACLA, <em>Griffeth v. Detrich, </em>603 F.2d 118, 121 (9th Cir.1979), creates a property interest in Section 8 benefits to which constitutional due process attaches. <em>See Perry v. Sin-dermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 599-603, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (citing <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)) (a legitimate claim of entitlement derived from a statute, rule, regulation, or de facto protocol gives rise to a federally protected property interest). Moreover, because it is beyond dispute that \u201cproperty interests ... extend well beyond actual ownership,\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 571-72, 92 S.Ct. 2701, the district court erred in concluding that plaintiffs \u201ccan only [have] a property interest in property.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Ressler v. Pierce, </em>692 F.2d 1212, 1215 (9th Cir.1982) (finding that applicants have a federally protected property interest in receiving benefits); <em>Griffeth, </em>603 F.2d at 121 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">The controlling authority establishes that Section 8 participants have a property interest in housing benefits by virtue of their \u201cmembership in a class of individuals whom the Section 8 program was designed to benefit.\u201d <em>Ressler, </em>692 F.2d at 1215. Because the Section 8 regulations \u201cclosely circumscribe\u201d HACLA\u2019s discretion \u2014 by prohibiting HACLA from immediately implementing a reduced VPS, and requiring HACLA to inform participants that a reduced VPS will be implemented \u2014 plaintiffs\u2019 property interest is protected against an abrupt and unexpected change in benefits. <em>Id.; see also Gene</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>va Towers Tenants Org. v. Romney, </em>504 F.2d 483, 490 (9th Cir.1974) (finding that plaintiffs\u2019 protected property interest in low-income housing included an expectation \u201cthat rents will be kept as low as economically feasible\u201d where an entity\u2019s discretion to increase rent was limited and plaintiffs clearly fell within the category of intended beneficiaries of the federal assistance program).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">What process is due to protect plaintiffs\u2019 well-settled property interest in their Section 8 benefits is controlled by the factors set forth in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Upon remand, the district court shall apply the <em>Mathews </em>factors to the circumstances presented here. <em>See, e.g., Ressler, </em>692 F.2d at 1216-22 (evaluating the sufficiency of procedural safeguards); <em>Geneva Towers, </em>504 F.2d at 491-93 (same). We note that the district court\u2019s conclusion that there is \u201cno reason to look beyond the regulatory language\u201d to determine if HAC-LA\u2019s notice was sufficient is at odds with <em>Mathews. </em>Technical compliance with regulatory procedures does not automatically satisfy due process requirements. <em>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (\u201c \u2018Property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation.\u201d). Moreover, given that the district court recognized that \u201cthe consequences of a sudden reduction in benefits to a Section 8 participant could be potentially devastating,\u201d there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether HACLA\u2019s notice sufficiently protected plaintiffs\u2019 property interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">2. For similar reasons, the district court improperly granted summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 state due process claim. California courts have held that the due process provision of the California Constitution, Cal. Const, art I, \u00a7 7, is \u201cidentical in scope and purpose\u201d to the Due Process Clause of the federal Constitution. <em>Gray v. Whitmore, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 1, 20, 94 Cal. Rptr. 904 (1971) (citing <em>Gray v. Hall, </em>203 Cal. 306, 318, 265 P. 246 (1928)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">3. The district court incorrectly concluded that the notice provided by defendants satisfied the mandatory duty in \u00a7 982.505 to provide one-year notice before implementing the reduced VPS. California Government Code \u00a7 815.6 permits private individuals to sue public entities where: (1) an enactment imposes a mandatory duty; (2) it is intended to protect the individual from the type of injury suffered; and (3) the breach of the mandatory duty was the proximate cause of the injury suffered. Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 815.6. At a minimum, the notice must be sufficiently effective to protect housing benefits recipients from an abrupt and unexpected reduction of benefits. It is a question of fact whether the \u201cliteral compliance\u201d that occurred here was sufficient to meet \u00a7 815.6\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">4. The district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 state law negligence claim was erroneous because, while public entities cannot be held liable for their own negligence, they may be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of their individual employees. <em>See </em>Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 815.2; <em>Eastbum v. Reg\u2019l Fire Prot. Authority, </em>31 Cal.4th 1175, 1179, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 552, 80 P.3d 656 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>5. The district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim to enforce the notice requirement in the regulation. Under <em>Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, </em>335 F.3d 932 (9th Cir.2003), agency regulations cannot create a federal right enforceable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this disposition.

R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\">. The district court's reliance on <em>Atkins v. Parker, </em>472 U.S. 115, 105 S.Ct. 2520, 86 L.Ed.2d 81 (1985), is misplaced. There, the plaintiffs had no property interest in advance notice of congressional action under the Food Stamp Act, and thus minimal, after-the-fact notice of a legislative change satisfied due process. <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 129-30, 105 S.Ct. 2520.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b567-6\">MOSMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aba\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">I agree with the panel that plaintiffs have a property interest in Section 8 benefits. And I also agree that this property interest is protected by the constitutional guarantee of due process. I write separately only to clarify the question left open for the district court to determine on remand: What process was due?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">\u201c[0]nce a substantive right has been created, it is the Due Process Clause which provides the procedural m\u00ednimums, and not a statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Geneva Towers Tenants Org. v. Federated Mortg. Investors, </em>504 F.2d 483, 489 n. 13 (9th Cir. 1974). Regulations like those referenced in the memorandum disposition can be useful in deciding whether or not there is a protected property interest. But they are not the source of the procedural protections. For this reason the district court was correct to find that plaintiffs have no constitutional right to a year\u2019s worth of benefits after being told of a change in the VPS. On remand, the district court should determine what process is due by considering the factors in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), without regard to the procedural protections in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">In situations analogous to termination of Section 8 benefits, the procedural protection guaranteed by the Constitution is typically pre-deprivation notice and a hearing. <em>See, e.g., Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 12-15, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978) (requiring notice of opportunity to be heard before disconnecting municipal utility service); <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 339-40, 96 S.Ct. 893 (finding notice and administrative procedures used before discontinuing social security disability benefits constitutionally adequate); <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 603, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard before terminating employment); <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971) (requiring notice and an opportunity to be heard before a driver\u2019s license can be revoked); <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 264, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (requiring notice and a hearing to discontinue welfare benefits). I am unaware of any public benefit case requiring more than pre-deprivation notice and a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">At oral argument plaintiffs counsel conceded that plaintiffs who were actually going to have Section 8 benefits reduced were granted notice and a hearing before any reduction in those benefits. Because this was merely a representation at oral argument, remand is the proper remedy to address this issue of material fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the district court finds that adequate notice and a hearing were offered to every individual prior to any actual reduction in benefits, the district court may find as a matter of law that due process was satisfied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. <em>But see Hilao v. Marcos, </em>393 F.3d 987, 993 (9th Cir.2004) (\"A party ... is bound by concessions made in its brief or at oral argument.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
