We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process claims, <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005), and for an abuse of discretion the denial of motions to reopen, <em>Hernandez-Vivas v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1557, 1560 (9th Cir.1994). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Garcia-Rojas\u2019 motion to reopen for failure to establish reasonable cause for his absence from the June 7,1990 deportation hearing. <em>See Hemandez-Vivas, </em>23 F.3d at 1559 (mistaken belief that a timely motion to change venue negated court appearance does not constitute reasonable cause excusing failure to appear). Garcia-Rojas\u2019 argument that the BIA and IJ rejected his motion under an incorrect legal standard is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Garda-Rojas\u2019 contention that the BIA erred by determining that he was ineligible for relief under NACARA is without merit. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.43(e) (establishing filing deadlines for motions to reopen seeking relief under NACARA).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Garda-Rojas\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen violates his due process rights is also without merit. <em>See Martinez-Rosas, </em>424 F.3d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
