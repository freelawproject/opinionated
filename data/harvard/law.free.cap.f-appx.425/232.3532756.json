Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Santillan received ineffective assistance of counsel. In his pro se supplemental brief, Santillan raises numerous additional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. Un<em>ited States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant must bring such a claim in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2010) motion. <em>See id. </em>An exception exists when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). The record before us fails to conclusively establish ineffective assistance. Thus, Santil-lan\u2019s claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">Regarding the claims raised in Santillan\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, we find them to be meritless. Specifically, Santillan asserts that the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) contained \u201cplain error\u201d regarding the drug amount and the failure to provide for a reduction under the \u201csafety valve.\u201d However, Santillan stipulated to the accuracy of the factual allegations in the PSR, and absent any objection, the district court was free to adopt the PSR\u2019s findings. <em>See United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). Santillan also asserts that the district court erred by accepting counsel\u2019s withdrawal of certain objections to the PSR. However, there was no error in granting Santillan\u2019s counsel\u2019s request.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Santillan\u2019s convictions and sentence. We deny Santillan\u2019s motion to substitute counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation or Santillan may renew his motion. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-12\"> Santillan also raises claims of failure to respond to \"Brady\" requests and judicial bias. These claims are not supported by the record. In particular, Santillan did not make any \"Brady\u201d requests until after his judgment was entered, and the sentencing court did not make the statements of which Santillan complains.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
