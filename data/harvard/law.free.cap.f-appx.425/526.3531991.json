Upon de novo review, <em>see Partee v. Astrue, </em>638 F.3d 860, 863 (8th Cir.2011) (standard of review), we conclude that (1) the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) credibility determination is entitled to deference, <em>see Finch v. Astrue, </em>547 F.3d 933, 935-36 (8th Cir.2008); (2) Pittman is not disabled under the listing she cites, <em>see Carlson v. Astrue, </em>604 F.3d 589, 593 (8th Cir.2010) (claimant has burden of proving her impairment meets or equals listing; impairment must meet all specified criteria of listing); (3) further development of the record was not required, <em>see Halverson v. Astrue, </em>600 F.3d at 922, 933 (8th Cir.2010) (ALJ is required to order medical examinations and tests only if medical records presented provide insufficient medical evidence to determine disability); <em>Gregg v. Barnhart, </em>354 F.3d 710, 713 (8th Cir.2003) (ALJ need not investigate impairment that claimant does not cite in application or offer as basis for disability at hearing); (4) the ALJ\u2019s determination of residual functional capacity is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Moore v. Astrue, </em>572 F.3d 520, 523 (8th Cir.2009); and (5) the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the vocational expert (VE) included, as required, only those impairments the ALJ found were substantially supported by the record, <em>see Lacroix v. Barnhart, </em>465 F.3d 881, 889 (8th Cir.2006), and thus the VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence of the determination that Pittman was not disabled, <em>see Robson v. Astrue, </em>526 F.3d 389, 392 (8th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-12\">. The Honorable Erin L.
