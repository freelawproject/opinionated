LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Antion Lomand Knox,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a state prisoner proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We deny Knox\u2019s application for COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">Knox was charged in state court with four counts in 1995. An Oklahoma jury found him guilty of possession of a firearm after a former felony conviction (\u201cCount 4\u201d). He then pled guilty before the same court to attempted robbery with a firearm after a former felony conviction (\u201cCount 1\u201d) and pointing a firearm at another after a former felony conviction (\u201cCount 3\u201d). He filed a direct appeal of Count 4 only, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">While his direct appeal was pending, Knox filed two motions for state post-conviction relief \u2014 one addressing his Count 1 and Count 8 guilty pleas and a second, filed a day later, covering his Count 4 conviction. The Oklahoma district court denied his application regarding Count 1 and Count 3 in early 1998, but never ruled on his petition regarding Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">More than a decade later, Knox filed a second application for state post-conviction relief, which was denied as out of time. He then sought relief in federal court, filing the present \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in November 2010. The government filed a motion to dismiss, contending Knox\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely. Concluding Knox\u2019s petition was time-barred by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), the district court granted the government\u2019s motion and dismissed Knox\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">A petitioner may not appeal the denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 without a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1)(A). To obtain a COA, Knox must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the [\u00a7 2254] petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). When the district court\u2019s ruling is based on procedural grounds, the petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The district court correctly ruled that Knox\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">AEDPA imposes a one-year time limit on federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners, which begins when a conviction becomes final by: (1) the conclusion of direct review; or (2) the expiration of the time for seeking direct review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Because Knox did not appeal his guilty plea convictions, but instead pursued state post-conviction relief, those convictions became final on July 11, 1997, ten days after the guilty plea. <em>See Fleming v. Evans, </em>481 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir.2007) (citing Rule 4.2(A), Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals). Knox did appeal his jury trial conviction, which became final January 7, 1999, ninety days after the OCCA affirmed on October 9, 1998. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Without tolling, the limitations period for Knox\u2019s guilty plea convictions expired on July 11, 1998, and for his jury trial conviction on January 7, 2000. Therefore, without tolling, his \u00a7 2254 petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">And Knox is not entitled to AEDPA statutory tolling. Although the one-year statute of limitations is tolled while a defendant\u2019s application for post-conviction relief is \u201cpending\u201d in state court, that tolling period applies only to a \u201cproperly filed application\u201d for post-conviction relief. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). A motion for post-conviction relief is properly filed under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) when it complies with state filing requirements. <em>Habteselassie v. Novak, </em>209 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cIf, for example, an application is erroneously accepted by the clerk of a court lacking jurisdiction, ... it will be <em>pending, </em>but not <em>properly filed.\u201d Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 9, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">Knox\u2019s 1997 petitions for state post-conviction relief were not properly filed. \u201cOnce an appeal has been perfected in [the OCCA], the trial court has no authority in the case until [the OCCA\u2019s] mandate has issued, restoring jurisdiction in the trial court.\u201d <em>Crider v. State ex rel. Disk Court of Okla. Cnty., </em>29 P.3d 577, 578 (Okla. Crim.App.2001).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Knox perfected his appeal on October 2, 1997. He filed his applications for post-conviction relief on October 28 and 29, 1997. The state district court had no jurisdiction to entertain these motions; they were therefore not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">No reasonable jurist could dispute the district court\u2019s determination that Knox\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is time-barred. We therefore DENY his application for COA. We also DENY Knox\u2019s \u201cExtreme Emergency Motion for Sanctions,\u201d which challenges conduct unrelated to this appeal. All other pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Knox has failed to advance \u201ca reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d <em>see DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991), so we DENY his motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-13\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-18\">. Knox uses several aliases in his filings, including \"Antone Lamandingo Knox\u201d and \"Antone Lamont Knox.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-19\">. We liberally construe Knox\u2019s pleadings because he proceeds pro se. <em>See Hall v. Bellman, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-10\">. <em>Crider </em>refers to the <em>case, </em>not individual <em>claims. </em>Thus the district court lost jurisdiction over all counts of Knox\u2019s conviction once his appeal on Count 4 was perfected.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
