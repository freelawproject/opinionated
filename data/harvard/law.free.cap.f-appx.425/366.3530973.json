The district court dismissed her complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that the complaint stated \u201cnothing more than a conclusory allegation with no plausible, supporting facts.\u201d A district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a claim filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>if it \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-20\">After reviewing Callins\u2019s complaint, we agree with the district court that her complaint failed to state a claim. Callins\u2019s complaint did not plead sufficient factual matter to allow \u201cthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). To meet this pleading standard, Callins\u2019s complaint must state more than \u201can unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we do not consider additional factual allegations stated in Callins\u2019s brief before this court, or in her notice of appeal, because those facts were not pled to the district court when it rendered its decision. <em>See Lovelace v. Software Spectrum Inc., </em>78 F.3d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cNormally, in deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, courts must limit their inquiry to the facts stated in the complaint and documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court dismissing Callins\u2019s claim without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
