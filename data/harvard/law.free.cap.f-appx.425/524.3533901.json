Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., </em>639 F.3d 507, 514 (8th Cir.2011) (standard of review); <em>Rothmeier v. Inv. Advisers, Inc., 85 </em>F.3d 1328, 1336-37 (8th Cir.1996) (explaining the evidence necessary for a plaintiff to avoid summary judgment in an age-discrimination case and affirming summary judgment where the evidence showed that the employer\u2019s problems with the plaintiff concerned business matters, not the plaintiffs age); <em>see also Ramlet v. E.F. Johnson Co., </em>507 F.3d 1149, 1152-53 (8th Cir.2007) (noting that direct evidence of discrimination must show a link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the employment decision; direct evidence does not include statements made by decision-makers that are not related to the deci-sional process). We further conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Howell\u2019s state-law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (stating that a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction); <em>Moots v. Lombardi, </em>453 F.3d 1020, 1024 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-18\">. The Honorable J. Leon Holmes, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
