INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (deadline for filing a motion to reopen can be equitably tolled \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence\u201d). In any event, we lack jurisdiction to review Salazar-Carranza\u2019s equitable tolling claim because he did not raise this claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004). To the extent that petitioner challenges the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen sua sponte, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
