He now appeals his sentence, which was based on an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, arguing that it is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to effectuate the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because he has preserved the issue on appeal, we review the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly under \u00a7 4A1.3 for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The record reflects that Borja\u2019s sentence was a departure authorized by the advisory sentencing guidelines pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the inadequacy of Bor-ja\u2019s criminal history. In determining that Borja\u2019s criminal history was under-represented, the district court noted that many of Borja\u2019s criminal convictions \u2014 including numerous convictions for driving while intoxicated, as well convictions for evading arrest and unlawfully carrying a weapon\u2014 were not scored in the presentence report because of their age. The district court concluded that the revised guidelines range was inadequate to meet the requirements of the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and considered Borja\u2019s history and characteristics, as well as the need for the sentence to provide just punishment, to promote respect for the law, to protect the public, and to deter future criminal conduct in determining Borja\u2019s sentence. The district court noted that neither the leniency that Borja previously received nor the 87-month prison term that was previously imposed following a prior conviction for illegal reentry had any deterrent effect. The district court further concluded that Borja\u2019s use of more than a dozen aliases and several different birth dates and social security numbers to avoid detection reflected the likelihood of further recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly was permissible under the Guidelines and that the departure was based on permissible factors that advanced the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and were justified by the facts of the case. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347; <em>see also United States v. Beasley, </em>90 F.3d 400, 403 (5th Cir.1996) (holding that district court did not err in considering defendant\u2019s six remote prior convictions in evaluating the adequacy of his criminal history). Based on the totality of the circumstances, the sentence did \u201cnot account for a factor that should have received significant weight\u201d or \u201crepresent ] a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Moreover, although Borja\u2019s 132-month sentence is 45 months more than the top of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>his guidelines range (87 months), we have affirmed similar and more substantial departures, and we conclude that the degree of the departure in this case was not unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531-32 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming upward departure from guidelines range of 21 to 27 months to 60 months when underlying circumstances rendered sentence unreasonable); <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir. 2008) (upholding an upward departure or variance to 180 months from an advisory maximum of 51 months); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir. 2006) (affirming an upward departure to 120 months from a range of 46 to 57 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
