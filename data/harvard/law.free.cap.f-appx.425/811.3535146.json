The sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines called for a sentence in each ease of 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court varied upwardly from that range and sentenced Aguilar-Ramirez to concurrent prison terms of 144 months. He now appeals his sentences on the ground that they are unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009). This review is deferential. The appellant bears the burden of establishing the absence of reasonableness in light of the record and the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Review for reasonableness has two steps. First, we must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1093 (11th Cir. 2008). Procedural errors can also include selection of a sentence that is based on clearly erroneous facts, or failure to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). A district court need not expressly discuss each and every \u00a7 3553(a) factor at the time of sentencing, but need only note that it has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments along with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Second, we must determine whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable based on the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. <em>Gall </em>instructs that the district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The sentences are not unreasonable in this case because the district court considered the statements of the parties, the defendant\u2019s history as set out in the presentence report, correctly calculated the Guidelines sentence range, and considered the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, the sentences are not substantively unreasonable because the district court specifically discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that affected its decision to impose the challenged variance, particularly noting the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the likelihood that he will commit further offenses on release from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\">. He also challenges the district court's drug quantity determination in fixing the Guidelines sentence range for the \u00a7 846 offense. He abandoned the challenge in the district court; hence, we do not consider it here. <em>United States v. Horsfall, </em>552 F.3d 1275, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2034, 173 L.Ed.2d 1120 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
