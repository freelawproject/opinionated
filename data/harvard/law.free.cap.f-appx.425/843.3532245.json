Green contends that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. He argues that the district court erred at the sentence hearing by failing to clearly rule on whether it was providing him with safety-valve relief. That failure was, according to Green, a violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B), which requires that a court \u201cmust \u2014 for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter \u2014 rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-26\">The government on cross-appeal contends that because the district court failed to expressly grant safety-valve relief, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>court erred in sentencing Green to 97 months, which was below the statutory minimum sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">A federal grand jury indicted Green on one count of possessing with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(iii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Green proceeded to trial, where two police officers testified that they had observed him sell crack cocaine to an undercover informant. The informant also took the stand, echoing the officers\u2019 version of events and identifying Green as the man who had sold him crack cocaine. Green testified in his own defense, denying any involvement in the drug sale. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Before his sentence hearing, Green filed <em>pro se </em>numerous documents, including a sentencing memorandum and two motions alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. In the sentencing memorandum Green argued that he was eligible for various reductions in his sentence, including relief under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision in United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5C1.2, which permits a court to sentence a defendant below the statutory minimum provided he meets each of the five requirements laid out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">At the sentence hearing the district court first noted that Green\u2019s presentence investigation report had calculated his guidelines range as 97 to 121 months but that there was a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months applicable to his crack cocaine conviction. Defense counsel then spoke up, acknowledging the various <em>pro se </em>objections and motions that Green had filed but concluding: \u201cI have no legal objections to the PSR. As the court has noted it\u2019s a straight 120 month mandatory minimum.\u201d The court then allowed Green to speak, and he argued that he was entitled to a lower sentence because of acceptance of responsibility, his \u201cfamily ties,\u201d and the safety valve provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">When the court questioned Green about his safety-valve argument, defense counsel interjected, reminding Green that because he had testified under oath during his trial, anything he might say at the sentence hearing could subject him to further prosecution. The court re-emphasized that point, explaining to Green that he could be indicted for perjury if he contradicted the testimony he had given during his trial (denying any involvement in the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The court then addressed and rejected Green\u2019s arguments that were based on his alleged acceptance of responsibility and his \u201cfamily ties\u201d before returning to the question of safety valve relief. Green argued again that he believed he met all five requirements necessary for safety valve relief. His counsel then spoke up, explaining the predicament:</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Clearly, Your Honor, I would love to see Mr. Green get the safety valve but my understanding is that he has not yet accepted and told the Government everything he has to say about this case. And he has already testified under oath at trial so he is in a precarious situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The government agreed with defense counsel, pointing out that the only thing Green had owned up to was the undisputed fact that the jury had found him guilty; he had not admitted that he committed the crime. As a result, the government argued, safety valve relief was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">After asking whether either side had anything further, the court then proceeded to pronounce sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">Well, the court recognizes that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States versus Booker, </em>sets forth that the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>trict Courts, while not being bound to apply the sentencing guidelines, must consult those guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. In imposing sentence today, the Court has taken the Guidelines under advisement and determined that the advisory sentencing range is 97 to 121 months, which increases to 120 to 121. Due to the statutory mandatory minimum and considering an offense level of 30 and a criminal history category of I.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">However, in this case the Court is going to enter a variance and I am going to reduce the guideline sentencing range down to 97 to 121 months. I think that is appropriate in terms of this case and considering the nature and circumstances of the offense ...</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The court went on to discuss other 18 U.S.C.'\u00a7 3553(a) factors before explaining that it was imposing a sentence of 97 months imprisonment. When it asked whether either side had any objections, the government objected to the court\u2019s having imposed a sentence \u201cbelow the mandatory statutory minimum.\u201d Green raised no further objections. The court then acknowledged the government\u2019s objection and concluded the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">In the \u201cStatement of Reasons\u201d it filed after sentencing, the district court adopted the PSR without change. The court also recognized that a mandatory minimum sentence applied to Green\u2019s count of conviction, but the court justified sentencing below the mandatory minimum on the basis that it had \u201cimposed a variance (downward).\u201d On the sentencing form used in that district the court left unchecked a box that would have indicated that it had granted safety valve relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Zal-divar, </em>615 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2010). We also review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum. <em>United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir. 2010). In an appeal of a denial of a motion for relief under the safety valve, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, the so-called \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision, enables a district court to sentence a defendant without regard to the statutory minimum for certain offenses if five requirements are met. <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir.2006). A defendant who satisfies these criteria is eligible for a two-level reduction in offense level. <em>See id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(ll). The burden is on the defendant to show that he has met all of the safety-valve requirements. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir. 1997). The last of them is that the defendant must show that:</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>tion and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan----</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). This final factor is a \u201ctell-<em>all </em>\u201d provision: in order to satisfy it, the defendant has an affirmative responsibility to \u201ctruthfully, disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the government filed a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or the defendant falls within the safety-valve of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u201d <em>United States v. Casta-ing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir. 2008). As we explained in <em>Castaing-Sosa, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cmade advisory the Sentencing Guidelines, not statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums enacted by Congress.\u201d 530 F.3d at 1362. We continued: \u201cThus, Bookeds instruction to district courts to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning a reasonable sentence cannot be read to authorize using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Both sides ask us to remand this case for resentencing, and our review of the record convinces us that is the correct result. We agree with Green that the district court failed to expressly rule on his request for safety-valve relief. That said, the court\u2019s actions, statements, and the \u201cStatement of Reasons\u201d form it filled out after sentencing strongly suggest that it did reject Green\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">We also agree with the government that the district court exceeded its authority in sentencing Green to 97 months imprisonment. See <em>Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1360. The government did not file a substantial assistance motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and there was no express grant of safety-valve relief. The district court\u2019s use of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to justify its \u201cvariance\u201d below the mandatory minimum was, for the reasons we explained in <em>Cas-taing-Sosa, </em>error. <em>Id. </em>at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">For these reasons, Green\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. For reasons we explain more fully below, the Middle District of Georgia\u2019s \"Statement of Reasons\u201d form appears to contain at least one error in section \"II.C.\" That section of the form allows a court to explain why it imposed a sentence below the mandatory minimum. One of the options a court can check is that \"[t]he Court imposed a variance (downward),\u201d but that would not, under the law of this Circuit, justify a sentence below the mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Casta-ing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. Because we are remanding this case for resentencing, we need not decide several other issues that Green raises in this appeal. Two of them concern the district court's alleged failure at sentencing to verify that Green and his attorney had read and discussed his PSR and its alleged failure to consider Green\u2019s argument that under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he was entitled to a lower sentence. Even if we assume that the alleged errors were errors, our decision renders them moot, at least for the time being. Green also argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during sentencing. That argument is moot because Green, who is represented by new counsel, is to be resen-tenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
