We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 experiences in Fiji, including stoning of the family home, and a beating and robbery suffered by Prem Chand Lai in 1987, did not constitute persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to establish they have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Nahrvani, </em>399 F.3d at 1154; <em>see also Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1395-96 (9th Cir.1996) (record evidence did not compel finding that petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">Because petitioners failed to demonstrate they were eligible for asylum, they necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Nahrvani, </em>399 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners failed to establish it is more likely than not they would be tortured if returned to Fiji. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b562-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
