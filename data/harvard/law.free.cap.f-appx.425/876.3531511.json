Zola-Aguilar argues that his sentence is procedurally un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>reasonable because the district court failed to state explicitly that the sentence is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a), to achieve the goals of sentencing. Zola-Aguilar maintains that the district court violated the requirement, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(c), that it state its reasons for the sentence it entered. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard of review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Zola-Aguilar\u2019s argument fails. The Supreme Court has ruled that, under section 3553(c), \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We have stated that \u201cthe requirement of \u00a7 3553(c)(1) does not mean that a sentencing court must incant the specific language used in the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither must the district court state that it has considered each sentencing factor. <em>Id. </em>Zola-Aguilar\u2019s argument would require district courts to \u201cincant the specific language\u201d of section 3553(a) in contravention of our express holding that such recitations are unnecessary. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (an acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is ordinarily sufficient). The record establishes that the district court exercised its authority and imposed a sentence that was \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing because the district court explicitly stated that it had considered the statutory factors and the applicable guidelines and policy statements, as well as Zola-Aguilar\u2019s previous illegal reentries. The district court did not abuse its discretion. Zola-Aguilar\u2019s sentence in the middle of the guideline range is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
