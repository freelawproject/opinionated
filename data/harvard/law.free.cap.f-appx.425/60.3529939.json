Koeltl, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b84-27\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-28\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>AND DECREED that the judgment and order of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Plaintiff-Appellant Joseph Kastner, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s: (1) judgment adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and thereby dismissing Kastner\u2019s second amended complaint principally for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; and (2) order denying Kastner\u2019s motion for reconsideration and leave to file a third amended complaint. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \u201cconstruing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 </em>F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002). This Court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court order denying Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motions. <em>See Tran-saero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, </em>162 F.3d 724, 729 (2d Cir.1998) (Rule 60(b)); <em>Baker v. Dorfman, </em>239 F.3d 415, 422 (2d Cir.2000) (Rule 59(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In this case, because Kastner\u2019s arguments on appeal fail to address the district court\u2019s bases for dismissing his claims and denying his motion for reconsideration and leave to amend, Kastner has waived any such challenge. See <em>Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d); <em>LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding that issues not raised by <em>pro se </em>litigant in appellate brief were abandoned). Accordingly, we limit our review to the issues that Kastner raised in his opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Kastner argues for the first time on appeal that the judges below were biased against him and that the magistrate judge should have questioned him on the confusing points of his second amended complaint. The well-established general rule is that a court of appeals will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); see <em>also Virgilio v. City of New York, </em>407 F.3d 105, 116 (2d Cir.2005). The rule is not an absolute bar to raising new issues on appeal; the Court may, in its discretion, disregard the general rule when necessary to remedy manifest or obvious injustice. <em>See Thomas E. Hoar, Inc. v. Sara Lee Corp., </em>900 F.2d 522, 527 (2d Cir.1990). We conclude that there is no reason to disregard the general rule that we will not review arguments raised for the first time on appeal, as Kastner has not demonstrated that review of these claims is necessary to remedy manifest injustice. In any event, Kastner has not articulated any meaningful basis for his belief that the judges below were biased against him. The fact that motions were not decided in his favor is not a sufficient basis to support a claim of bias. <em>See, e.g., Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (\u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality recusal motion,\u201d and \u201copinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings ... do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Kastner\u2019s remaining procedural arguments do not provide any basis for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>turbing the orders below. First, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court intentionally failed to mail Kastner a copy of its dismissal order. In any event, Kastner fails to show how he was prejudiced by not receiving that order any earlier than he did, and we note that he was able to timely move for reconsideration of that order. Second, there is no merit to Kastner\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge erred by failing to read all of Kastner\u2019s submissions. In order to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must, among other things, provide \u201ca plain statement of the claim ... [that] give[s] the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Patane v. Clark, </em>508 F.3d 106, 113 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original). A review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations reveals that the magistrate judge expended considerable effort in reviewing the numerous allegations in Kastner\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We have considered Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment and order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
