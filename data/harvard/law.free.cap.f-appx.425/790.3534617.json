To this end, Dvorak avers that the IJ applied the wrong \u201cstandard of proof.\u201d Additionally, he argues that the IJ\u2019s findings were tainted by confusion during the immigration proceedings. Finally, he contends that his ability to present evidence was unfairly limited because he had to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to certain questions and had no opportunity to elaborate on his answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">\u201c[Where], as here, the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). When addressing the due process errors that Dvorak raises on appeal, the BIA issued its own opinion. Accordingly, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>due process claims. <em>Avila v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>560 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.2009). The Fifth Amendment entitles an alien in removal proceedings to due process of law. <em>See Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 1449, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). To prevail on a due process challenge, however, an alien must show substantial prejudice, i.e., that the outcome would have differed, had the due process violation not occurred. <em>See Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Upon a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Dvorak\u2019s petition for review. First, he has abandoned any argument as to the standard of proof applied by the IJ. Although Dvorak states that the BIA failed to consider all the evidence and failed to recognize that the IJ had applied an inappropriate standard of proof on his application for withholding of removal, he mentions these issues in only a single sentence without any analysis or reference to the record. But a reference to an issue without citation to any authority or the record is insufficient to raise the issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Thus, because Dvorak failed to properly brief the arguments, we deem the arguments abandoned. <em>See Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cPassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>Second, we cannot agree that the IJ\u2019s findings were tainted by confusion. To be sure, Dvorak may be correct that in one instance the translator improperly substituted the term \u201carrest\u201d in place of \u201cattack,\u201d which Dvorak claims impeded his ability to testify regarding his fear of State authorities. However, the record reveals that the IJ soon after asked Dvorak to discuss each incident in some detail, which clarified any confusion the translation error may have caused. Similarly, during that same exchange the translator initially mistranslated the term \u201ctestimony\u201d in describing the motivation for the attacks against Dvorak\u2019s wife. Here too, however, the IJ took pains to ensure that Dvorak, the translator, and the immigration court all understood exactly what Dvorak meant. We conclude that, in so doing, the IJ adequately rectified any confusion that arose during this exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Finally, Dvorak was not unfairly limited in his presentation of evidence. To begin, the record belies Dvorak\u2019s contention that he was forced to answer only \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to certain questions. Rather, the IJ required Dvorak to respond to a series of question by answering only \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and then permitted him to elaborate on his answers through longer explanations. Nor was this questioning itself improper. To the contrary, the IJ properly acted within the scope of his statutorily prescribed discretion to question individuals appearing before him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b). Lastly, mistranslations during Dvorak\u2019s asylum interview did not limit his ability to present evidence in the later proceedings before the IJ. Indeed, there is no indication that the IJ prevented Dvorak from submitting any evidence whatsoever. To the contrary, it was on account of conflicts between Dvorak\u2019s testimony \u2014 i.e., evidence that he was permitted to submit\u2014 and statements in his earlier asylum interview that led the IJ to conclude Dvorak was \u201cnot worthy of credence.\u201d Thus, Dvorak has failed to substantiate his claim that he was deprived of an opportunity to present necessary evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">For these reasons, Dvorak has failed to demonstrate that the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s actions deprived him of due process or caused him substantial prejudice. As a result, we must deny his petition. <em>Patel, </em>334 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">. Dvorak concedes that his asylum application was untimely filed and does not appeal the denial of that claim before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-15\">. Similarly, Dvorak did not argue that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief and has abandoned this issue as well. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\"When an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>appellant fails to offer argument on an issue [such as CAT relief], that issue is abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">. To the extent mistranslations during Dvorak's asylum interview affected his proceedings at all, the proper challenge would have been to the IJ's adverse credibility determination. However, because Dvorak does not challenge that determination, we may not address this issue in this appeal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
