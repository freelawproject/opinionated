Wendell William Chinners pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of conspiracy to manufacture with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), 846 (2006), and one count of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2006). The district court sentenced Weaver to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment and Chinners to a total term of imprisonment of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-20\">Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating their opinion that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether the district court incorrectly calculated the theoretical yield of methamphetamine as to Weaver and whether the district court erred in applying a reckless endangerment enhancement <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> as to Chinners. Neither Weaver nor Chinners, although notified of their right to file pro se supplemental briefs, has done so. The Government declined to file a responsive brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Weaver contends that the district court erred in calculating the theoretical yield of methamphetamine from the amount of pseudoephedrine he purchased' for the purpose of converting it to The district court\u2019s of the amount of drugs to the defendant for sentencing purposes is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Sampson, </em>140 F.3d 585, 591 (4th Cir.1998). This deferential standard of review reversal only if the court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). When the amount of drugs \u201cseized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the district court shall approxi-mate the quantity to be used for USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n.12. Af-ter reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not clearly er-ror in calculating the theoretical yield of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"AQk\">Chinners contends that the endangerment during flight enhance-ment was improper. \u201cWe review the court\u2019s application of the reckless endangerment enhancement for clear <em>United States v. Carter, </em>601 F.3d 252, 254 (4th Cir.2010). A two-level is required \u201c[i]f the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.2. \u201c[A]cts are considered \u2018reckless\u2019 when [the defendant] was aware of the risk created by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to that risk constituted a gross from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>601 F.3d at 255 quotation marks omitted). Be-cause Chinners led police on a high-speed chase past several vehicles and placed the pursuing officer and the passengers in his car in danger, we conclude that the court did not err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"A4P\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the Appellants\u2019 con-victions and sentences. This court re-quires that counsel inform Weaver and Chinners, in writing, of their right to peti-tion the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Weaver or Chinners requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be-fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AJX\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-14\"> Counsel characterizes the enhancement as one for obstruction of justice, which is covered by USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Chinners\u2019 offense level was actually enhanced for reckless endangerment during flight, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
