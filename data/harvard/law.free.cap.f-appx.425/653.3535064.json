See Fed.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">Ortiz was initially granted supplemental security income benefits in 1989. At that time, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) determined Ortiz had \u201ca cyclothymic disorder characterized by anhedonia, sleep disturbance, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating and hallucinations.\u201d Her mental impairments were deemed severe and precluded gainful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">Her eligibility for continued benefits was reviewed in 1999. A different ALJ noted Ortiz\u2019s mental impairments and also reviewed additional medical evidence indicating she had \u201cspondylolysis and related degenerative change in the lower lumbar spine.\u201d An IQ test resulted in scores of 67 for verbal, 77 for performance and 71 for full-scale. The ALJ determined that Ortiz had mild mental retardation and other severe impairments such as \u201cspondylolysis of the lumbosacral spine and obesity\u201d and therefore \u201ccontinues to be disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">Ortiz\u2019s benefits were terminated in 2005 because she failed to supply requested documentation. Unrepresented by counsel, she reapplied for benefits. A third ALJ ruled that Ortiz \u201cis not mentally retarded and does not have degenerative disc disease as was misapprehended in the prior applications.\u201d Benefits were denied because \u201cnew and material evidence shows that the claimant has neither a severe mental impairment nor a severe physical impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">Ortiz\u2019s application was denied at the second step of the five-step sequential evaluation process used to determine whether an individual is disabled for purposes of receiving disability benefits. <em>See Bowen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>Yuckert, </em>482 U.S. 137, 140-42, 107 S.Ct. 2287, 96 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987) (describing five-step process). Ample authority cautions against a determination of nondisability at step two. <em>See id. </em>at 153, 107 S.Ct. 2287 (noting the step-two inquiry is intended to identify \u201cclaimants whose medical impairments are so slight that it is unlikely they would be found to be disabled\u201d); <em>Webb v. Barnhart, </em>433 F.3d 683, 686 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining a step-two impairment \u201cmay be found not severe <em>only if </em>the evidence establishes a slight abnormality that has no more than a minimal effect on an individual\u2019s ability to work\u201d) (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1290 (9th Cir.1996) (noting \u201cthe step-two inquiry is a de minimis screening device to dispose of groundless claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Here, the ALJ relied on two mental evaluations diagnosing Ortiz with depressive and anxiety disorders but not ruling out either a learning disability or borderline intellectual functioning. This is not the \u201ctotal absence of objective evidence of severe medical impairment\u201d that would permit us to affirm \u201ca finding of no disability at step two.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>433 F.3d at 688 (reversing a step-two determination \u201cbecause there was not substantial evidence to show that Webb\u2019s claim was \u2018groundless\u2019\u201d). Moreover, there is evidence in Ortiz\u2019s medical history indicating she suffers from a severe mental impairment. Indeed, two other ALJs previously determined that her mental impairment is severe. <em>See Perry v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 461, 464 (9th Cir.1983) (noting claimant \u201cenjoys a presumption of continued disability created by a prior finding of disability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">At the very least, the circumstances of this case suggest the ALJ \u201chad an affirmative duty to supplement [Ortiz\u2019s] medical record, to the extent it was incomplete, before rejecting [her] petition at so early a stage in the analysis.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>433 F.3d at 687. This could have been accomplished by considering her previous medical history, including the results of her prior psychological examination. <em>See Corrao v. Shalala, </em>20 F.3d 943, 949 (9th Cir.1994) (noting for mental impairments, the ALJ \u201cmust consider the evidence in the case record \u2014 the mental status examination and psychiatric history\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">We conclude a remand is required to permit the ALJ to continue the sequential analysis. <em>See Vasquez v. Astrue, </em>572 F.3d 586, 597 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Webb, </em>433 F.3d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
