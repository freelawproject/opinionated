R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b26-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the case be remanded to the district court for further proceedings regarding appellant\u2019s common law tort claims consistent with <em>Barnhardt v. District of Columbia, 8 </em>A.3d 1206 (D.C.2010). To the extent the allegations in the complaint do not necessarily foreclose a claim of municipal liability, appellant\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim is remanded for further proceedings to determine whether he has stated a claim for municipal liability by alleging appellee \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to instruct and supervise its employees. <em>See Baker v. District of Columbia, </em>326 F.3d 1302, 1307 (D.C.Cir. 2003) (\u201cDeliberate indifference is determined by analyzing whether the municipality knew or should have known of the risk of constitutional violations.... \u201d); <em>see also Warren v. District of Columbia, </em>353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C.Cir.2004) (stating that alleging that a municipality \u201c \u2018knew or should have known\u2019 about the ongoing constitutional violation, but did nothing,\u201d is sufficient to state a claim for municipal liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>See </em>Fed.
