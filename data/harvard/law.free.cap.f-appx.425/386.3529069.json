Judgment was entered in March 2007. More than three years later, Rivera filed a notice of appeal and motions seeking <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) status, record transcripts, and appointment of counsel. The district court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Rivera moves this court for leave to proceed IFP and for appointment of counsel. We may dismiss an appeal during consideration of an interlocutory motion if the appeal \u201cis frivolous and entirely without merit.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Rivera did not file his notice of appeal within the required period after the entry of judgment or within the time for requesting the district court to extend the deadline. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1), (4). He is not entitled to have the untimeliness of his notice of appeal disregarded. <em>See United States v.
