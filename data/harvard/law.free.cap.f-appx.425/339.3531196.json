Payne filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition arguing that his counsel was ineffective for failing to argue \u201cthat fronting drugs [does] not constitute [a] managerial relationship for a conviction\u201d under the continuing criminal enterprise statute. The district court determined that Payne could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claim did not satisfy the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The district court thus dismissed Payne\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as frivolous and to the extent it was construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-21\">Section 2255 provides the main vehicle to raise a collateral challenge to a federal sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 relief is hence the appropriate remedy for \u201cerror[s] that occurred at or prior to sentencing.\u201d <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In contrast, \u00a7 2241 is properly used to raise a challenge to \u201cthe manner in which a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tence is executed.\u201d <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 877. A petition filed under \u00a7 2241 that raises errors \u201cthat occurr[ed] at trial or sentencing is properly construed [as arising] under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877-78. Payne is challenging alleged errors that happened at trial. As such, Payne\u2019s claim must be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Cox, </em>911 F.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">If a prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201c \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention,\u2019 \u201d he may be permitted to bring a habeas corpus claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 904. Payne has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
