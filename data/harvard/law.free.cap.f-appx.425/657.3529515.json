Lobo (\u201cLobo\u201d) appeals his jury conviction and 70-month sentence for reentering the United States without authorization after having been removed in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">A. Lobo\u2019s Second Motion to Substitute Court-Appointed Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lobo\u2019s second motion for substitution of appointed counsel. We consider the three factors stated in <em>United States v. Mendez-Sanchez, </em>563 F.3d 935, 942 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">Lobo submitted his second motion to substitute counsel on the eve of trial. \u201cIt is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to deny a motion to substitute made during or on the eve of trial if the substitution would require a continuance.\u201d <em>United States v. McClendon, </em>782 F.2d 785, 789 (9th Cir.1986). Given that granting Lobo\u2019s request likely would have required a substantial continuance, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">Moreover, the district court\u2019s inquiry into Lobo\u2019s complaint was adequate. This was Lobo\u2019s second motion to substitute appointed counsel, made substantively for the same reason he requested that his first appointed defender be removed. The district court inquired into the crux of the disagreement between Lobo and his counsel, asking specific and targeted questions about Lobo\u2019s dissatisfaction with his counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See United States v. Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 772, 777-78 (9th Cir.2001). Lobo\u2019s description of the problems he had with his appointed counsel, along with the district court\u2019s questions and observations, gave the court \u201ca sufficient basis for reaching an informed \u25a0decision.\u201d <em>McClendon, </em>782 F.2d at 789. Although Lobo suggests that the district court failed to inquire into Lobo\u2019s choice to proceed to trial rather than plead guilty, this did not render the district court\u2019s inquiry inadequate. Lobo could have pled guilty at any time, and the district court\u2019s inquiry established that the source of Lobo\u2019s conflict with his attorney was his insistence on collaterally attacking his state conviction in the federal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">Finally, the attorney-client relationship was not so irreconcilable as to deny Lobo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>effective assistance of counsel, nor did it result in Lobo\u2019s inability to present an adequate defense. While the relationship between Lobo and his appointed counsel was strained, Lobo\u2019s case is missing the \u201cstriking signs of serious conflict\u201d that indicate a significant breakdown in communication. <em>Adelzo-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d at 774-75, 778-79. Moreover, there is no indication that the breakdown in communication between Lobo and his counsel prevented Lobo\u2019s appointed counsel from presenting an adequate defense on the \u00a7 1326 charge of illegal reentry. Instead, the conflict between Lobo and both of his attorneys arose out of Lobo\u2019s \u201cgeneral unreasonableness,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is unclear what could have been done differently.\u201d <em>Mendez-Sanchez, </em>563 F.3d at 944. Given that Lobo\u2019s frustration arose from the inability to collaterally attack his prior state conviction, it is unlikely that granting his motion to substitute counsel would have precluded a similar complaint about any newly substituted counsel. Thus, the district court properly exercised its discretion when it rejected Lobo\u2019s second motion for substitution of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">B. The Reasonableness of Lobo\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u201c[Ajppellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1280 (9th Cir. 2006). An \u201cabuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The district court\u2019s sentence correctly calculated Lobo\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range as 63 to 78 months and considered all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its determination. The district court reduced Lobo\u2019s total offense level by two points based on acceptance of responsibility and considered many factors weighing in Lobo\u2019s favor. The district court also gave sufficient consideration to Lobo\u2019s reasons for returning to the United States without authorization, including his desire to reunite with his family, and took as true Lobo\u2019s claim that he was under duress to leave Honduras. However, the district court found that Lobo\u2019s history and characteristics were particularly aggravated by his prior criminal record and merited a sentence sufficient to protect the public and to deter Lobo from committing further criminal activity. Thus, Lobo\u2019s 70-month sentence for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">C. Lobo\u2019s Remaining Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">We have previously held that a warrant of deportation is non-testimonial because it is not made in anticipation of litigation. <em>United States v. Orozco-Acosta, </em>607 F.3d 1156, 1163 (9th Cir.2010). Thus, the admission of Lobo\u2019s warrant of deportation into evidence was not a violation of Lobo\u2019s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">We have also previously rejected arguments that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 231, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), abrogated the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that a district court can enhance a defendant\u2019s base offense level under the Guidelines and increase his criminal history category even if a jury did not make any findings about the defendant\u2019s prior record. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Cardenas, </em>555 F.3d 1049, 1051 (9th Cir. 2009) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>-, 130 S.Ct. 315, 175 L.Ed.2d 209 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
