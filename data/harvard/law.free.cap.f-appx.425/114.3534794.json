Ballentine, proceeding pro se, seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the District Court to issue a declaratory judgment, grant a hearing, and respond to his filings and letters. For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">Ballentine filed suit against the defendants in the District Court in March 2010. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss in May 2010. On July 28, 2010, Ballentine filed a motion requesting a hearing. Two months later, on September 30, 2010, Bal-lentine filed a letter that appears to ask for \u201csomeone to answer the questions posed ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-22\">Months later, on March 15, 2011, Ballen-tine filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking a declaratory judgment in the District Court on his then-pending complaint. Ballentine states that he received no response to his \u201cfilings and inquiry letters,\u201d and further requests a \u201cpretrial status hearing or trial; or, a Judgment issue where natural born\u2019 is designated a non-court decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-23\">When Ballentine filed this mandamus petition, the District Court had not yet ruled on his motion requesting a hearing or on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, on March 22, 2011, the District Court denied the motion for a hearing, and, on March 31, 2011, granted the motion to dismiss the complaint. Because the case has been closed, we will deny the mandamus petition as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
