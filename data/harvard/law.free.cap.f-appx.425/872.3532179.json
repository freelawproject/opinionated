Valle argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence of 60 months for the firearm offense to run consecutively to his 120-month mandatory minimum sentence for the drug trafficking offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Valle contends that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) prohibits a district court from imposing consecutive sentences when the mandatory minimum sentence for the underlying drug trafficking offense is higher than the minimum sentence for the firearm offense. He argues that because the statute requires a consecutive 60-month sentence \u201c[e]xeept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided ... by any other provision of law,\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), he cannot be sentenced consecutively for his firearm offense when he has also been convicted under another provision of law, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, that provides a greater mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See U.S. v. Williams, </em>558 F.3d 166, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause prohibits consecutive sentences where an underlying drug offense provides a greater minimum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">We recently rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Segarra </em>and held that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) requires consecutive sentences even when the mandatory minimum sentence for the underlying drug offense is greater than the sentence for the firearm offense. 582 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2009). Based on our decision in <em>Segarra, </em>we hold that the district court did not err by sentencing Valle to a consecutive 60-month sentence for his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Valle\u2019s 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-7\">. The district court also sentenced Valle to 120 months imprisonment for his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), to be served concurrently with the drug offense sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. Valle acknowledges that <em>Segarra </em>is controlling, but appeals to preserve the issue for further review in light of the circuit split on this issue, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>558 F.3d 166 (2d Cir.2009), and the Supreme Court's recent grant of <em>certiorari </em>in two consolidated cases based on similar arguments. <em>See United States v. Abbott, </em>574 F.3d 203 (3d Cir.2009), <em>cert. granted, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1284, 175 L.Ed.2d 1073 (2010); <em>United States v. Gould, </em>329 Fed.Appx. 569 (5th Cir. 2009), <em>cert. granted, </em>-U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1283, 175 L.Ed.2d 1073 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
