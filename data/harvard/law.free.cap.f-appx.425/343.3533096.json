No additional term of probation or supervised release was imposed upon revocation. Hines completed her term of imprisonment while her appeal was pending, and she has been released from prison. Her court-appointed counsel has now moved to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">This appeal requires us to examine sua sponte the basis of our jurisdiction. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Section 2 of Article III of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some collateral consequence of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 118 S.Ct. 978 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Hines has completed the entire sentence imposed for her probation revocation, there is no case or controversy for us to address. <em>See Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 7, 14-18, 118 S.Ct. 978; <em>United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 847-48 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is DISMISSED as moot. Consequently, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
