He was sentenced to three concurrent 76-month terms of imprisonment and three concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>rent two-year terms of supervised release. Esquivel filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">As Esquivel does not challenge his conviction or sentence for illegal reentry, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to that offense. We reject Esquivel\u2019s contention, raised in order to preserve the argument for further review, that under <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000); <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); and <em>United, States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied. As Esquivel concedes, his argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Esquivel challenges his \u00a7 922(g) convictions and sentences, which were based on possession of the same weapons, on the basis that they are multiplicitous and violate double jeopardy. The Government concedes that our decision in <em>United States v. Munoz-Romo, </em>989 F.2d 757, 759-60 (5th Cir.1993), is controlling. Esquivel is correct that his convictions for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and a felon in possession of a firearm violate his rights against double jeopardy. <em>See Munoz-Romo, </em>989 F.2d at 759-60. In light of <em>Munoz-Romo, </em>we remand the case so that the district court may vacate one of the convictions and resentence Esquivel. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
