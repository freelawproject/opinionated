The record reflects that the district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1284 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cSo long as the district court\u2019s view of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, it cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b586-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
