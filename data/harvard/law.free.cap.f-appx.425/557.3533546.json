We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">Sarkis asserts claims based on his employment contract with the Office of the High Representative for Bosnia (\u201cOHR\u201d). Under the purposeful availment test used for contract claims, the court looks to whether the defendant took actions \u201csuch as executing or performing a contract\u201d demonstrating that it \u201cpurposefully avail[ed][it]self of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co., </em>374 F.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir.2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">Sarkis argues that OHR<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in California because it negotiated and entered into a contract with a California resident. However, OHR did not seek out a California resident for Sark-is\u2019s position. It was purely fortuitous that Sarkis had a California address when the parties negotiated his contract. The purposeful availment requirement is intended to ensure that jurisdiction is not based on such \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzew-icz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">Instead the Court has instructed us to \u201cuse a highly realistic approach,\u201d by looking at the \u201cprior negotiations and contemplated future consequences, along with the terms of the contract and the parties\u2019 actual course of dealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478-79, 105 S.Ct. 2174. While OHR contacted Sarkis in California through phone and e-mail to negotiate his contract, the \u201cuse of the mails, telephone or other international communications simply do not qualify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>purposeful activity invoking the benefits and protection of the forum state.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Kennedy, </em>771 F.2d 1244, 1262 (9th Cir.1985). The contemplated future consequences of the contract were that Sarkis would move to Bosnia and work for OHR. The terms of the contract did not make any reference to California, but did identify Sarajevo as Sarkis\u2019s duty station. The actual course of dealing conformed with the terms of the contract; Sarkis moved to Bosnia and worked for OHR in Sarajevo.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">While Sarkis has cited cases where personal jurisdiction was found over an out-of-state company that hired a state resident, all of these cases involved a contract for the state resident to work in the state. One of the purposes of these contracts was for the out-of-state company to conduct business in the state. Here, by contrast, the point of the contract was to have Sark-is move to Bosnia to work for OHR. At no time during his employment did Sarkis perform work in California, nor did his employment contract suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Sarkis also failed to establish personal jurisdiction for his tort claims under the \u201ceffects test\u201d because he has not shown that OHR expressly aimed the alleged conduct at California, causing harm that it knew was likely to be suffered there. <em>See Schwarzenegger, </em>374 F.3d at 803. OHR did not target its solicitation of applications at California, rather it advertised internationally in the <em>Economist. </em>As for the allegedly fraudulent statements made during the negotiations, phone calls and other communications to a forum resident are not sufficient acts to authorize the exercise of personal jurisdiction. <em>Peterson, </em>771 F.2d at 1262. Furthermore, the consequences of the alleged fraud, Sarkis moving to Bosnia, were felt in Bosnia, not California. Finally, the actual firing occurred in Bosnia, and OHR had no way of knowing where Sarkis would go after his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">No matter how many times Sarkis uses the word \u201cCalifornia\u201d in his briefs (approximately 275 times by our count),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he cannot change the fact that he entered into a contract for services to be performed in Bosnia and that any OHR contacts with California were mere coincidence. As such, OHR was not subject to personal jurisdiction in California. Since we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal on personal jurisdiction grounds, there is no need to consider the other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-15\">. Our reasoning for a lack of personal jurisdiction over OHR extends to High Representative Lajcak as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\">. We also note with strong disapproval Appellant\u2019s repeated omission of spaces between words in order to claim that his reply brief just barely fits (by two words) under the word limit. The reply brief is forty-three pages, the length of many opening briefs, making it clear that the brief actually exceeds the limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
