We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-20\">Gurung failed to establish that he was persecuted on account of imputed political opinion. He testified that he refused to cooperate with Maoist guerrillas who demanded money from him, but he provided no evidence that he expressed opposition to the Maoists\u2019 cause or that they considered him a political opponent. Under <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), a bare refusal to cooperate with a guerrilla group is not sufficient to establish persecution on the basis of political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">Gurung has also failed to show that he was persecuted on the basis of his membership in the particular social group of successful businessmen in Nepal. For purposes of the asylum statute, a social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>group must be defined with particularity and be \u201cgenerally ... recognizable to others.\u201d <em>Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 945 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1170-71 (9th Cir.2005). Gurung has not defined the boundaries of the \u201csuccessful businessmen\u201d group or presented evidence that the group is socially visible. Moreover, he has provided no specific evidence that he was a member of any such group. <em>See In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-, </em>24 I. &amp; N.
