We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">The district court correctly concluded that the city of South San Francisco complied with its Personnel Rule \u00a7 13.02(B), which requires that the subject of disciplinary action be allowed \u201cto inspect copies of all materials upon which the disciplinary action is based.\u201d In Selvitella\u2019s hearing before the Personnel Board, the Board accepted testimony that the city produced all of the materials it relied on in deciding to terminate Selvitella. The materials provided Selvitella with his notice of termination were more than sufficient to prove the factual allegations underlying his dismissal \u2014 indeed, Selvitella\u2019s termination could have been supported by his admissions alone \u2014 which constitutes substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion that Selvitella was allowed to inspect all materials on which the decision to terminate him was based. <em>See Rosenblit v. Superior Court, </em>231 Cal.App.3d 1434, 282 Cal.Rptr. 819, 824 (1991) (holding that foundational factual findings material to whether an agency proceeded in the manner required by law are reviewed for substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">The Personnel Board did not abuse its discretion by denying Selvitella\u2019s discovery requests. <em>See Cimarusti v. Superior Ct., </em>79 Cal.App.4th 799, 94 Cal.Rptr.2d 336, 342-43 (2000) (holding that agency evidentiary and discovery decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion). Selvitella\u2019s reliance on <em>Shively v. Stewart, </em>65 Cal.2d 475, 55 Cal.Rptr. 217, 421 P.2d 65 (1966) is misplaced for two reasons. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>Shively </em>dealt with the right to practice one\u2019s profession, not to retain a particular job. Second, even in <em>Shively, </em>the doctors challenging the agency decision were denied discovery with respect to \u201creports and documents gathered by investigators and employees of the board.\u201d <em>Shively, </em>55 Cal.Rptr. at 221, 421 P.2d at 69. The court held that \u201cto secure discovery, there must be a showing of more than a wish for the benefit of all the information in the adversary\u2019s files,\u201d and that \u201csome additional showing of need and specificity\u201d was required. <em>Id. </em>Selvitella has been incapable of even theorizing as to what types of documents or other materials the criminal investigation may have produced that could overcome the clearly established facts of his misconduct. Because the Board properly found that Selvitella had been provided all the materials to which he was entitled under local rules, the district court was correct to conclude that it did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order additional discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Selvitella\u2019s complaint that the Board\u2019s decision was not supported by findings related to the charges against him is without merit. In its decision, the Board noted that it \u201cvoted, unanimously, to uphold the City\u2019s decision.\u201d The Board also referenced the factual conclusions that underlay the City\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">The City terminated Mr. Selvitella\u2019s employment after determining that Mr. Selvitella had engaged in repeated instances of illegal gambling while on duty, used City facilities to conduct illegal gambling activities and facilitated on-duty illegal gambling by a subordinate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Far from leaving any \u201canalytic gap,\u201d as Selvitella suggests, the links between the factual allegations against Selvitella and the rule violations that resulted in his termination were made abundantly clear in the several notices he received regarding the disciplinary action against him, and did not require much explanation in the first place. <em>Cf. Topanga Ass\u2019n for A Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, </em>11 Cal.3d 506, 113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 841, 522 P.2d 12 (1974) (\u201c[Ijmplicit in section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which renders the challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.\u201d) That the Personnel Board decision was brief and incorporated the City\u2019s decision by reference is inconsequential, for the communication of the charges to Selvitella certainly satisfied \u201cthe liberal rules of administrative pleading,\u201d which \u201crequire only that the respondent ... be informed of the substance of the charge and afforded the basic, appropriate elements of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>49 Cal.App.3d 931, 123 Cal.Rptr. 563, 570 (1975); <em>see also Burako v. Munro, </em>174 Cal.App.2d <em>688, </em>345 P.2d 124, 126 (1959) (\u201c[Cjourts are more interested in fair notice to the accused than in adherence to technical rules of pleading.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Selvitella\u2019s emphasis on the Board\u2019s statement that it \u201calso note[d] that the termination is warranted based on Mr. Selvitella\u2019s acknowledged repeated instances of illegal conduct while on duty\u201d is a red herring. That statement merely indicates that, in addition to the several rule violations cited by the City, Selvitella also deserved to be terminated based on the simple fact that his actions were illegal. <em>See </em>South San Francisco Personnel Rule 13 (\u201cThe City may take disciplinary action against any employee for misconduct of any violation of ... any laws.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The Board did not abuse its discretion by terminating Selvitella for his misconduct. Courts review agency penalties \u201cwith great deference to the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Deegan v. Mountain View, </em>72 Cal.App.4th 37, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 690, 695 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>(1999). \u201cThe appellate court reviews the agency\u2019s selection of penalty and, if reasonable minds can differ with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action, it finds no abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Every City official that reviewed Selvitella\u2019s case, including the Fire Chief, the City Manager, the Assistant City Manager, and each member of the unanimous Board, determined that Selvitella should be terminated. Their determination was based on the fact that Selvitella violated City rules by engaging in conduct that he knew was illegal, by encouraging at least one subordinate employee to do the same, and by using City property and equipment to engage in that illegal activity. That is not an unreasonable basis. <em>See Deegan, </em>84 Cal.Rptr.2d at 695. The Board therefore did not abuse its discretion in upholding Selvitella\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
