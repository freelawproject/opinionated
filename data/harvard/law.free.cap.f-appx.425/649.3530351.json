Finding Defendant subject to the federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1)(A), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California imposed a life sentence. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we repeat only those facts necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm Ferguson\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">I. Defendant\u2019s Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">We apply a four-part test to determine if the district court erred under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) in permitting the government to introduce Defendant\u2019s 1998 state court conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-16\">[Ejvidence of prior ... criminal conduct may be admitted if (1) the evidence tends to prove a material point; (2) the other act is not too remote in time; (3) the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the defendant committed the other act; and (4) (in certain cases) the act is similar to the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-17\"><em>United States v. Corona, </em>34 F.3d 876, 881 (9th Cir.1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that \u201c[t]he greater is the dissimilarity of the two offenses, the more tenuous is the relevance.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Miranda, </em>601 F.2d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.1979). The circumstances of the 1998 conviction and the prison fight here are distinct. The 1998 conviction was assault with a semiautomatic weapon in a public place and was not related to a claim of self-defense by Ferguson. The fight here occurred in prison, with fists and feet, and arose from the victim instigating a fight by striking Defendant in the face. For the 1998 conviction to be relevant in these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>stances, the jury first needed to draw a prohibited character inference and conclude that Ferguson had a violent propensity which rendered him unlikely to employ self-defense. This is the inference Rule 404(b) aims to keep from the jury. <em>See United States v. Commanche, </em>577 F.3d 1261, 1269-70 (10th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>964 F.2d 295, 298-99 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Nevertheless, \u201c[a] nonconstitutional evidentiary error will be reversed for abuse of discretion only if the court\u2019s ruling more likely than not affected the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Chu Kong Yin, </em>935 F.2d 990, 994 (9th Cir.1991). Given the overwhelming evidence of guilt against Ferguson, particularly Officer Avila\u2019s description of Ferguson\u2019s escalating retaliation, we conclude that any error in admitting defendant\u2019s prior conviction did not affect the voluntary manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Ferguson also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of Juror No. 8. A trial court\u2019s decision to excuse a juror is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>48 F.3d 1477, 1485 (9th Cir.1995). Once a jury has begun to deliberate, the defendant has a right under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c) not to have the juror substituted without his consent. <em>United States v. Beard, </em>161 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.1998). The dismissal of Juror No. 8 occurred mid-trial and before the jurors were instructed or even permitted to deliberate. The juror raised a valid concern about his impartiality, and the district court\u2019s inquiry of the juror was thorough. The transcript reflects that the juror was hesitant and equivocated in his answers, and the district court acted well within its discretion in replacing the juror with a qualified alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Next, Ferguson argues that the prosecutor misstated the elements of involuntary manslaughter during his closing arguments. Given that it is undisputed that the district court properly instructed the jury as to the elements of the offense and instructed the jurors that they were to follow the court\u2019s words, there is no justification in the circumstances of this case to deviate from the principle that \u201c[t]he jury is regularly presumed to accept the law as stated by the court, not as stated by counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina Casteneda, </em>511 F.3d 1246, 1250 (9th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Finally, there was no error in the district court giving the model jury instruction on reasonable doubt. While reasonable doubt need not be defined for the jury, if given, \u201cthe instructions to the jury must \u2018as a whole, fairly and accurately convey the meaning of reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nolasco, </em>926 F.2d 869, 871 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc). The district court\u2019s instruction clearly satisfied this requirement. <em>See United States v. Bustillo, </em>789 F.2d 1364, 1368 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">II. Defendant\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">The district court sentenced Ferguson to life imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1)(A). Defendant argues that his 2002 Assault on a Postal Employee with Intent to Rob, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114, is a nonqualifying felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(3). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">It is apparent from the record that the 2002 conviction falls within the statute\u2019s \u201csafety valve,\u201d as it neither involved a firearm nor resulted in; serious bodily injury to the victim. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A). The 2002 pre-sentence report (PSR) and the findings of the 2002 sentencing court taken together clearly establish that the injuries inflicted by Fergu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>son did not threaten a substantial risk of death or cause the victim extreme physical pain and disfigurement as described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(h)(3). The 2002 sentencing court accepted the findings in the PSR and used those facts to conclude that a three-point sentencing enhancement was warranted \u2014 a category of bodily injury that is, at a minimum, some quantum less than \u201cserious.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3) (2002). Moreover, the government has not offered any reason to discount Defendant\u2019s showing or to ignore the findings of the sentencing court in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentence is vacated, and this matter is remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
