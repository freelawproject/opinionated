Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, and review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s decision whether to summarily dismiss an appeal. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). Petitioners\u2019 contentions that the IJ applied an incorrect hardship standard and failed to give adequate consideration to some of their hardship evidence are not supported by the record and do not amount to color-able legal or constitutional claims over which we have jurisdiction. <em>See Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 979-80 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by deciding not to summarily dismiss petitioners\u2019 appeal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E), and we lack jurisdiction to the extent petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm without opinion. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 854 (9th Cir.2003) (where the IJ\u2019s decision is unreviewable, so is the BIA\u2019s decision to streamline).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
