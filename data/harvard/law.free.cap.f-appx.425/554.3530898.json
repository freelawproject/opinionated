The district court concluded that Zurich has no duty to defend or indemnify Bickerstaff in a third-party contribution action filed by Spear, Safer, Harmon &amp; Co. (the \u201cunderlying action\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">1. The professional liability policy Zurich issued to Bickerstaff unambiguously excludes \u201cclaims or \u2018costs, charges and expenses\u2019 for or arising out of ... the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Insured or any other person, firm or organization.\u201d Under California law, the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 does \u201cnot import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy. Rather, it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability, and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship.\u201d <em>Acceptance Ins. Co. v. Syufy Enterprises, </em>69 Cal.App.4th 821, 328, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 557 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The underlying action arises from the insolvency of Caduceus, a medical malpractice self-insurance fund. The Florida Department of Insurance, acting as Caduceus\u2019 receiver, initially sued Spear Safer (the \u201creceiver action\u201d). The receiver action set forth allegations that Spear Safer\u2019s \u201cunqualified opinions on Caduceus\u2019 financial statements, among other things, enabled Caduceus to continue to rewrite existing policies, write new insurance policies and leverage its capital well in excess of that allowed under Florida law and past the point of insolvency to the detriment of Caduceus, its policyholders and claimants.\u201d Spear Safer then filed the underlying action against Bickerstaff, seeking contribution and alleging that Bickerstaffs \u201creserve reviews and rate level recommendations ... directly impacted and caused the insolvency of Caduceus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">Bickerstaffs reliance on <em>Marquez Knolls Property Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Executive Risk Indem., Inc., </em>153 Cal.App.4th 228, 62 Cal.Rptr.3d 510 (2007) is misplaced. The <em>Marquez Knolls </em>court concluded that, in the context of the particular insurance policy at issue, an exclusion applied only to claims stemming from the plaintiffs own activities. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 62 Cal.Rptr.3d 510. By contrast, the exclusion in Bickerstaffs policy covers \u201cthe insolvency or bankruptcy of the Insured <em>or any other person, firm or organization.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). As a general matter, the <em>Marquez Knolls </em>court reinforced California\u2019s broad interpretation of \u201carising out of\u2019 language in insurance policy exclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 62 Cal.Rptr.3d 510. Therefore, the receiver and underlying actions, which together allege that Bicker-staff played a causal role in Caduceus\u2019 insolvency, satisfy California\u2019s definition of the term \u201carising out of,\u201d and trigger the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>exclusion. <em>See Syufy, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at 328, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Bickerstaff argues that the complaint in the receiver action alleges that Caduceus\u2019 insolvency occurred in 1993, before Bicker-staff was retained. Thus it characterizes the underlying action as a standard malpractice claim based on work performed for an already insolvent client. Bickerstaff misreads the allegation in the receiver action; it in fact alleges that Caduceus was either \u201cstatutorily impaired <em>or </em>insolvent\u201d by 1993. (emphasis added). Moreover, the legal definition of insolvency describes an ongoing process in which an entity is unable to meet its liabilities \u201cas they mature.\u201d <em>Berg &amp; Berg Enterprises, LLC v. Boyle, </em>178 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1042 n. 23, 100 Cal.Rptr.3d 875 (2009) (quoting Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 501); <em>see also In re Dill, </em>731 F.2d 629, 632 (9th Cir.1984); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 867 (9th ed.2009) (defining insolvency as the \u201ccondition of being unable to pay debts as they fall due or in the usual course of business\u201d or the \u201cinability to pay debts as they mature\u201d). Therefore, even if Caduceus were insolvent in 1993, the exclusionary provision would still apply because the allegation is that Bickerstaff contributed to Caduceus\u2019 worsening financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">2. The doctrine of concurrent causation does not apply because the alleged conduct excluded by the policy was the same as, and not independent of, the covered conduct. Under the doctrine, \u201c[Coverage cannot be defeated simply because a separate excluded risk constitutes an additional cause of the injury\u201d independent of the covered risk. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Partridge, </em>10 Cal.3d 94, 109 Cal.Rptr. 811, 514 P.2d 123, 125 (1973). Here the receiver and underlying actions both allege that Bickerstaffs work contributed to Caduceus\u2019 insolvency, and therefore the covered risk of malpractice \u201cdid not exist independently of the other risk[ ] not covered by the policy\u201d but rather was \u201cdirectly connected to the excluded risk[ ]\u201d of insolvency. <em>Medill v. Westport Ins. Corp., </em>143 Cal.App.4th 819, 835, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 570 (2006). Bickerstaff erroneously relies on <em>Conestoga Servs. Corp. v. Exec. Risk Indemnity, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 976, 983 (9th Cir.2002), which applied the doctrine where the excluded risk of bankruptcy and the insured risk of malpractice both independently contributed to a third party\u2019s damages, but distinguished a scenario similar to Bickerstaffs in which the insured is sued <em>\u201cbecause </em>[the third party] went bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">3. While an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify, neither the allegations in the complaints nor any extrinsic facts known to Zurich \u201cgive rise to the potential of liability under the policy.\u201d <em>Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co., </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168, 177 (1966). The potential of liability that would trigger the duty to defend can be found based on either a comparison of the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy, or consideration of extrinsic facts that \u201creveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153, 1157 (1993). Here, the complaints in the receiver and underlying actions together allege that Bickerstaffs conduct contributed to Caduceus\u2019 insolvency, thus squarely falling under the terms of the policy exclusion. Bickerstaff suggests that there is a potential of liability under the policy because Caduceus\u2019 financial situation might improve, and therefore the pleadings could be amended to reflect that it is no longer insolvent. However, an \u201cinsured may not trigger the duty to defend by speculating about extraneous \u2018facts\u2019 regarding potential liability or ways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>in which the third party claimant might amend its complaint at some future date.\u201d <em>Gunderson v. Fire Ins. Exchange, </em>37 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1114, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 272 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Because we conclude that the policy excludes coverage for Spear Safer\u2019s contribution action, we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Zurich did not have a duty to indemnify Bickerstaff, or to provide it with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
