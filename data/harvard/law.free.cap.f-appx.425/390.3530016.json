The district court varied upward from the Sentencing Guidelines imprisonment range in sentencing Cortez to a 70-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Cortez gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Cortez contends that the district court abused its discretion in failing to explain adequately the extent of its upward variance from the Sentencing Guidelines imprisonment range. Cortez contends also that the sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the mitigating circumstance of Cortez\u2019s history of alcohol and drug abuse, and because the length of the sentence was greater than necessary to effectuate the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for procedural error and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The district court did not fail to consider Cortez\u2019s drug and alcohol abuse; rather, it explained that it did not regard such abuse to be a mitigating factor. Because of Cortez\u2019s mendacity and extensive and violent criminal history, the court stated, a non-Guidelines sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to deter future criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes, and to provide just punishment for the offense. The district court\u2019s reasons were adequate. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Unlike <em>United States v. Kirkpatrick, </em>589 F.3d 414, 415-16 (7th Cir. 2009), cited by Cortez, the district court\u2019s reasons were not conclusional and do not indicate that the sentence was arbitrarily chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">While the variance in this case is significant, this court has affirmed similar variances and departures. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008). There is no indication that the district court failed to (1) \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d (2) gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or (3) made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. The sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Cortez has shown no more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the Section 3553(a) factors, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
