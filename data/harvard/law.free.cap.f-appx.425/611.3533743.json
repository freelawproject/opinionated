He challenges the district court\u2019s denial of two requests for change of counsel, both of which were made within two weeks of a retrial. It is undisputed that either motion, if granted, would have required a continuance. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We review the denial of motions to substitute or withdraw counsel for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>560 F.3d 1107, 1113 (9th Cir.2009) (motion to withdraw); <em>United States v. Torres-Rodriguez, </em>930 F.2d 1375, 1380 (9th Cir.1991) (motion to substitute), <em>overruled on other grounds by Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). In doing so, we consider three factors: (1) the adequacy of the inquiry into the alleged conflict between the defendant and counsel, (2) whether the conflict resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense, and (3) the timeliness of the motion and possible delay. <em>Carter, </em>560 F.3d at 1113; <em>Torres-Rodriguez, </em>930 F.2d at 1380 &amp; n. 2 (explaining that the three-factor analysis applies to a motion to substitute retained counsel where trial would be delayed as a result).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">1. Here, the three factors support the denial of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. First, during an ex parte hearing, the district court fully explored the conflict over the defense strategy for retrial. This inquiry provided a sufficient basis for the district court to make an informed decision. Notably, Comans has not indicated what information the district court lacked in making its decision. Second, the disagreement over defense strategy is insufficient, without more, to establish a conflict that would prevent an adequate defense. <em>United States v. Reyes-Bosque, </em>596 F.3d 1017, 1034 (9th Cir .2010) (concluding that defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with defense strategy did not require change of counsel), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 898, 178 L.Ed.2d 758 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Third, the district court found that the delay of retrial was unjustified because the motion to withdraw was motivated by fee issues and Comans\u2019s desire to delay retrial, rather than the conflict. The district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous given counsel\u2019s focus on fee issues and Comans\u2019s history of requesting continuances shortly before trial. <em>See Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (a district court\u2019s findings are not in clear error if \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety\u201d); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>587 F.3d 1165, 1174-75 (9th Cir.2009) (history of continuances supported court\u2019s finding that motion for change of counsel was brought for delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">2. Consideration of these three factors also supports the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for substitution of counsel. First, the district court held another hearing that provided a sufficient basis for the court\u2019s decision. Comans again has not pointed to any information the court lacked in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">Second, although there was a breakdown in communications after the denial of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, it did not prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>an adequate defense because counsel had already discovered all of the relevant facts in the case and developed a full defense theory. <em>Cf. Brown v. Craven, </em>424 F.2d 1166, 1169-70 (9th Cir.1970) (discussing a debilitating conflict that prevented counsel from developing the facts, interviewing witnesses, and putting on more than a perfunctory defense). The record reflects that counsel\u2019s decision not to call witnesses at retrial was tactical qnd not the result of a breakdown in communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Third, the district court\u2019s finding that delay of retrial was unjustified is supported by Comans\u2019s history of continuances, <em>see Thompson, </em>587 F.3d at 1174-75, as well as the district court\u2019s assessment that the conflict over the use of expert testimony was inconsequential because there were no issues for which expert testimony would be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
