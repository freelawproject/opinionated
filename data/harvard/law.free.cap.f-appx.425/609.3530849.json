We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Biurquez-Zaragoza contends that the district court erred when it determined that his prior conviction for attempted robbery categorically qualified as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. He argues that the Kansas definition of robbery is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines because it contains no element of violent force. This is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">We have previously held that the enumerated offenses are <em>\u201cper se </em>crimes of violence .... even though \u2018force,\u2019 as such, is not an essential element for conviction of those offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir. 2003). This holding was not altered by <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), which only addressed the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d as used in the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). \u201cCrime of Violence\u201d as used in the sentencing guidelines is a term of art; it explicitly includes crimes that do not contain an element of violent force such as statutory rape, arson, extortion and extortionate extension of credit. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 at cmt. n.(l)(B)(iii). <em>See also Pereira-Salmeron, </em>337 F.3d at 1152; <em>United States v. Harris, </em>572 F.3d 1065, 1066 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (recognizing that a robbery statute may meet the generic definition of robbery even if the robbery statute makes the degree of force immaterial); <em>United States v. Gomez-Leon, </em>545 F.3d 777, 789 (9th Cir.2008) (stating that when the court considers whether a crime of conviction falls within the list of enumerated offenses, it does so without regard for whether the crime meets the requirement of the application note\u2019s alternative residual clause element test). Biurquez-Zaragoza\u2019s conviction for attempted robbery therefore qualifies as a crime of -violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 5 (stating that prior conviction for attempt to commit crime of -violence constitutes crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Biurquez-Zaragoza also contends in his reply brief that his crime of conviction was not categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 because Kansas\u2019s definition of \u201cattempt\u201d is broader than the federal definition. Biurquez-Zaragoza forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in his opening brief. <em>See Eberle v. City of Anaheim, </em>901 F.2d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1990). Even were we to reach the merits of this claim, Biurquez-Zaragoza\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. When a state\u2019s definition of \u201cattempt\u201d is different from the federal definition, as is the case here, we look to how the state applies the definition to see if it overlaps in practice with the federal definition. <em>United States v. Rivera-Ramos, </em>578 F.3d 1111, 1114 (9th Cir.2009). After reviewing cases from the Kansas Supreme Court, we conclude that Kansas applies the \u201covert act\u201d test in the same way the Ninth Circuit applies the \u201csubstantial step\u201d test. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gobin, </em>216 Kan. 278, 531 P.2d 16, 19 (Kan. 1975) (collecting cases) (stating that attempt requires \u201csteps beyond mere preparation by doing something directly moving toward and bringing nearer the crime\u201d and must approach \u201csufficiently near to consummation of the offense\u201d); <em>see also State v. Peterman, </em>280 Kan. 56, 118 P.3d 1267 (2005); <em>State v. Martens, </em>274 Kan. 459, 54 P.3d 960 (2002); <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>251 Kan. 54, 833 P.2d 925 (1992); <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>245 Kan. 691, 783 P.2d 1239 (1989); <em>State v. Garner, </em>237 Kan. 227, 699 P.2d 468 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b633-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
