Ratliff, an attorney, successfully represented two claimants in their efforts to receive benefits from the Social Security Administration. Ratliff then filed a motion with the district court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b). The district court granted the motion, but the government reduced the award because of debts the claimants owed the government. Ratliff challenged the government\u2019s reduction, but the district court rejected Rat-liffs challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-20\">In a prior opinion in this case, we reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, finding that since \u201cEAJA attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded to prevailing parties\u2019 attorneys, ... the government\u2019s withholding of the fee awards to cover the claimants\u2019 debts was in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ratliff v. Astrue, </em>540 F.3d 800, 802 (8th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court of the United States subsequently reversed this court\u2019s judgment, finding that an award of EAJA attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cis payable to the litigant\u201d rather than the litigant\u2019s attorney \u201cand is therefore subject to a Government offset to satisfy a pre-existing debt that the litigant owes the United States.\u201d <em>Astrue v. Ratliff, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2521, 2524, 177 L.Ed.2d 91 (2010). Having reconsidered this case in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, we now vacate our prior opinion and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
