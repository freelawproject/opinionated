Judge Cornish (Mr. Cornish) appeals the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\u2019s January 21, 2010 and March 8, 2010 orders denying him temporary reinstatement to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) roster of active registered practitioners pending resolution of his lawsuit. Mr. Cornish filed his Notice of Appeal on March 22, 2010. During the pen-dency of this appeal, the district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment regarding some of Mr. Cornish\u2019s claims and dismissed Mr. Cornish\u2019s remaining claims. <em>Cornish v. Du-das, </em>715 F.Supp.2d 56 (D.D.C.2010). The district court entered final judgment against Mr. Cornish, which Mr. Cornish has separately appealed. <em>Cornish v. Kap-pos </em>(Appeal No.2011-1041).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-25\">In light of the district court\u2019s entry of final judgment in the underlying action, Mr. Cornish\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his requests for injunctive relief pending the resolution of his lawsuit is moot. <em>See Harper v. Poway Unified Sch. Dist., </em>549 U.S. 1262, 127 S.Ct. 1484, 167 L.Ed.2d 225 (2007); <em>see also Fundicao Tupy v. United States, </em>841 F.2d 1101, 1103 (Fed.Cir.1988) (dismissing an interlocutory appeal of the Court of International Trade\u2019s denial of injunctive relief because intervening final decision rendered the interlocutory appeal moot). Because Mr. Cornish\u2019s lawsuit is no longer \u201cpending resolution\u201d before the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>court, \u201c[t]here is no longer any need to preserve the trial court\u2019s power to provide an effective remedy on the merits, which is the purpose of a preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>Fundicao Tupy, </em>841 F.2d at 1103. In conclusion, we must dismiss Mr. Cornish\u2019s interlocutory appeal, because the entry of final judgment has rendered it moot. In light of this dismissal, all of Mr. Cornish\u2019s outstanding motions filed in this appeal are likewise moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
