After we remanded the case for further proceedings regarding the application of a particular sentencing adjustment, the district court imposed the same sentence. Patterson again appeals. His appointed counsel, however, has determined that there are no nonfrivolous issues that Patterson can pursue on appeal and moves to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Patterson has not accepted our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). We confine our review to the potential issue identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Cano-Rodriguez, </em>552 F.3d 637, 638 (7th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">At Patterson\u2019s first sentencing, the district court calculated two versions of his guidelines range. Under the first version the court applied the guidelines provision for Patterson\u2019s violation of \u00a7 2423(a), setting his base-offense level at 28, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(a)(3), and imposing three 2-level increases, respectively, for undue influence of a minor, \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(2)(B), using a computer to commit the offense, \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3)(B), and involving the minor in a commercial sex act, \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(4)(B). Patterson also received a 2-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, \u00a7 3El.l(a), resulting in a total offense level of 32, which, when combined with a criminal history category of IV, yielded a guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. Based on the discovery that Patterson\u2019s 1983 conviction for robbery with a deadly weapon qualified him as a career offender, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the court then recalculated his guidelines range under \u00a7 4B1.1; as such his base-offense level rose to 34 (supplanting the lower base-offense level initially assessed under \u00a7 261.3), which the court again discounted by 2 levels for acceptance of responsibility. His criminal-history category was also reassessed at VI, yielding a guidelines range of 210 to 262 months. The court sentenced Patterson to the top of that range, emphasizing his long criminal history, the particularly reprehensible nature of his conduct, the need to protect the public, and the unlikelihood of rehabilitation. We affirmed the court\u2019s judgment in all respects except one: we reversed the application of the increase under \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3) for Patterson\u2019s use of a computer to facilitate the minor\u2019s online prostitution and remanded the case \u201cto ensure that [the increase] played no part in Patterson\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>576 F.3d 431, 443 (7th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">On remand the district court again sentenced Patterson to 262 months. \u201c[T]he reasons for that sentence,\u201d the court stated, \u201care expressed in the [first] judgment that I entered. And I don\u2019t see any change in that.\u201d The court emphasized the same sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that it discussed at the first sentencing hearing: Patterson\u2019s crime was \u201cparticularly callous and cruel\u201d because he had \u201cabused terribly a young and innocent person that was essentially defenseless\u201d; Patterson committed the offense just weeks after having been released from prison for his last crime; Patterson had \u201cno respect for his fellow human beings\u201d; and \u201cthe necessity to protect the public is paramount.\u201d The court said nothing about Patterson\u2019s use of a computer as a factor influencing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Counsel considers whether Patterson could challenge the reimposition of his 262-month sentence. Because this is Patterson\u2019s second appeal, however, he correctly notes that any arguments he could raise are limited by the scope of our remand. <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>483 F.3d 509, 514-15 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Husband, </em>312 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>101 F.3d 527, 528 (7th Cir.1996). Here the remand was limited to ensuring that the \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3) adjustment did not affect Patterson\u2019s sentence. <em>Patterson, </em>576 F.3d at 443. To this end counsel correctly notes that the career-offender provision dictated Patterson\u2019s guidelines range and that the \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3) adjustment was not factored into the sentence. Moreover, the court\u2019s rationale for imposing a 262-month sentence made no reference to any computer use. In fact, the court clarified that it based Patterson\u2019s high-end sentence on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in particular his extensive criminal history and the need to protect the public. Although the court might have been more explicit in stating that computer use did not affect sentencing, we agree with counsel that raising this issue on appeal would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We therefore GRANT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS Patterson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
