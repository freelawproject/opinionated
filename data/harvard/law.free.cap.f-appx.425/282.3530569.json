To show that a pretrial detainee\u2019s right to adequate medical care was violated requires the plaintiff to establish, among other things, \u201cthat the prison official had a culpable state of mind \u2014 that the official was deliberately indifferent to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., </em>74 F.3d 633, 648 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc) (citing <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833-34, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). The plaintiff must show that the officials \u201chad gained actual knowledge of the substantial risk ... and responded with deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650. Here, as the district court thoroughly explained, the undisputed summary-judgment evidence showed that the City and the County officers were unaware that the plaintiffs brother was suffering from a subdural hematoma, described in the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ord as an \u201cinvisible brain bleed.\u201d Therefore, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the \u201cofficers ... had gained actual knowledge of\u2019 her brother\u2019s serious medical needs, and accordingly, failed to show that her brother\u2019s constitutional rights were violated. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Further, the plaintiffs opening brief abandons any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the only individually-named defendants in this suit are sued in their official capacities and the plaintiff acknowledged at oral argument that the individually-named defendants are sued in their official capacities. \u201c[Ojfficialcapacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.... Because the real party in interest in an official-capacity suit is the governmental entity and not the named official, the entity\u2019s \u2018policy or custom\u2019 must have played a part in the violation of federal law.\u201d <em>Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom ... inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The \u201cofficial policy must be \u2018the moving force of the constitutional violation\u2019 in order to establish the liability of a government body under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Polk Cnty. v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 326, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981) (quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018). The plaintiffs summary-judgment evidence failed to show that a policy or custom of the defendants was the moving force of the alleged constitutional violation here, <em>viz., </em>that the plaintiffs deceased brother\u2019s serious medical needs were met with deliberate indifference on the part of the confining officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants on the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 deliberate indifference claim, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
