The district court ruled that Rhodes\u2019s claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was untimely and that his tort claims were barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The district court later awarded Rhodes his attorney\u2019s fees and costs because Bamaco had failed to produce its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy during the discovery period, and Bamaco cross-appeals that sanction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Bamaco is a general contractor that manages disaster-related work. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August 2005, Bamaco entered a contract to remove debris in the State of Mississippi, and Bamaco subcontracted the physical labor to P &amp; L Construction Company and its subcontractors. Rhodes was hired by P &amp; L or Bamaco to perform labor for the Katrina project. According to Rhodes, \u201cwithin hours of beginning work\u201d on the project, he was electrocuted, fell, and broke his foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">On March 9, 2006, Rhodes applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. Rhodes stated on his petition to contravert that he was an employee of P &amp; L, not Bamaco. On December 22, 2006, an administrative judge dismissed Rhodes\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">On September 15, 2008, Rhodes filed in the district court a complaint against P &amp; L and Bamaco to recover disability benefits and medical expenses. Rhodes alleged that the companies had \u201cdenied coverage\u201d for worker compensation and had negligently and wantonly failed to \u201cmaintain a safe working environment\u201d or \u201cto properly train and supervise their employees.\u201d Rhodes sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">The district court dismissed P &amp; L from the action because Rhodes failed to provide proof of timely service, and Bamaco answered with a denial that it had employed Rhodes. Bamaco later moved for summary judgment and argued that Rhodes\u2019s complaint about workers\u2019 compensation benefits and negligence was untimely and that he was barred from suing in tort for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Bamaco. The district court ruled that Rhodes\u2019s complaint was untimely and that his right to compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act barred him from recovering in tort. The district court invited Rhodes to move for sanctions because Bamaco had failed to disclose information about its workers\u2019 compensation insurance in its initial and supplemental responses to discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Rhodes moved for reconsideration and for sanctions against Bamaco, and the district court granted Rhodes partial relief. The district court rejected Rhodes\u2019s argument that Bamaco had failed to \u201csecure payment\u201d of insurance as required by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but the district court granted Rhodes\u2019s request for sanctions. The district court ruled that Bamaco should have disclosed earlier that it had workers\u2019 compensation insurance when Rhodes had been injured and that Rhodes had \u201cincur[red] attorney\u2019s fees and expenses that could have been avoided if Bamaco had divulged the existence of the policy.\u201d The district court awarded Rhodes $88,722.50 in attorney\u2019s fees and $7,135.53 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Rhodes was not entitled to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Bamaco because he failed to apply timely for those benefits. Under the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cif no payment of compensation ... is made and no application for benefits filed with the commission within two years from the date of the injury or death, the right to compensation ... shall be barred.\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-35(1). \u201c[A]n \u2018application for benefits\u2019 as referenced in ... Section 71-3-35(1) ... means a petition to controvert, or some variation of a petition or motion, filed with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission by the claimant.\u201d <em>Tupelo Public Sch. Dist. v. Parker, </em>912 So.2d 1070, 1072 (Miss. Ct.App.2005). Bamaco never compensated Rhodes for his injuries, and Rhodes never filed a petition with the Commission to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits from Bamaco.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Rhodes argues that the two-year limitations period was tolled because Bamaco failed to notify the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission of Rhodes\u2019s injury and Bama-co withheld information about its insurance, but his arguments fail. An employer is required under Mississippi law to file an injury report with the Commission within ten days of an injury that has caused an employee to miss more than five days of work, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-67, but \u201cthe failure of an employer to file notice, alone, is not sufficient to require estoppel,\u201d <em>Nicholson v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>51 So.3d 995, 998 (Miss.Ct.App.2010); <em>see Prentice v. Schindler Elevator Co., </em>13 So.3d 1258, 1260 (Miss.2009). Although the statute of limitation may be tolled if an \u201cemployer misrepresents the nature and existence of its coverage and the employee relies on such statements,\u201d <em>Holbrook ex rel. Hol-brook v. Albright Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>703 So.2d 842, 844 (Miss.1997), Rhodes failed to introduce any evidence that he refrained from applying for workers compensation benefits based on a misrepresentation by Bamaco during the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Rhodes argues that his complaint of negligence was timely, but we need not address that argument because Rhodes\u2019s complaints about negligence and wantonness are both barred under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In Mississippi, an employer is required to \u201csecure the payment to his employees of the compensation payable under [the] provisions\u201d of the Act, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-7, by either \u201chavfing] in effect a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy or be[ing] a qualified self-insurer,\u201d <em>Washington v. Tem\u2019s Junior, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number><em>Inc., </em>981 So.2d 1047, 1051 (Miss.Ct.App. 2008) (citing Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-75). Bamaco established that it had \u201csecured payment\u201d by obtaining workers\u2019 compensation insurance in Mississippi from Twin City Fire Insurance Company and that Twin City Fire Insurance had a valid \u201cMississippi Privilege License\u201d on the date that Rhodes had been injured. Because Bamaco had secured payment for its employees, its \u201cliability ... to pay compensation ... [was] exclusive and in place of all other liability\u201d to Rhodes, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 71-3-9, and guaranteed Bamaco \u201cimmunity from suit in tort for [Rhodes\u2019s] injuries],\u201d Tem<em>\u2019s Junior, </em>981 So.2d at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Rhodes argues that Bamaco failed in three ways to \u201csecure payment\u201d as required by section 71-3-7, but we disagree. First, Rhodes argues that Bamaco\u2019s insurance policy provided worker\u2019s compensation coverage only in Alabama, but the policy included an \u201cother state\u201d endorsement that provided identical coverage to Bamaco\u2019s employees in Mississippi. Second, Rhodes argues that Bamaco failed to give its insurer notice that it was working in Mississippi, but Bamaco presented undisputed evidence that it \u201cnotified its insurer via telephone that it was working in Mississippi.\u201d Third, Rhodes argues that Bamaco failed to register its policy with the Mississippi Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, but Rhodes fails to cite any authority that makes the guarantee of immunity under section 71-3-9 contingent on registration. Bamaco \u201csecured payment\u201d for its employees in Mississippi, and \u201c[t]he prerequisite for immunity\u201d did not require Bamaco to \u201ctimely inform the Commission of an employee\u2019s injury or ensure that a particular employee [was] paid the benefits to which he is entitled under the Act.\u201d <em>Tem\u2019s Junior, </em>981 So.2d at 1050-51. After Bamaco \u201c \u2018secure[d] payment of compensation\u2019 through a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy,\u201d its \u201cstatutory responsibility to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits bec[ame] the responsibility of the carrier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Bamaco cross-appeals the sanction for its failure to disclose earlier its workers\u2019 compensation insurance, but the district court was entitled to sanction Bamaco for withholding information about its insurance policy. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1)(A). Bamaco argues that it was substantially justified in failing to disclose its policy, but Rhodes alleged that he was an employee of Bamaco and \u201ca party must\u201d produce in its initial disclosures \u201cany insurance agreement under which an insurance business <em>may </em>be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(l)(A)(iv) (emphasis added). Rhodes also was harmed by Bamaco\u2019s misrepresentations. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). Based on Bamaco\u2019s statements in its disclosures that it did \u201cnot have insurance for the claims asserted against it in this action,\u201d Rhodes \u201ccontinued to pursue a remedy (the civil action) which was not available.\u201d Rhodes incurred attorney\u2019s fees and expenses unnecessarily, and Bamaco does not challenge as unreasonable the amount of the sanction. The district court rejected Rhodes\u2019s request to exclude evidence of the insurance policy, <em>see id., </em>because Bamaco disclosed two weeks before discovery ended that it \u201chad a commercial general liability policy in effect at the time of the Hurricane Katrina Gulf-port, Mississippi job\u201d and Rhodes did not request an extension of time to investigate the policy. \u201c[W]e cannot say that we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in\u201d deciding to award attorney\u2019s fees and expenses \u201cafter its weighing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>Plywood Antitrust Litig., </em>655 F.2d 627, 638 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We AFFIRM both the summary judgment against Rhodes and the sanction against Bamaco.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
