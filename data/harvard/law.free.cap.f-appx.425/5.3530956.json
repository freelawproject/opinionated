Kravitz, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b29-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b29-21\">Plaintiff-appellants Oleg Zapolski and Sofiya Zapolskaya, each proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeal from the District Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>judgment dismissing their amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-22\">With respect to the dismissal based upon appellants\u2019 failure to state a claim, a court has the inherent authority to dismiss meritless claims. <em>See Fitzgerald v. First E. Seventh St. Tenants Corp., </em>221 F.3d 362, 363-64 (2d Cir.2000) (affirming the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint, notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff had paid the filing fee rather than requesting permission to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)). Although the standard of review to be employed for such dismissals has not been decided, we need not reach that issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>because the district court\u2019s dismissal withstands even <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Fitzgerald, </em>221 F.3d at 364 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Even though all allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is \u201cinapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim will have \u201cfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">With respect to the District Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, if a court \u201cdetermines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings regarding subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities ACT (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. See Robinson v. Gov\u2019t of Malay., </em>269 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir.2001). \u201c[T]he FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.\u201d <em>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). \u201cSubject to existing international agreements to which the United States [was] a party at the time of enactment of [the FSIA], a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States ... except as provided in [28 U.S.C.] sections 1605-1607.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Having conducted an independent and de novo review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the judgment of the District Court for substantially the same reasons stated in its thorough and well-reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">We have considered all of the arguments raised by appellants and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
