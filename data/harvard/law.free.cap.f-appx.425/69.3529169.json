April 13, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 076 609 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 27, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-19\">The BIA did not err in finding that Lolia failed to establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal because he did not demonstrate that the mistreatment he suffered was on account of any protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). Lolia argues that he was attacked by a group of soldiers working under Joseph Kabila, the current DRC President and member of the Swahili ethnic group, because of his Baluba ethnicity. However, he testified that he was beaten and robbed by a group of men, some in uniforms and some not, and that \u201cyou could not tell the difference who was who.\u201d Furthermore, Lolia did not testify that the group gave any indication that they targeted him due to his ethnicity or for any reason other than to take his possessions. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the record does not <em>compel </em>a conclusion that Lolia\u2019s ethnicity was a motivating factor in the attack. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zaca-rias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This is especially true in light of the country conditions evidence in the record which, although enumerating a plethora of human rights abuses in the DRC, makes no mention of Swahili/Baluba tensions, attributing the problems to general country-wide strife.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">With respect to the attack against Lolia\u2019s father, \u201can asylum applicant cannot claim past persecution based solely on harm that was inflicted on a family member on account of that family member\u2019s political opinion or other protected characteristic.\u201d <em>See Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2007). Although Lolia could nevertheless demonstrate his eligibility for relief if he could show that he \u201cnot only shares (or is perceived to share) the characteristic that motivated persecutors to harm the family member, but was also within the zone of risk when the family member was harmed,\u201d <em>id., </em>he testified that he was not present when his father was attacked. Therefore, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Lolia could establish that his father\u2019s attack was motivated by an enumerated protected ground, because the record does not compel the conclusion that Lolia\u2019s own mistreatment was due to any protected ground, his claim for asylum and withholding of removal was properly denied. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1); <em>Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 178; <em>Tao Jiang, </em>500 F.3d at 141-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Finally, with respect to Lolia\u2019s claim for relief under the CAT, because he addresses the issue only in a \u201csingle conclusory sentence\u201d in his brief, we deem this argument abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
