BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">This diversity case presents questions of Mississippi law on which Mississippi should have the final answer and for which Mississippi affords the means to obtain that answer. Guided by the great principles of federalism, we defer decision and certify decisive questions to the Supreme Court of Mississippi,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to its Rule 46, adopted August 1, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Our problem \u2014 choice of law, Mississippi or Nebraska \u2014 arises out of the following situation. Plaintiff-Appellant Joseph Boardman, age 19, was a student in Mississippi during the 1978-79 school term. During the summer of 1979 he worked in Gulf-port, Mississippi for his uncle. While at school, Joseph had been permitted by his father to operate an automobile which was insured under his father\u2019s insurance policy issued by defendant United Services Automobile Association (USAA). Joseph Board-man drove this automobile until his father delivered it to Joseph\u2019s sister. After Joseph no longer had the car, Henry Board-man requested USAA to remove Joseph as a named insured from his automobile insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">On June 20, 1979, Joseph Boardman purchased a 1970 Chevrolet Caprice from an automobile dealer in Gulfport, Mississippi. He applied for a title and purchased and obtained a Mississippi license tag for his car. After Joseph purchased this particular automobile he discussed with his father having it insured by USAA, but no insurance was purchased, nor was any notice of the acquisition of a new vehicle given to USAA prior to Joseph\u2019s accident on July 8, 1979. Thus, prior to the date of the accident, Joseph\u2019s 1970 Chevrolet was never added to the policy of his father, nor was any premium paid for coverage under any other insurance contract. Joseph\u2019s claim for compensation for his personal injuries arising out of an accident with an uninsured motorist was denied by USAA under the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause on the grounds that Joseph was driving a motor vehicle which Joseph solely owned, which was not an insured vehicle as defined under the USAA policy of his father.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking an adjudication that there existed uninsured motorist coverage for Joseph\u2019s personal injuries under Henry Boardman\u2019s policy. They also sought an adjudication that the uninsured motorist benefits could be stacked under the terms and provisions of the automobile insurance contract for a total coverage of $60,000. Defendant USAA filed a cross motion for summary judgment seeking an adjudication that there was no uninsured motorist coverage for Joseph\u2019s accident. USAA also sought an adjudication that there could be no stacking even if the court found that the coverage existed and that the limitation on benefits available to Joseph Boardman was $10,000.00, the minimum statutory requirement of the Mississippi Safety Responsibility Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">In its opinion, the District Court held that Mississippi law would be applied to the insurance contract under the Mississippi choice of law \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d test. The Court also held that (i) the exclusionary clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relied upon by USAA was void as a violation of Mississippi public policy; (ii) Joseph Boardman was an insured under the USAA policy; (iii) the contract of insurance existing between Henry Boardman and USAA provided uninsured motorist coverage to Joseph Boardman; and (iv) the language of the limitation of liability clause found in the policy was ambiguous, thus permitting stacking of the policy limits to provide a total uninsured motorist coverage of $60,000. The interlocutory appeal of USAA was granted on May 16, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">This diversity suit, filed in a Mississippi federal district court, requires that we apply the choice of law rules a Mississippi court would apply had the case been filed in a state court. <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). While it is clear that the Mississippi Supreme Court in choice of law situations applies and recognizes the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d test, such a decision under that test clearly applicable to the fact situation in this case eludes us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While it is clear that under this approach, \u201cthe Court trying the action applies the law of the place which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>has the most significant relationship to the event and parties, or which, because of the relationship or contact with the event or parties, has the greatest concern with the specific issues with respect to the liabilities and rights of the parties to the litigation,\u201d <em>Craig v. Columbus Compress and Warehouse Co., </em>210 So.2d 645 (Miss.1968), it is precisely the significance or the lack of significance of these contacts which troubles us. We discern no clear path from the cases cited by the District Court or the parties. In addition to the unknown relative weight to be given by Mississippi to the choice influencing principles of \u00a7 6 and the relevant comments of the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is also unclear how the Mississippi courts employ the more specific \u00a7 188<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u00a7 198<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which appear to bear on the case before us. Also at stake is the weight of the policy embodied in the Mississippi Safety Responsibility Act in helping to assure that motorists involved in accidents with uninsured motorists do not become public charges in Mississippi. Finally, depending almost certainly on the choice of law decision is the validity of the USAA policy\u2019s uninsured motorist exclusionary clause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-15\">(1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-16\">(2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see \u00a7 187), the contracts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-17\">(a) the place of contracting,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-18\">(b) the place of negotiation of the contract,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-19\">(c) the place of performance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-20\">(d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-21\">(e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-22\">These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-24\">(3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 189-199 and 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Fully aware of Mississippi\u2019s imprimatur on \u00a7 6 we might \u2014 by piecing together some of our own deliverances and the District Court opinions dutifully following them\u2014 come up with a fair prediction of what Mississippi would hold in this case, but we do not think this a wise course. At issue is a matter of great importance to Mississippi. With facilities for positive determination so readily at hand through certification, it is for Mississippi \u2014 not us as a fortuitous momentary spokesman \u2014 to make its own policy decisions. This is especially so with respect to the ever growing number of serious automobile accidents on the state\u2019s highways involving out-of-state vehicles covered or not covered by insurance policies obtained at earlier times and places by persons in our nomadic society.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Concerned that we uphold our Erie<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> duty to apply the substantive law of the forum state in a diversity case, we seek guidance from the one court constitutionally entitled to supply it. Indeed, as this case centers upon the strength of local Mississippi policies this course is mandated by the principles of federalism. Federal courts should hesitate to \u201ctrade judicial robes for the garb of prophet\u201d J. Brown, <em>Certification </em>\u2014 Federalism <em>in Action, </em>7 Cum.L.Rev. 455 (1977), when an available certification procedure renders the crystal ball or divining rod unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Following our usual practice, we are requesting counsel to submit a joint statement of facts and a proposed certificate of questions, <em>see West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>504 F.2d 967 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-10\">. <em>See generally In re McClintock, </em>558 F.2d 732, n. 2, 3, 4, and 5 (5th Cir.1977) and cases cited; J.

If Nebraska law is held to govern the insurance contract, the exclusionary clause is valid because the Supreme Court of Nebraska has clearly upheld the validity of the insurance contract\u2019s exclusionary language denying benefits for uninsured motorist coverage. Accordingly, if Nebraska law applies under the Mississippi \"center of gravity\" test, Joseph Boardman cannot recover for his injuries. <em>See Herrick v. Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co., </em>202 Neb. 116, 274 N.W.2d 147 (1979). The <em>Herrick </em>Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-28\">In <em>Shipley v. American Standard Insurance Co. of Wisconsin, </em>183 Neb. 109, 158 N.W.2d 238 (1968), the Plaintiff was operating an uninsured motorcycle when he was injured in a collision with another motorcycle operated by an uninsured motorist. We held that the Plaintiff could not recover under the uninsured motorist provision of a policy which insured a Chevrolet automobile owned by the Plaintiff excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury to an insured while occupying an automobile (other than an insured automobile) owned by the named insured____ We held that an uninsured motorist endorsement should be interpreted in light of the statutory requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>concerning victims of negligent and financial irresponsible motorists, citing <em>Stephens v. Allied Mutual Insurance Company, </em>182 Neb. 562, 156 N.W.2d 133, (1968).

He might expect the uninsured motorist endorsement to cover loss while he was operating his motorcycle, but such expectations are unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-8\">The statute, of course, relates to automobile liability insurance policies. It requires that uninsured motorist coverage be included in any such policies delivered or issued for delivery in the state unless rejected by the insured. The purpose of the coverage is to protect the insured from uninsured motorists who do not have liability insurance on their vehicle. <em>It is difficult to find a policy in the statute to protect one uninsured motorist from another uninsured motorist. </em>This is what the <em>Shipley </em>case referred to when it stated: \u201cAn overriding public policy of protecting an owner/operator who inexcusably has no applicable bodily liability coverage is not presently discernible.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b959-15\">. <em>Erie Railroad Co. v.
