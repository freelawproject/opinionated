GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">Eileen Tubbesing brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) against the members of the Board of Election Commissioners of St. Louis County, Missouri, alleging that she had a constitutionally protected property interest in her employment with the Board. Tubbesing claimed that she was deprived of this property interest without due process when the Board terminated her. She sought damages of $250,-000, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and reinstatement to her former position. Alleging that the conduct of the Board members was willful and malicious, she also sought punitive damages in the amount of $500,-000. The Board members, John Fox Arnold, A1 Bauer, Catherine Rea and Ann R. Ruwitch, filed a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. They appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment under the collateral order doctrine. 98 F.R.D. 555. We reverse and order entry of summary judgment in favor of the Board members on Tubbesing\u2019s claims for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">Tubbesing was the Democratic Director of Elections with the St. Louis County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Board of Election Commissioners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was terminated by a three-to-one vote of the Board on September 1, 1981. The Board held an executive meeting on Friday, August 28, 198.1. At that meeting some of the problems concerning the relationship between the two directors were discussed, including (1) Tubbesing\u2019s failure to work cooperatively with the other director; (2) Tubbesing\u2019s unprofessional conduct in regard to the automobile furnished to the lead director;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) Tubbesing\u2019s preferential treatment of some of the employees under her supervision; and (4) Tubbesing\u2019s unresponsiveness to the Board. The Board agreed to inform Tubbesing that they had lost confidence in her as a director and that they were going to seek a new Democratic Director. Arnold, chairman of the Board, told Tubbesing of the Board\u2019s decision, and asked her to resign. Tubbesing refused to resign, and on September 1 at a meeting which Tubbesing attended, the Board terminated her. Tubbesing did not request a hearing regarding her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Tubbesing bases her claim of a property interest in her job on the language of the Personnel Policies and Benefits Manual of the St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners which permits termination only for cause and provides an employee with a right to a pre-termination hearing. She also argues that it had been the custom and practice of the Board not to terminate an employee except for good cause shown and communicated to the employee prior to termination. Tubbesing alleges that she was fired without cause and without a hearing strictly for political reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Board contends that the Policy Manual does not apply to the job of Director of Elections. It maintains that it relied on the advice of legal counsel to the effect that the person who held the position of Director of Elections served at the pleasure of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The district court denied summary judgment, finding that factual issues remained to be determined with respect to the merits of Tubbesing\u2019s claim as well as the issue of qualified immunity. The Board brought this appeal from the denial of summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity, and we stayed proceedings pending its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">We must first determine whether we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. The Board contends that the district court\u2019s order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). In <em>Evans v. Dillahunty, </em>711 F.2d 828 (8th Cir.1983), this Court held that motions for summary judgment that are premised on qualified immunity are immediately appealable if the following criteria are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">The essential facts are not in dispute * *; and (2) the determination of whether the government official is entitled to immunity is solely a question of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Since only money damages were sought in <em>Evans, supra, </em>qualified immunity was a complete defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claims and prevented the defendants from being put to trial. In this case, however, Tubbesing is also seeking reinstatement; therefore, the Board members' qualified immunity defense would entitle them to summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>judgment only on the damages\u2019 claims. The Board would still be required to defend itself in any trial involving Tubbesing\u2019s claim for equitable relief. We believe, however, that the policies underlying the qualified immunity doctrine which justify the immediate appealability of a denial of summary judgment based thereon are just as compelling in this case as when only money damages are sought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Contra Bever v. Gilbertson, </em>724 F.2d 1083 (4th Cir. 1984) (Hall, J., dissenting). That the Board will stand trial on the equitable claim does not change the fact that partial summary judgment based on qualified immunity eliminates the risk of personal liability. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), the threat of personal liability could deter all but the most resolute or irresponsible from discharging their public duties, or even from being willing to serve in public office. 457 U.S. at 813, 102 S.Ct. at 2736. We here deal with a citizen board, whose members serve part time, and these reasons are all the more compelling in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In <em>Harlow </em>the Supreme Court revised the test for qualified immunity, eliminating the subjective aspect so that more claims could be resolved on motions for summary judgment before trial. <em>McSurely v. McClellan, </em>697 F.2d 309, 316 (D.C.Cir. 1982). The objective standard now permits summary judgment for the official if the law was not \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time the challenged action occurred. Withholding appellate review of pretrial denials of qualified immunity would frustrate <em>Harlow\u2019s </em>purpose in revising the test. Therefore, as long as the criteria set out in <em>Evans </em>are met, the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment is appealable notwithstanding Tubbesing\u2019s claim for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In denying the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment the district court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">factual issues clearly remain in dispute regarding whether or not plaintiff had a property interest in continued employment and the right to procedural due process prior to termination. Further factual questions remain as to whether the defendants, even if protected by qualified immunity, acted with malice or recklessness so as to preclude them from such immunity, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abb\">Beyond the conclusion that factual issues \u201cclearly\u201d remain in dispute, the court did not go on to articulate specifically the factual issues that must be determined.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have carefully studied the record before the district court and believe that the facts material to the issue of qualified immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>are undisputed and that those undisputed facts demonstrate that as a matter of law, the Board members are entitled to summary judgment on Tubbesing\u2019s claims for money damages. We conclude therefore that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Government officials are entitled to qualified immunity from suit as long as their conduct does not violate \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Davis v. Scherer, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3018-19, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984) (quoting <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2739); <em>Green v. White, </em>693 F.2d 45, 47 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2464, 77 L.Ed.2d 1341 (1983). The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>reiterated that the standard to be used in determining the availability of qualified immunity is solely an objective one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-12\">Whether an official may prevail in his qualified immunity defense depends upon the \u201cobjective reasonableness of [his] conduct as measured by reference to clearly established law.\u201d No other \u201ccircumstances\u201d are relevant to the issue of qualified immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-13\"><em>Davis, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3018-19 (quoting <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2739) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Since whether the Board members are entitled to qualified immunity depends only upon the \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d of their conduct, the disputed factual issues concerning malice, to which the district court referred in denying the summary judgment motion, are irrelevant to the determination of qualified immunity. Tubbesing alleged that the conduct of the Board was malicious and that she was fired strictly for political reasons. These allegations, however, when submitted to the test of the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, are not supported by any evidence. In her own deposition, Tubbesing denies that she was terminated for political reasons, and she was unable to present any evidence supporting her allegations of malice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tubbesing\u2019s motion and affidavit in opposition to the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment contains no reference to her allegations of malice or politically motivated firing. These issues are thus not a bar to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">The only other factual issue mentioned by the district court is whether Tubbesing had a property interest in continued employment as a director, thus entitling her to certain due process rights. This issue goes to the merits of her claim, but it also defines the narrow issue to which <em>Davis </em>restricts our review. Under <em>Harlow </em>and <em>Davis </em>the threshold question is whether the conduct complained of violated clearly established law. Applying <em>Harlow </em>and <em>Davis </em>to Tubbesing\u2019s allegations and the deposition testimony before the district court, we conclude that Tubbesing\u2019s claims for money damages do not overcome the showing of objective reasonableness measured by clearly established law, and therefore should be determined by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">Under Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, once a motion for summary judgment is made, \u201can adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading.\u201d The Rule requires the responding party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial or else have summary judgment entered against him. <em>Miller v. Solem, </em>728 F.2d 1020, 1023-24 (8th Cir.1984); <em>McCormick v. Ross, </em>506 F.2d 1205, 1208 (8th Cir.1974). Tubbesing\u2019s submission in response to the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment and supporting docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ments does not address the issue established in <em>Harlow </em>and <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Tubbesing bases her property right to continued employment with the Election Board on the Policy Manual, and in her amended complaint, the custom and practice of the Board. The deposition testimony submitted by the Board members in support of their motion for summary judgment established their claim that the custom and usage of prior Boards was that election directors served at the pleasure of the Board. Tubbesing\u2019s response to the Board\u2019s motion sets forth no specific facts which would rebut the Board\u2019s evidence and create a genuine issue of fact as to custom and practice. Certainly there is no demonstration of clearly established law. In her Motion and Affidavit in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Tubbesing merely repeats, without further elaboration, some of the allegations contained in her amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">4. Plaintiff further states that she was an employee of the St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners and was treated as an employee and there existed Personnel Policies and Benefit Manuals which applied to <em>all positions </em>in the employment of the St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners, (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">5. Plaintiff further states that the Board members of the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners had always treated her as an employee and entitled to all the benefits that all employees of the Election Board received and that the custom and practices of the Election Board were such that she was recognized as an employee as all other personnel employed by the Election Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">There was uncontradicted deposition testimony, including that of Tubbesing, that the position of Election Director was a non-merit position. Tubbesing does not rest her claimed property right on a contract or state statute or regulation. Other than her interpretation of the Policy Manual, Tubbesing\u2019s only evidence in support of her claim are her subjective expectations. That is not enough to demonstrate a clearly established right. <em>See Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d 1407, 1414 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1275, 79 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984). Therefore, the only relevant issue remaining unresolved is whether the Policy Manual applies to the Directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Insofar as there is a disputed issue concerning the Manual, it involves the differing interpretations of Tubbesing and the Board. There is no dispute that the Manual was in effect and no dispute about the contents of the Manual. The only dispute involves its interpretation, and this is a question for the court. Rather than precluding summary judgment, the fact that the application of the Policy Manual is disputed merely emphasizes that the law at the time of the conduct complained of was not clearly established. Even considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Tubbesing, and giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences, we cannot conclude that there is a genuine issue of fact concerning whether Tubbesing had a \u201cclearly established\u201d right to continued employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">After a close reading of the Policy Manual, we are unable to determine that it is applicable to the Directors of Elections. Although section 1.01 of the Manual states that it applies \u201cto all positions with the St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners,\u201d the language throughout other sections of the Policy Manual indicates that the Manual does not apply to the Directors, but rather is to be used by the Directors when dealing with subordinate employees of the Board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The Board sought the advice of counsel who told them that the Directors served at the pleasure of the Board. While reliance on the advice of counsel alone will not satisfy an official\u2019s burden of acting reasonably, in the instant case whether the Policy Manual applied to Directors is not clear, and the Board members acted in good faith in following their attorney\u2019s advice. <em>See Wentz v. Klecker, </em>721 F.2d 244, 247 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A plaintiff who \"seeks damages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may overcome [an] official\u2019s qualified immunity only by showing that those rights were clearly established at the time of the conduct at issue.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3020-21. Since it is not clearly established that Tubbesing had a property interest in continued employment as a Director of Elections, as a matter of law the Board members cannot be held to have violated a clearly established property right of which a reasonable person would have known.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfY\">If the law * * * was not clearly established, an official could not * * * fairly be said to \u201cknow\u201d that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxRD\"><em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2739. We conclude that the \u201cclearly established\u201d test has not been met, that the Board members meet the requirements of qualified immunity, and, therefore, are entitled to summary judgment on Tubbesing\u2019s claims for money damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Tubbesing\u2019s amended complaint appears also to allege a deprivation of liberty as a result of her termination by the Board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even though we need not determine this issue in deciding whether the Board members are entitled to qualified immunity, we believe that it is possible to dispose of it as a matter of law based on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">The elements of a claim for deprivation of liberty on the part of a public employee include \u201cthat the reasons given for the discharge may severely damage the employee\u2019s reputation and that the employee claims those reasons were false.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 347, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2078, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976). Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, as we must in reviewing a denial of a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>judgment, <em>Jewson v. Mayo Clinic, </em>691 F.2d 405, 408 (8th Cir.1982); <em>McSurely, </em>697 F.2d at 321, we are able to determine as a matter of law that Tubbesing has not been deprived of any constitutionally protected liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The Supreme Court stated in <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 575, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2708, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), and further explained in <em>Bishop, supra, </em>that one is not deprived of liberty when she or he is simply discharged and there is no public disclosure of the reasons for the discharge. 426 U.S. at 348, 96 S.Ct. at 2079. Tubbesing does not claim that the Board made public any reasons for her discharge which might severely damage her standing and reputation in the community. On the contrary, according to Tubbesing no reasons were given for her discharge and she does not know why she was terminated. Hence, it is clear that she fails to establish a right of recovery for deprivation of liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Tubbesing\u2019s claims for money damages and for any further proceedings regarding Tubbesing\u2019s claim for reinstatement not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">. The bipartisan Board is appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. <em>Mo.Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7 115.027 (1978). The Board conducts all public elections within its jurisdiction, <em>Mo.Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7 115.023, and employs a staff and maintains offices for this purpose. <em>Mo.Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 115.015-057. There are two directors, one Democrat and one Republican. <em>See Mo.Rev. Stat. </em>\u00a7 115.047 (1978). The \"lead\" director is the director of the same political party as the Governor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-15\">. The county government furnishes an automobile to the lead director. While Tubbesing was lead director she had the auto. When a Republican Governor was elected and the Republican director became lead director, Tubbesing refused to relinquish the auto until finally ordered to by Arnold. She persisted in a demand that a second automobile be provided for her although only one automobile had traditionally been furnished.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-5\">. \u2018\u2018[T]he expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues, * * the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office,\u201d and the inhibition from \"unflinching discharge\u201d of duty were cited in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), as consequences to be avoided by prompt disposition of insubstantial claims. 457 U.S. at 814, 102 S.Ct. at 2737. These consequences are just as much a concern where a plaintiff seeks equitable relief in addition to money damages. Even though a trial still must be held in regard to the equitable relief claimed, \"the fear of being sued and held personally liable for damages is a far cry from a suit for reinstatement or injunctive relief, which public officials face regularly in the course of performing their duties.\" <em>Bever, </em>724 F.2d at 1091-92 n.4 (Hall, J., dissenting). In addition to bearing the responsibility for the outcome of the litigation, an official being sued personally for money damages, especially punitive damages, may be required to retain private counsel at his own expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\">. The district court stated only very generalized reasons for denying the motion for summary judgment. We are mindful that a ruling on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not require a detailed discussion of the reasons for granting or denying such a motion and, further, that a statement of findings of fact would be inconsistent with the rule. Nevertheless, we have observed that a statement of the facts relied on and the conclusions of the district court can be most helpful not only to litigants but also to a reviewing court. <em>Robert Johnson Grain Co. v. Chemical Interchange Co., </em>541 F.2d 207, 210 (8th Cir.1976). It would have facilitated our review of its order if the district court had more specifically set out the reasons for its denial. <em>See Kosak v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S. \u2014, \u2014n. 4, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 1522 n. 4, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-15\">. When asked what evidence she had that led her to believe the individual Board members acted maliciously, Tubbesing responded, \"Well, because I was\u2014because I was just fired.\" In revising the test for qualified immunity, the <em>Harlow </em>Court concluded that \"bare allegations of malice should not suffice to subject government officials either to the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.\u201d 457 U.S. at 817-18. <em>See also Miller </em>v. <em>Solem, </em>728 F.2d 1020, 1024-25 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">.
