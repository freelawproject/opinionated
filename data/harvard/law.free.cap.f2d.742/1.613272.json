The FCC promulgated a rule that required state public utility commissions to follow a certain method for calculating depreciation of telephone company equipment. The Public Utilities Commission of Maine (the \u201cP.U. C.\u201d) evidently ignored the FCC rule. The private party, namely the New England Telephone Company, invoking the authority of section 401(b) of the Federal Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(b), obtained a federal district court injunction requiring the Maine commission to comply with the FCC rule. 570 F.Supp. 1558 (D.Me.1983). Section 401(b) of the Act states that if anyone</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-15\">fails or neglects to obey any order of the [Federal Communications] Commission ..., any party injured thereby ... may .apply to the appropriate- district court of the United States for the enforcement of such order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">We find that the word \u201corder\u201d in this statute does not include an FCC rulemaking decision of the sort here at issue. Thus, the district court lacked authority to - issue the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">We start by examining the FCC decision at issue. The decision focused upon the question of how to recapture through depredation charges the cost of a telephone company asset that has unexpectedly lost some of its anticipated economic value, (For a general description of cost recovery through regulated rate-setting, see <em>Distrigas of Massachusetts Corp. v. FERC, </em>737 F.2d 1208 (1st Cir.1984).) To take an oversimplified, imaginary example to illustrate the problem, suppose that the telephone company originally thought that some connecting equipment (say, a $50 fuse) installed in 1960 on the line between a house and a street pole would last fifty years. The company might initially depreciate the equipment at the rate of $1 per year. Suppose further that in 1980, after the company has recaptured $20 through depreciation charges, a new, : dm cheap, technological development makes it sensible to replace the fuse in .... \u2022 . n n \u2022 ,, ti 1985, instead of m the year 2010. How . ,, ,, ,, . should the company recapture the remain-\u00aeon . ., . \u2022 i \u25a0 . .9 mg $30 of its original equipment cost? One depreciation method, called the \u201cwhole life\u201d method, would have the company recalculate the annual depreciation charge for future years by dividing the original $50 cost by the newly estimated whole life of the asset (25 years). Thus, for the next five years, the company would charge $2 per year. By 1985, the company, then, would have recovered $30 of its $50 investment; the remainder would be recovered after the fuse was taken out of service. Another method, called the \u201cremaining life\u201d method, would have the company recalculate the annual depreciation allowance by dividing the remaining undepreciated cost of the fuse ($30) by its remaining useful life. So, the company would charge $6 per year for the years 1981 through 1985, recovering the total cost by the time the fuse was retired from service.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">The economic implications of the choice between these methods are likely to be complex and may be of great importance, <em>See generally </em>Cornell, Pelcovits, &amp; Bren<em>nar, A Legacy of Regulatory Failure, </em>Regulation, July/Aug. 1983, at 37; Fogarty, <em>Capital Recovery: A Crisis for Telephone Companies, A Dilemma for Regulators, </em>Pub.Util.Fort., Dec. 8, 1983, at 13. The \u201cremaining life\u201d method, for example, apparently means that consumers will have to pay more in the near future, but less in the more distant future. Moreover, there are those who argue that in the newly deregulated telephone world, the foreseeably long-term higher \u201cphantom\u201d depreciation charge resulting from the whole life approach (say, $2 extra per year from 1985 to 1995 to recover for the replaced fuse) could lead important customers to switch from the regular telephone system to other lower priced (but economically more costly) systems. If so, customer desertion could deprive the regular system of important sources of revenue and burden remaining customers with still higher charges.</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\"><em>\u201e\u201e </em>,, , Whether or not these concerns are accurate&gt; the fact is that in 1980 the FCC an_ ,, , . \u201e , , nounced that it would switch from whole . . ... \u201e , ... ,, life to remaining life depreciation meth- . . , , /. .... .. ods. <em>In re Amendment of Part 31, etc., </em>83 AOA, / , , \u2019 .f C(f d 916 &lt;1981&gt;- /nd December 1982 it ruled that N\u00aew England Telephone and certain other phone companies must use remamMe systems m settm&amp; their <em>inter' </em>state rates- <em>In re Prescription of Revised Percentages of Depreciation, etc., </em>92 FCC2d 920 (1982). It expressly said, however\u2019 that it would determine the applicabiltty of its choice of methodologies to <em>intra </em>\u201cState rates (the subject now before us) in a separate proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">The \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d was a rule-making proceeding, which initially involved a different depreciation question, namely whether certain telephone assets should be depreciated or treated as current expenses. <em>in re Amendment of Part 31, Uniform System of Accounts, etc., </em>Docket No. CC 79-105. The FCC concluded that some of the assets should be charged as current expenses, at least insofar as <em>inter </em>state rates were concerned. 85 FCC2d 818 (1981), <em>clarified as only affecting interstate rates, </em>89 FCC2d 1094 (1982). Several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>phone companies then asked the FCC to reconsider whether it should not apply its rule to <em>intra </em>-state rates as well</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In the meantime, an Ohio telephone company asked the FCC for a \u201cdeclaratory ruling\u201d that the Commission\u2019s newly announced preference for a \u201cremaining life\u201d depreciation system applied to <em>intra </em>-state, as well as to <em>inter </em>state, rates and preempted contrary preferences of state regulatory commissions. The FCC evidently believed that the Ohio case and the <em>Part 31 </em>case reconsideration both involved the same general question, whether the FCC should require state commissions to apply FCC depreciation policies in intra-state ratemaking. Hence, it consolidated the two proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In January 1983 the FCC announced its decision in the (now consolidated) <em>Part 31 </em>reconsideration. 92 FCC2d 864 (1983). It held that its methods for calculating depreciation were automatically binding upon the state commissions under the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 220(b). It added that, in any event, even if the federal Act did not <em>automatically </em>preempt the right of state commissions to follow different depreciation methods for intra-state transactions, the Commission could (and did) forbid their doing so, for a nationally uniform depreciation policy was of great importance to a sound national communications policy. The Maine P.U.C. was not a party to the <em>Part 31 </em>reconsideration proceeding, but some other state regulatory commissions were, and several of these commissions have appealed the FCC\u2019s ruling to the Fourth Circuit, where the case awaits decision. <em>Virginia State Corporation Commission v. FCC, </em>737 F.2d 388 (4th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In April 1983, three months after the FCC\u2019s consolidated <em>Part 31 </em>reconsideration decision, the Maine P.U.C. denied New England Telephone a rate increase in part because the increase rested upon the use of \u201cremaining life\u201d depreciation. The Maine commission decided that the FCC decision was unlawful \u2014 that the FCC could not tell it what depreciation methods to use. New England Telephone appealed the P.U.C.\u2019s decision to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, but it did not raise the \u201cremaining life\u201d issue in its appeal. Instead, it went to federal court, under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(b), arguing that the Maine commission\u2019s defiance of the FCC was unlawful and should be enjoined. The federal district court agreed. The Maine P.U.C. now appeals its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The FCC decision at issue is the product of a rulemaking proceeding, namely the <em>Part 31 </em>reconsideration. <em>See </em>pages 8-9 <em>infra. </em>The decision also fits the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s definition of a \u201crule\u201d: It is \u201can agency statement of general ... applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy ...\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4). Hence, we consider it to be a rule. And, we ask whether such a rule can also be considered an \u201corder of the Commission\u201d within the terms of section 401(b) of the Communications Act. We note that several other courts have been asked to enforce the preemptive effect of the FCC\u2019s <em>Part 31 </em>reconsideration decision pursuant to section 401(b), and a number of them have granted the requested injunctions. <em>See Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission, </em>738 F.2d 901 (8th Cir.1984); <em>South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, 570 </em>F.Supp. 227 (M.D.La.1983); <em>Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. v. Washington Utilities &amp; Transportation Commission, </em>565 F.Supp. 17 (W.D.Wash. 1983); <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>560 F. Supp. 844 (D.Md.1983). But none of the courts granting injunctions, aside from the district court below, have directly addressed the question the Maine P.U.C. has raised here: whether the FCC\u2019s decision constitutes an \u201corder\u201d in the contemplation of section 401(b). We conclude that it does not, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>First, the Administrative Procedure Act defines the word \u201corder\u201d as \u201ca final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency <em>in a matter other than rulemaking </em>____\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(6) (emphasis added). Although this definition applies to the APA, enacted in 1946, and not necessarily to the Communications Act, enacted in 1934, the APA was the product of extensive study of pre-existing procedure. Some of its provisions \u2014 particularly those governing judicial review \u2014 were largely declaratory of existing law. Byse, <em>Vermont Yankee and the Evolution of Administrative Procedure: A Somewhat Different View, </em>91 Harv.L.Rev. 1823, 1829 (1978). And, post-APA statutes and rules typically incorporate the APA\u2019s concepts and distinctions. Thus, even if pre-APA statutes used the term \u201corder\u201d inconsistently, procedural coherence warrants reference to the APA\u2019s definitions as a starting point and their use as a guide in determining the proper construction of pre-existing, related procedural statutes \u2014 at least where other non-APA considerations also point clearly in the same direction. <em>See Kroeger v. Stahl, </em>148 F.Supp. 403, 406 (D.N.J.) (using APA definition of \u201corder\u201d in interpreting 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(b)), <em>aff'd, </em>248 F.2d 121 (3rd Cir.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Second, to interpret section 401(b) more broadly \u2014 to apply it beyond the context of the \u201cadjudicatory order\u201d \u2014 threatens to interfere seriously with the well established principle that the \u201cenforcement\u201d of the Communications Act is \u201centrusted primarily to an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Universalist Convention v. Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co., </em>183 F.2d 497, 500 (1st Cir.1950); <em>see Lechtner v. Brownyard, </em>679 F.2d 322, 327 (3d Cir.1982) (\u201cThe focus of the Act is the general public, with the FCC, not the private litigant, as its champion.\u201d). Section 401, in relevant part, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">(a) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon application of the Attorney General of the United States at the request of the Commission, alleging a failure to comply with or a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter by any person, to issue a writ or writs of mandamus commanding such person to comply with the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">(b) If any person fails or neglects to obey any order of the Commission other than for the payment of money, while the same is in effect, the Commission or any party injured thereby, or the United States, by its Attorney General, may apply to the appropriate district court of the United States for the enforcement of such order. If, after hearing, that court determines that the order was regularly made and duly served, and that the person is in disobedience of the same, the court shall enforce obedience to such order by a writ of injunction or other proper process, mandatory or otherwise, to restrain such person or the officers, agents, or representatives of such person, from further disobedience of such order, or to enjoin upon it or them obedience to the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">The first part, subsection (a), allows the <em>Commission </em>to ask a federal court to enjoin \u201ca failure to comply with or a violation of any of the provisions\u201d of the Act; the second part, subsection (b), allows a private person to require compliance with a Commission \u201corder.\u201d Section 401(a) allows the Commission to decide precisely where and how to enforce the Act. Section 401(b) is consistent with the Commission\u2019s prerogatives under section 401(a) only if the term \u201corder\u201d is read to apply exclusively to those cases in which the Commission has previously considered and determined the specific rights and duties in question and where the private action seeks only to enforce the Commission\u2019s specific mandate. Only then would the Commission retain enforcement initiative, selecting a particular target for regulatory action and specifying the regulatory constraints that are to govern the target.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Third, to interpret \u201corder\u201d in section 401(b) broadly enough to encompass rules threatens the sound development of a coherent nationwide communications policy \u2014 a central objective of the 1934 Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151; <em>FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., </em>309 U.S. 134, 60 S.Ct. 437, 84 L.Ed. 656 (1940); <em>Benanti v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 96, 104 n. 14, 78 S.Ct. 155, 159 n. 14, 2 L.Ed.2d 126 (1957). Rules are general in form and they can be highly general in content. <em>See, e.g., Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, </em>316 U.S. 407, 418, 62 S.Ct. 1194, 1202, 86 L.Ed. 1563 (1942) (\u201cUnlike an administrative order or a court judgment adjudicating the rights of individuals, which is binding only on the parties to the particular proceeding, a valid exercise of the rule-making power is addressed to and sets a standard of conduct for al to whom its terms apply. ); <em>Precious Metals Associates, Inc. v. Commodity Futures Tradin</em>g <em>Commission, </em>620 F.2d 900, 911 (1st Cir. 1980) ( Rulemaking proceedings are ... designed to fill in the interstices of a statute.\u201d) (citing <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 202, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) and <em>United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., </em>410 U.S. 224, 245, 93 S.Ct. 810, 821, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973)); <em>PBW Stock Exchange, Inc. v. SEC, </em>485 F.2d 718, 732 (3rd Cir.1973) (\u201cRulemaking ... characteristically involves ... declaring generally applicable policies binding upon the affected public generally, but not adjudicating the rights and obligations of the parties before it.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 969, 94 S.Ct. 1992, 40 L.Ed.2d 558 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">To apply a rule to particular cases often (though not always) requires not only adjudicatory fact finding, but also interpretation of the rule\u2019s scope and meaning, <em>See, e.g., Gardner v. Toilet Goods Association, </em>387 U.S. 167, 193-98, 87 S.Ct. 1526, 1539-42,18 L.Ed.2d 704 (Fortas, J., dissenting) (1967); <em>Board of Trade v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, </em>704 F.2d 929, 932-33 (7th Cir.1983). To construe 401(b) to include a private right to enforce commission rules would place this interpretive function squarely in the hands of private parties and some 700 federal district judges, instead of in the hands of the Commission. At best, responsibility for uniform policy would rest on the shoulders of an overworked (and inexpert) Supreme Court. The result would be to deprive the FCC of necessary flexibility and authority in creating, interpreting, and modifying communications policy. And one need only look at the highly general language in which some Commission rules are stated to realize that this shift of power from Commission to courts is not merely a theoretical concern. <em>See, e.g., </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 21.3 (generaj principles of telecommunications licensing). 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.1920 (personal attack ru]e). There ig n0 reason to believe that Congress intended an interpretation of 401(b) that could threaten such a shift or undermine the well established bar against private actions to enforce the Communications Act <em>See, e.g., Lechtner v. Bro</em>wnya<em>rd, supra; Massachusetts Universa</em>list <em>Convention v. Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Fourth, the Act\u2019s statutory review provisions can be read more fairly and coherently if 401(b) is construed narrowly. The normal way to obtain review of an FCC order is for a party to petition a circuit court of appeals. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402; <em>see, e.g., City of Rochester v. Bond, </em>603 F.2d 927, 934-35 (D.C.Cir.1979) (\u00a7 402 as exclusive route to judicial review). Section 401(b) seems to foresee such review, for it discourages the district courts from reexamining the validity of the FCC \u201corder\u201d in question. It states that if, \u201cafter hearing, th[e] court determines that the order was regularly made and duly served,\u201d the court shall enforce obedience; this language suggests that the substantive validity of the order is not to be considered. <em>See Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission, </em>738 F.2d 901 (8th Cir.1984); <em>American Bond &amp; Mortgage Co. v. United States, </em>52 F.2d 318, 320 (7th Cir.1931), <em>cert. denied, </em>285 U.S. 538, 52 S.Ct. 311, 76 L.Ed. 931 (1932); <em>United States v. National Plastikwear Fashions, Inc., </em>123 F.Supp. 791, 793-94 (S.D.N.Y.1954). This \u201csplit\u201d of power between circuit and district courts (leaving \u2018review\u2019 to the first and \u2018enforcement against the disobedient\u2019 to the second) makes a degree of sense where an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u2018adjudicatory\u2019 order is at issue, for the \u2018disobedient person\u2019 in such a case was likely a party to the order and might have sought review of the agency decision in the circuit court. It makes far less sense and is far less fair in the case of an agency rule, which might well be enforced against persons not parties to the rulemaking proceeding. <em>Compare Yakus v. United States, </em>321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944) (administrative regulation can be enforced in proceeding which precludes review of validity of the regulation) <em>with Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 275, 98 S.Ct. 566, 54 L.Ed.2d 538 (1978) (suggesting troubling nature of the <em>Yakus </em>holding and its limited reach) <em>and id. </em>at 289-90, 98 S.Ct. at 575 (Powell, J., concurring) (same). The anomaly of such a restriction on proceedings to enforce rules would have been perceived still more forcefully in 1934, when \u2018pre-enforcement\u2019 review of rules was virtually non-existent\u2014 when the validity of a rule was typically first considered at the time of enforcement. <em>See, e.g., Federal Power Commission v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>304 U.S. 375, 383-85, 58 S.Ct. 963, 966-68, 82 L.Ed. 1408 (1938); Verkuil, <em>Judicial Review of Informal Rulemaking, </em>60 Va.L.Rev. 185, 196\u2014 97 &amp; n. 55, 202-03 (1974). <em>Cf. Port of Boston Marine Terminal Association v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 6.2, 70-71 &amp; n. 20, 91 S.Ct. 203, 209 &amp; n. 20, 27 L.Ed.2d 203 (1970). And this fact makes it rather unlikely that Congress believed section 401(b) would apply to Commission rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Fifth, other sections of the Communications Act use the word \u201corder\u201d in a way that seems to envision Commission decisions requiring specific actions of specific carriers. <em>See, e.g., </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 (orders directing carriers to establish through services); 204 (orders concerning collection and refund of proposed increased rates); 205 (order directing carrier to cease and desist from charging unreasonable rates); 209 (order directing carrier to pay damages for violation of Act); 214(d) (order directing carrier to expand its facilities). With one exception, to which we shall turn shortly, we are unaware of any provision that uses the word \u201corder\u201d to refer to FCC interpretations of the Act or to FCC rules of general applicability. Indeed, section 416 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(a), provides that \u201c[e]very order of the Commission shall be forthwith served upon the designated agent of the carrier____\u201d This language suggests that Congress assumed that \u201corders\u201d took the form of specific directives to specific parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Sixth, to allow communications common carriers to enforce generalized FCC policy against state commissions through \u2018enforcement\u2019 suits in federal district courts threatens issue splitting and procedural complexity. New England Telephone, for example, might readily have raised the \u2018depreciation\u2019 problem in the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, where it obtained review of the rest of the P.U.C.\u2019s rate decision in which the depreciation issue was embedded. Instead, it expressly withheld the issue from that proceeding, bringing it before the federal district court instead, thereby leaving the state court in the difficult position of trying to judge the reasonableness of certain of the P.U.C.\u2019s determinations \u2014 the selection of a rate of return fairly reflecting the risks to investors, for example \u2014 without considering the closely inter-related depreciation issue. The Maine courts were to review Hamlet without the Prince; the federal courts, the Prince without the rest of the play. Since the supremacy clause of the federal Constitution requires the Maine courts to apply federal communications law where appropriate, we see no reason to read the statute to encourage this form of fractionated review.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Before concluding, we consider three arguments in New England Telephone\u2019s favor:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">First, in <em>Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, supra, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the word \u201corder\u201d in section 401\u2019s neighboring section, section 402, to encompass agency rules promulgat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ed after rule-making proceedings. Thus, our interpretation requires reading the same word differently in the two sections. While we recognize the force of the argument calling for a similar construction, <em>see, e.g., Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States, </em>286 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 608, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932); <em>Firestone v. Howerton, </em>671 F.2d 317, 320 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.1982), we find sufficient difference in the functions of the two sections to justify assigning a different scope to the same word in the two settings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Stauffer Chemical Co., </em>684 F.2d 1174, 1184-85 (6th Cir.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 575, 78 L.Ed.2d 388 (1984); <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 429, 461 n. 230 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1281, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Section 402(a), which the <em>CBS </em>Court considered, concerns judicial review of FCC decisions. It states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">Any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any <em>order </em>of the Commission under this chapter (except those appealable under subsection (b) of this section) shall be brought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of Title 28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 (\u201cThe court of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to determine the validity of (1) all final <em>orders </em>of the Federal Communications Commission made reviewable by section 402(a) of title 47 ----\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>CBS </em>concerned the FCC\u2019s Chain Broadcasting Regulations, which told broadcasting stations in part how they were to deal with the networks. CBS argued that the Court should review the regulations\u2019 lawfulness, despite the absence of any enforcement order based on the regulations. If it had to wait until the regulations were enforced to secure judicial review of their validity, it might have to wait forever, CBS said, for the stations intended to obey the regulations, to CBS\u2019s detriment. Thus, to interpret \u201corder\u201d in section 402 to apply only to the outcome of an adjudicatory enforcement proceeding would deprive those who might be seriously injured by others\u2019 obedience to an FCC rule of any opportunity to challenge the rule\u2019s legal validity. The Court agreed. And it considered the regulations to have sufficiently serious and immediate impact to warrant pre-enforcement review of their lawfulness. Accordingly, rules were swept within the scope of section 402\u2019s reference to \u201cany order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">As this statement of the issues in <em>CBS </em>reveals, the policy concerns relevant to a proper interpretation of the word \u201corder\u201d in section 402 involve fundamental principles of judicial review and fair treatment. These concerns point towards a broad interpretation of the word in section 402, but no such considerations are at issue in the case of section 401. To the contrary, private parties have no inherent right to enforce FCC rules, and, as we have remarked above, considerations of fairness favor, if anything, a narrow construction of section 401\u2019s reference to \u201cany order.\u201d In the absence of some strong policy reason favoring a broad interpretation of \u201corder\u201d in section 401, the various considerations previously discussed seem sufficient to outweigh the importance of linguistic uniformity among <em>different sections </em>of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Second, New England Telephone denies that the FCC decision here at issue was embodied in a \u201crule;\u201d rather, it contends we should consider it as an adjudicatory order. The decision was called a \u201cMemorandum Opinion and <em>Order\u201d </em>(emphasis added); and it was issued as a \u201cdeclaratory order\u201d pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.2 (authorizing the Commission to issue declaratory rulings, in accordance with section 5(e) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e)). As the Supreme Court has said, however, \u201c[t]he particular label placed upon [a decision] by the Commission is not necessarily conclusive, for it is the substance of what the Commission has purported to do and has done which is decisive.\u201d <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, </em>316 U.S. at 416, 62 S.Ct. at 1200. The FCC commonly adopts rules in opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ions called \u201corders.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.429(i); <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, </em>316 U.S. at 425, 62 S.Ct. at 1204. And, in this instance, the proceedings that led to the decision were \u201cproperly treated by the FCC as rulemaking proceedings under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.399\u2014 1.429.\u201d 570 F.Supp. at 1571. The FCC has confirmed that the decision \u201cwas adopted as part of a rulemaking docket.\u201d Memorandum of Federal Communications Commission as Amicus Curiae at 16. There is no indication that anyone followed adjudicatory, rather than rulemaking, procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The temptation to refer to the FCC\u2019s deliberations as an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d that led to a \u201cdeclaratory order\u201d arises from the FCC\u2019s consolidation of the pure <em>Part 31 </em>rulemaking proceeding with GTE of Ohio\u2019s declaratory action against the Ohio Public Utilities Commission. The latter action \u2014 entitled \u201cPetition for Declaratory Ruling\u201d \u2014 might perhaps be regarded as adjudicatory, despite its consolidation into a rulemaking proceeding. But even if its culminating order was regarded as enforceable under \u00a7 401(b), it would be enforceable against the Ohio P.U.C., not the Maine P.U.C., which was not a party to the declaratory action. (Nor for that matter was the Maine Commission a party to the Part 31 proceeding with which the Ohio proceeding was consolidated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Third, New England Telephone points to the importance of the policy that the FCC is trying to vindicate with its effort to enforce uniform national depreciation rules. The threat of uneconomic bypass of the existing telephone system is arguably serious and may well justify regulatory decision-making by a single national authority. Moreover, New England Telephone suggests that the FCC\u2019s authority to impose preemptive nationwide rules is obvious. <em>See, e.g., Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association v. FCC, </em>693 F.2d 198, 214-18 (D.C.Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 938, 103 S.Ct. 2109, 77 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983); <em>North Carolina Utilities Commission v. FCC, </em>537 F.2d 787 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 651, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976). Thus, it believes the Maine commission is acting contrary to clear law. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that all this is true, however, why must section 401(b) offer the only remedy? The federal courts are currently considering the substantive arguments concerning the FCC\u2019s authority. <em>Virginia State Corporation Commission v. FCC, supra. </em>Is it not reasonable to assume that the Maine commission and the Maine courts will read the decision? And, in the meanwhile, does New England Telephone not have a remedy sufficient to ameliorate any serious threat to the national telephone network through section 401(a); can it not ask the Commission to bring an enforcement action if the threat is truly serious? Finally, why can it not obtain an adjudication from the FCC against the Maine commission, through the same declaratory ruling procedure employed by GTE of Ohio, and <em>then </em>enforce the resultant order under 401(b) if necessary? Of course, in the process, the FCC likely will have to decide how important it is to vindicate New England Telephone\u2019s position. But this agency check permits assurance that New England Telephone\u2019s claim of public importance is correct, a determination that is properly left in the first instance to the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In sum, we conclude that New England Telephone cannot bring this case in federal court under the authority of section 401(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\n<em>The injunction is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the action.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">MEMORANDUM AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">This court held that private parties could not use \u00a7 401(b) of the Communications Act to enforce an FCC rule because the word \u201corder\u201d in that section does not include agency rules, but, rather, refers to \u2018adjudicatory\u2019 orders. New England Telephone, with support from the FCC, seeks a rehearing. The panel\u2019s opinion considered most of the arguments they raise; but three points require further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>First, New England Telephone now argues that the district court enforced, not only the FCC\u2019s <em>Preemption Order </em>(a \u2018rule-making\u2019 order), but also the <em>Prescription Order </em>(an \u2018adjudicatory\u2019 order); it adds that the latter order provides adequate basis for \u00a7 401(b) jurisdiction. This case, however, concerns an effort to apply the FCC\u2019s depreciation rules to <em>intra </em>-state rates. And, as we explained in our opinion, the <em>Prescription Order </em>expressly left open the question of where its rules would apply. The FCC decided to apply them <em>intra </em>-state in its later <em>Preemption </em>decision. Hence, this case is most naturally viewed as an effort to enforce the FCC\u2019s <em>Preemption Order, </em>which, in turn, incorporates the pre-existing <em>Prescription Order </em>depreciation rules. New England Telephone apparently began this case with this view, for it alleged in its complaint that it was \u201cbeing substantially and irreparably harmed by Defendant PUC\u2019s unlawful refusal to obey the FCC\u2019s <em>Preemption Order </em>\u201d (Complaint at 5); and New England Telephone asked that the PUC\u2019s action be declared unlawful in part \u201cbecause it violates the <em>Preemption Order, </em>the Communications Act, and the United States Constitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10. The FCC, in its amicus brief filed below, also characterized the case as one seeking enforcement of the <em>Preemption Order. See </em>Memorandum of Federal Communications Commission as Amicus Curiae, at 3. (\u201cThe FCC order that is before this Court for enforcement\u201d is the Preemption Order.) The district court thought the same. <em>See </em>570 F.Supp. 1558, 1565 (D.Me. 1983); 565 F.Supp. 949, 954 (D.Me.1983). The first serious effort to recharacterize this case as one to enforce the <em>Prescription Order </em>(and to bring it via that route within 401(b)\u2019s scope) appears in New England Telephone\u2019s rehearing petition. To accept its argument now would be unfair to other parties in the case. Thus, we reject it for that reason and because we believe it an unnatural, and hence incorrect, characterization of this federal suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Second, the FCC argues that our opinion runs contrary to precedent. But, that is not so. The main case the FCC cites, <em>Ambassador, Inc. v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 317, 65 S.Ct. 1151, 89 L.Ed. 1637 (1945), appears to involve, not Communications Act \u00a7 401(b), but, rather, \u00a7 401(a). The <em>Ambassador </em>suit was brought by the Attorney General on behalf of the FCC to enforce a rule contained in a telephone company tariff. The Supreme Court found jurisdiction because \u201ca departure\u201d from the tariff \u201cis forbidden by the Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 325, 65 S.Ct. at 1155, thus bringing the suit within the terms of \u00a7 401(a) (suit by Attorney General authorized \u201cat the request of the Commission, alleging ... a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter____\u201d). The suit also involved joinder of subscribers as parties under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 411, which (in language that appears to apply to suits under \u00a7 401(a), but not under \u00a7 401(b)) authorizes joinder in proceedings \u201cfor the enforcement of the provisions of this <em>chapter </em>\u201d (emphasis added). The FCC correctly points out that the <em>Ambassador </em>Court does not cite \u00a7 401(a). It cites only to \u00a7 401 in general, without specifying \u201c(a)\u201d or \u201c(b)\u201d. This fact, however, could at most show no more than that <em>Ambassador </em>is ambiguous. Ambiguity and court silence do not amount to controlling precedent. The second case the FCC relies upon, <em>Brookhaven Cable TV, Inc. v. Kelly, </em>428 F.Supp. 1216 (N.D.N. Y.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>573 F.2d 765 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 904, 99 S.Ct. 1991, 60 L.Ed.2d 372 (1979) involved, not rulemaking, but a declaratory order as to which the defendant was a party. The <em>Brookhaven </em>court explicitly refused to decide the \u00a7 401(b) question and instead rested jurisdiction on other grounds. The remaining cases, in district courts, arise out of the current depreciation controversy. As we said before, in none of them does the court directly address the question here at issue. Thus, we believe this a case of first impression. And the fact that we can find no reported instance in section 401(b)\u2019s fifty year history in which a private party has used it to enforce an FCC rule is some evidence that it has not conventionally been thought designed for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Third, the FCC appeals to \u201cexpertise\u201d and \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d to bolster its support for the telephone company\u2019s position. We do not believe that these considerations are sufficiently powerful here, however, to turn the tide. For one thing, the FCC\u2019s claim of an administrative \u2018need\u2019 to enlist private \u00a7 401(b), rule-enforcement efforts is not totally plausible m .. . ^ . , \u201e , . t, i light of the lack of precedent. Perhaps such private enforcement efforts would help the FCC deal with potentially hostile state commissions in the immediate context of current telephone deregulation. But, if one steps back to ask the broader question \u2014whether, <em>in general, </em>a private right to enforce FCC rules is likely to serve the Communications Act\u2019s regulatory ends\u2014 one must be more doubtful. As we previously stated, given the general language and broad scope of many FCC rules, to allow private rule enforcement risks significant court interference with FCC control over its own docket, with the FCC s power te \u201cterpret its own rules, and with the FCC s ability to set its own communications . . policy. The FCC now argues that, when , , K rules are unclear, a \u00a7 401(b) court could use the doctrine of \u2018primary jurisdiction\u2019 to obtain commission clarification. The primary jurisdiction doctrine, however, lacks both the clarity and the practical efficacy that would be necessary to repair such a contorted court/agency relationship. <em>See Distrigas of Massachusetts Corp. v. Boston Gas Co., </em>693 F.2d 1113, 1119 (1st Cir. 1982); <em>cf. </em>Jaffe, <em>Primary Jurisdiction, </em>77 Harv.L.Rev. 1037 (1964). Rather than rely upon this complex, ad hoc legal device, we draw the simpler conclusion that Congress did not intend Commission rules to fall within the scope of \u00a7 401(b)\u2019s word \u201corder,\u201d thereby leaving control of their interpretation and enforcement primarily in the hands of the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">For another thing, we cannot accept the FCC\u2019s claim that we should simply defer to its view of the law, <em>see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Its \u201cviews\u201d here do not reflect agency policy reached after debate among staff or commissioners, Rather, as far as we can tell, they simply represent the General Counsel\u2019s interpretation of the statute; they are contained only jn j^is brief. <em>Cf. Investment Company Institute v. Camp, 40</em>1 g 617, 626-28, 91 S.Ct. 1091; 1097-98, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971) (counsel&gt;s efforts in course of litigation are , ,, , . . , ,. hardly tantamount to an administrative . . , \u201e \u201e .... interpretation of a statute); <em>see generally Mayburg v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>740 F.2d 100 (1st Cir.1984) (discussing factors determining weight to be given to administrative interpretations of statutes). While counsel\u2019s experience entitles his opinion to respect, it cannot bind a court as to the meaning of a jurisdictional statute. Moreover, the FCC\u2019s legal argument here threatens a highly anoma]ous result. Its view of statutory construction is one that would place primary authority to decide pure questions of statutory ]aw jn the hands of the agency. At the game ^ its interpretation of the statute in ,. ,,, ,, , ., question is one that would place considera- . . \u201e ble authority to decide questions of commu- . , Mcatlons Pollcy in the hands of the courts' Each mstitution-court and agency-would receive comparatively greater power in the area \u2122 which it, comparatively, <em>lacks </em>expertise. The resulting picture is one of classical administrative law principle turned upside down. At least, the position seems inconsistent with the sound court/agency working partnership that administrative law traditionally has sought,</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">\n<em>fhe pet\u00fcion for rehearing is denied_</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
