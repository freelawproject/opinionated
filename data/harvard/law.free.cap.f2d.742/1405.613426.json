United States, </em>571 F.Supp. 1265 (CIT 1983).

In February 1982, the ITA issued a notice of its determination to initiate countervailing duty investigations of nine carbon steel products from Spain. 47 Fed.Reg. 5753. In June 1982, the International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary determination that there was a \u201creasonable indication\u201d that six types of Spanish steel imports (of the nine types which were under investigation) were \u201cmaterially injurpng] or threatening] ... [to] materially] injur[e]\u201d an American industry. 47 Fed.Reg. 26038.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In August 1982, the ITA published a notice of its \u201cPreliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain Steel Products from Spain\u201d. 47 Fed.Reg. 38161. That notice announced the ITA\u2019s preliminary determination that \u201cthere is reason to believe or suspect that certain benefits which constitute subsidies ... are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Spain of certain steel products____\u201d The notice went on to identify three programs which the ITA had preliminarily found to confer benefits constituting subsidies on the six products still under investigation, It also reported the ITA\u2019s preliminary finding that the Desgravacion Fiscal a la Ex-portaci\u00f3n (DFE) program was not a subsidy because the amount of money it rebated to exporters was not excessive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AnIj\">Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671b(b), the ITA estimated the net amount of the subsidy it believed that manufacturers, producers and exporters of the six products were receiving. It then directed the U.S. C\u00fastoms Service to suspend liquidation of all entries from Spain of the six steel products under investigation and to require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond or security for each entry after the date of the notice of the preliminary affirmative determination. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671b(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A21H\">The ITA published its \u201cFinal Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations\u201d on November 15, 1982. 47 Fed.Reg. 51438. In that notice, the ITA determined that the three programs which it had preliminarily labeled as subsidies did, in fact, constitute subsidies. In addition, it found that two of the Spanish manufacturers, producers, and importers subject to the investigation were receiving countervailable cash grants. The notice also said that the ITA had determined that the DFE program (as well as other programs) did not constitute a subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">As a result of that notice, the suspension of liquidation as to all six products from Spain was continued, cash deposits or bonds in specified amounts were required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>the ITC was notified of the determinations, and the ITC\u2019s 45-day maximum time period for its final injury investigations began. The ITC notified the ITA of its final affirmative injury determination on December 21, 1982. 48 Fed.Reg. 51 (January 3, 1983). It found that an American industry was \u201cmaterially injured\u201d as a result of imports of the six Spanish steel products. On January 3, 1983, the ITA issued countervailing duty orders covering all entries of the six products. 48 Fed.Reg. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-4\">On January 7, 1983, Bethlehem filed a summons and complaint with the Court of International Trade challenging one aspect of the ITA\u2019s final determination on Spanish steel products \u2014 the finding that the DFE was not a subsidy. In September 1983, the CIT dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the summons had not been, in the court\u2019s view, filed within the time limits specified by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515a(a)(2)(A) and (B). Those subsections provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-5\">(2) Review of determinations on record</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-6\">(A) In general. \u2014 Within thirty days after the date of publication in the Federal Register of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-7\">(i) notice of any determination described in clause (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of subparagraph (B), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-8\">(ii) an antidumping or countervailing duty order based upon any determination described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B), an interested party who is a party to the proceeding in connection with which the matter arises may commence an action in the United States Court of International Trade by filing a summons, and within thirty days thereafter a complaint, each with the content and in the form, manner, and style prescribed by the rules of that court, contesting any factual findings or legal conclusions upon which the determination is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-9\">(B) Reviewable determinations. \u2014 The determinations which may be contested under subparagraph (A) are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-11\">(i) Final affirmative determinations by the Secretary and by the Commission under section 1303 of this title, or by the administering authority [the Commerce Department] and by the Commission under section 1671d or 1673d of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-12\">(ii) A final negative determination by the Secretary, the administering authority, or the Commission under section 1303, 1671d, or 1673d of this title.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1510-13\">In the CIT\u2019s eyes, the ITA\u2019s finding regarding the DFE was a \u201cfinal negative determination\u201d within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(ii), <em>supra, </em>and could be reviewed by the CIT only if a summons were filed within thirty days of publication (November 15, 1982) of the ITA\u2019s final determination in the Federal Register. Bethlehem\u2019s summons, accordingly, was deemed untimely because it was filed beyond that thirty-day limit. The court rejected Bethlehem\u2019s contention that the DFE finding was merely a negative aspect of a \u201cfinal affirmative determination\u201d which should be appealed at a later time, after the countervailing duty order had been issued. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)(i). The court relied, instead, on the CIT opinion in <em>Republic Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>4 CIT 17 (1982), which had held that the preliminary findings by the ITA that certain programs did not constitute subsidies were \u201cnegative determinations\u201d and could be appealed immediately after their publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-15\">The statute distinguishes between a \u201cfinal affirmative determination\u201d and a \u201cfinal negative determination\u201d in countervailing duty matters, both in the procedural provisions for the administrative proceedings (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671d) and in the appeal provision just quoted (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)). Under that scheme, the question is whether the ITA\u2019s holding that the DFE was not a subsidy with respect to the products at issue was a \u201cnegative de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>termination\u201d in itself, or was merely one part or aspect of an overall \u201caffirmative determination\u201d that as a whole the affected products had been aided by subsidies. We agree with the latter position and also hold that Congress authorized (in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(A)(ii) and \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(i), <em>supra) </em>domestic interests like Bethlehem to appeal, after publication of a countervailing duty order, from any adverse conclusion in such an overall \u201caffirmative determination\u201d lessening the amount of countervailing duties. Accordingly, Bethlehem\u2019s appeal here was timely.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1511-4\">The very form of the ITA\u2019s finding that the DFE program did not constitute a subsidy strongly tends to demonstrate that it was not an appealable \u201cnegative determination\u201d in itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That particular finding was included towards the end of a long public notice entitled, \u201cFinal <em>Affirmative </em>Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain Steel Products from Spain\u201d. 47 Fed. Reg. 51438 (November 15, 1982) (emphasis added). The notice began with a summary that reported only that the ITA had \u201cdetermined that certain benefits which constitute subsidies are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Spain of certain steel products____\u201d The notice listed the four programs which the ITA had found to confer subsidies on the six products under investigation. The ITA found that all of the six products received some subsidy; it did not determine that any of the products received no subsidy at all. Consequently, liquidation of entries of all six imported products remained suspended and subject to the requirement of the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or security.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1511-11\">The adverse impact on Bethlehem of the ITA\u2019s negative finding regarding DFE, included in the overall affirmative determination, was that the cash deposit, bond, or security which the importers were required to post \u2014 and the duties later assessed\u2014 would be smaller than if the ITA had found that the DFE was a subsidy and had included it in its conclusion as to the net subsidy received by each manufacturer, producer, or exporter of the six steel products. Thus, the amount of the proper countervailing duty was directly involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-12\">In this connection it is significant, in evaluating Bethlehem\u2019s right to question this \u201cnegative\u201d conclusion on an appeal from the countervailing duty order, that the company would undoubtedly have such a right of appeal if the ITA had made the affirmative finding that the DFE was a subsidy but then underestimated its magnitude. In that comparable situation Bethlehem would be subject to exactly the same type of injury \u2014 lower deposit or security requirements and lower duties imposed on importers \u2014 and would likewise be complaining that the ITA had underestimated the duties owed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In that instance, under the statute, an appeal would indisputably be from an affirmative determination and the time for appeal would indisputably be within 30 days after publication of the countervailing duty <em>order, </em>not the ITA\u2019s final administrative determination. In the light of the very close connection between Bethlehem\u2019s present case and this hypothetical one, it is difficult to believe that Congress provided that Bethlehem cannot wait until the countervailing duty order before challenging the amount of the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>rates (and the underlying negative finding on the DFE).</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-4\">We are, of course, aware that the CIT has drawn a distinction between a challenge to a finding that a program does not constitute a subsidy and a challenge to the alleged undervaluing of an acknowledged subsidy. <em>See Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>slip op. 84-16 (CIT March 7, 1984); <em>United States Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>slip op. 83-65 (CIT June 28, 1983), <em>vacated, </em>slip op. 84-12 (CIT Feb. 24, 1984); <em>United States Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>slip op. 83-59 (CIT June 17, 1983), <em>vacated, </em>slip op. 84-12 (CIT Feb. 24, 1984) . We need not now decide the propriety of making such a distinction <em>before </em>a countervailing duty order is published, so as, perhaps, to bar early complaints of undervaluing as premature. This distinction is, however, wholly artificial after the issuance, as here, of a countervailing duty order. At that point, whether the complaint is that the ITA has erroneously decided that one program is not a subsidy or whether it is that a subsidy has been undervalued, the essence of the attack is still the same \u2014 it is directed towards the <em>amount </em>of duties to be assessed. At least then, there is no reason to prohibit Bethlehem from challenging a countervailing duty order on the ground that the projected duty assessments do not take a particular subsidy into account,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> when a challenge to projected duty assessments on the ground of inaccurate computation would clearly be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-7\">Moreover, to demand an earlier challenge by Bethlehem to the ITA\u2019s finding that the DFE was not a subsidy might well have called for a needless appeal before the countervailing duty order was published. At the time the ITA made its final determination, the ITC had not yet made final affirmative injury determinations for the products Bethlehem alleged were being subsidized by the DFE, and there was no legal requirement that an ITC determination be made within 30 days. <em>See </em>Part I, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1512-10\">Although the ITA\u2019s notice was entitled <em>\u201cFinal </em>Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations ...\u201d (emphasis added), the determinations were final only in the sense that they reflected the <em>ITA\u2019s </em>final investigative findings on the question of subsidies. But in the context of the countervailing duty investigation as a whole, they were, as the Government has argued, only \u201cinterlocutory\u201d in nature and effect. After the notice\u2019s issuance, there still remained one last requirement before a countervailing duty order could issue \u2014 the ITC\u2019s final injury determination. If the ITC had found no injury, the investigation would have been terminated, and no countervailing duty order would have been promulgated. The decision below requires, however, an interested domestic party to appeal from the ITA determination even though shortly thereafter the whole question of duty assessment could become moot because the ITC found no domestic injury whatever. It is highly unlikely that Congress would call for such a potentially useless appeal. It is much more likely that Congress anticipated that the domestic interest could and would wait until after the countervailing duty order issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-11\">The upshot of these considerations (textual, structural, and practical) is that the preferred interpretation of the provisions of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(A) and (B), <em>supra, </em>is that (a) the ITA\u2019s conclusion as to the DFE was but one aspect of the overall affirmative determination and (b) Bethlehem could properly appeal, as it did, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>respect to that DFE conclusion within 30 days after the countervailing duty order. In these circumstances that order triggered the appeal time. Only then did it become clear and definite that Bethlehem had a real complaint as to the ITA\u2019s DFE conclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1513-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-6\">Bethlehem has alternatively raised before us the possibility of harmonizing its position with earlier CIT cases upholding earlier appeals in comparable circumstances <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on the basis that interested parties in Bethlehem\u2019s position have a statutory option as to the time to seek judicial review of negative aspects of a determination \u2014 after the determination, or after the countervailing duty order, or perhaps at both times. The Government, which, as we have pointed out (n. 6, <em>supra), </em>supports Bethlehem\u2019s stance that its appeal here was timely, strongly denies such an option. We do not accept Bethlehem\u2019s alternative position that an option always exists in cases of this type; under our reading of the statute Congress did not normally contemplate such a proliferation (and perhaps duplication) of appeals. But in rejecting the position that such an option always exists, we leave open the question whether there may possibly be occasions on which a negative subsidy finding can be severed from affirmative subsidy findings respecting the same product, and then judicially challenged on a separate, \u201cinterlocutory\u201d basis. We do decide, however, that if such an earlier appeal is ever permissible, it could be taken only on the ground that Congress gave for specifically providing interlocutory appeals in the Trade Agreements Act of <em>1979 </em>\u2014 i.e., that delay \u201ccould make an ultimate resolution of an issue in a party\u2019s favor irrelevant because of the irreversible damage suffered during the interim period\u201d. S.Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 245 (1979). On the record before us and Bethlehem\u2019s own contentions and actions, that is plainly not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-11\">We turn finally to the question of the effect of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2636(c) on 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a, although the CIT did not cite 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2636(c) as supporting its holding that Bethlehem\u2019s summons was untimely filed. That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1513-12\">(c) A civil action contesting a reviewable determination listed in section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a], other than ... [certain preliminary determinations], is barred unless commenced in accordance with the rules of the Court of International Trade <em>within thirty days after the date of the publication of such determination in the Federal Register.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1513-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-14\">We have little difficulty reading 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2636(c) together with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a, even though the latter provision says that final affirmative determinations may be challenged within thirty days of publication of the related countervailing duty order, and the former, quoted immediately <em>supra, </em>literally says that a challenge should be commenced within thirty days of publication of the determination itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>These statutes are clearly <em>in pari materia. </em>The Customs Court Act of 1980 (of which 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2636(c) is a part) and the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (including 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a) were companion measures concerning the administration of the countervailing duty and antidumping laws. In fact, the House Judiciary Committee, responsible for the Customs Court Act, worked closely with the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, which had been responsible for the Trade Agreements Act, in order to ensure that the two sets of legislative provisions did not conflict. <em>See </em>126 Cong.Rec. 26,554 (1980). (\u201c[T]he Judiciary Committee has engaged in a continuing dialog with the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Trade to assure that ... [the bill (later incorporated into the Customs Court Act of 1980) ] is consistent with their work in American foreign trade policy, particularly in the area of imports\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-4\">Congress intended that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2636(c) should \u201csubstantially restate ... the law set forth in section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a], as added by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979\u201d. H.R.Rep. No. 1235, 96th Cong.2d Sess. 56, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3729, 3767. A provision declaring that challenges to final affirmative determinations must be taken prior to the issuance of a countervailing duty order would have constituted a substantial departure from the law set forth in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)(i), and there is absolutely no reason to believe that Congress intended such a radical change. Indeed, the evidence points the other way. Congress amended 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a only to the extent of shortening the time limits during which certain interlocutory challenges could be brought from thirty to ten days following publication of the determination. As stated in the Senate Report accompanying S. 1654 (the bill that became the Customs Court Act after amending its language to contain the text of the House bill):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-5\">Proposed section 2636(c) [which became \u00a7 2636(d) ] sets forth the time limits for instituting two types of civil actions which were first authorized by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. While that Act authorized suit within 30 days, that period of time is far too long in light of the fact that the decisions to be reviewed ... are decisions which in effect merely extend the time within which the agency may act. Therefore, section 2636(c) [\u00a7 2636(d) ] reduces the time period of 30 days provided for in the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 to 10 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-7\">Proposed subsection 2636(d) [which was adopted as \u00a7 2636(c) ] sets forth the time limit for the commencement of suit under section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a]. <em>This subsection merely restates the provisions contained in section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1514-8\">(Emphasis added.)

[law] it is not clear whether a domestic manufacturer can challenge the <em>amount </em>of a dumping or countervailing duty assessment or only the total failure to assess such a duty. The ... [new law] ... would leave no doubt that judicial review may be sought on either basis\u201d.) (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1512-8\">. We disagree with the CIT\u2019s comments, in the opinion below, that Bethlehem was not \"really\u201d challenging the countervailing duty order because its complaint only disputed the ITA\u2019s finding on DFE, and that finding was not even mentioned in the countervailing duty order. It is true that Bethlehem\u2019s complaint was not that a countervailing duty order had been published; it was, however contesting the rates of duties listed in that countervailing duty order, on the ground that they did not take into account the alleged DFE subsidy. The fact that the countervailing duty order did not explicitly mention the ITA\u2019s finding regarding the DFE program is of no significance. The order was squarely, though implicitly, based on that finding; without it, the duty rates assigned would have been greater.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1513-7\">. Congress did explicitly provide, in defined situations, for appeals at an earlier stage of countervailing duty proceedings. <em>See, e.g., </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(l)(B)(i) (\"extraordinarily complicated\" cases); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(l)(B)(ii) (preliminary determination of no subsidy). The premise for allowance of such earlier appeals is that the interested parties could otherwise suffer irreversible damage while the countervailing duty proceeding continued. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 245 (1979), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1979 p. 381. In the present situation Congress provided no such earlier appeal, apparently because of the unlikelihood of serious injury to the domestic interested parties in the relatively short interim between the ITA\u2019s final determination and the countervailing duty order. Suspension of liquidation continued after the ITA\u2019s publication of its negative finding on DFE.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1513-16\">. <em>Republic Steel Corp. v.
