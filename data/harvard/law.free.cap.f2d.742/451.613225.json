(North-side) commenced this action against Ford Motor Company (Ford) based upon provisions of the Minnesota Motor Vehicle Sale and Distribution Regulations, Minn.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 80E.01-80E.18. Section 80E.14 permits an existing dealer to commence a court action to determine if there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for permitting the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">In June 1980, there were five Lincoln-Mercury motor vehicle dealerships in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; one of them, Capp Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., terminated its dealership in June 1980. In June 1982 Ford notified the remaining dealers, including Northside, in writing, that it intended to reopen the Capp location. After North-side pursued its remedies according to the procedures set forth in the dealership agreement, it brought this action on November 5, 1982 in state court. The case was removed to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">Prior to trial, Northside sought a preliminary injunction against Ford in order to stop Ford from taking any further action to open a proposed new dealership until there had been a \u201cgood cause\u201d determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ford moved for summary judgment on the ground that it merely was reopening a preexisting dealership and therefore was exempt from the statutory provisions. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 80E.14(1). The District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied both motions. After a five-day trial, the District Court concluded that \u201cgood cause\u201d had been established. North-side appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of its request for a preliminary injunction and from the District Court\u2019s finding of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-19\">Northside requested a preliminary injunction to prevent Ford from taking any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>further action with regard to the new dealership until the \u201cgood cause\u201d determination had been made. There now has been a final judgment in the \u201cgood cause\u201d proceeding. Having reviewed the matter, we hold that the preliminary injunction issue is moot. <em>See generally Bell v. Sellevold, </em>713 F.2d 1396 (8th Cir.1983) (application of mootness doctrine), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 978, 79 L.Ed.2d 215 (1984); <em>Allen v. Likins, </em>517 F.2d 532, 534-35 (8th Cir.1975) (application of mootness doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">With regard to the \u201cgood cause\u201d determination, Northside argues that the District Court committed several errors of law; however, it primarily challenges the District Court\u2019s findings of fact. After reviewing the decision below, the record, and the briefs on appeal, we are convinced that the District Court committed no error of law or fact. As an example, Northside claims that the District Court rejected the statutory definition of \u201crelevant market\u201d area in favor of one chosen by Ford. But the District Court\u2019s opinion simply shows that it recognized a factual distinction between the statutory \u201crelevant market\u201d analysis and Ford\u2019s marketing strategies. In making its good cause determination, the District Court thoroughly considered the seven nonexclusive factors listed in the statute as well as other factors. We do not see any error in any of the District Court\u2019s findings. Having considered all of North-side\u2019s arguments, we affirm on the basis of the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-13\">. Northside also moved for a temporary restraining order to stop Ford from acting with regard to the dealership until after the preliminary injunction hearing. The District Court denied this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-21\">.
