Accordingly, we reverse her conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">Hilda Escobar de Bright was charged on counts of conspiring to import heroin (Count One), illegally importing heroin (Count Two), conspiring to possess heroin with intent to distribute (Count Three), and illegally possessing heroin with intent to distribute (Count Four), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 952(a), 960(a)(1), 841(a)(1) (1982), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1982). She was convicted on all four counts and sentenced to concurrent six-year sentences. In Counts One and Three, Escobar de Bright was charged with conspiring with Ernesto Ayala-Zarate, Hector Ayala-Zarate, Ana Maria Zarate de Ayala, and others to import heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(a)(1) and to possess heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">In April 1981, Ernesto Ayala-Zarate contacted Manny Banda, a paid informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration, about the purchase of heroin. Apparently, in that and a later conversation, Ernesto gave Banda the defendant\u2019s telephone number \u2014 one time so that Banda might approach Ernesto\u2019s brother, Hector, who is Escobar de Bright\u2019s son-in-law, and one time so that Banda might contact the defendant and solicit her assistance in importing heroin from Mexico. Banda arranged to meet the defendant and, after meeting her, persuaded her to drive immediately to Mexico. At trial, the defendant testified that she drove to Mexico only because she felt threatened by Banda and that she did not know that he planned to import heroin. After entering Mexico, she drove back across the border where her 17 year old son, Francisco, entered the automobile. Her car was later stopped by United States Customs Patrol officers. The officers searched Francisco and discovered four ounces of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-16\">Subsequently, Escobar de Bright and Ernesto and Hector Ayala-Zarate were named in the four count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on all four counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>The defendant challenges her conspiracy conviction.

United States, </em>343 F.2d 139, 142 (5th Cir. 1965), the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals established the rule that, \u201cas it takes two to conspire, there can be no indictable conspiracy with a government informer who secretly intends to frustrate the conspiracy.\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Wray, </em>8 F.2d 429 (N.D.Ga.1925)). The Fifth Circuit held that, because the jury could have concluded from the evidence that the defendant conspired only with the government agent, the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of conspiracy only if it determined that he acted with the knowledge that persons other than the government agent were also involved in the illegal scheme. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">Two other circuits have explicitly adopted the <em>Sears </em>rule. <em>See United States v. Moss, </em>591 F.2d 428, 434 n. 8 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Chase, </em>372 F.2d 453, 459 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 907, 87 S.Ct. 1688, 18 L.Ed.2d 626 (1967) (\u201c[Ojne who acts as a government agent and enters into a purported conspiracy in the secret role of an informer cannot be a co-conspirator.\u201d) (citations omitted). In ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>dition, at least one other circuit has expressed the view that the <em>Sears </em>rule is correct. <em>See United States v. Barnes, </em>604 F.2d 121, 161 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 907, 100 S.Ct. 1833, 64 L.Ed.2d 260 (1980) (\u201c[T]he Government showed that [the defendant\u2019s] involvement was more far-ranging than simply having conspired with Government agents, for which no conspiratorial liability could be imposed.\u201d); <em>United States v. Rosenblatt, </em>554 F.2d 36, 38 (2d Cir.1977). Until now, we have not considered the applicability of the <em>Sears </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">Strong considerations support the adoption of the <em>Sears </em>rule. A conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more people to commit an unlawful act, <em>see, e.g., Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 777, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1289, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975); <em>United States v. Falcone, </em>311 U.S. 205, 210, 61 S.Ct. 204, 206, 85 L.Ed. 128 (1940); <em>United States v. Abushi, </em>682 F.2d 1289, 1293 (9th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Andreen, </em>628 F.2d 1236,1248 (9th Cir.1980), which arguably requires some form of a \u201cmeeting of minds,\u201d <em>Krulewitch v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 448, 69 S.Ct. 716, 720, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring). There is neither a true agreement nor a meeting of minds when an individual \u201cconspires\u201d to violate the law with only one other person and that person is a government agent. The principle was explained concisely a quarter of a century ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-5\">Since the act of agreeing is a group act, unless at least two people commit it, no one does. <em>When one of two persons merely pretends to agree, the other party, whatever he may believe, is in fact not conspiring with anyone. </em>Although he may possess the requisite criminal intent, there has been no criminal act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\"><em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Criminal <em>Conspiracy, </em>72 Harv.L.Rev. 920, 926 (1959) (emphasis added; footnote omitted) (hereinafter Developments). In short, the formal requirements of the crime of conspiracy have not been met unless an individual conspires with at least one bona fide co-conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">The rationale behind making conspiracy a crime also supports the <em>Sears </em>rule. Criminal conspiracy is an offense separate from the actual criminal act because of the perception \u201cthat collective action toward an antisocial end involves a greater risk to society than individual action toward the same end.\u201d <em>Developments, supra, </em>at 923-24 (footnote omitted); <em>see </em>W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 61, at 459-60 (1972). In part, this view is based on the perception that group activity increases the likelihood of success of the criminal act and of future criminal activity by members of the group, and is difficult for law enforcement officers to detect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-10\">For two or more to confederate and combine together to commit or cause to be committed a breach of the criminal laws, is an offense of the gravest character, sometimes quite outweighing, in injury to the public, the mere commission of the contemplated crime. It involves deliberate plotting to subvert the laws, educating and preparing the conspirators for further and habitual criminal practices. And it is characterized by secrecy, rendering it difficult of detection, requiring more time for its discovery, and adding to the importance of punishing it when discovered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-11\"><em>United States v. Rabinowich, </em>238 U.S. 78, 88, 35 S.Ct. 682, 685, 59 L.Ed. 1211 (1915); <em>see, e.g., Callanan v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 587, 593-94, 81 S.Ct. 321, 325, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961); <em>Developments, supra, </em>at 924-25; W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 61, at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">Such dangers, however, are non-existent when a person \u201cconspires\u201d only with a government agent. There is no continuing criminal enterprise and ordinarily no inculcation of criminal knowledge and practices. Preventive intervention by law enforcement officers also is not a significant problem in such circumstances. The agent, as part of the \u201cconspiracy,\u201d is quite capable of monitoring the situation in order to prevent the completion of the contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>criminal plan; in short, no cloak of secrecy surrounds any agreement to commit the criminal acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Finally, the <em>Sears </em>rule responds to the same concern that underlies the entrapment defense: the legitimate law enforcement function of crime prevention \u201cdoes not include the manufacturing of crime.\u201d <em>Sherman v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 369, 372, 78 S.Ct. 819, 820, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958); <em>see Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 452, 53 S.Ct. 210, 216, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932). Allowing a government agent to form a conspiracy with only one other party would create the potential for law enforcement officers to \u201cmanufacture\u201d conspiracies when none would exist absent the government\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">We find the reasons underlying the <em>Sears </em>rule to be compelling and therefore adopt it here. Our inquiry, however, is not finished. Because we have decided that the defendant\u2019s requested instruction was supported by law, we now must decide whether there was \u201csome foundation in the evidence\u201d to support giving a <em>Sears </em>instruction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">Here, the defendant\u2019s testimony is sufficient to support the giving of the requested instruction. Escobar de Bright testified that she did not know why Banda wanted her to go to Mexico but that, because she feared for her own and her son\u2019s safety, she felt coerced by him into going; the concern for her safety was based at least in part, she said, on her belief that Banda \u201cmight be wearing a gun.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She also testified that Banda \u201ccommanded\u201d her son, Francisco, to go to Mexico. This testimony provides some support for Escobar de Bright\u2019s theory that she \u201cconspired\u201d only with the government agent Banda and did so only after he threatened her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-18\">In addition, there is testimony suggesting that Escobar de Bright would not have conspired with members of either of the Ayala-Zarate families. For example, her husband, Lorring G. Bright, testified that there was \u201cbad blood\u201d between Hector Ayala-Zarate and himself. In fact, Bright testified that he had previously shot Hector Ayala-Zarate. He also testified that his wife did not \u201cget along\u201d with Hector and that she often argued with Hector about her daughter (Hector\u2019s wife) and granddaughter. The defendant also testified to that effect. Finally, both the defendant and her husband testified that they had never met or spoken with another alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>co-conspirator, Anna Maria Zarate de Ayala; in addition, there is no evidence suggesting that either of them had ever met Ernesto Ayala-Zarate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">We conclude that there was \u201csome foundation in the evidence\u201d to support the defendant\u2019s theory that she conspired only with a government agent. After carefully considering the instructions as a whole, <em>see United States v. Rohrer, </em>708 F.2d 429, 431 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Abushi, </em>682 F.2d 1289, 1299 (9th Cir.1982), we also must conclude that the jury could have followed those instructions and convicted the defendant of conspiracy even if it concluded that she had conspired only with the government agent. Accordingly, the district court erred in failing to give the jury the defendant\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">As we noted earlier, we have consistently stated that if a defendant\u2019s theory of the case is supported by law, and if there is some foundation for the theory in the evidence, the failure to give the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction concerning his theory is \u201creversible error.\u201d We recognize that the cases that originally established this rule were decided before the Supreme Court created the \u201charmless\u201d constitutional error category. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although our decisions since <em>Chapman </em>have reiterated that failure to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s theory is reversible error,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we have never discussed the relationship between reversible error as used in those cases and the harmless error rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-6\"><em>Chapman </em>recognized that \u201cthere are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u201d 386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827 (recognizing that the constitutional right to counsel, the right against admission in evidence of coerced confessions, and the right to an impartial judge require automatic reversal); <em>see United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980 n. 6, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 42, 43-44, 87 S.Ct. at 836, 837-838 (Stewart, J., concurring in the result); <em>United States v. Valle-Valdez, </em>554 F.2d 911, 915 n. 6 (9th Cir.1977) (citing Supreme Court cases holding that \u201ccertain kinds of constitutional error require automatic reversal\u201d; citations omitted); <em>see also Bagley v. Lumpkin, </em>719 F.2d 1462 (9th Cir.1983) (government\u2019s failure to provide information requested by defendant pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), so that he could effectively cross-examine two important government witnesses required automatic reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">While \u201creversible error,\u201d from a strictly semantic standpoint, could mean reversible <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>or reversible only if error resulted, or could have resulted, in some prejudice to the defendant, our cases must be read as meaning that a failure to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s theory of the case is reversible <em>per se. </em>The right to have the jury instructed as to the defendant\u2019s theory of the case is one of those rights \u201cso basic to a fair trial\u201d that failure to instruct where there is evidence to support the instruction can never be considered harmless error. Jurors are required to apply the law as it is explained to them in the instructions they are given by the trial judge. They are not free to conjure up the law for themselves. Thus, a failure to instruct the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s theory of the case precludes the jury from considering the defendant\u2019s defense to the charges against him. Permitting a defendant to offer a defense is of little value if the jury is not informed that the defense, if it is believed or if it helps create a reasonable doubt in the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>mind, will entitle the defendant to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">We conclude that our cases \u2014 both before and after <em>Chapman </em>\u2014 stating that the failure to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s theory of the case is \u201creversible error\u201d mean that the error can never be treated as harmless. We are not free to modify that rule; only the court <em>en banc </em>could do so. We would not change the rule, however, even if we had the opportunity, because any substantial modification of the rule would be inconsistent with fundamental constitutional guarantees. The conspiracy convictions under Counts One and Three of the indictment are</p>\n<p id=\"Avv\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">. In our initial opinion, we stated that the defendant challenged only her conspiracy conviction under Count One (conspiracy to import heroin) of the four count indictment. In reliance on our statement, the en banc court remanded the case so that we might decide the merits of the defendant\u2019s challenge to her conviction on Count One. Upon re-reading the briefs and carefully scrutinizing the record, we are forced to conclude that the defendant\u2019s arguments apply equally to her conviction under Count Three of the indictment (conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute). Although she did not specify which counts were being appealed, we find no basis for distinguishing between the two conspiracy counts. We therefore consider the defendant\u2019s objections as applying to her convictions on both Counts One and Three. For purposes of clarity and simplicity, we refer to defendant\u2019s convictions on those counts as the \u201cconspiracy conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1299-18\">. Hector and Ernesto Ayala-Zarate were also convicted. Their convictions were affirmed in an unpublished memorandum. We do not set forth here the evidence that supported those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>convictions. Ana Maria Zarate de Ayala, Hector\u2019s and Ernesto\u2019s mother, was not indicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">. The defendant also contends that the district court erred in admitting testimony concerning statements made by a co-conspirator under Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2). Because we reverse her conspiracy conviction on other grounds, we need not address that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">. The defendant\u2019s counsel \u2014 apparently in the judge\u2019s chambers \u2014 requested an instruction that the jury could not find the defendant guilty of conspiracy if it concluded that she \"conspired\u201d only with Banda, the government agent. This request is mentioned in a discussion between counsel and the judge about the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, or, in the alternative, for a new trial; that motion was denied. In any event, the government does not allege that defendant\u2019s counsel did not submit the proposed jury instruction in the manner required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 30. We therefore need not consider whether the defendant met the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 30 in requesting the instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">. Of course, the precise phrasing of the instruction is within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rohrer, </em>708 F.2d 429, 431 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Abushi, </em>682 F.2d 1289, 1299 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">. The following colloquy between the defendant and her counsel indicates her purported concern for her own and her son\u2019s safety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7W\">Q: Hilda, when you eventually went into Mexico, was [Banda] with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF3h\">A: Yes.

Despite her testimony, the defendant did not request any instruction as to a defense of duress or coercion. Although her testimony might have provided some support for such a defense and although the defense of coercion or duress may be inconsistent with the theory that Escobar de Bright conspired with Banda, she did not offer an inconsistent defense here.
