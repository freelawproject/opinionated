(Childcraft) appeals from the decision of the Court of International Trade (CIT), 572 F.Supp. 1275 (1983) which upheld the classification of the imported merchandise as toys, Item 737.90 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) instead of as \u201cMachines not specially provided for,\u201d Item 678.50 TSUS, or \u201cElectrical articles ... not specially provided for,\u201d Item 688.40 TSUS, as claimed. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-26\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-27\">The imports are articles primarily used by children, and are respectively known as \u201cTeaching Typewriters,\u201d \u201cTouch to Learn,\u201d and \u201cTouch and Match.\u201d The Teaching Typewriter requires the use of programmed cards, each of which presents a problem to be solved, such as a simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>addition or word completion exercise. When a child presses the key or keys representing the correct answer, the card moves forward out of the machine. Additional programs teach vocabulary, phonograms, and mathematics; and progressively more difficult program cards are available for each of these subject categories. The Touch to Learn article operates on the same principle but uses a programmed cassette in place of the card, and a correct answer advances the cassette to the next problem. Available programs teach, for example, counting, telling time, addition, subtraction and multiplication. The Touch and Match article teaches reading readiness. It utilizes a card having an item appearing on its left side which a child must match with the corresponding item on the card\u2019s right side, by simultaneously pressing the appropriate buttons. This article is supplied with a blank card to enable teachers to create individualized exercises for children with specific learning problems. A correct choice causes the machine to produce a noise and light a light. None of these articles will function in its intended manner without the card or cassette programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-4\">The Customs Service classified these articles as toys, TSUS 737.90, and the CIT affirmed. The primary issue, as formulated by the CIT, and the affirmative determination which formed the basis for its upholding of the classification of these articles as toys, was whether their chief use was for the <em>amusement </em>of children and adults, rather than for the <em>education </em>of pre-school children. Childcraft contends on appeal that these articles are primarily used for educational purposes and, therefore, that TSUS 678.50 or 688.40 would be correct. The government conceded below and at argument before this court that if the merchandise is not classifiable under TSUS 737.90, that Childcraft\u2019s suggested classification in TSUS 678.50 would be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-5\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-6\">The meaning of terms, such as \u201ctoy,\u201d is a question of law. <em>Daw Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>714 F.2d 1140, 1141 (Fed. Cir.1983). Both parties, as well as the CIT, relied upon the definition set forth in the TSUS (Schedule 7, part 5, subpart E, headnote 2) as adopted by a line of cases including <em>B. Shackman &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>67 Cust-Ct. 372, 380, C.D. 4300, (1971), that a toy is an article \u201cchiefly used for the amusement of children or adults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-8\">It is incumbent upon the importer in a case such as this to overcome the presumption of correctness which attaches to a classification by the Customs Service, and the importer has the burden of proving that the classification is incorrect, though the importer need not always prove that its own proposed classification is correct. <em>Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States, </em>733 F.2d 873 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-9\">Whether particular items, such as the articles at issue here, fit the definition of toy is a question of fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Daw Industries, </em>714 F.2d at 1142. A finding is \u201c \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). Thus, in order to prevail, Childcraft must demonstrate clear error in the CIT\u2019s finding, based on the record below, that the imported articles are chiefly used for amusement and are thus toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-10\">The evidence of record consists primarily of witness testimony, a photocopy of one of Childcraft\u2019s catalogs, the three imported articles, and the programmed cards and cassettes used with these articles. As the CIT opinion notes, only one witness testified, and that was Childcraft\u2019s Senior Vice-President of Merchandising. The government called no witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-11\">Childcraft\u2019s witness testified that his company was primarily engaged in selling teaching aids and school supplies, and that he worked with educational consultants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>teachers, and others in the field of preschool education. His further testimony was that approximately eighty per cent of Childcraft\u2019s business was generated by sales to schools and educational systems. Additional testimony indicated that the machines could not function without their programmed cards or cassettes, and that particular programs were progressive in degree of learning difficulty. The imported articles were merchandised through school catalogs and by sales representatives who conducted workshops with school teachers to demonstrate the items. Other sales were generated by public distribution through retail stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-5\">Due to the nature of this case, our holding as to whether or not the subject articles are correctly classified as toys depends on the facts adduced below. Thus, the CIT correctly couched the determinative issue before us in terms set forth by the former Customs Court in <em>Ideal Toy Corp. v. United States, </em>78 Cust.Ct. 28, 33, C.D. 4688 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1517-6\">When amusement and utility become locked in controversy, the question becomes one of determining whether the amusement is incidental to the utilitarian purpose, or the utility purpose incidental to the amusement [citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1517-7\">In finding that Childcraft \u201cfailed to demonstrate by the evidence of record that the imported merchandise is chiefly used for educational purposes and not chiefly used for the amusement of children,\u201d the CIT relied overmuch on certain comments by the witness that \u201che had observed children using the merchandise in school and that the children were enjoying themselves.\u201d The CIT erroneously found, from the following quoted testimony, an admission \u201cthat the basis [sic] of the merchandise was amusement of a young child with the hopeful purpose that the child would learn something while being amused.\u201d The quoted testimony was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1517-8\">Young children, unless they are really new, have ideas, and the enviornonment [sic] around them every day is an adventure and anything at all might be \u2014 it the driest subject \u2014 an amusement to a child. But, I guess, as we grow older, we begin to be influnced [sic] by things that happen to us, and so maybe we learn to hate mathematics or we learn to \u2014 whatever. The fact is that anything mechanical would certainly \u201camuse\u201d somebody. It moves. Certainly, a young child \u2014 Well, there is nothing funny about it, nothing dances and there are no cymbals that are played, no music response. It was not a toy that you could turn into other things. It did simply one thing: it taught or attempted to teach a child a very rudimentary fact or facts for which it was intended, and anything will amuse a child, but I think that is a rather broad definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1517-10\">It is evident to us from this transcript excerpt that the witness stated only that the imported articles were not \u201cfunny,\u201d were not toys that could be turned \u201cinto other things\u201d through play, and that they did one thing \u2014 i.e., \u201ctaught or attempted to teach\u201d children. That the witness also recognized that \u201canything will amuse a child\u201d is hardly persuasive, as found by the CIT, that the chief purpose of the article was amusement. Indeed, our review of this testimony, and the entire record, leads us to the opposite conclusion. In response to the question, \u201cWould it be fair to say that if a child was not amused by such a device, they would just tend to ignore it?\u201d, the witness said \u201cThat holds true for everything.\u201d If a child disliked using the imported articles, it is reasonable to surmise that their use would be infrequent or less than optimally effective. Thus, we conclude that this testimony of the witness is not sufficient to support the CIT\u2019s finding as to the article\u2019s chief purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-11\">Previous decisions by our predecessor court and the Customs Court help evaluate the witness\u2019 statements in a more useful, decision-making context. For example, in <em>United States v. Louis Wolf &amp; Co., </em>26 CCPA 243, 249, C.D. 23 (1938), the court held that microscopes classified as toys were not toys.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1518-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>From the evidence in the case and the exhibits before us we think the merchandise at bar is not chiefly used for the <em>amusement </em>of children because, as we have hereinbefore stated, the interest which children display in the use of these microscope sets is not the character of \u201camusement\u201d which a child gets from a toy or from an article which is essentially a plaything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKqy\">Devices known as \u201ceducational number learners\u201d and \u201cgeometrical sorting boards\u201d were held to be chiefly used for educational purposes in <em>B. Shackman &amp; Co., </em>supra. The evidence presented in <em>Shackman </em>indicated that the children using these items were \u201cexcited\u201d rather than amused, and learned from them. See also the cases cited in <em>Shackman, </em>67 Cust.Ct. at 381-383. Thus, mere amusement does not necessarily require a finding that an item\u2019s chief use is noneducational.</p>\n<p id=\"A84\">The testimony evidence presented in <em>Shackman </em>may have been more clear and compelling than that presented in the instant case, however. Unlike Childcraft, which presented one corporate witness, Shackman presented six witnesses, four of whom were experts in the field of education and the two others were involved in the importation, sale, and distribution of the imported articles. The CIT in the instant case did correctly recognize the premise that \u201cimporters, merchants and executives concerned with ordering, selling, distributing and promoting an article have to know the article\u2019s chief use and may properly give testimony as to such use.\u201d <em>Shackman, </em>67 CustCt. at 383; <em>see also, International Customs Service, Inc. v. United States, </em>63 Cust.Ct. 255, 259, C.D. 3905 (1969) and <em>Novelty Import Co. v. United States, </em>60 Cust.Ct. 574, 582, C.D. 3462, 285 F.Supp. 160 (1968). Yet the CIT erroneously discounted Childcraft\u2019s witness\u2019 uncontradicted testimony, in view of its finding based on his testimony, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"AYf\">The CIT also largely relied on Exhibit 5 in the case, which was a copy of Child-craft\u2019s 1971 Catalog entitled \u201cChristmas Catalogue Toys That Teach.\u201d The CIT found that this catalog was \u201cessentially a toy catalog the like of which is sent to retail outlets such as Gimbels and F.A.O. Schwartz Co., famous toy stores. Articles listed in this catalog appear to be only for the basic purpose of the amusement of children.\u201d While the CIT is correct in its observation that the fact that the \u201carticles were marketed as toys, while not determinative, is of obvious probative value,\u201d citing <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>62 Cust.Ct. 718, 724, C.D. 3853 (1969), Childcraft calls our attention to other aspects of the catalog which diminish its probative value. Among the other articles also included in the catalog were items which could not be classified as toys, such as furniture, play pens, musical instruments, flashlights, clocks, etc. Additionally, the advertising text accompanying the articles at issue describes each of them as a teaching machine.</p>\n<p id=\"ASHE\">The type of catalog advertising present in the <em>Montgomery Ward </em>case is distinguishable from the Childcraft catalog, particularly in view of the fact that the former catalog listed the imported articles (toy musical instruments) in a special section, with an index \u201cadding that \u2018[o]nly toys are listed here ...\u2019.\u201d <em>Montgomery Ward, </em>62 Cust.Ct. at 724. In contradistinction, Child-craft presents its imported articles as teaching machines, rather than as toys, Furthermore, the decision in <em>Montgomery Ward </em>was largely predicated on testimony that the imported articles were incapable of use for serious musical study, and the decision was further buttressed by a clear line of cases dealing with toy musical instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"AnQn\">jn reaching our decision we give due deference to the CIT\u2019s statement that \u201cin viewing a demonstration of the merchan\u00bf[ise at trial and reviewing the exhibits in chambers [it] is of the solid conclusion that the main effect thereof is the amusement 0f children and any educational value is merely incidental thereto.\u201d However, the exhibit evidence of record, when considered in its entirety with the testimony of child-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>craft\u2019s witness, does not support the CIT\u2019s finding that the chief use of the imported article is amusement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1519-5\">To summarize, in view of Child-craft\u2019s proposed classification and the government\u2019s concession that this would be correct, we hold that the imported articles are properly classifiable under Item 678.50 TSUS, machines not specially provided for. The decision of the CIT is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1519-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
