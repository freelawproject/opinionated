NEWMAN, Circuit Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">The Secretary of Health and Human Services appeals from a judgment of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Jack B. Weinstein, Chief Judge) invalidating a procedure used by the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) in the determination of original and continuing eligibility of claimants for disability benefits. <em>City of New York v. Heckler, </em>578 F.Supp. 1109 (E.D.N.Y.1984). The ruling affects a class of persons with severe mental illnesses. The class is estimated to include more than 50,000 New York residents. The Secretary raises no challenge on appeal to the District Court\u2019s invalidation of the challenged procedure, which has since been abandoned. However, the appeal presents substantial and complicated issues concerning the jurisdiction of the District Court to adjudicate the class members\u2019 challenge and to award relief. For reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-20\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b839-21\">The invalidated procedure concerns one aspect of the elaborate process by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>people are determined to be eligible for disability benefits under the Social Security Disability Insurance (\u201cDI\u201d) program, established by Title II of the Social Security Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), and the Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) program established by Title XVI of the Act, 76 Stat. 197, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq. (1982). More specifically, we are concerned with the five-step \u201csequential evaluation\u201d process adopted by the Secretary to govern determination of initial and continuing eligibility for disability benefits under both DI and SSI programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The first step in the sequential process is a decision whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d If so, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1520(a), (b), 416.920(a), (b) (1983). If not, the second step is a decision whether the claimant\u2019s medical condition or impairment is \u201csevere.\u201d If not, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 416.920(c). If the impairment is \u201csevere,\u201d the third step is a decision whether the claimant\u2019s impairments meet or equal the \u201cListing of Impairments\u201d set forth in subpart P, app. 1, of the social security regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(d), 416.920(d). These are impairments acknowledged by the Secretary to be of sufficient severity to preclude gainful employment. If a claimant\u2019s condition meets or equals the \u201clisted\u201d impairments, he or she is conclusively presumed to be disabled and entitled to benefits. If the claimant\u2019s impairments do not satisfy the \u201cListing of Impairments,\u201d the fourth step is assessment of the individual\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>his capacity to engage in basic work activities, and a decision whether the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity permits him to engage in his prior work. If the residual functional capacity is consistent with prior employment, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). If not, the fifth and final step is a decision whether a claimant, in light of his residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience, has the capacity to perform \u201calternative occupations available in the national economy.\u201d <em>Decker v. Harris, </em>647 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir.1981); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(f), 416.920(f). If not, benefits are awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The procedural irregularity challenged in this litigation concerns the fourth step of the sequential evaluation process\u2014the determination of residual functional capacity. In disregard of the regulatory requirement to conduct an individualized assessment of the residual functional capacity of each claimant, SSA, informally and without public disclosure, adopted an administrative practice that effectively imposed a presumption upon the determination of eligibility for DI benefits: Claimants whose mental impairments were not as severe as those in the Listing of Impairments were presumed to retain a residual functional capacity sufficient to perform at least unskilled work.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This presumption was conclusive as to most claimants with mental impairments that were \u201csevere\u201d but not \u201clisted.\u201d The practical effect of the presumption was to end the sequential process for most class members at the third step. The only class members who might progress through the fourth and fifth steps and receive benefits were those over 50 with extreme vocational deficiencies and \u201csevere\u201d but unlisted mental impairments. These class members, despite the presumption concerning residual functional capacity, might be found eligible for benefits by virtue of the medical-vocational \u201cgrid\u201d regulation, 20 C.F.R. subpart P, app. 2 (1983), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>but the force of the presumption could still adversely affect their claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The presumption concerning residual functional capacity was applied throughout the elaborate administrative process by which claims for initial and continuing disability benefits are determined. The presumption guided determinations made by the New York State Office of Disability Determinations, pursuant to its contract with the SSA and review decisions made at the regional and national levels by SSA officials. Upon the <em>de novo </em>reviews conducted by administrative law judges, the presumption was not required to be applied, but the District Court found that AU\u2019s often relied on determinations of residual functional capacity that were tainted by use of the presumption earlier in the review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">On February 8, 1983, the City of New York and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services, and the Acting Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health, suing on their own behalf and as <em>parens patriae, </em>and eight named, individuals brought this class action against the Secretary and the Commissioner of SSA on behalf of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">All individuals residing in the State of New York who have applied for or received Title II and/or Title XYI benefits on or after April 1, 1980, and who have been found by defendants to have a mental impairment which is severe ... and whose applications for benefits have been or will be denied or whose benefits have been or will be terminated, on the basis of defendants\u2019 determination that such persons are capable of substantial gainful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining the Secretary from continuing to apply the unwritten presumption concerning residual functional capacity. The complaint invoked jurisdiction under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982), and the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">The Secretary unsuccessfully resisted class certification on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over most members of the proposed class. Following class certification, the Secretary filed her answer, denying plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and renewing her jurisdictional arguments. The answer did not specifically assert that the claims of some class members were time-barred by the 60-day rule of section 405(g), which permits judicial review only of decisions of the Secretary made within 60 days of the filing of a complaint in a district court. Though the answer was not amended to assert a time bar, the Secretary referred to this argument at the outset of trial and in her post-trial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">The District Court rejected the Secretary's jurisdictional contentions. On the merits Chief Judge Weinstein ruled that \u201cfrom 1978 until at least the early months of 1983\u201d SSA engaged in a covert policy to deny class members an individualized assessment of each claimant\u2019s capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity in violation of the strictures of the Social Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Act and regulations enacted thereunder. 578 F.Supp. at 1115. As relief the Court ordered the Secretary (i) to reopen all disability determinations rendered after April 1, 1980, in which disability benefits were denied or terminated, and (ii) to \u201creinstate benefits of all class members until the claimant\u2019s eligibility is properly determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1125. These reinstated benefits have been referred to in the litigation as \u201cinterim\u201d benefits. The Court stayed its judgment for ten days to permit an application for a stay pending appeal to this Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Following the Secretary\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal or, in the alternative, for clarification of the rationale for denying a stay, Chief Judge Weinstein entered an amended judgment modifying the judgment to limit relief to individuals with a \u201cfunctional psychotic or functional non-psychotic mental impairment which is severe ...\u201d and to limit interim benefits to recipients whose benefits had been terminated. The Court also entered a two-part stay pending appeal: First, the amended judgment was fully stayed for a ten-day period to permit application to the Court of Appeals for a stay pending appeal; second, a partial stay pending appeal was granted relieving the Secretary of the obligation to reopen and readjudicate the claims of individuals whose applications for benefits had been denied and who had abandoned their claims prior to December 10, 1982 (the 60th day prior to the filing of this action). Reopening was still required for all class members whose benefits had been terminated. The Secretary was also required to identify <em>all </em>class members, those whose applications for benefits had been denied and those whose benefits had been terminated, and to provide interim benefits to all class members whose benefits had been terminated. This Court denied the Secretary\u2019s motion to stay the District Court\u2019s amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">On appeal, the Secretary does not challenge the District Court\u2019s ruling on the merits, but raises only jurisdictional contentions. She asserts that the District Court lacked jurisdiction under section 405(g) over most members of the certified class: (i) claimants whose right to pursue administrative or judicial review lapsed pri- or to December 10, 1982, (ii) claimants whose benefits were terminated and who did not challenge the Secretary\u2019s action, and (iii) claimants who failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The Secretary further contends that mandamus jurisdiction is not available and that the District Court lacked authority to award interim benefits in the absence of an administrative finding of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">A. Section 405(g) Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">Section 405(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">Any individual, after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow ... in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">The Secretary contends that many, if not most, class members fail to satisfy section 405(g)\u2019s prerequisites of a final decision made after a hearing and commencement of a civil action within sixty days subsequent to the mailing of notice of such decision (or such further time as the Secretary may allow).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">The requirement of a \u201cfinal decision of the Secretary made after a hearing\u201d has been held to consist of two elements \u2014 (i) the \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d non-waivable requirement that a claim for benefits has been presented to the Secretary and (ii) the \u201cwaivable\u201d requirement that the administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary have been exhausted. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 328-30, 96 S.Ct. 893, 899-900, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 764-65, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2466, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>Presentment Requirement. </em>The District Court ruled that the non-waivable, \u201cpresentment\u201d requirement had been satisfied by all class members \u2014 those whose applications for benefits had been denied by the Secretary and those whose benefits had been terminated pursuant to continuing eligibility review. The class members whose applications for benefits were denied clearly satisfy the presentment requirement. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 329, 96 S.Ct. at 900; <em>see also Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 72, 76, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 1887, 1889, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976) (jurisdiction sustained for claimants who filed application after suit filed); <em>Jones v. Calif ano, </em>576 F.2d 12, 18 (2d Cir.1978) (\u201cIt is undisputed that [plaintiffs], by filing claims with the SSA, have satisfied the non-waivable requirement.\u201d). Whether recipients whose benefits were terminated also surmount this jurisdictional barrier is more problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We reject at the outset the view endorsed by other Circuits that mere termination of benefits somehow satisfies the presentment requirement. <em>See Lopez v. Heckler, </em>725 F.2d 1489, 1503 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cclass members ... have had their benefits terminated ... and have thus met the presentation requirement\u201d); <em>Kuehner v. Schweiker, </em>717 F.2d 813, 817 (3d Cir.1983) (plaintiffs meet \u201cthe first, non-waivable condition, because all the claimants were benefit recipients whose benefits had been reduced or terminated\u201d); <em>Ellison v. Califano, </em>546 F.2d 1162, 1164 (5th Cir.1977). We recognize that the rationale underlying these decisions is not implausible \u2014 that the recipient\u2019s failure to report that disability ceased amounts to a \u201ccontinuing claim\u201d for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We continue to adhere, however, to the position adopted in <em>Wheeler v. Heckler, </em>719 F.2d 595, 600 (2d Cir.1983), that a recipient subject to continuing eligibility review does not satisfy the presentment requirement through inaction. <em>Wheeler </em>held that terminated recipients who failed to \u201cinitiate[] even informal communications with SSA ... either prior or subsequent to receipt of a termination notice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 600 (footnote omitted), had not satisfied the non-waivable jurisdictional requirement of section 405(g). Various Supreme Court pronouncements lend support to this view. In <em>Eldridge, </em>a benefit-termination case, the Court found the presentment requirement satisfied by the recipient\u2019s actions that \u201cspecifically presented the claim that his benefits should not be terminated because he was still disabled.\u201d 424 U.S. at 329, 96 S.Ct. at 900. <em>See also Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 703-04 &amp; n. 15, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2558-59 &amp; n. 15 (1979) (recipients must seek formal reconsideration in order to satisfy section 405(g)\u2019s presentment requirement). Our view also draws support from some of the opinions written by the Justices in connection with the stay of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Heckler, supra. </em>In granting the stay, Justice Rehnquist, acting as Circuit Justice, explicitly stated that the Secretary\u2019s termination decision does not by itself satisfy the presentment requirement. <em>Heckler v. Lopez, </em>463 U.S. 1328, 104 S.Ct. 10, 14, 77 L.Ed.2d 1431 (1983). When the Court denied a motion to vacate the stay, Justice Stevens stated, in his partial concurrence, that the presentment requirement was satisfied by the submission of a questionnaire indicating that the recipient was still disabled and desired benefits, <em>Heckler v. Lopez, </em>463 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 221, 223, 78 L.Ed.2d 217 (1983) (Stevens, J., with whom Blackmun, J., joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">In this case, however, terminated recipients did not remain passive. Prior to the Secretary\u2019s decision to terminate benefits, every class member completed a Social Security questionnaire indicating in writing that he remained disabled and desired benefits. We agree with Chief Judge Weinstein that the submission of the disability questionnaire satisfied the presentment requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The Secretary points out that the class members here apparently did not communicate with SSA after the submission of the questionnaire or the receipt of an initial termination notice. She seeks to distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>guish <em>Eldridge </em>on the ground that the claimant there not only submitted a completed questionnaire but also sent a letter objecting to SSA's preliminary notice of termination of benefits. Her argument draws support from Justice Rehnquist\u2019s view that recipients must \u201cquestionf ] the initial determination that they cease to be disabled,\u201d <em>Heckler v. Lopez, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 14. We agree that where the Secretary acts unilaterally to terminate or reduce benefits, for example, where benefits are terminated because a recipient returned to work or failed to cooperate with the agency\u2019s review process, a claimant must act in order to trigger section 405(g) jurisdiction. However, we resist the view that jurisdiction is lacking where a claimant asserts eligibility after commencement of the continuing eligibility review process even though prior to the Secretary\u2019s initial determination. We find more persuasive Justice Stevens\u2019 less formalistic, more pragmatic understanding of <em>Eldridge </em>that all a claimant need do is \u201cspecifically presentf ] the claim that his benefits should not be terminated because he was still disabled,\u201d <em>Heckler v. Lopez, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 229 n. 2 (quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 329, 96 S.Ct. at 900). That thought was adequately expressed by Eldridge in either his letter or his returned questionnaire, and here by the plaintiffs\u2019 return of their questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><em>Exhaustion Requirement. </em>The second jurisdictional prerequisite, that the administrative remedies prescribed by the Secretary be fully exhausted, may be waived, either by the Secretary, <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 766-67, 95 S.Ct. at 2467, or, in appropriate circumstances, by the courts, <em>Mathews v. Diaz, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 76-77, 96 S.Ct. at 1889-90; <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 330-32, 96 S.Ct. at 900-01; <em>Mercer v. Birchman, </em>700 F.2d 828, 831 (2d Cir.1983). In this case the District Court, over the Secretary\u2019s objections, dispensed with the need fully to exhaust administrative remedies as a condition of judicial review. On appeal, the Secretary contends that judicial waiver is inappropriate in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The Supreme Court has adopted a practical approach to section 405(g)\u2019s exhaustion requirement. The Court has approved judicial waiver where plaintiff\u2019s legal claims are collateral to the demand for benefits, where exhaustion would be futile, or where the harm suffered pending exhaustion would be irreparable. <em>Compare Mathews v. Eldridge, supra </em>(exhaustion waived), <em>with Heckler v. Ringer, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (exhaustion not waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Although <em>Eldridge </em>and <em>Ringer </em>make clear the circumstances that permit a court to waive exhaustion, they do not establish whether each of the individual factors deemed relevant in those decisions \u2014 futility, collaterally, and irreparable harm\u2014 must be present before a court may dispense with exhaustion. In the absence of express guidance, we have taken the view that no one factor is critical. <em>See Smith v. Schweiker, </em>709 F.2d 777, 780 (2d Cir.1983). We have adopted a more general approach, balancing the competing considerations to arrive at a just result under the circumstances presented. That approach points toward waiver of exhaustion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">As was true in <em>Eldridge </em>and not true in <em>Ringer, </em>claimants here have raised a colorable claim that recovery of retroactive benefits would not be fully compensatory because of their mental disabilities and their dependency on disability benefits. We have no reason to disturb Chief Judge Weinstein\u2019s conclusion that, the harm caused by wrongful denials was \u201cirreparable.\u201d From ample evidence the District Judge found that \u201c[t]he ordeal of having to go through the administrative appeal process\u201d would likely trigger a \u201csevere medical setback\u201d for many members of the class. 578 F.Supp. at 1118. Such consequences are hardly consistent with the remedial goals of the Act and the nation\u2019s mental health policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">With respect to the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, it cannot be said, as was true in <em>Eldridge, </em>that these are \u201cwholly\u201d collat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>eral to the claim for benefits; plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Secretary unlawfully failed individually to assess claimants\u2019 residual functional capacity is somewhat intertwined with claimants\u2019 demand for benefits. However, the class here complains fundamentally of a procedural irregularity and not of the Secretary\u2019s substantive standards of eligibility. The District Court was not asked to and did not rule on the merits of any of the underlying claims. In this regard cases such as <em>Heckler v. Lopez, supra; Heckler v. Ringer, supra; </em>and <em>Smith v. Schweiker, supra, </em>which involved challenges to the Secretary\u2019s substantive standards, are distinguishable. We con-elude, therefore, that although not \u201cwholly\u201d collateral, plaintiffs\u2019 claims are substantially collateral to their entitlement to \u2022disability benefits and consequently present an appropriate circumstance for waiver. <em>See Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Minnesota v. Heckler, </em>720 F.2d 965, 969-71 (8th Cir.1983); <em>see also Lopez v. Heckler, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 1501-03; <em>Kuehner v. Schweiker, supra, </em>717 F.2d at 818; <em>id. </em>at 821-23 (Becker, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"ABZ_\">Moreover, under the circumstances of this case, exhaustion of administrative remedies would have been futile. Although exhaustion might have resulted in recovery of retroactive benefits for some members of the class, as was also true in <em>Eldridge, </em>the administrative process cannot vindic\u00e1te the procedural rights asserted in this litigation. The class members complain of a procedural irregularity \u2014 the failure of the Secretary to base eligibility determinations on individualized assessments of a claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. This procedural right, guaranteed by the Secretary\u2019s regulations, cannot be vindicated by an ultimate determination of eligibility. For that reason further exhaustion justifiably may be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"A1yn\">More generally, we discern no legitimate interest to be advanced by requiring plaintiffs to travel through the administrative maze as a prerequisite of a judicial hearing, This is not a case like <em>Smith v. Schweiker, supra, </em>or <em>Heckler v. Ringer, supra, </em>where the claim asserted could benefit from further factual development or from the agency\u2019s \u201cexperience and expertise,\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 765, 95 S.Ct. at 2467. Nor is this a case where exhaustion serves to \u201cprevent[ ] premature interference with agency processes\u201d or to allow the agency \u201can opportunity to correct its own errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As in <em>Eldridge </em>it is not realistic to \u201cexpect that the Secretary would consider substantial changes in the current administrative review system at the behest of a single aid recipient ... in an adjudicatory context,\u201d 424 U.S. at 330, 96 S.Ct. at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"AHoy\"><em>Sixty-Day Limitation. </em>Under the Act, claimants must seek judicial review of final decisions of the Secretary \u201cwithin sixty days after the mailing ... of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Secretary may allow.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). The Secretary argues that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over those claimants who were entitled to but did n\u00b0t seek judicial review of an adverse decision of the Secretary received more than 60 days prior to commencement of the present suit, <em>i.e., </em>claimants who abandoned their claims prior to December 10, 1982.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00aelie contends that the 60-day provision is jurisdictional and not a statute of limita^ons provision, as the District Court ruled, \u00aehe further contends that the 60-day proviS40n was not waived and, as a jurisdictional requirement, could not be waived,</p>\n<p id=\"Aa1s\">We acknowledge that the Supreme Court\u2019s position on whether the 60-day provision is jurisdictional is not free from doubt. In the stay ruling in <em>Heckler v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Lopez, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 222-23, Justice Stevens reckoned with the issue and concluded that the 60-day requirement is jurisdictional. Although the Secretary apparently had failed to raise the 60-day requirement in the District Court, Justice Stevens declined to find waiver and concurred in maintaining the stay of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment insofar as the stay applied to claimants who had not sought administrative or judicial review of their termination decisions 60 days prior to the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">On various other occasions, however, the Court has instructed that the 60-day limitation is not jurisdictional. Both <em>Salfi </em>and <em>Eldridge </em>construed the 60-day requirement as a statute of limitations, waivable by the parties. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 328 n. 9, 96 S.Ct. at 899 n. 9; <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 763-64, 95 S.Ct. at 2465-66. And notwithstanding his opinion in <em>Lopez, </em>Justice Stevens\u2019 separate opinion in <em>Heckler v. Ringer, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2028, 2033-36, incorporates the <em>Salfi </em>and <em>Eldridge </em>statements to the effect that section 405(g) contains a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d waivable by the parties. Justices Brennan and Marshall also view the 60-day requirement as waivable, <em>Heckler v. Lopez, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 225, 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Along with other Courts of Appeals this Circuit has adopted the view that the , 60-day limitation period is not jurisdictional. <em>Latona v. Schweiker, </em>707 F.2d 79, 81 (2d Cir.1983); <em>see Lopez v. Heckler, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 1508; <em>Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Minnesota v. Heckler, supra, </em>720 F.2d at 973 n. 19; <em>but see Lopez v. Heckler, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 1510-11 (Boochever, J., concurring); <em>Whipp v. Weinberger, </em>505 F.2d 800, 801 (6th Cir.1974). In the absence of an authoritative ruling by the Supreme Court to the contrary, we continue to believe that the 60-day requirement is not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">That conclusion leads to the further inquiry whether the failure of some class members to satisfy the 60-day requirement is nonetheless fatal to their claims. Without assessing the correctness of Chief Judge Weinstein\u2019s view that the Secretary failed timely to assert the 60-day provision as a defense, we agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the 60-day requirement, even if timely raised, does not bar the claims of any class members because the 60-day period was effectively tolled during the time that SSA\u2019s policy of applying the challenged presumption concerning residual functional capacity remained operative but undisclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">All of the class members who permitted their administrative or judicial remedies to expire were entitled to believe that their Government\u2019s determination of ineligibility was the considered judgment of an agency faithfully executing the laws of the United States. Though they knew of the denial or loss of benefits, they did not and could not know that those adverse decisions had been made on the basis of a systematic procedural irregularity that rendered them subject to court challenge. Where the Government\u2019s secretive conduct prevents plaintiffs from knowing of a violation of rights, statutes of limitations have been tolled until such time as plaintiffs had a reasonable opportunity to learn the facts concerning the cause of action. <em>See Lopez v. Heckler, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 1505-07 (disability claim); <em>Barrett v. United States, </em>689 F.2d 324, 327-30 (2d Cir.1982) (claim under Federal Tort Claims Act), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3111, 77 L.Ed.2d 1366 (1983); <em>Chiappa v. Califano, </em>480 F.Supp. 856 (S.D.N.Y.1979) (disability claim). Since in this ease the full extent of the Government\u2019s clandestine policy was uncovered only in the course of this litigation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> all class members may pursue this action notwithstanding the 60-day requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>B. Mandamus Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Section 1361 of the Judicial Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The Secretary resists mandamus jurisdiction with two arguments: (1) that the third sentence of section 405(h) of Title 42 bars mandamus jurisdiction and (2) that even if mandamus were available, the District Court erred in concluding that the writ could properly be issued. Neither argument succeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Although the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions declined to decide whether the third sentence of section 405(h) bars mandamus jurisdiction over claims arising under the Act, <em>Heckler v. Ringer, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2022; <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, supra, </em>442 U.S. at 698, 99 S.Ct. at 2556; <em>Norton v. Mathews, </em>427 U.S. 524, 529-31, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2774-75, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976); <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 332 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. at 901 n. 12, it is settled in this and other circuits that, notwithstanding the sweeping language of section 405(h), mandamus jurisdiction is available under circumstances where the writ properly would issue. <em>See, e.g., Dietsch v. Schweiker, </em>700 F.2d 865, 867-68 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Mercer v. Birchman, supra, </em>700 F.2d at 832; <em>Ellis v. Blum, </em>643 F.2d 68, 78-82 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Barnett v. Califano, </em>580 F.2d 28, 31 (2d Cir.1978); <em>White v. Mathews, </em>559 F.2d 852, 856 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1458, 55 L.Ed.2d 500 (1978); <em>see also Lopez v. Heckler, supra, </em>725 F.2d at 1507-08; <em>Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Minnesota v. Heckler, supra, </em>720 F.2d at 968-69; <em>Kuehner v. Schweiker, supra, </em>717 F.2d at 819; <em>Leschniok v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">This is a case where the writ properly would issue. A writ of mandamus will not issue unless (1) the plaintiffs have a right to have the act performed, (2) the defendant is under a clear nondiscretionary duty to perform the act requested, and (3) plaintiff has exhausted all other avenues of relief. The first two conditions are obviously satisfied. The Act and the regulations enacted thereunder establish both the right and the duty \u2014 claimants\u2019 right to have eligibility determinations based on individualized assessments of residual functional capacity and the Secretary\u2019s duty to make such assessments and base eligibility determinations upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">In a sense it is somewhat anomalous to uphold the exercise of mandamus jurisdiction in a case such as this where the District Judge concluded, and we agree, that all class members have an adequate remedy under section 405(g) of the Act. Normally, the availability of jurisdiction for traditional appellate review would preclude mandamus jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we rely on mandamus jurisdiction as an alternate source of the District Court\u2019s authority, in the event that, upon further review, it is determined that section 405(g) jurisdiction is unavailable to some of the class members.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">C. The Merits and the Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"AI8n\">The Secretary has made no claim before the District Court or on appeal that use of the presumption concerning residual functional capacity was lawful. There is thus no dispute that on the merits the class members are entitled to prevail. However, the Secretary challenges on appeal the scope of the District Court\u2019s remedial decree, specifically, the reinstatement of benefits for those class members previously determined to be disabled but subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>terminated from the disability rolls. This reinstatement has the effect of awarding interim benefits to terminated class members until such time as the SSA makes a procedurally correct determination that they are no longer eligible for disability benefits. In the Secretary\u2019s view, this award of interim benefits violates the principle of sovereign immunity, which shields the Government from liability for a money judgment in the absence of an express congressional enactment waiving such immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The Act authorizes benefit payments following a final decision by the Secretary or a final judgment by a court that a claimant is \u201centitled\u201d to benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(i). The amended judgment provides interim benefits only to those individuals who have previously received a \u201cfinal decision\u201d from the Secretary that they were \u201centitled\u201d to disability benefits. New applicants were not awarded interim benefits. Once the District Court properly invalidated the Secretary\u2019s termination decisions because of the acknowledged procedural illegality, the Court was clearly entitled to reinstate the earlier favorable final decisions pending lawful redeterminations of each claimant\u2019s continuing eligibility. As both the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have held in closely analogous circumstances, the payment of benefits to wrongfully terminated recipients follows a final decision of the Secretary and consequently is consistent with the requirements of section 405(i). <em>Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Minnesota v. Heckler, supra; Lopez v. Heckler, supra </em>(preliminary injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We do not construe the recent amendment to section 223 of the Act, Pub.L. No. 97-455, \u00a7 2, 96 Stat. 2498 (1983) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(g), extended through December 7, 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-118, \u00a7 2, 97 Stat. 803 (1983)), as indicating a congressional understanding that federal courts lacked remedial power to order the award of interim benefits in appropriate circumstances. That amendment entitles claimants who are challenging a termination decision to continue to receive benefits throughout their administrative appeals. We see no reason to think that Congress, in authorizing interim benefits during administrative appeals, believed that such benefits were not available during pursuit of judicial remedies. The more plausible interpretation is that Congress was anxious to fill a gap and ensure continuity of benefits on the understanding that, after administrative remedies were pursued, courts had adequate authority to continue interim benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">More fundamentally, we do not construe section 405(i) as a limitation on a federal court\u2019s remedial powers under the Act. While a court\u2019s injunctive power must be exercised with caution, respectful of the authority of coordinate branches of Government, <em>cf Heckler v. Day, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2249, 2258, 81 L.Ed.2d 88 (1984), where, as here, the award of interim benefits is necessary to make whole individuals harmed by the SSA\u2019s failure to abide by the law, federal courts are not without authority to award the necessary relief. <em>See Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Minnesota v. Heckler, supra; Day v. Schweiker, </em>685 F.2d 19, 23-24 (2d Cir.1982), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Heckler v. Day, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2249, 81 L.Ed.2d 88 (1984); <em>White v. Mathews, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 861 (Social Security Act does not \u201cex-clud[e] the possibility of interim payments ordered by a court exercising its remedial power\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>435 U.S. 908, 98 S.Ct. 1458, 55 L.Ed.2d 500 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-5\">. SSA\u2019s policy was communicated through a series of unpublished internal memoranda circulated within SSA from 1979 through 1982. It was enforced on the state disability determination agency through SSA\u2019s \"Quality Assurance Review\u201d of initial state determinations. At both the regional and national levels SSA analysts and physicians conduct sample reviews of state agency decisions. Whenever regional or national review detects an \"error,\u201d the claim is remanded to the state agency for redetermination. According to the evidence presented to the District Court, for the period in question SSA quality assurance reviews, and consequently the state agency whose performance SSA scrutinized, were guided by the challenged presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. The differing consequences of the presumption for the minority and majority of class members become evident from a comparison of the \"grid\u201d regulations concerning older and younger persons. <em>Compare </em>20 C.F.R. subpart P, app. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 201.01, 201.09, 202.01, 202.09, 203.01, 203.10 (1983) (unskilled claimants aged 50 and over granted benefits), <em>with </em>20 C.F.R. subpart P, app. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 201.18, 201.23-24, 202.16-.17, 203.25 (1983) (unskilled claimants aged 49 and under denied benefits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">. Federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1982), was also invoked for causes of action based on the rule-making provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982), the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982), and the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. In view of our disposition of the appeal, we do not reach the question of whether jurisdiction is available on these alternative bases. Furthermore, since the Secretary does not challenge the standing of the individual and class plaintiffs, we do not reach the issue whether the City and State of New York have standing to assert their own interests or, acting as <em>parens patriae, </em>to protect the interests of their citizens. C/. <em>Watt v. Energy Action Educational Foundation, </em>454 U.S. 151, 160, 102 S.Ct. 205, 212, 70 L.Ed.2d 309 (1981) (inconsequential standing issues reserved).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AhEm\">. At every stage in the administrative review process claimants are normally required to appeal from adverse administrative decisions within 60 days, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.900 <em>et seq. </em>and 416.1400 <em>et seq. </em>Consequently, the class members the Secretary considers time-barred are (1) claimants who did not seek administrative review within 60 days of the initial state agency determination of ineligibility, (2) claimants who sought an AU hearing but did not seek Appeals Council review within 60 days, and (3) claimants who appealed to the Appeals Council but failed to bring suit in federal district court within 60 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. Although an earlier case, <em>Mental Health Ass'n of Minnesota v. Heckler, supra, </em>involved the identical SSA presumption at issue here, in that litigation SSA erroneously represented that the presumption was not in use in other SSA regions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b846-11\">. Even if we were inclined to agree with the Secretary that the 60-day provision is jurisdictional, it would still be arguable that the time period was tolled by the non-disclosure of the presumption challenged in this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">. If the Supreme Court were to disagree with our rulings that class members are in compliance with the presentment and 60-day requirements of section 405(g), we believe mandamus jurisdiction would be available. However, we recognize that if section 405(g) jurisdiction should be held unavailable because of disagreement with our ruling that administrative remedies need not be exhausted, then mandamus jurisdiction would also be unavailable. <em>See Heckler v. Ringer, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2022-23; <em>Ellis v. Blum, supra, </em>643 F.2d at 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
