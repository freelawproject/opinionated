BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"Aqiu\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-28\">For a second time, we consider Dr. David Daly\u2019s claim that his First Amendment rights were violated by the temporary six day removal of his clinical privileges at the University of Texas Health Science Center.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Daly also claims that the District Court erred in dismissing his case without specifically ruling on \u2014 or granting \u2014 his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>post-remand motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint alleging a continuing conspiracy to destroy his professional standing and force his resignation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AEyD\">Facts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axs\">Dr. Daly, a tenured professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, filed this lawsuit on August 31, 1979, alleging two causes of action against his superiors at the medical school. He asserted that defendant-appellee suspended his clinical privileges at the medical school in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, He also alleged that as a part of this suspension he was told that he could not communicate with his patients and that this order violated his First Amendment rights, Later he attempted to expand discovery to include events that had occurred after the date suit was filed to assert the theory that defendants were conspiring to wrongfully terminate his employment. This conspiracy claim was not contained in his original complaint and Daly\u2019s motion to expand the scope of discovery was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AqCs\">Approximately two weeks prior to trial, Daly attempted to amend his complaint to include the conspiracy claim. On January 23, 1981 the District Judge denied his motion to amend and proceeded to decide the case on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court determined that Daly had not proved the existence of a property interest and granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on April 30, 1981. Plaintiff appealed to this Court and in an opinion dated March 14, 1982, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiff could not elevate his claim to the deprivation of a liberty or property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. We also affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend since the denial was manifestly within the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"A05d\">We determined, however, that the District Court failed to analyze the plaintiffs First Amendment claim and remanded the case only for a determination on that issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also held that because plaintiff had not asserted a retaliation claim before the DJstrict Court&gt; he could not do 80 on aPPea-l-</p>\n<p id=\"AxOl\">On remand the First Amendment claim was considered by the District Court on a motion for summary judgment. On January 7, 1983, the plaintiff responded to defendanf s motion for summary judgment on the First Amendment issue with yet another motion to supplement his complaint, Plaintiffs supplemental complaint sought to amend his original complaint by alleging that he was the victim of an ongoing conspiracy to deny him the right to pursue his remedies in the federal court. The District Court did not specifically address plaintiffs motion to amend to include a \u00a7 1985(2) claim and its judgment dismissed Daly\u2019s action in its entirety. It is from this order that plaintiff appeals,</p>\n<p id=\"AeIh\">T\u2019he <em>Constitutionality of Regulations of Conduct That Have an Incidental Impact On Speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKd\">It is beyond dispute that a state operated hospital has the right, and the duty, to regulate the conduct of its physicians. Limitations on professional conduct necessarily affect the use of language and association; accordingly, reasonable restraints on the practice of medicine and professional actions cannot be defeated by pointing to the fact that communication is involved. <em>Garcia v. Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>384 F.Supp. 434 (W.D. Tex.1974), aff\u2019d. 421 U.S. 995, 95 S.Ct. 2391, 44 L.Ed.2d 663 (1975) held that \u201c[tjhere is no right to practice medicine which is not subordinate to the police power.\u201d In the first appeal of this ease, both the District Court and this Court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>mined that no liberty or property interest was established by Daly because of the impermanent nature of the suspension and the fact that he was not foreclosed from private practice; additionally, the suspension in no way affected Daly\u2019s employment as a tenured professor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">By withdrawing clinical privileges for a brief period at a state hospital, Daly\u2019s employer regulated only his professional conduct. The state has a legitimate interest, through continuing supervision, in maintaining the quality of medical care provided within its facilities. <em>Bigelow v. Virginia, </em>421 U.S. 809, 827, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 2234, 44 L.Ed.2d 660, 664 (1975) (citation omitted). In short, as we earlier pointed out \u201c[a] doctor has no constitutional right to practice medicine at a public hospital.\u201d <em>Daly v. Sprague, </em>675 F.2d at 727, <em>citing Hayman v. Galveston, </em>273 U.S. 414, 47 S.Ct. 363, 71 L.Ed. 714 (1927). Since the state undoubtedly possessed the power to regulate nonspeech and nonassociation aspects of Daly\u2019s professional actions, any incidental restrictions on his freedom of speech and association are not constitutionally invalid. <em>See Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, </em>436 U.S. 447, 457, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1919, 56 L.Ed.2d 444, 454 (1978) (speech \u201cessential but subordinate component\u201d of activity which state had discretion to control).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">\u201c[T]he State has interest as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.\u201d <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed.2d 811, 817 (1968). Daly\u2019s intention to speak and associate with his patients at the medical center is clearly subsumed within and subservient to the regulation of medical practitioners in state hospitals. Any communication prevented by the removal of staff privileges relates only to that communication taking place at the center in conjunction with Daly\u2019s employment responsibilities as a physician. Daly was not forced to relinquish any First Amendment right he would enjoy as a private citizen. Only the state clinical privileges extended to him as a physician-employee of the medical center were affected for this brief time period.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">\n<em>Denial of Leave to Amend Complaint is Within the District Court\u2019s Discretion and Can be Shown by Implication from its Decision to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">Prior to his first appeal Daly unsuccessfully attempted to amend his complaint alleging appellees\u2019 continuing conspiracy to destroy his professional standing and force his resignation. Following remand, he sought to bring before the District Court a continuation of' the same adverse activity through a motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint. He claimed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2) that appellees have undertaken a conspiracy to punish him for pursuing his remedies in the federal courts. The District Court did not specifically rule on Daly\u2019s motion to file this supplemental complaint, but its judgment directed that the plaintiff take nothing and that his action be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">We find that the District Court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was so inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s request for leave to amend as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>implicitly deny his motion. In light of our determination that the District Court denied by necessary implication the plaintiffs motion to supplement, we need not direct our review to a determination of whether, as the plaintiff contends, the District Court erred in not ruling directly upon the mo-*'10n'</p>\n<p id=\"AsqT\">Leave to amend pleadings shall be freely given when justice so requires. However, it is by no means automatic. <em>Layfield v. Bill Heard Chevrolet Co., </em>607 F.2d 1097, 1099 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 939, 100 S.Ct. 2161, 64 L.Ed.2d 793 (1980). Thus, the decision to grant or to deny a motion for leave to amend lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. Here, we find no abuse of discretion in the District Court s failure to grant the plaintiff s motion for leave to supplement. As we view it, we are not faced with the application of the usual principles<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on allowance of amended complaints. This is because this case was remanded on the specific and narrow grounds of the First Amendment claim. Nee <em>supra </em>note 3. We did not remand for a reconsideration of the , , , . . whole controversy. We remanded solely \u201e , . , , , . . , __. i ; for trial court decision on the First Amend- , , . , , , ment claim with further supplemental , . .. , t-,. , briefing and discovery as to the First . f , , . Amendment claim. Nothing further was \u201e . , authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">Although it would have been tidier for the District Court to have separately and explicitly considered the motion for leave to supplement, on appeal it cannot be said that disposing of the motion by necessary implication is improper when the supplemental pleading deals with events that occurred before the filing of the original pleading and in reality is only an amended pleading. <em>See </em>6 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1510.</p>\n<p id=\"AtS\">Further, Daly\u2019s supplemental filing is precluded by the law of the case doctrine gince the pr0p0sed supplemental complaint was not within the scope of our very limited remand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzA\">The \u201claw of the case\u201d rule is based on the salutory and sound public policy that litigation should come to an end. It is predicated on the premise that \u201cthere would be no end to a suit if every obstinate litigant could, by repeated appeals, compel the court to listen to criticisms on their opinions or speculate of changes from changes in its members,\u201d and that jt would be impossible for an appellate court \u201cto perform its duties satisfactorily and efficiently\u201d and expeditiously \u201cif a question, once considered and decided by Were to be litigated anew in the same cage upon any and every subsequent appeal\u201d thereof<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azag\">While the of the case\u00bb doctrine is , ,, , , . . \u00bb not an inexorable command, a decision of , n . . , in . a legal issue or issues by an appellate , , ,\u201e ,, \u201e court establishes the law of the case , , , \u201e . ,, , , and must be followed m all subsequent ,. ... in the same ease m the trial , , , , . ,, ,, , court or on a later appeal in the appellate , n r.n ,, ., , court, unless [i] the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different, [ii] controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues, or [iii] the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>(Citations omitted). <em>White v.

In fact, the suspension was for only 22 days and Daly\u2019s voluntary leave during this same period \u2014 due to his wife\u2019s illness \u2014 reduced the actual suspension of clinical privileges to less than a week. <em>See Daly, </em>note 1, at 721.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">.

The Court held that there are substantial limits placed on the extent to which a school board's decisions may be restrained on First Amendment grounds. <em>Pico </em>further illustrates that courts should not intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems unless basic constitutional values are directly and sharply implicated. The same considerations appear to apply to the university medical center in view of the state\u2019s extensive authority to regulate the practice of medicine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"A9v\">. As this Court pointed out in <em>Daly v.

A District Court's denial of a motion to amend is reviewed according to the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Barrett v.
