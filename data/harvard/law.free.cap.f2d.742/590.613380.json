In order for Miami Herald to be entitled to attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, it must qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the statute. In determining whether Miami Herald is a prevailing party, \u201cthe proper focus is whether the plaintiff has been successful on the central issue\u201d; \u201ca prevailing party need not have prevailed on all the issues; it is sufficient that plaintiffs prevail on the main issue.\u201d <em>Best v. Boswell, </em>696 F.2d 1282, 1289 (11th Cir.1983); see also <em>Iranian Students Association v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1979), <em>Ramos v. Koebig, </em>638 F.2d 838, 845 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">The main or central issue in this case is whether the licensing system in Chapter 16 of the Hallandale City Code infringes upon the Miami Herald\u2019s rights under the First Amendment. In the panel opinion, we observed that \u201cwith one exception, the contested provisions concern themselves exclusively with establishing a system whereby the owners of vending machines are to pay a set fee as a precondition to engaging in business within city limits, and to that extent merely impose a revenue-raising occupational license tax\u2014a tax under state law.\u201d In light of that observation, we held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the merits of Miami Herald\u2019s claims with respect to all but the single non-tax related provision. Given that the non-tax provision constituted a very small segment of the ordinance challenged, and that the focus of Miami Herald\u2019s concern is upon those provisions requiring the newspaper to pay a license tax, we conclude that the Miami Herald is not a prevailing party within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and is therefore not entitled to attorney fees. The Miami Herald\u2019s suggestion that it has \u201cprevailed\u201d because its claims were not rejected on the merits is ill taken. Prevailing for purposes of \u00a7 1988 is exhibited by the fact that the litigant \u201chas acquired the primary relief sought.\u201d <em>Iranian Students Association v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1979). This the Herald has not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">IT IS ORDERED that appellees\u2019 motion for attorney fees is DENIED and the judgment of the district court awarding appellees attorney fees is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
