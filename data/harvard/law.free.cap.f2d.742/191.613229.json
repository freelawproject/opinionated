The plaintiff was injured while performing services on McDermott\u2019s premises during the course of his employment with a contractor (TAD) that had contracted to furnish certain services at McDermott\u2019s site.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">On original hearing, we reversed the summary judgment and remanded, insofar as the district court had held the plaintiff employee\u2019s \u00e9mployment not within the coverage of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.O. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>734 F.2d 229 (5th Cir.1984). We did so on the basis of a decision of this circuit handed down after the district court\u2019s judgment below. <em>Thornton v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>707 F.2d 149 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 735, 79 L.Ed.2d 194 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">On petitions for rehearing, the defendant and third-party defendant, appellees, suggest, inter alia, that the present facts may be distinguishable from those in <em>Thornton </em>and that, at any rate, the decision (subsequent to our own opinion) of the Supreme Court on June 26, 1984 in <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Johnson, </em>\u2014U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2827, 81 L.Ed.2d 768 (1984), casts doubt on our holding that under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act the principal, McDermott, enjoyed no immunity from a tort suit by an employee of its contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">The record as developed in the district court, for summary judgment purposes only, did not take into account the issues posed by the subsequent circuit decision in <em>Thornton </em>nor by the subsequent Supreme Court decision in <em>Washington Transit. </em>The sketchy record does not, for instance, touch on factual issues of employment duties and insurance coverage that are relevant under expansive or limited readings of the holdings, respectively, of these two subsequent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">Rather than attempt now to interpret and apply these subsequent decisions to a record that was developed without reference to the issues presented by these subsequent decisions, we deem it appropriate to GRANT the petitions for panel rehearing and to VACATE our panel opinion, insofar as it reversed the summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s negligence and strict liability claims against McDermott. However, we VACATE the district court\u2019s summary judgment in this regard, and we REMAND to the district court for further proceedings on these claims. We do not vacate our panel decision insofar as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>it affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 intentional tort claim against McDermott.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">REHEARING GRANTED; ORIGINAL PANEL OPINION VACATED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
