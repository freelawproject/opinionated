GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">This environmental suit involves a 466-acre tract of cypress-tupelo gum swamp located on the west bank of the Mississippi River in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. The tract is bounded on the northeast by a residential subdivision known as Lincoln-shire, on the west by the Drill Hole Canal, a small artificial canal constructed during the 1960s, and on the east by a levee, on the other side of which runs the Millaudon Canal. The tract is surrounded by levees constructed in 1972 by the owner of the property at that time. In late 1972 or early 1973, the Drill Hole Canal, which previously had been a navigable waterway, was dammed, completing the ring of levees and impounding the tract so that it was no longer subject to tidal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-18\">In late 1976 or early 1977, C.I.T. Corporation became the owner of the tract through foreclosure and decided to proceed with the previous owner\u2019s plans to convert the tract for residential use by draining and filling the area within the levees. In order to do so, C.I.T. began working with the Corps of Engineers to prepare the environmental impact statement needed to secure an after-the-fact permit for the closure of the Drill Hole Canal. <em>See infra, </em>part B. In late 1979, the Corps discovered two gaps in the levee at the closure of the Drill Hole Canal. After receiving assurance from the Corps that no permits were required for the work, C.I.T. repaired the two gaps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-19\">In 1980, C.I.T. installed a drainage culvert into the levee between the tract and the Lincolnshire subdivision. This culvert permitted gravity drainage from the tract into a drainage canal serving the subdivision. Because the first culvert was ineffective, in 1981 C.I.T. installed a second culvert into the levee at a lower elevation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-20\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-21\">The Corps of Engineers first became involved in this case in March 1976, when it received a citizen\u2019s complaint that the Drill Hole Canal had been blocked in violation of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (RHA) and federal regulations which require the issuance of a permit for activities which result in the obstruction of navigable waters. Soon after receiving the complaint, the Corps issued a cease and desist order to the developer of the tract (C.I.T.\u2019s predecessor in interest) and ordered the developer to apply for an after-the-fact permit for the canal blockage and for maintenance of the levee system around the tract. After C.I.T. became owner of the tract, it filed the necessary application. The Corps decided that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>would have to prepare an environmental impact statement before granting or denying the permit application in order to comply with its responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act, \u00a7 102, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Between late 1977 and June 1979, the Corps proceeded with the development of an environmental impact statement and took other steps to review C.I.T.\u2019s application. During this time, several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, notified the Corps of their opposition to the granting of the permit and their intention to participate in hearings on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">In the spring of 1979, C.I.T. first inquired of the Corps whether the blockage of the Drill Hole Canal fell within the scope of nationwide permits issued by the Corps in July 1977. These nationwide permits authorize certain classes of activity within the scope of the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction to be carried out without an individual project permit. The Corps agreed with C.I.T. that its activities were authorized by the nationwide permit and did not require an individual permit. In September 1979, the Corps advised C.I.T. that its proposed repair of gaps in the levees surrounding the tract was also authorized by the nationwide permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">In early 1980, Orleans asked the Corps to reconsider its two decisions regarding the applicability of nationwide permits. The Corps considered Orleans\u2019 arguments and consulted with personnel of the Environmental Protection Agency before deciding, after almost one year, to stand by its determinations that the canal blockage and levee repair were authorized by the nationwide permits. During this period of reconsideration, the Corps inspected, also at Orleans\u2019 request, the installation of the two drainage culverts in the tract\u2019s northeast levee. The Corps engineer who inspected the site reported that the installation did not involve any work upon the wetlands in the interior of the tract, nor did it result in the depositing of dredged or fill material into the wetlands. The Corps concluded that it had no basis to assert jurisdiction over the culvert installations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Orleans filed this suit in June 1981, seeking declaratory and injunctive\u2019 relief from the Corps\u2019 decision that C.I.T. was not subject to individual permit requirements for three activities: the blockage of the Drill Hole Canal, the repair of levees around the tract and the installation of culverts to drain the tract. One year later, the plaintiffs <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that permits were required as a matter of law for installation of the two drainage culverts. The defendants <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> countered with motions to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all issues raised by the plaintiffs. The district court, after a hearing, granted the defendants\u2019 motions and dismissed the complaint, holding that none of the decisions not to require permits was arbitrary or capricious. The plaintiffs now appeal the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">Orleans concedes that we normally must review discretionary decisions of the Corps under the arbitrary and capricious standard, and it concedes that decisions not to require permits for actions by private developers, such as those at issue here, are usually considered to be discretionary. Despite these admissions, Orleans argues that we should review the first of the three decisions challenged in this case more closely because \u201ca successor agency head [has], without any apparent valid reason, alter[ed] a three year old, apparently valid exercise of authority by his predecessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issues before this court, then, are (1) what standards of review to apply, and (2) whether the three challenged agency-decisions are reversible under the appropriate standards of review. Before discussing these issues, however, we shall canvass some of the statutes and regulations governing the Corps\u2019 decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Orleans argues that there are two statutory schemes under which the Corps should have exercised its authority to require permits for the enclosure and drainage of the C.I.T. tract: the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended in 1977, popularly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the RHA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">The Corps possesses regulatory authority relevant to this case granted by the Clean Water Act, which, in general, prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States except in compliance with the CWA\u2019s terms.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clean Water Act, \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 502(12), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a), 1362(12) (1978). The Act authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to \u201cissue permits, after notice and opportunity for public hearings[,] for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites,\u201d and to issue nationwide permits for some classes of activity. Clean Water Act, \u00a7 404(a), (e), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(a), (e) (1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In July 1977 the Corps enacted the nationwide permit regulations on which the Corps relied in this case to exempt the blockage of the Drill Hole Canal from individual permit requirements under the CWA. Those regulations provided for a phase-in of the individual permit requirements to wetlands and non-navigable waters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Discharges into wetlands or non-navigable waters prior to the phase-in dates were not subject to individual permit requirements if they did not violate certain health and environmental restrictions, subject to the Corps\u2019 reservation of discretionary authority to require an individual permit if the circumstances \u201cindicate the need for such action because of ... adverse impacts to the affected waters,\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 323.4-l(a), 323.4-4 (1977), superseded, <em>see </em>47 Fed.Reg. 31,800 (1982). In addition to its authority to require individual permits for the depositing of dredged or fill material in navigable waters, the Corps may bring suits for injunctive and punitive relief for violations of permits issued under section 404. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(s) (1978). The Corps\u2019 1977 regulations allowed district engineers to require an after-the-fact permit rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>bring suit if \u201cthe unauthorized activity does not warrant legal action.\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 326.5 (1977).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Orleans has also asserted claims relating to the Corps\u2019 regulatory authority under the Rivers and Harbors Act. Section 10 of the RHA prohibits the obstruction of the \u201cnavigable capacity\u201d of the waters of the United States except as. authorized by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of Army. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403. The Corps of Engineers has developed regulations which specify the circumstances under which it will authorize activities which obstruct navigable waters, as well as regulations which define \u201cnavigable waters\u201d for the purposes of determining whether the Corps will exercise section 10 jurisdiction over particular bodies of water. Through these regulations the Corps has asserted jurisdiction over privately developed artificial channels, even those passing through private property, if they are susceptible to being used in support of interstate commerce. 33 C.F.R. 329.4, 329.5, 329.8 (1983). In general, the Corps requires individual permits for all \u201cstructures and/or work in or affecting navigable waters of the United States ____\u201d unless the regulations specifically exempt the activity, 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.3(a) (1983), but it has established \u201cnationwide permits\u201d which exempt certain classes of activities from the individual permit requirements. Prior to July 22, 1982, nationwide permits promulgated under section 10 authority were codified at 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.-4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These nationwide permits, promulgated by the Corps in July 1977, provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-5\">The following structures or work are hereby permitted for purposes of Section 10 and do not require separate Department of the Army permits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-6\">(c) The <em>repair, </em>rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously authorized, currently serviceable, structure or <em>of any currently serviceable structure constructed prior to the requirement for authorization; </em>provided such repair, rehabilitation, or replacement does not result in a deviation from the plans of the original structure, and further provided that the structure to be maintained has not been put to uses differing from uses specified for it in any permit authorizing its original construction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-11\">(g) <em>Structures or work completed </em>before 18 December 1968 or <em>in waterbodies over which the District Engineer has not asserted jurisdiction provided there is no interference with navigation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.4 (1977) (emphasis added). In this case, the Corps found that C.I.T. was exempt from the permit requirement for the blockage of the Drill Hole Canal on the basis of section 322.4(g), and the repair of the levees around the C.I.T. tract on the basis of section 322.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-13\">Section 9 of the RHA prohibits the construction of dams or dikes across navigable waters of the United States unless both Congress and the Secretary of the Army approve.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Secretary of the Army has not delegated the authority to grant or deny section 9 permits to the Chief of Engineers, but the Corps\u2019 regulations under section 9 allow the district engineer of the relevant district to recommend \u201cconditions to be imposed\u201d upon authorized section 9 projects. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 321 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">Orleans argues that because the Corps initially required C.I.T. to apply for an af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>ter-the-fact permit for the 1972-73 canal closure, the Corps' decision to abandon the permit process should be reviewed under a stricter standard than the usual \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the reversal in position occurred after a change in the administration of the Corps\u2019 New Orleans District, we should, according to Orleans, view it with suspicion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">This court has recently reaffirmed the principle that an agency may adjust its rules and policies in the light of its experience and changing circumstances. <em>Creppel, </em>670 F.2d at 571; <em>American Petroleum Institute v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>661 F.2d 340, 355 (5th Cir.1981). Even when an agency abandons a prior determination, the reviewing court should affirm the agency\u2019s decision if the <em>final </em>agency action is not arbitrary or capricious. <em>Texaco, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>700 F.2d 1039, 1043 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Creppel, </em>670 F.2d at 571-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Orleans invites this panel to modify the rules summarized above because in this case the reversal of an agency\u2019s position coincides with a change in agency leadership. We decline to depart from our traditional standard of review, however, because to do so would violate a basic principle of judicial review of agency action, that is, the presumption of regularity. <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). Orleans advances no persuasive reasons for abandoning this presumption here. If, in fact, the Corps\u2019 decision to discontinue the permit process for the Drill Hole Canal was made in bad faith or is otherwise not supported by the administrative record, then the decision will not withstand the arbitrary and capricious standard. On the other hand, if the decision represents a valid exercise of the Corps\u2019 decision-making powers, then this court should not interfere with the Corps\u2019 judgment. <em>Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824. To substitute a stricter rule of judicial review for changes of agency rules made by succeeding administrations would unnecessarily and inappropriately restrict the agency\u2019s discretion. The record in this case shows that the New Orleans district of the Corps has had three district engineers since 1976.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If this court considers each change of administration to undermine the traditional standards of deference outlined in <em>Creppel, </em>then only rarely would a federal agency such as the Corps be able to change its bureaucratic mind without being subject to a higher level of judicial scrutiny. Such a rule is, it seems to us, at odds with this court\u2019s policy of deference to matters generally committed to the expertise and discretion of federal agencies. <em>See Avoyelles Sportsmen\u2019s League, Inc. v. Marsh, </em>715 F.2d 897, 904 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Buttrey v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1170, 1183-85 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 927, 103 S.Ct. 2087, 77 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">We therefore conclude that the Corps\u2019 decision not to require an after-the-fact permit for the closure of the Drill Hole Canal will be reviewed, as will the other two decisions challenged on appeal, under the arbitrary and capricious standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Orleans has challenged the three Corps decisions relating to the C.I.T. tract on the grounds that they violate the terms of the CWA. We first address Orleans\u2019 attack on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>the halting of the after-the-fact permit process for the closure of the Drill Hole Canal,</p>\n<p id=\"A702\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"AGin\">In 1979, the Corps decided that the closure of the canal was within the scope of a nationwide permit promulgated under the CWA in 1977, 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.4-l(a), the text of which is set out <em>supra, </em>note 7. Under this regulation, the Corps did not require after-the-fact permits for discharges made prior to July 25, 1975, except for discharges \u201cinto navigable waters of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atu5\">Orleans has not expressly stated why it believes its decision was arbitrary or capricious. Primarily, it relies on the fact that the decision not to require a permit was a reversal of the Corps\u2019 prior position. We examine, first, whether the Corps\u2019 decision appears to be a reasonable application of the regulation, and second, whether the Corps acted arbitrarily or capriciously in reversing the permit process.</p>\n<p id=\"AE1\">The facts before the Corps were as follows. During 1972 and 1973, when this discharge occurred, the Corps did not consider the Drill Hole Canal to be a navigable waterway. The Corps did not exert jurisdiction over private, man-made canals, such as the Drill Hole Canal, during the period when this canal was actually blocked. In March 1976, the Corps issued a cease and desist order to the owner of the C.I.T. tract, basing its authority to require an after-the-fact permit on <em>United States v. Stoeco Homes, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 597 (3d Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 927, 95 S.Ct. 1124, 43 L.Ed.2d 397 (1975). This was the first time that the Corps even arguably asserted jurisdiction over the Drill Hole Canal. In 1977, the Corps formally amended its regulations to make it clear that private artificial canals subject to tidal action were within the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction,</p>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">In applying the nationwide permit regulation to this situation, the Corps decided that the discharge was not made into a \u201cnavigable water\u201d, based on the status of the Drill Hole Canal when the discharge occurred. In reasoning this way, the Corps chose not to use several other points in time at which it might have chosen to measure navigability: the enactment of the CWA, the promulgation of the 1977 regulations\u2019 or the time when the CorPs was deciding whether to re&lt;luire an after-the-^ac^ Perm^- Although the Corps did not actually discuss its rationale for choosing ^he date of the discharge, a valid rationale is immediately apparent: that is, the unfairness of exerting jurisdiction over activity which, when done, was clearly not within the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction. In fact, the Eleventh Circuit recently held that the Corps may not retroactively apply the CWA permit requirements against private developers 'n some situations. <em>United States v. Context-Marks Corp., </em>729 F.2d 1294 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Buccaneer Point Estates, Inc. v. United States, </em>729 F.2d 1297 (11th Cir. 1984). While these cases arose in a factually dissimilar context from this one, their reasoning helps to persuade us that the Corps did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in interpreting this regulation,</p>\n<p id=\"A5l\">Orleans relies primarily on 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.4-4, under which the Corps had discretionary authority to require an individual permit for a discharge otherwise exempted by the nationwide permits. Orleans contends that Colonel Rush was exercising his discretionary authority under this regulation when he began the after-the-fact permit process on the closure of the Drill Hole Canal, and that Colonel Sands acted arbitrarily in halting the permit process. Colonel Sands noted, however, that under the applicable regulatory guidelines that the Corps\u2019 policy was to apply the discretionary permit requirement only to proposed discharges, and not to completed discharges such as the canal closure. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. 230.1 (1975). His interpretation of the guidelines led him to believe that he had no authority to continue the permit process. This reading of the guidelines is a reasonable one, and we cannot say that Colonel Sands\u2019 decision not to invoke his discretionary authority constituted an abuse of that discretion, nor that it was arbitrary or capricious, even though it differed from his predecessor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>The Corps\u2019 decision that the 1972-73 closure of the Drill Hole Canal is covered by the 1977 nationwide permits under the CWA is, therefore, a reasonable interpretation of the nationwide permit regulation. In fact, although Orleans has argued on appeal that this interpretation was a reversal of the Corps\u2019 prior position, it is not clear from the record that the Corps actually considered whether the 1977 regulations might cover the canal closure before C.I.T. first requested the Corps to do so in 1979. Even if the decision is considered to be a reversal of prior Corps policy, under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d test which we must apply to such a decision, <em>see </em>part IY.A, <em>supra, </em>we find no basis in the record for reversing the Corps\u2019 determination that the activity at issue here was covered by the nationwide permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Orleans also contends that the repair of the levees surrounding the C.I.T. tract in the fall of 1979 required permits under the CWA. When C.I.T. first contacted the Corps about repairing the levees, the Corps took the position that the repairs could be performed without a permit under the authority of section 404(f)(1)(B) of the CWA, which exempts the discharge of dredge of fill material for the purposes of maintenance of currently serviceable structures such as levees. In addition, the Corps found that a nationwide permit promulgated under the CWA, 33 C.F.R. 323.4-3(a)(5) (1977), covered the levee repair.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Corps found that the levee was currently serviceable, as required by the statute and the interpretative regulation, because it served as a secondary flood and hurricane protection barrier for the nearby Lincolnshire subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Orleans argues that the Corps acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to require a permit for the levee repair because (1) the levee could not properly be characterized as \u201ccurrently serviceable,\u201d and (2) the Corps did not make the necessary finding that the repair satisfied the conditions enumerated in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.4-3(b) (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">Neither the CWA nor the regulations defines \u201ccurrently serviceable,\u201d nor does the legislative history of the 1977 Clean Water Amendments. The Corps\u2019 determination that the levee was currently serviceable because it filled a need for a flood and hurricane protection barrier for the Lincolnshire subdivision is a reasonable interpretation of the term as it is used in the statute and regulation. Orleans does not challenge this interpretation directly; rather, its primary argument is that the currently serviceable structures of which the statute and regulations contemplate repair include only those structures which were legally built in the first instance. Because the levee was not authorized, Orleans contends, its repair is not exempted from the permit requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because we have already rejected Orleans\u2019 contention that the original structure was unauthorized, however, this argument fails for lack of its necessary factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">We also reject Orleans\u2019 contention that the Corps was required to make specific findings of fact regarding whether the repairs violated any of the conditions set forth in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.4-3(b). The purpose of the nationwide permit system is to allow certain types of discharges to be made without prior Corps approval: if a private party, acting under the assumption that its discharge is allowed under a nation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>wide permit, makes a discharge, that party bears the risk of liability for rectifying the harm done if in fact the discharge is not permitted. In this case, C.I.T. chose to seek the Corps\u2019 opinion before it repaired the levee. The fact that C.I.T. chose to seek the advice of the Corps prior to repairing the levees does not, in our opinion, serve to place upon the Corps an additional burden, not contemplated by the regulations, of making extensive findings of fact regarding compliance with section 323.4-3(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We note also that Orleans has been actively challenging the Corps\u2019 actions in this case since January 1980, and has had ample opportunity to present both to the Corps and the courts evidence which would indicate that the conditions of section 323.-4-3(b) were violated by the levee repairs challenged in this lawsuit. Orleans has not done so. At Orleans\u2019 request, the Corps spent nearly one year reconsidering its decisions not to require permits for the Drill Hole Canal closure and the levee repair. No evidence or legal argument having been presented which persuades us that the levee repairs were not authorized under the nationwide permit, we cannot say that the Corps acted arbitrarily or capriciously in failing to require a CWA permit before C.I.T. made the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Finally, Orleans argues that the installations of two drainage culverts between the C.I.T. tract and an adjacent drainage canal violated the CWA because they resulted in the depositing of dredged or fill material into either the C.I.T. tract itself or into the Lincolnshire Canal, which drains into the Millaudon Canal, a navigable waterway. As was the case with the levee repairs, the record shows that C.I.T. informed the Corps of its intent to install the culverts beforehand and that Corps personnel inspected the site shortly after the work was completed. The Corps\u2019 on-site investigator reported that he found \u201cno evidence of any discharges regulated under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.\u201d The record clearly indicates that after the culverts were installed, only clear water from within the C.I.T. tract flowed into the drainage canal. Clear water is not within the definition of a pollutant under the CWA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Orleans contends, however, that a \u201cplug\u201d of dirt was washed through the canal during the installation of the culverts, and that this discharge of dirt, no matter how small, violated the CWA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In its briefs, Orleans has contended that the \u201cfact\u201d that a plug of earth was washed away during the culvert installation is undisputed. The record does not support the contention that this was a \u201cfact.\u201d Colonel Sands, in his deposition, explained that the Corps had no evidence before it which would confirm that dirt had been deposited either into the tract or into the canal. As he said, C.I.T. could easily have removed the earthen plug and deposited it elsewhere. Colonel Sands indicated in his deposition that the Corps would have asserted jurisdiction under the CWA if the on-site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>inspector had found evidence of the depositing of dredged or fill material. His testimony reflects a necessary deference to the field inspector\u2019s findings of fact. Just as Colonel Sands, as an administrator, must rely on the reports of his subordinates to determine whether the necessary facts for exercise of the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction are present, we, as a reviewing court, must grant considerable deference to the agency\u2019s findings of fact. In this case, Colonel Sands had before him a report from his field inspector indicating that no dredged or fill material was deposited. Relying on this report, and having no concrete information which would indicate that the field inspector was in error, Colonel Sands agreed that the Corps had no jurisdiction under section 404 to require C.I.T. to obtain a permit for the culvert installation. His reliance on this report appears to have been in good faith, and we find no basis for holding that Colonel Sands\u2019 decision was arbitrary or capricious. Even assuming that the report was erroneous, we cannot find in the record before us any indication that Colonel Sands\u2019 reliance upon the findings of the field investigator was so unreasonable as to indicate that the Corps\u2019 handling of this matter was actionable under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Orleans has argued that the first two of the actions challenged in this lawsuit, the blockage of the canal and the repair of the levees, violated section 10 of the RHA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although it also alleged claims under section 9 of the RHA in its complaint, Orleans has not argued these claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Orleans argues that the decision not to require an after-the-fact permit for the closure of the Drill Hole Canal was arbitrary and capricious because it contravened section 10 of the RHA. However, Colonel Sands clearly based his decision not to require a permit on 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.4(g). That section created a nationwide permit for \u201c[sjtructures or work completed before 18 December 1968 or in waterbodies over which the District Engineer has not asserted jurisdiction provided there is no interference with navigation.\u201d The Corps interpreted this regulation to exempt from the permit requirement any structure or work completed in a waterway before the Corps asserted jurisdiction over that waterway. We have already discussed the fact that the Corps did not assert jurisdiction over canals such as the Drill Hole Canal until several years after the Drill Hole Canal was blocked. As long as the Corps\u2019 interpretation of the exemption is not arbitrary or capricious, we must not disturb its decision not to require a section 10 permit. We realize that section 322.4(g) could plausibly be read to exempt only those structures completed in waterbodies over which the Corps had not exerted jurisdiction in July 1977, when the regulation was promulgated. However, we also find that the Corps\u2019 reading of the regulation is not unreasonable, particularly in the light of the recent cases, discussed in part IV.B.l, <em>supra, </em>holding that the Corps may not retroactively apply its permit requirements when to do so would be manifestly unfair. In any event, for reasons not apparent to us, Orleans has chosen not to raise this argument. Rather, it has argued that section 322.4(g) exempted only the <em>repair </em>of structures which were completed prior to the Corps\u2019 assertion of jurisdiction. This argument is clearly based on a misreading of the plain words of the regulation. The regulation plainly exempts the structure itself, in this case, the dam across the Drill Hole Canal. Neither Orleans\u2019 argument nor our own reading of the regulation con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>vinces us that the Corps acted arbitrarily or capriciously in applying section 322.4(g) to this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Orleans\u2019 second line of argument is that, even if an activity was specifically exempted by section 322.4(g) from the mandatory permit requirement, the Corps retained discretionary authority to require an RHA permit under 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 323.4-4, discussed in part IY.B.l, <em>supra. </em>This argument is, again, based upon a misreading of the regulation: section 323.4-4 applied only to projects exempted under the nationwide permits promulgated under the CWA, not the RHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">On its face, Colonel Sands\u2019 decision that the canal closure was not subject to an individual permit requirement was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Orleans\u2019 arguments do not convince us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">Orleans also asserts that the levee repairs made by C.I.T. in 1979 were subject to an RHA permit requirement. Colonel Sands reached the opposite conclusion, based on the nationwide permit found at 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.4(c), which exempted the following activities from the permit requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-8\">The repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of any previously authorized, currently serviceable, structure or of any currently serviceable structure constructed prior to the requirement for authorization; provided such repair, rehabilitation, or replacement does not result in a deviation from the plans of the original structure, and further provided that the structure to be maintained has not been put to uses differing from uses specified for it in any permit authorizing its original construction; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Orleans\u2019 argument is that section 322.4(c) cannot be applied to this repair project because it was neither \u201cpreviously authorized\u201d nor \u201cconstructed prior to the requirement for authorization.\u201d We have already concluded that the levee in question was completed before the Corps asserted jurisdiction over the canal, when no authorization by the Corps was required. Therefore, Colonel Sands\u2019 finding that the levee repair fell into this category of the nationwide permit was completely justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">We find that the Corps\u2019 decisions described above were in accordance with its own regulations and the terms of the RHA. It follows that these decisions were not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">Orleans has raised a number of arguments which we have not specifically addressed in this opinion. These relate primarily to Orleans\u2019 contention that the Corps, particularly Colonel Sands, has acted in bad faith in handling this case. We find no evidence in the record which supports this notion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are convinced that the Corps was reasonable in finding that C.I.T.\u2019s actions in enclosing the tract<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and repairing the levees were allowed under nationwide permits under both the CWA and RHA and that the installation of the drainage culverts did not involve a discharge regulable under the CWA. The Corps\u2019 refusal to require C.I.T. to obtain individual project permits for these acts was not, therefore, arbitrary and capricious. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">. \"The plaintiffs\" and \"Orleans\u201d include the Sierra Club, which was allowed to intervene in the suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">. \"The defendants\u201d include C.I.T., which was also allowed to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">. Actually, Orleans Audubon does not limit its argument to the first decision, i.e., to discontinue the after-the-fact permit process for the closure of the Drill Hole Canal. However, neither of the other decisions can be rationally characterized as a reversal of prior policy, since neither was presented to the Corps prior to the change in administration on which Orleans Audubon bases this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">.

Even so, Orleans' argument would be valid only if the repairs were to that portion of the levee blocking the Drill Hole Canal. These particular repairs appear to have been made in the southern levee of the C.I.T. tract, and the Drill Hole Canal runs beside the west of the tract, but was closed by the levee near the southern end of the tract. We simply cannot be sure where the repairs were made from the information available to us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">. Orleans has also argued that the drainage of water from the C.I.T. tract is prohibited by section 404(f)(2) of the CWA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-9\">Any discharge of dredge or fill material into the navigable waters incidental to any activity having as its purposes bringing an area of the navigable waters to a use which it was not previously subject, where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters be reduced, shall be required to have a permit under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-17\">Orleans contends that the drainage is prohibited under this section because it is incidental to an activity which is intended to bring about the conversion of a wetland, the C.I.T. swamp, into a non-wetland area which can then be developed into a residential area without governmental approval. Although we are fully aware of this possibility, as is the Corps, we cannot require the Corps to exercise a jurisdiction that it does not possess. Section 404(f)(2) applies <em>only </em>when dredged or fill material has been discharged, and water is simply not dredged or fill material. Orleans\u2019 bald assertion that vegetation from the tract (which, it argues, constitutes a pollutant) is also being removed through the culverts is not supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1018-22\">.
