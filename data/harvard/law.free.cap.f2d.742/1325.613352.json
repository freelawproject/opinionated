That statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-5\">(a) Whenever an attorney charged with the prosecution of a defendant in a court of the United States for an alleged felony committed when the defendant was over the age of twenty-one years has reason to believe that the defendant is a dangerous special offender such attorney, a reasonable time before trial or acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, may sign and file with the court, and may amend, a notice (1) specifying that the defendant is a dangerous special offender who upon conviction for such felony is subject to the imposition of a sentence under subsection (b) of this section, and (2) setting out with particularity the reasons why such attorney believes the defendant to be a dangerous special offender. <em>In no case shall the fact that the defendant is alleged to be a dangerous special offender be an issue upon the trial of such felony, be disclosed to the jury, or be disclosed before any plea of guilty or nolo contendere or verdict or finding of guilty to the presiding judge without the consent of the </em>parties____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">In this appeal, Darwin argues that he was improperly sentenced under the statute because the government disclosed to the trial judge prior to a verdict that the defendant was alleged to be a dangerous special offender. The facts relevant to disposition of this issue are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">Darwin\u2019s trial began on December 6, 1982. The verdict was returned on December 9. At a status conference held on December 22, the district judge revealed that on the morning of December 8 he had received an envelope from the Criminal Clerk addressed to him and marked \u201cin camera.\u201d He opened it and read \u201cabout the first four lines\u201d of the document therein, captioned \u201cNotice of intent to request sentencing of the defendant as a dangerous special offender.\u201d The first sentence of the notice, spanning seven lines, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asn_\">Comes now the United States Attorney by and through its undersigned Assistant United States Attorney and in compliance with Title 18, United States Code, Section 3575(a) files this notice of the Government\u2019s intent to specify that Anthony Darwin is a dangerous special offender within the meaning of Section 3575 of Title 18, United States Code, and in support thereof states the following.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA4s\">Realizing that he was forbidden to see such a notice prior to a jury verdict, the experienced trial judge resealed the document in the envelope and did not reopen it until December 10, after a verdict was returned. At the December 22 hearing, the district court ruled that notwithstanding a technical violation of the special offender statute, the error was wholly non-prejudicial; the court therefore declined to dismiss the dangerous special offender notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">An understanding of the purpose and effect of the requirement that \u201cin no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>case shall the fact that the defendant is alleged to be a dangerous special offender ... be disclosed ... before any ... verdict or finding of guilty to the presiding judge\u201d is facilitated by reference to the legislative history of the dangerous special offender statute, which was discussed in depth in <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>537 F.2d 845 (5th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As originally drafted in the Senate, the statute would have proscribed divulging allegations that the defendant was a dangerous special offender to the jury, but not the judge. S.Rep. 91-617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 162-63 (1969); <em>Bailey, </em>537 F.2d at 848. The House, however, modified the Senate bill so as to prohibit disclosure of the special offender notice to the presiding judge, over the objection of the Justice Department that concluded there was no reason to believe that a court would be prejudiced by knowledge of the dangerous special offender notice. <em>Bailey, </em>537 F.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">In the <em>Bailey </em>case, it was undisputed that the prosecuting attorney \u201cin open court in the absence of the jury but in the presence of the judge, announced that a \u2018dangerous special offender\u2019 notice had been filed against three of the defendants.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>537 F.2d at 847. The United States Attorney argued that the statute was intended to prohibit disclosure of the allegations within the notice but not the bare fact that a notice had been filed. The court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-6\">[T]he United States Attorney\u2019s argument fails because the statute when literally read prohibits any kind of disclosure of the notice to the presiding judge and the government in this criminal case should be held strictly to the literal language of the Act. While the statute\u2019s literal prohibition against disclosure may be \u201canomalous\u201d as the district judge concluded, action to remove the anomaly is a matter for the consideration of Congress. Because the government here failed to comply strictly with the statutory prerequisites for enhancement, the enhanced portion of the defendant\u2019s sentences must be overturned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">In the recent decision of <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>720 F.2d 1255 (11th Cir.1983), the United States put a notice alleging that the defendant was a dangerous special offender in a sealed envelope, which was improperly placed in the court file before the district court ruled on a motion of the defendant to suppress evidence (a different judge presided at the trial). The envelope was not opened until after a verdict was returned, but .on the face of the envelope was typed a citation to the special offender statute. In affirming the defendant\u2019s sentencing under the special offender statute, the court of appeals observed that there was no evidence in the record indicating that the judge was aware of the envelope or that the United States Code citation on it referred to the dangerous special offender statute; moreover, \u201ceven the speculative chance that the judge presiding over the motion to suppress might have inadvertently become aware that Pugh was alleged to be dangerous would have been harmless error,\u201d because the court\u2019s ruling denying Pugh\u2019s motion to suppress was the \u201conly correct ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1259.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">We are compelled to conclude that <em>Bailey </em>controls, and not <em>Pugh. </em>In <em>Pugh, </em>there was no showing that the judge knew the special offender notice had been filed, and all indications are to the contrary. In this case, as in <em>Bailey, </em>the judge was clearly on notice. In <em>Pugh, </em>the court speculated that even if the judge might have known that the statute was being invoked, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>resulting error was harmless. Unlike <em>Bailey </em>and the instant case, where the judge receiving the special offender notice presided over a substantial portion of the defendant\u2019s trial, the judge in <em>Pugh </em>ruled only on a single discrete motion. The <em>Pugh </em>court noted that there, the evidence was clear that the plain view doctrine justified the warrantless search of Pugh\u2019s automobile, and that denying Pugh\u2019s motion to suppress was \u201cthe only correct ruling\u201d the district court could have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">We have reviewed the portion of the trial commencing on the morning of December 8. If the court had made no rulings, we would affirm. However, a number of rulings against the appellant were made. While we find nothing erroneous in these rulings, and have no reason to believe that they were motivated by prejudice, we cannot say as could the court in <em>Pugh, </em>that they were the \u201conly correct ruling(s).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">The special offender statute could not be clearer: in no event shall the district judge be made aware of the special offender notice prior to the return of a verdict. We do not read <em>Pugh </em>to permit our court to ignore this explicit statutory proscription, whenever the record fails to reveal that the court made an erroneous ruling after it became aware that notice had been filed. Were such an interpretation accepted, the statutory proscription would be of no effect: premature notification would constitute reversible error only if the judge notified subsequently committed reversible error. Rather, we construe <em>Pugh </em>to say that if the district court is inadvertently notified of the government\u2019s intention to pursue special offender sentencing, the resulting error will be deemed harmless only if the court\u2019s subsequent rulings are non-discretionary, <em>i.e. </em>the <em>only </em>correct rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">We are sympathetic with Judge Gee\u2019s observation in his special concurrence in <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>that the special offender statute \u201cis hopelessly quixotic and incoherent in terms of the policies which it ostensibly furthers.\u201d However, we are unable, as was Judge Gee, to support a \u201cconstruction alternative to according 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575(a) its plain meaning.\u201d We must therefore vacate Darwin\u2019s sentence under the dangerous special offender statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-9\">VACATED and REMANDED for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">. The conviction in this case arose out of Darwin's failure to appear for a bond reduction hearing following his arrest and release on charges of making false statements to the FAA in an application for an airman medical certificate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. He was convicted of that offense as well, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal <em>(United States v. Darwin, </em>744 F.2d 96 (11 Cir.1984)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">. Issues raised but rejected include: 1) whether the district court erred in refusing to deliver jury instructions requested respecting duress and wilfulness; and 2) whether certain testimony of Agent Funes should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">. <em>Bailey </em>is a binding decision of the former Fifth Circuit. <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">. Limiting harmless error analysis to situations in which the court made the \"only correct ruling\" is consistent with the very stringent and literal reading courts have given the statute. <em>Bailey, supra; United States v. Taylor, </em>716 F.2d 701, 712-13 (9th Cir.1983) (the statute unambiguously provides that the fact of the notice \"shall\u201d not be disclosed prematurely and the \u201cGovernment's contention that the disclosure did not affect the trial judge is pure speculation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">. The district court's basis for concluding that it was in no way prejudiced by the knowledge that a special offender notice had been filed, was that all facts in the notice forming the basis for the government\u2019s special offender request were admitted at trial, and that since the notice did not contain any information of which the judge was not already aware, the inadvertent disclosure of the notice was harmless error. While this might be true were the district court to have read the entire notice, the judge indicated that he read only the first four lines, enough to let the court know that special offender sentencing was sought, but not enough to inform him of the reasons therefor. In other words, on the final day of trial, the judge knew that the government had filed a special offender notice against Darwin, but did not know what Darwin was alleged to have done to warrant enhanced sentencing under the statute: enhancement could have been based on nothing more than what the judge had learned in the course of trial, or any of a variety of other matters of which the trial court was unaware. The court could only speculate as to the grounds the government intended to advance in favor of enhancement, and we are unable to hold that under these circumstances the error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
