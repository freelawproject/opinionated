RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"ATT\">A prisoner convicted of two counts of armed robbery in a Louisiana state court and sentenced to a total of 125 years\u2019 imprisonment, without benefit of parole, seeks habeas corpus on the grounds that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction, the state court\u2019s charge confused the jury, and the sentence constitute(j cruel and unusual punishment. For reasons somewhat different from those advanced by the district court, we affirm the judgment denying relief on two of the grounds stated, but remand for further consideration of the eighth amendment isSUe.</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"ALfv\">Kenne* Wayne Whitmore was convicted m \u00b0* tw0 eounts armeci robbery. He admits his complicity in the robberies but contends that he planned on]y to com. mit a robbery without arms, punishable in Louisiana as the lesser offense of simple robb There wag nQ evidenC6) he con. tendg; ^ he and hig codefendant, Perry Lee Paynej planned to commit armed rob. bery.</p>\n<p id=\"Amb\">When a federal habeas corpus petitioner contends that the evidence adduced in his state-court trial is insufficient to sustain his conviction, the issue is whether a rational trier of fact might have found that each essential element of the crime was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>In making this assessment, the court of appeals does not substitute its view of the evidence for that of the fact finder, but considers all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In that light, the evidence was, in substance, this: Early in the morning of February 19, 1975, Whitmore and Payne were at Whitmore\u2019s house. They were apparently discussing the gun Payne was holding; one of them, perhaps Whitemore, fired the gun. Later that morning Whitmore and Payne twice visited Bill\u2019s Shoe Store in Zachary, Louisiana. They looked around but did not buy anything. On one of the visits, their car was left running while they were in the store. Lemener Matthews, who was working in the store, became suspicious and took down the license plate number of the car. When she left the store for lunch, she left a note for her boss warning him about the young men.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Whitmore and Payne returned to the store a third time at 4:00 p.m. on the same day. Matthews and Bill Messer, the owner of the shoe store, were both working. Whitmore distracted Messer by saying he wanted some desert boots. Messer showed Whitmore the boots at the shoe counter, out of the sight of Matthews, who was at the cash register. Payne then took Matthews at gunpoint to the back of the store. After Whitmore left the store, Messer went to the back of the store to see what had happened to Matthews. Payne, with his gun in his hand, forced Messer and Matthews to undress and to give him their personal money. Payne then ordered Matthews to retrieve the store\u2019s petty cash. While Payne held the two at gunpoint at the back of the store, Whitmore returned to the store, took the store\u2019s cash box, and ran to a waiting car driven by Samuel Harris. The two rode around the block and then returned to the scene. In the meantime, Payne raped Matthews and forced her and Messer into the bathroom. Whit-more and Harris then picked up Payne. The three men rode around for a short time while Whitmore and Payne discarded non-currency items obtained in the robbery. Whitmore and Payne were later arrested at the home of Payne\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Under Louisiana law neither direct commission of the crime nor presence at the scene of the crime is necessary for conviction as a principal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whitmore was a principal in the crime of armed robbery of Messer and Matthews because Whitmore took money from the store while Payne held Messer and Matthews at gunpoint, and then Whitmore picked up Payne after the robbery. Moreover, testimony that Payne brandished and fired a pistol in Whitmore\u2019s presence before the robbery is sufficient to justify the inference that Whitmore knew Payne intended to use the gun in the day\u2019s activities. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to sustain Whitmore\u2019s conviction for armed robbery notwithstanding the fact that he was not himself armed and the allegation that he did not plan for Payne to be armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">In support of his insufficieney-ofthe-evidence contention, Whitmore also challenges the following charge to the jury, to which defense counsel objected at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG\">Title 15, Section 445 says that, \u201calthough intent is a question of fact for your determination it need not be proven as other facts.\u201d I tell you to my knowledge it never has been. It may be inferred from the circumstances of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">Whitmore argues that this instruction as well as the instructions regarding the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>dard of reasonable doubt, intent, and knowledge of a defendant to aid his accomplice only confused the jury, which might otherwise have convicted him of a lesser offense, simple robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We have held that an erroneous instruction will support a collateral attack on a state court\u2019s judgment \u201conly if the ailing instruction so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court properly concluded that the instructions in this case\u2014 considered in their entirety \u2014 do not cause constitutional concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Although the state trial court gave detailed instructions on complicity and intent, the jury did manifest confusion. After deliberating a short time, the jury asked for additional instructions regarding the intent and knowledge of \u201cone person knowing the other has a weapon.\u201d Later the jury asked the judge whether a principal must know about the use of a weapon in an armed robbery. Each time the jury requested instructions, the state trial judge repeated the provisions of Section 14:24 of Louisiana Revised Statutes. He then explained that, to be a principal, whether present or absent, a person must actually counsel, assist, and encourage, or aid and abet his accomplice\u2019s perpetration of the crime. In response to the second question, the court also charged that it must be shown that the accused acted knowingly and intentionally in furtherance of the common design. The court further charged that \u201call persons knowing the unlawful intent of the person committing the crime who were ... aiding and abetting either by furnishing the weapons of attack, encouraging by words or gestures, or endeavoring at the time ... of the offense to secure the safety or concealment of the offender are principals or equal offenders and subject to the same punishment.\u201d These were proper and adequate clarification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Whitmore contends that the imposition of consecutive sentences lasting 75 years for the armed robbery of Matthews and 50 years for the armed robbery of Messer, each with no possibility of parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The merits of this contention must be determined under the precepts set forth in <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983). In <em>Solem </em>the Supreme Court found the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole so disproportionate to the non-violent crime of uttering a no-account check as to be unconstitutional. The Court announced that the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment embraces the principle that \u201ca criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which a defendant has been convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The Court also set forth the method for determining proportionality. Review \u201cshould be guided by objective factors____ First, we look to the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty____ Second, it may be helpful to compare the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction. If more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at issue may be excessive ____ Third, courts may find it useful to compare the sentences imposed for com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>mission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The district court did not conduct such a review. It stated only that a federal court has no right to review any sentence of a state court that does not exceed the maximum sentence that may be imposed under the laws of the state. In stating this proposition, the court relied on a Fourth Circuit decision, <em>Stevens v. Warden, Maryland </em>Penitentiary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Solem, </em>however, invalidates this conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Moreno v. Estelle,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we held that <em>Solem </em>does not require extensive analysis with respect to every petition for habeas corpus relief raising the excessiveness issue. We recognized, however, that at least a cursory <em>Solem </em>analysis is required,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> save that <em>Rummel v. Estelle</em><footnotemark>13</footnotemark> still controls cases whose facts are not clearly distinguishable from those in <em>Rummel </em>itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A \u201cprimary consideration in that regard seems to be whether or not parole is available to the defendant within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Here, by contrast, the sentence denies the possibility of parole, the federal record is devoid of pertinent evidence, and the briefs provide no assistance in applying the <em>Solem </em>criteria. We must therefore REMAND the case for a <em>Solem </em>analysis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The denial of habeas relief based on the sufficiency of the evidence and the adequacy of the jury instructions is AFFIRMED for the reasons given above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AWP6\">. <em>Jackson v.
