Subsequently, on June 21,1983, we entered an order remanding No. 82-2216 (the \u201cForeclosure Settlement\u201d appeal) back to the district court for an expedited hearing and definitive ruling on the revised settlement proposal in that case. The \u201cMercantile Settlement\u201d appeal (No. 82-2293) was held in abeyance, however, because this court believed that a settlement acceptable to the district court, and the parties involved in the Mansion House cases, would soon be forthcoming, effectively resolving the issues raised in the Mercantile appeal. Such a settlement has so far failed to materialize.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-26\">On July 20, 1984, this court again heard arguments in the consolidated Mansion House appeals (Nos. 82-2216, 82-2293, 83-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>1645 and 83-1754). After careful consideration we have determined that the matters in the Mercantile appeal No. 82-2293 should be expeditiously resolved, regardless of the eventual disposition of the remaining Mansion House cases. In our view, it would be inequitable to require Mercantile Trust Company to remain hostage to the ongoing and complex disputes of the other Mansion House litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Accordingly, we reverse that part of the district court\u2019s September 23, 1982 order which denied Mercantile\u2019s motion to compel closing and performance of the Mercantile settlement agreement, executed May 18, 1982, by Mercantile, HUD and the Ownership-Partnerships. Further, we remand the case for disposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">1) all funds escrowed by Receiver Gerald A. Rimmel for the express purpose of resolving the Mercantile litigation, including those funds within the Registry of the court, are to be paid to Mercantile Trust Company forthwith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">2) the parties in the Mercantile action should be instructed to fully comply with the terms of the Mercantile settlement agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">3) the court shall dismiss Causes Nos. 78-45C, 82-0115C and 82-0123C (the Mercantile cases) in accordance with the Mercantile settlement agreement upon Mercantile\u2019s receipt of the amounts owing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
