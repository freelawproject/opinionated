In 1983, LSC notified EALS that some of its remaining grant funds for 1983 would be withheld to offset unspent LSC funds which EALS had carried over from prior years. EALS brought this suit against appellants, the Corporation and three of its officials, to enjoin them from withholding any funds until the Corporation granted EALS a hearing pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606 (1983). The district court held for EALS and the Corporation appealed. <em>See East Arkansas Legal Services v. LSC, </em>Civil Action No. 83-2813 (D.D.C. October 4, 1983). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-18\">In 1974, Congress established the Legal Services Corporation as a non-profit corporation to provide legal assistance in civil matters to persons unable to afford adequate legal counsel. Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-355, 88 Stat. 378, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2996 <em>et seq. </em>In creating a corporation to administer the legal services program, Congress intended to ensure that the program would be independent and \u201cfree from any outside interference, political or otherwise.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 247, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1973), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3872, 3874 (1974). Congress considered protection of the Corporation\u2019s independence to be a centerpiece of the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-19\">The Act authorizes the Corporation to provide financial assistance to individuals, organizations, and state and local governments that provide legal assistance to the poor. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996e(a)(l)(A). Pursuant to that authority, the Corporation currently provides annual grants to over 300 legal services programs throughout the country. The Act also establishes strong procedural protections for grant recipients. Before the Corporation reduces a recipient\u2019s grant award in a significant manner \u2014 whether through termination or suspension of financial assistance or through a denial of refunding at the end of the grant year \u2014 the recipient is entitled to notice and a hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2996j.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-20\">For several years, the Corporation did not require the expenditure of grant funds in the year in which the funds were awarded. Under the policy set forth in the Corporation\u2019s \u201cAudit and Accounting Guide for Recipients and Auditors\u201d, recipients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1474\">*1474</page-number>were permitted to carry over unspent funds into subsequent years, although each recipient was required to account separately for this \u201cfund balance\u201d in its annual audit. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion at 3, 9. Beginning in 1982, however, the Corporation began to develop a new policy designed to limit the amount of unspent funds which grant recipients could carry over into subsequent years. This case involves the Corporation\u2019s application of that new fund balance policy to EALS in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">A. <em>LSC\u2019s Development of a New Fund Balance Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-5\">Since at least 1980, the Corporation has required every recipient with a fund balance exceeding ten percent of its LSC grant to submit a plan explaining how the recipient intended to spend those funds and over what period of time. In 1982, the Corporation decided to strengthen this policy through an effort to eliminate recipients\u2019 excess fund balances. In August, LSC staff prepared a memo for the Committee on Audit and Appropriations of LSC\u2019s Board of Directors (the Board), recommending two courses of action. First, the staff suggested that the Corporation take immediate action against any recipients whose fund balances exceeded fifty percent of their current grant. Those programs were to be notified, pursuant to the requirements of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1623 (1983), that their financial assistance would be suspended for thirty days unless they could show cause why the suspension should not take effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-6\">Second, the memo recommended that the Board approve a new policy to be applied during the 1983 grant year. Under that policy \u2014 which the full Board eventually adopted \u2014 recipients would be permitted to carry over only ten percent of their annual LSC grants. With respect to any carryover between ten percent and twenty-five percent of a recipient\u2019s annual grant, the Corporation would permit recipients to apply for a waiver of the ten percent ceiling. In no case, however, would a recipient be permitted to carry over anything in excess of twenty-five percent of its annual grant. The Corporation would recover fund balances exceeding the permissible levels by offsetting the recipient\u2019s current grant award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-8\">The proposed policy could be enforced only if the Corporation knew the amount of funds actually carried over at the end of a program\u2019s fiscal year. Because that determination apparently could not be made pri- or to the beginning of the subsequent fiscal year, the memo recommended that a condition be included in all future grants, beginning with those for 1983. That condition would indicate that the recipient\u2019s new grant award would be offset by the Corporation if the recipient carried over impermissible levels of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-9\">The Board\u2019s Audit and Appropriations Committee approved the general recommendations contained in the memo and directed the staff to prepare a resolution for Board action on the proposed new fund balance policy. Immediately following the Committee meeting, the Corporation took steps to suspend financial assistance to twenty-two grant recipients, including EALS, with fund balances in excess of fifty percent of their 1982 grants. Both the statute and the regulations require the Corporation to give a recipient reasonable notice and an opportunity to show cause why a suspension should not occur. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j(l); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1623 (1983). (All references to LSC\u2019s regulations refer to the regulations in effect in 1983 when the Corporation took the actions challenged in this lawsuit.) Pursuant to these regulations, LSC sent preliminary determination letters to twenty-two recipients notifying them of the proposed suspension. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1623.4(a). Two of the programs voluntarily returned sufficient funds to bring their fund balances below the fifty percent level. EALS was one of the sixteen programs that successfully challenged the preliminary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-10\">Following the Committee meeting, the staff also prepared a resolution for Board consideration that set forth a new \u201cinstruction\u201d regarding the Corporation\u2019s fund bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>anee policy. (Instructions are policy guidelines adopted by the Corporation that are not codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.) The Board adopted the resolution on October 30, 1982, and, in November, a notice of the proposed new Fund Balance Instruction (the Instruction) was published in the Federal Register. 47 Fed.Reg. 53,-805 (1982). Following a comment period, the Board, at its December 1982 meeting, adopted the new fund balance policy, directed the staff to publish the final Instruction in the Federal Register, and approved a condition to be included in all 1983 grant contracts incorporating the provisions of the new policy. The Instruction was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 1983, and, pursuant to a statutory requirement that all rules, regulations, guidelines, and instructions be published thirty days prior to their effective date, the Instruction went into effect on February 5, 1983. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996g(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-5\">The Instruction required recipients to provide LSC with a statement of their fund balances from 1982 within ninety days after the close of the fiscal year. If a recipient\u2019s fund balance exceeded ten percent of its 1982 grant, it was permitted to apply within that same ninety-day period for a waiver of the ten percent ceiling so that it could retain up to twenty-five percent of its 1982 grant. The initial waiver decision was to be made by the Regional Office, but the Instruction permitted recipients to appeal the decision of the Regional Office to the Director of Field Services, whose determinations would be final. The Instruction provided that, \u201c[i]n the absence of a waiver ... any fund balance amount in excess of 10% shall be set off against the recipient\u2019s annualized grant award for the next period by pro rata deductions from the remaining monthly allocations to the recipient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Instruction also provided that recipients would receive notice at least thirty days prior to any deduction in their monthly allocations.' The Corporation began implementation of this new policy in early 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-6\">The Corporation awarded its 1983 grants before the Instruction went into effect, but included a special condition in all grant awards regarding the newly adopted fund balance policy. That condition provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ani\">Consistent with the Instruction on Recipient Fund Balances <em>to be published by the Corporation, </em>unexpended funds in excess of 10% of the recipient\u2019s 1982 support from the Legal Services Corporation, carried forward as a fund balance at the close of the recipient\u2019s 1982 fiscal year shall be set off against this grant award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-8\">A waiver of this provision to a maximum of 25% may be sought by application to the appropriate Regional Office within 90 days of the close of the recipient\u2019s fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1577-9\">48 Fed.Reg. 561 (1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-10\">B. <em>Application of the New Fund Balance Policy to EALS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1577-11\">EALS received its first grant of $191,000 from LSC in 1978. Although EALS carried over a significant amount of funds that year, the Corporation doubled EALS\u2019 grant in 1979 and increased it again in 1980. From 1980 until 1983, EALS received between $605,000 and $606,000 in new grant funds each year from the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1577-12\">At the end of 1982, Congress approved a Continuing Resolution appropriating money to the Corporation and other agencies for fiscal year 1983. Joint Resolution of December 21, 1982, Pub.L. 97-377, 96 Stat. 1830. The Continuing Resolution required the Corporation to provide the same level of funding to grantees that it had provided them in 1982:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1577-13\">[Notwithstanding any regulation, guideline, or rule of the Corporation, the funds appropriated in this Act for the Legal Services Corporation shall be used by the Corporation in making grants or entering into contracts <em>... so as to insure that funding for each such current grantee and contractor is maintained in 1983 at the annualized level at which each such grantee and contractor was funded in 1982, </em>or in the same proportion which total appropriations to the Corporation in fiscal year 1983 bear to the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>appropriations to the Corporation in fiscal year 1982, until action is taken by directors of the Corporation who have been confirmed in accordance with ... the Legal Services Corporation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1578-4\">96 Stat. 1876 (emphasis added). Consistent with that resolution, EALS, which had received $605,000 from the Corporation in 1982, was awarded a grant of $605,274 for fiscal year 1983. (Although the Corporation\u2019s fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30, the fiscal year for all of theCorporation\u2019s grant recipients runs from January 1 to December 31.) The Corporation pays out annual grant awards in eleven monthly installments. The first installment, provided in late December, provides two-twelfths of a recipient\u2019s total annual grant. The remaining installments are paid in one-twelfth increments at the beginning of each month from February to November. Consistent with that scheme, EALS\u2019 1983 grant was disbursed in monthly installments of $50,522.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-5\">EALS\u2019 financial statement for fiscal year 1982 indicated that it had a fund balance of $173,841 as of December 31, 1982. Under the Instruction, EALS was entitled automatically to keep $65,298 of that fund balance, an amount equal to ten percent of EALS\u2019 1982 annual grant plus investment income. In March 1983, pursuant to the Instruction, EALS applied for a waiver of the fund balance policy up to the full allowable amount of twenty-five percent. In its letter to the Corporation, EALS stated that its request for a waiver of the fund balance policy \u201cdoes not constitute a waiver by said recipient of any claims it may have respecting the enforceability of the referenced instruction, the grant condition referred to therein, or the recapture policy generally.\u201d Defendants\u2019 Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Exhibit 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-6\">The Corporation granted EALS a waiver for $35,000 which was attributable to a one-time special needs grant, but it denied the rest of EALS\u2019 request. Pursuant to the Instruction, EALS appealed that decision. In an August 19,1983, letter denying that appeal, EALS was told that it would have a total of $750,000 available to it in 1983: the $605,000 grant; the $65,000 carryover automatically permitted under the Instruction; and the $35,000 attributable to the special needs grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-8\">One week later, on August 25, 1983, LSC notified EALS that it intended to offset $83,543 of EALS\u2019 excess fund balance against EALS\u2019 1983 grant award over a several month period. (The Corporation subsequently corrected its determination to $73,543 \u2014 the amount of the fund balance which EALS was not permitted to carry over into 1983.) The letter to EALS (hereinafter referred to as the \u201coffset notice\u201d) indicated that the amount to be offset would be deducted on a pro rata basis from EALS\u2019 monthly grant allocations beginning in October 1983, at the rate of $11,934 per month. The deduction amounted to approximately twenty-five percent of EALS\u2019 two remaining monthly grant allocations for 1983. EALS here challenges only the proposed reductions in those two 1983 monthly allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1578-9\">Several days after receiving the offset notice, EALS responded with a request for a hearing pursuant to the Corporation\u2019s \u201cProcedures Governing Termination of Financial Assistance and Denial of Refunding\u201d set forth at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606. In contrast to the Corporation\u2019s notice to EALS in 1982 regarding the proposed thirty-day suspension of financial assistance, the Corporation\u2019s offset notice did not suggest that the announced deductions constituted a \u201cpreliminary determination\u201d triggering EALS\u2019 right to a hearing. EALS, however, treated the offset notice as a preliminary determination that its financial assistance from the Corporation was about to be terminated in part. It therefore requested an \u201cinformal conference\u201d pursuant to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.6. On September 19, 1983, the Corporation denied EALS\u2019 request for a hearing on the ground that the offset did not constitute a \u201ctermination\u201d of financial assistance within the meaning of the regulations. This lawsuit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>C. <em>Proceedings before the District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1579-4\">On September 23, 1983, EALS filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Corporation and three of its officials from withholding funds from EALS\u2019 remaining 1983 grant allocations until the Corporation complied with the notice and hearing requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations. EALS also filed motions for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction. Following a hearing on September 23, the district court granted EALS\u2019 motion for a TRO. At a second hearing on September 30, 1983, the district court, with the consent of the parties, consolidated the motion for a preliminary injunction with a hearing on the merits of EALS\u2019 underlying claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 65. The district judge granted EALS\u2019 request for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-5\">The court held that the Corporation\u2019s proposed withholding of funds constituted a \u201ctermination\u201d within the meaning of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.2(a) (1983). It therefore found that EALS was entitled to a hearing pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j(2). The court further found that 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.4 prohibits the Corporation from terminating a recipient\u2019s grant award on the basis of a policy that was not in effect at the time the grant was made. Because the Fund Balance Instruction did not take effect until after the Corporation had awarded EALS its 1983 grant, the court concluded that section 1606.4 precluded the Corporation from relying on the Instruction when it sought to reduce EALS\u2019 remaining monthly grant allotments for 1983. The Corporation and the three individual defendants noticed an appeal. They also filed a motion for summary reversal, which this court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-7\">The Corporation offers two grounds for reversing the district court. First, it contends that the proposed offset of funds did not constitute a \u201ctermination\u201d within the meaning of the regulations and that, therefore, EALS was not entitled to a hearing. Second, it argues that, regardless of whether the offset can be characterized as a termination, EALS agreed to abide by the policies set forth in the as-of-yet unpublished Instruction, and was bound by that agreement. We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-10\">A. <em>LSC\u2019s proposed reduction in funds was a \u201ctermination. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1579-11\">Congress directed the LSC to develop procedures for insuring that financial assistance to a recipient would not be terminated absent adequate notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVRm\">[Financial assistance ... shall not be terminated, an application for refunding shall not be denied, and a suspension of financial assistance shall not be continued for longer than thirty days, unless the grantee ... has been afforded reasonable notice and opportunity for a timely, full, and fair hearing, and, when requested, such hearing shall be conducted by an independent hearing examiner. <em>Such hearing shall be held prior to any final decision by the Corporation to terminate financial assistance or suspend or deny funding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1579-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j(2) (emphasis added). The LSC\u2019s procedures governing the termination of financial assistance and denial of refunding are found at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606. Those regulations define a \u201ctermination\u201d as \u201ca decision that financial assistance to a recipient will be permanently terminated <em>in whole or in part </em>prior to expiration of the recipients\u2019 current grant or contract.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.2(a) (emphasis added). A denial of refunding is a decision by- LSC to refuse to refund a recipient or to reduce substantially the amount of the recipient\u2019s refunding at the end of a grant year. Under LSC\u2019s regulations, any reduction in a recipient\u2019s grant that is more than ten percent or more than $20,000 below the recipient\u2019s previous grant constitutes a \u201cdenial of refunding\u201d that triggers the hearing requirement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1606.2(b)(2). Thus any significant reduction in a recipient\u2019s funding \u2014 whether by termination, suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>or denial of refunding \u2014 is subject to the notice and hearing requirements of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-4\">LSC contends here that a termination of financial assistance occurs only when a recipient\u2019s \u201cannualized level of funding\u201d is reduced prior to the expiration of a grant. That term does not appear in the Act or the regulations. LSC\u2019s brief defines a recipient\u2019s \u201cannualized level of funding\u201d as those funds which LSC insures will be <em>available </em>to a recipient during the fiscal year. In EALS\u2019 case, the Corporation established an \u201cannualized funding level\u201d for 1983 at $605,247. Because LSC permitted EALS to carry over $100,000 in excess LSC funds provided in prior years, and only sought to offset $73,000 in carryover funds, EALS had $705,000 in LSC funds <em>available </em>to it in 1983. Because EALS would still have over $605,000 in LSC funds available to it in 1983, LSC claims that its decision to recover approximately $24,000 in excess carryover funds by offsetting EALS\u2019 two remaining 1983 grant allotments did not constitute a \u201ctermination\u201d of EALS\u2019 financial assistance in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-5\">EALS counters that the term \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d in the statute and the regulations refers to the money that LSC agrees to pay to a recipient during a fiscal year. Thus, under EALS\u2019 interpretation, a termination occurs when the grant award promised to a recipient during a fiscal year is reduced. The fact that LSC has permitted recipients to carry over funding from prior years should not diminish the Corporation\u2019s obligations under the current year\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-6\">We agree with EALS\u2019 interpretation of the meaning of the word \u201ctermination.\u201d \u201c[Ujnless contrary indications are present, a court can assume that Congress intended the common usage of [statutory terms] to apply.\u201d <em>Inner City Broadcasting v. Sanders, </em>733 F.2d 154, 158 (D.C.Cir.1984). Here, the statute refers to the termination of a recipient\u2019s \u201cfinancial assistance,\u201d not, as the Corporation would suggest, to the reduction in a recipient\u2019s \u201cannualized level of funding.\u201d The use of the term \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d in the statute and the regulations indicates that the term refers to the amount of money actually paid to a recipient pursuant to a grant award, not to the amount of funds available to a recipient during a grant year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-8\">The plain meaning of the language authorizing the Corporation to enter into agreements \u201cto provide financial assistance to qualified programs\u201d is that the Corporation has authority to pay out money to a recipient, not to ensure that money is <em>available </em>to that recipient from some other sources, including a <em>different </em>grant. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 6304 (1982) (defining a \u201cgrant agreement\u201d as \u201cthe legal instrument reflecting a relationship between the United States Government and a State, a local government, or other recipient when \u2014 (1) the principal purpose of the relationship is <em>to transfer a thing of value </em>to the ... recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States\u201d) (emphasis added). Although the statute does not define the term \u201cfinancial assistance,\u201d it authorizes LSC to provide such assistance by contract or grant. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996a(6); \u00a7 2996e(a)(l)(A). Thus the grant awards, which LSC provides annually and pays out in monthly allotments, are the measure of \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d which LSC provides to a recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-9\">LSC\u2019s regulations also suggest that \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d refers to the money paid out to a recipient, not to the level of funding available to a recipient. Nowhere do the regulations refer to the <em>availability </em>of funds as a measure of a recipient\u2019s financial assistance. The provisions of the regulations providing for notice and a hearing when \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d is suspended or terminated are framed in reference to a recipient\u2019s \u201ccurrent grant.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1606.2(a), 1623.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1580-10\">LSC\u2019s own conduct in 1982, when it proposed to suspend financial assistance to twenty-two grant recipients, is consistent with a finding that \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d in both the statute and the regulations refers to the amount of money paid out to a recipient. The Act mandates two distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>notice and hearing procedures for two different situations. In the first situation, where LSC intends to suspend financial assistance, a recipient is entitled to a hearing and an opportunity to show cause why the suspension should not take place. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j(l). In the second situation, where LSC intends to terminate financial assistance, deny refunding, or suspend financial assistance for more than thirty days, the procedures are more elaborate and the recipient is entitled to a full and fair hearing before an independent examiner. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2996j(2). The two procedures are similar, however, in that they both refer, in identical language, to reductions in \u201cfinancial assistance.\u201d Similarly, LSC\u2019s regulations implementing these two provisions of the Act contain parallel language concerning the effect of LSC\u2019s actions on a recipient\u2019s \u201cfinancial assistance ... prior to the expiration of the recipient\u2019s current grant....\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1606.2(a), 1623.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-4\">In 1982, LSC adhered to the more limited notice and hearing requirements of the statute and its own regulations when it proposed to suspend, for thirty days, the grant awards of recipients whose fund balances exceeded fifty percent of their current funding levels. That action is significant because it suggests that LSC considered that the term \u201cfinancial assistance,\u201d in both the statute and in LSC\u2019s implementing regulations, refers to the amount of funds paid in the current year, not to the level of LSC funds <em>available </em>to a recipient in a given year. If LSC's interpretation of what it means to \u201cterminate financial assistance\u201d is correct, then it never would have had to provide notice and a hearing to those twenty-two recipients in 1982 for a proposed thirty-day \u201csuspension of financial assistance.\u201d Those recipients carried over an amount of funds exceeding fifty percent of their 1982 awards; a suspension of one-twelfth of their 1982 awards would still have left them with <em>available </em>funds far exceeding the amount of their 1982 awards. If the proposed offset in this case was not a \u201ctermination\u201d then, under LSC\u2019s theory, its proposed curtailment of twenty-two recipients\u2019 monthly allotments in 1982 were not \u201csuspensions\u201d either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-6\">We think that LSC properly concluded in 1982, as it should have with regard to the offset proposed against EALS in 1983, that suspension or termination of \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d refers to the amount of funding <em>provided a recipient in the current fiscal year, </em>not the amount of funding <em>available </em>to a recipient in the current fiscal year. Although the equities may have appeared to LSC to be different in those two situations \u2014 an unannounced thirty-day suspension of funding as compared to a deliberate move over several months toward a short-term twenty-five percent reduction in funding \u2014 the statute and LSC\u2019s own regulations, not LSC\u2019s present view of the equities, determine the procedures to be followed in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-7\">We also find that adoption of LSC\u2019s view of what constitutes \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d would seriously undermine the procedural safeguards which Congress established for LSC grant recipients. Congress has given LSC explicit authority to terminate financial assistance to any recipient that fails to comply with the many statutory requirements of the Act and with any rules, regulations and guidelines promulgated by LSC under the Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2996e(b)(l)(A). Congress made clear, however, that no such termination could occur until a recipient receives an opportunity for a \u201ctimely, full, and fair hearing.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2996e(b)(l)(A), 2996j(2). The notice-and-hearing requirement applies not only to terminations, but to any significant reduction in a recipient\u2019s funding, whether made during or at the end of the grant year. Thus whenever LSC decides to terminate assistance, deny refunding, or suspend assistance for more than thirty days, recipients have a right to a hearing and may demand that the hearing be held before an independent examiner. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1581-8\">In most cases, Congress has been silent on the question of a grantee\u2019s procedural rights when an agency decides to terminate some or all of its federal grant. <em>See </em>R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>Cappalli, Rights and Remedies under Federal Grants 272 (1979). The panoply of due process rights established by Congress under the Legal Services Corporation Act distinguishes that statute from most other federal grant programs, yet LSC, through a semantic sleight-of-hand, would end-run the clear procedural protections which Congress provided LSC grant recipients. By characterizing EALS\u2019 1983 grant award as a guarantee of an available pool of funds rather than as a commitment to provide new funds, LSC seeks to circumvent the hearing requirements mandated by Congress. Labelling its action a \u201crecovery of prior assistance\u201d does not alter LSC\u2019s obligation to provide EALS with a hearing that comports with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-4\">Any other conclusion would result in a circumvention of the due process rights which Congress bestowed upon LSC grant recipients. Under LSC\u2019s annualized level of funding theory, LSC could have decided to \u201crecover\u201d all $173,000 in carryover funds from 1982 in a lump sum without any notice or opportunity for a hearing and <em>regardless </em>of the effect that action might have had on the continuing operations of EALS and on the services provided to its clients. Such a result is contrary to the carefully drawn scheme of procedural rights created by the Congress to ensure that programs are not precipitously deprived of funding by LSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-5\">When it first created the Legal Services Corporation in 1974, Congress wanted to ensure that LSC and its grantees would be independent and free from outside interference. The notice and hearing requirements of the statute were one part of that scheme. In 1977, Congress strengthened the notice and hearing provisions to ensure that the hearing would be held, upon request, before an independent hearing examiner. Pub.L. 95-222, 91 Stat. 1619,1624 (1977). The legislative history indicates that Congress intended that an independent examiner be available to a recipient \u201cthreatened with loss of funding.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 310, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4503, 4517. The House Report explained: \u201cThe provision will help to implement the statutory purpose of insulating Corporation decisions from political pressure, <em>and will insure that the final decision made by LSC will not be reached hastily, or on the basis of erroneous or incomplete information.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-7\">Congressional concern that legal services programs not experience sudden funding losses is further evidenced by the continuing resolution that required LSC to maintain the same level of funding in 1983 that it had provided recipients in 1982. Similar provisions have appeared in subsequent continuing resolutions, Pub.L. 98-107, 97 Stat. 733, 739 (1983); Pub.L. 98-151, 97 Stat. 964, 973 (1983), and in the FY 1984 Appropriations Act for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, Pub.L. 98-166, 97 Stat. 1071, 1088 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-8\">LSC made much of the fact that its offset decision was <em>not </em>reached hastily, and that EALS was on notice that LSC intended to implement the fund balance policy and even availed itself of the opportunity to seek a waiver of that policy in the spring of 1983. But the notice which EALS received and the waiver procedures it invoked did not comport with the hearing requirements <em>mandated by statute </em>and by LSC\u2019s own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-9\">At the end of 1982, LSC agreed by contract to provide EALS with $605,000 in financial assistance in fiscal year 1983 monthly allotments of $50,000. We hold that LSC\u2019s decision to reduce two of those allotments constituted a permanent \u201ctermination\u201d of a portion of EALS\u2019 financial assistance in 1983, triggering the notice and hearing requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j and its implementing regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1582-10\">B. <em>Waiver of the Right to a Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1582-11\">On appeal, LSC argues that, even if the proposed offset was a \u201ctermination,\u201d EALS waived its right to a hearing under the statute and regulations because it ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>cepted a condition in its 1983 grant whereby it agreed to be bound by the new fund balance policy. We need not reach the question of whether LSC may impose a grant condition on its recipients that requires them to waive procedural rights guaranteed by LSC\u2019s enabling statute and implementing regulations, for LSC did not raise that argument before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-5\">EALS\u2019 1983 grant agreement was never made part of the record before the district court. The content of the grant condition was determined solely by reference to the published Instruction. Although LSC repeatedly referred to the grant condition in the proceedings before the district court, it did so in the context of asserting that EALS was on notice that its 1983 grant award might be offset pursuant to the new fund balance policy. In particular, LSC, in the context of opposing EALS\u2019 motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, was trying to show that any \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to EALS was caused by its own failure to plan for the anticipated application of the new fund balance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-6\">Furthermore, LSC\u2019s counsel indicated at both hearings that the sole issue before the district court was whether the offset was a \u201ctermination.\u201d LSC raises the waiver argument on appeal to counter EALS\u2019 claim that the proposed offset violated a provision of LSC\u2019s regulations that prohibits LSC from terminating a contract or grant based upon a policy that was not in effect when the grant was awarded. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.4. LSC\u2019s counsel in the proceedings below conceded that, if the offset were a \u201ctermination,\u201d then section 1606.4 would preclude LSC from withholding the funds. At the hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order, LSC\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cIf you were to rule that this action was a termination of funding, then it would be the case that we could not terminate their funds based on a policy that-we had enacted during the calendar year.\u201d Transcript of Hearing of September 23, 1983, at 34. According to counsel, the timing of the publication of the new Instruction was not relevant, because LSC contended that no termination had occurred. At the hearing on the preliminary and permanent injunction, LSC\u2019s attorney repeated this assertion: \u201c[PJlaintiffs are correct that our regulation prevents LSC from terminating a program on the basis of a policy that was not in effect at the time the grant was awarded.\u201d Transcript of Hearing of September 30, 1983, at 27-28. We find that the only question presented to and considered by the district court was whether LSC\u2019s proposed action with respect to EALS\u2019 two remaining 1983 grant allotments constituted a \u201ctermination\u201d within the meaning of the statute and regulations. The waiver issue was not presented properly to the district court as an alternative argument and we refuse to consider it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-9\">Although EALS sought to have LSC enjoined from withholding funds only until EALS received a hearing, it is doubtful that a hearing could serve any purpose here, for the sole basis for LSC\u2019s proposed offset was the Fund Balance Instruction that did not take effect until after EALS received its 1983 grant award. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court; LSC was required to comply with the requirements of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606 before it could reduce EALS\u2019 1983 grant allotments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-10\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1583-11\">STARR, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1D\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1583-12\">I respectfully dissent. The majority\u2019s decision unnecessarily requires the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) to provide East Arkansas Legal Services (EALS) with a hearing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996j (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606 (1983) prior to withholding a portion of EALS\u2019 fiscal year 1983 (FY 1983) funds in order to offset unexpended funds carried over from FY 1982. In my view, the LSC\u2019s attempted offset of unspent carried over funds does not constitute a \u201ctermination\u201d of \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d within the meaning of the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>plicable statute and regulations. Thus, I would hold that LSC was not required to provide EALS with a pre-termination hearing prior to effecting the offset.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1584-4\">Section 2996j(2) provides that The Corporation shall prescribe procedures to ensure that \u2014(2) financial assistance under this subchapter shall not be terminated, an application for refunding shall not be denied, and a suspension of financial assistance shall not be continued for longer than thirty days, unless the grantee, contractor or person receiving financial assistance under this sub-chapter has been afforded a reasonable notice and opportunity for a timely, full, and fair hearing, and, when requested, such hearing shall be conducted by an independent hearing examiner. Such hearing shall be held prior to any decision by the Corporation to terminate financial assistance or suspend or deny funding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1584-5\">The procedures implementing this provision are found in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606 (1983). The regulations specify a rather elaborate pretermination notice and hearing procedure,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is triggered by three specific types of actions affecting the level of funding of an LSC grantee \u2014 termination, suspension, or denial of refunding. The regulations define \u201ctermination,\u201d the funding action relevant to this case, as \u201ca decision that financial assistance to a recipient will be permanently terminated in whole or in part prior to expiration of the recipient\u2019s grant or contact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1606.2(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1584-10\">As the majority recognizes, neither the statute nor the regulations define the term \u201cfinancial assistance.\u201d The majority nonetheless concludes that termination of financial assistance includes termination of \u201cthe amount of money actually paid to a recipient pursuant to a grant award, not [ ] the amount of funds available to a recipient during a grant year.\u201d Majority Opinion at 1478. The majority reaches this conclusion by arguing that the \u201ccommon usage\u201d of the term \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d requires this construction. The majority further argues that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the statutory provisions governing the LSC grant-making process and the termination regulations support its interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1584-11\">Critically, the majority arrives at this \u201ccommon sense\u201d interpretation of these straightforward words only by overlooking the significance of the basic fact that grant awards to legal services providers are made on an <em>annual </em>basis and are calculated by means of a \u201cminimum access figure.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the annual basis on which grants are awarded supports the LSC\u2019s argument that <em>a termination requires, at a minimum, a reduction of the annual funding level. </em>The annual basis of the funding of LSC grantees also suggests that termination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>under the statute and regulations, does not refer to the recapture of <em>excess </em>surplus. Consistent with this interpretation of the statute and regulations, the offset attempted here in no way purports to cut off permanently EALS\u2019 financial assistance, in whole or in part. Rather, EALS\u2019 FY1983 funding is to be continued at its annualized rate. Indeed, there is no contention, nor could there be, that EALS\u2019 funds are being reduced below this normal level. The offset attempted here is intended only to recover unexpended FY82 funds carried over into FY83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-4\">Moreover, the structure and express language of the regulations supports the view that \u201ctermination\u201d does not occur when LSC attempts to recoup unspent funds. In particular, the regulations governing denials of refunding, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion that the regulations do not mention \u201cannual level\u201d of funding, expressly refer to the annualized funding level. A denial of refunding parallels a termination of funding, except that a termination is effective at the time of the current grant, whereas a denial of refunding affects only future grants. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.2(a), (b). Thus, an examination of the criteria for \u201cdenial of refunding\u201d is helpful in understanding the type of funding action encompassed by a \u201ctermination.\u201d The regulations state that a \u201cdenial of refunding\u201d occurs when the recipient (1) \u201c[w]ill not be provided with financial assistance\u201d; (2) \u201c[w]ill have its <em>annual level of financial support reduced to an extent </em>\u201d that does not result from an overall reduction of LSC funding to legal services agencies and that is more than 10% or $20,000 below the recipient\u2019s <em>current level of assistance; </em>and (3) \u201c[wjill be provided with financial assistance subject to a new condition or restriction not generally applicable in other legal services agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1606.2(b) (emphasis added). \u201cTermination,\u201d by analogy, encompasses only reductions in the annual level of funding. Since there has been no reduction in the annual level of EALS' annual funding, no termination has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-5\">Neither the statute nor the regulations purport to require an elaborate hearing for every LSC action regarding funding. Rather, the statute and regulations require a hearing only for terminations, suspensions, and denials of refunding. The application of termination embraced by the majority would drain the term of all meaning. If an offset such as that attempted here requires a hearing, then it is difficult to see how an erroneous overpayment, for example, could be recovered without a hearing. In sum, the broad definition of termination adopted here would trigger the hearing procedure for each and every funding decision, an anomalous result compelled neither by the statute nor regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-8\">Finally, it should not go unnoticed that the instant case is but a small portion of a much larger drama. Over the past few years, LSC has been engaged in an effort to remedy what appears to be a vexatious problem with excess fund balances being held by various LSC grantees. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief 7-10. Pursuant to its grant-making authority under the Legal Services Corporation Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996f, LSC is to \u201cinsure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery of legal assistance.\u201d As early as 1980, LSC developed guidelines aimed at limiting and controlling the amount of unspent, excess funds being retained by LSC providers. Despite that initial effort, the problem has apparently remained, and LSC, in 1982, ultimately developed the Fund Balance Instruction at issue in this case. The majority\u2019s decision, requiring as it does a hearing prior to recoupment of those excess, unspent funds, defeats the statutory prescription for the \u201ceconomical and effective\u201d legal services to the poor. That provision indicates Congress\u2019 clear intent that funds be utilized, not simply held, by legal services providers. Thus, the majority\u2019s requirement of a hearing prior to implementation of the recoupment of excess funds, rather than serving the noble goal of providing the needy with legal services, frustrates that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1585-9\">In sum, nothing in the statute nor the regulations compels the majority\u2019s conclusion. The offset attempted here did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>rise to the level of a termination of financial assistance, and thus no hearing was required prior to its implementation. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1584-6\">. The regulations provide for notification of the Corporation\u2019s \"preliminary determination\u201d that the grant should be terminated or refunding should be denied to the recipient, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1606.5; for an informal conference procedure at the request of the recipient, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1606.6; and for a fact-finding hearing procedure to be conducted by an independent presiding officer. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1606.7-8. The regulations further specify that the Corporation has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence on issues of fact, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1606.11(a), and that the Corporation has the obligation of proving a \"substantial basis\u201d for its actions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1606.11(b).
