A prior panel of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>court has determined that we have appellate jurisdiction over this order under <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Finance Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">We decline to decide the validity of the challenged rules, for it is patent that the federal courts have no statutory (and possibly constitutional) subject matter jurisdiction over this personal injury case. The only conceivable basis of subject matter jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1982). But, as Judge Richey has carefully observed in an opinion with which we agree entirely, the District of Columbia is not a citizen of a state for purposes of that section. <em>See District of Columbia v. L.B. Smith, Inc., </em>474 F.Supp. 894 (D.D.C.1979). Accordingly, we remand this case and direct the district court to dismiss the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Costs taxed against appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
