Gen., the State of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondents-appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b692-26\">Before BARRETT, McKAY and LOGAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b692-27\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b692-28\">In accordance with 10th Cir.R. 9(e) and Fed.R.App.P. 34(a), this appeal came on for consideration on the briefs and record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-29\">This is an appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the North<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ern District of Oklahoma denying petitioner\u2019s relief sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On direct appeal and in her petition, petitioner raised the following errors: (1) denial of defense attorney\u2019s presence at a post-indictment, post-lineup interview between witnesses and police violated petitioner\u2019s sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel; and (2) failure of the trial court to exclude the in-court identification because of the tainted lineup without a determination of the witnesses\u2019 independent ability to identify the petitioner violated her fifth and fourteenth amendment due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Petitioner asserts that <em>Richardson v. State, </em>600 P.2d 361 (Okla.Crim.App.1979), controls the disposition of this case. The <em>Richardson </em>court extended the right to counsel defined in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), to include the right to have counsel present at a post-lineup interview between witnesses and police. <em>Richardson, </em>600 P.2d at 365. Petitioner relied on <em>Richardson </em>in post-conviction proceedings in state court. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, however, refused to apply <em>Richardson </em>retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">In determining whether petitioner has been denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment, this court is not bound to follow Oklahoma\u2019s interpretation of the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">While a few states including Oklahoma, <em>Richardson, </em>and California, <em>People v. Williams, </em>3 Cal.3d 853, 92 Cal.Rptr. 6, 478 P.2d 942 (1971), have held that a defendant has a constitutional right to have his counsel attend a post-indictment post-lineup interview, the circuits that have considered the question have declined to extend <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), to the post-lineup interview. <em>United States v. White, </em>617 F.2d 1131, 1135 (5th Cir.1980) (citing <em>United States v. Banks, </em>485 F.2d 545 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 987, 94 S.Ct. 2391, 40 L.Ed.2d 764 (1974)); <em>United States v. Bierey, </em>588 F.2d 620, 624 (8th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 927, 99 S.Ct. 1260, 59 L.Ed.2d 482 (1979); <em>United States v. Tolliver, </em>569 F.2d 724, 727 (2d Cir.1978) (recording of interview should be made available to defense counsel); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>549 F.2d 1217, 1223 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 971, 97 S.Ct. 1659, 52 L.Ed.2d 365 (1977) (citing <em>Doss v. United States, </em>431 F.2d 601, 603-04 (9th Cir.1970)); <em>United States v. Wilcox, </em>507 F.2d 364, 370 (4th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 979, 95 S.Ct. 1408, 43 L.Ed.2d 661 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">We follow the other circuits in holding that petitioner\u2019s sixth amendment rights were not violated when petitioner\u2019s counsel was denied presence at the post-lineup interview. Because we find that the line-up was not constitutionally tainted, we need not address petitioner\u2019s second contention. The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
