The truck had been leased to the Post by the Hertz Corp. Taylor sued the driver, the Post, and Hertz in the Southern District of New York, alleging negligent operation by the driver, negligent maintenance by the Post, and negligent failure to inspect and test by Hertz.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Taylor\u2019s co-employee and the Post were immune from suit under New York\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>see </em>N.Y.Work. Comp.Law \u00a7\u00a7 29(6) <em>&amp; </em>53, and Taylor\u2019s complaint against them was dismissed. This meant that Hertz could not be held derivatively liable for the dismissed defendants\u2019 negligence. <em>Rauch v. Jones, </em>4 N.Y.2d 592, 596, 176 N.Y.S.2d 628, 152 N.E.2d 63 (1958). Hertz could, however, be held liable for its own negligent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">On June 2, 1983, Hertz brought a third-party action against the Post's parent company, News Group Publications, Inc., (hereinafter \u201cthe Post\u201d) and Centennial Insurance Company, the Post\u2019s automobile insurance carrier. Although, for some undisclosed reason, the parties have not seen fit to make the third-party pleadings part of the record on appeal, the parties inform us that Hertz sought recovery against Centennial as an additional insured under the Centennial-Post policy. The lease agreement between Hertz and the Post provided that the Post would procure a standard automobile liability policy for the leased vehicles covering both Hertz and the Post. The Centennial policy did cover \u201clessors\u201d such as Hertz, but provided in a \u201cHired Autos\u201d endorsement that a lessor \u201cis not an insured for liability resulting from defects or faulty workmanship,\u201d the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s claim against Hertz.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Hertz asserts a right of recovery against Centennial, however, because of a \u201cCertificate of Insurance\u201d, issued by Centennial, which, under the heading \u201cDescription of Operations/Locations/Vehicles\u201d, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-13\">It is agreed that the Hertz Corporation Truck Division 7 Entin Road, Parsippany, New Jersey, is included as additional insured for all vehicles leased by them to [the Post] including replacement and substitute vehicles per leasing contract and also included as Loss Payee on Physical Damage A.I.M.A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">Alternatively, Hertz argues that, if the Centennial policy does not provide coverage for Hertz, the Post is liable for breach of the leasing agreement, a contention with which we are not now concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim against Hertz has been settled with the consent of all parties for $100,000. Following a bench trial before Judge Pollack, Centennial has been held liable for the full amount of the settlement plus $9,000 in court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. For reasons hereafter assigned, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">As a predicate for its finding of liability, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-17\">The rental agreement between Hertz and [the Post] clearly contemplated coverage broad enough to protect Hertz herein. Centennial must be held to have incorporated such broader coverage in its insurance policy by means of the insurance Certificate and the conflict between such incorporation and the \u201cHired autos endorsement\u201d is resolved in favor of Hertz and against Centennial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">We believe that this determination was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\">The genesis of the Certificate of Insurance is obscure. We question Hertz\u2019s as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>sertion that the Certificate was written to comply with the provisions of New York\u2019s financial responsibility laws. Section 312 of New York\u2019s Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that no motor vehicle shall be registered in New York unless the application for registration is accompanied by proof of financial security which may be evidenced by, among other things, a certificate of insurance which is filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 311 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law defines a certificate of insurance as \u201cany evidence issued by or on behalf of an insurance company duly authorized to transact business in this state, stating in such form as the commissioner may prescribe or approve that such company has issued an owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance on the motor vehicle or vehicles designated therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We believe that the Insurance Identification Card, formerly an FS-1, now generally an FS-20, is treated as the certificate of insurance for purposes of these statutes. <em>See Tomala v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>20 A.D.2d .206, 208, 245 N.Y.S.2d 944 (4th Dep\u2019t), <em>aff'd mem., </em>14 N.Y.2d 862, 251 N.Y.S.2d 971, 200 N.E.2d 635 (1964); N.Y.Admin.Code tit. 15, \u00a7 32.2(a) (amended 1982). The Certificate of Insurance which Centennial furnished Hertz in no way resembled such an official FS document. <em>See </em>N.Y.Admin. Code tit. 15, \u00a7 32.9. In the first place, the Certificate at issue bore no FS number, and stated in bold letters immediately below the caption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">THIS CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED AS A MATTER OF INFORMATION ONLY AND CONFERS NO RIGHTS UPON THE CERTIFICATE HOLDER. THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT AMEND, EXTEND OR ALTER THE COVERAGE AFFORDED BY THE POLICIES LISTED BELOW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The Certificate then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">This is to certify that policies of insurance listed below have been issued to the insured named above and are in force at this time. Notwithstanding any requirement, term or condition of any contract or other document with respect to which this certificate may be issued or may pertain, the insurance afforded by the policies described herein is subject to all the terms, exclusions and conditions of such policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">In the absence of proof that the Certificate at issue was filed as an official section 311 certificate, <em>see Mack v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>25 A.D.2d 482, 266 N.Y.S.2d 770 (1966), we are not prepared to accept it as such. We conclude instead that it was simply notice to Hertz that a policy of insurance had been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">The policy and the Certificate being before us, we are in as good position as the district court to construe those documents. <em>See Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, </em>461 F.2d 873, 879 (2d Cir.1972). Looking only to the language of the Certificate, we do not believe that the provision which makes Hertz an \u201cadditional insured for all vehicles leased by them to [the Post] including replacement and substitute vehicles per leasing contract\u201d incorporates the lease agreement into the policy. Centennial\u2019s policy was intended to cover automobiles leased to the Post under the leasing contract. We believe the phrase \u201cper leasing contract\u201d was intended to identify the covered vehicles, not to describe the terms of the insurance coverage. When the Certificate is viewed in the light of the controlling legal principles and the terms of the policy itself, the conclusion is inescapable that the Certificate did not make the lease agreement part of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">As a general rule, where a certificate or endorsement states expressly that it is subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, the language of the policy controls. <em>Birnbaum v. Jamestown Mutual Ins. Co., </em>298 N.Y. 305, 310-11, 83 N.E.2d 128 (1948); <em>Thompson-Starrett Co. v. American Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>276 N.Y. 266, 271, 11 N.E.2d 905 (1937); <em>Blue Cross of Northeastern New York, Inc. v. Ayotte, </em>35 A.D.2d 258, 260, 315 N.Y.S.2d 998 (3rd Dep\u2019t 1970). This rule accords with the widely recognized principle that the intent to incorporate additional papers into an insurance policy must be plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>manifest. <em>See </em>29 N.Y.Jur. <em>Insurance </em>\u00a7 641, at 633 (1963); 1 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d \u00a7 3:24, at 336 (rev. ed. 1984); <em>Buntin v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>583 F.2d 1201, 1205 (3d Cir.1978); <em>Transport Indemnity Co. v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>535 F.2d 232, 235 (3d Cir.1976); <em>Carolina Casualty Ins. Co. v. Transport Indemnity Co., </em>488 F.2d 790, 794 (10th Cir.1973). Section 345(i)(2) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides specifically that \u201c[t]he policy, the written application therefor (if any) and any rider or endorsement, which shall not conflict with the provisions of this article, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.\u201d In view of the above-quoted reservations in the Certificate, the \u201cHired Autos\u201d clause in the policy, and the express exclusion in the policy of \u201c[liability assumed under any contract or agreement,\u201d we think it clear beyond peradventure that the lease agreement was not incorporated into the policy by the terms of the Certificate of Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Of course, if the decision of the district court were correct, we would be duty bound to affirm it, even though the court \u201crelied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason.\u201d <em>Helvering v. Gowran, </em>302 U.S. 238, 245, 58 S.Ct. 154, 158, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937). In apparent reliance on this rule, Hertz suggests that, if we do not read coverage into the policy because the Certificate of Insurance put it there, we do so because coverage is mandated by statute. <em>See Bersani v. General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp., </em>36 N.Y.2d 457, 460, 369 N.Y.S.2d 108, 330 N.E.2d 68 (1975); N.Y.Ins.Law \u00a7 143. However, the statutory provisions upon which Hertz relies do not support its contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The \u201cstandard provisions\u201d of a New York liability insurance policy are set forth in section 167 of the Insurance Law. Subsection (2) of section 167, which is patterned after section 388 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, mandates that Centennial\u2019s policy contain a provision insuring the \u201cnamed insured\u201d against liability for injury resulting from negligence in the operation or use of one of its automobiles by any person using it with the permission, express or implied, of the \u201cnamed insured\u201d. This subsection, like section 388, deals with derivative liability, with which we are not here concerned because of the worker\u2019s compensation defense available to the primary wrongdoers, the Post and its employee-driver. <em>Rauch v. Jones, supra, </em>4 N.Y.2d at 595, 176 N.Y.S.2d 628, 152 N.E.2d 63. Moreover, Hertz is not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the policy, and the proper view is that Centennial \u201chas undertaken <em>separate and distinct </em>obligations to the various assureds, named and additional.\u201d <em>Greaves v. Public Service Mutual Ins. Co., </em>5 N.Y.2d 120, 124, 181 N.Y.S.2d 489, 155 N.E.2d 390 (1959) (quoting <em>Morgan v. Greater N.Y. Taxpayers Mutual Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>305 N.Y. 243, 249, 112 N.E.2d 273 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The same holds true with regard to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 345. That section requires motor vehicle policies to insure the \u201cnamed insured\u201d or a person using the vehicle with his consent for a maximum of $10,000 for bodily injury to one person. It does not mandate the coverage which the district court has found to exist herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the district court with instructions to see that the $109,000 paid by Centennial is repaid to Centennial with appropriate interest.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
