The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-26\">From September 1981 until April 1983, the defendant Edward Chow was an employee of Biosynergy, Inc. (BSI), an Illinois corporation. In mid-March of 1983, Chow, who was then Vice President of Finance and Budget of BSI, had a dispute with the management of BSI allegedly related to performance and to a stock option that Chow claimed had been promised him. At this time, Chow retained defendants Placek and Pearson, both attorneys, to represent him in connection with his employment difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-27\">On March 20,1983, Chow drafted a letter to Fred Suzuki, BSI\u2019s president. In the beginning of the letter, Chow stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1213-28\">I believe it is my duty, as Vice-president of Finance and Budget, to raise the matters contained in this letter in light of the planned public offering of stock in Liquid Crystal Products, Inc. (LCP), now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>known as Biosynergy, Inc. (BSI). Numerous items which, I believe, have not yet been disclosed should now be disclosed to protect the company\u2019s shareholders and to protect the company, its officers and directors, from any legal repercussions stemming from possible violations of federal and state securities laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">Chow\u2019s letter then went on to outline several possible securities law violations. These included a memorandum relating to private placement of BSI securities that Chow claimed contained false and misleading information, and a possibly undisclosed arrangement between Suzuki and the plaintiff Tom Pruitt, a Denver attorney, whereby Pruitt allegedly was paid fees for assisting BSI in fundraising. Chow\u2019s letter also included a demand for the stock option to which he claimed he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">On March 21, Chow personally delivered this letter to Placek, who requested and received Chow\u2019s assurances that Chow believed its contents were truthful and accurate. That same day, Placek passed the letter along to Pearson. Later that day, Pearson personally delivered the letter to the BSI corporate office in a sealed envelope addressed to Suzuki and marked \u201cpersonal and confidential.\u201d Also in this envelope was a letter from Pearson to Suzuki. This letter stated, in essence, that Chow hoped to settle his dispute with BSI amicably, but that if Suzuki did not contact Pearson or Placek by the next day, the defendants would send a copy of Chow\u2019s and Pearson\u2019s letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to BSI\u2019s lawyers and accountants, and they would begin preparation for a lawsuit against BSI. The defendants never actually sent the two letters to the SEC, but they did send a copy of Chow\u2019s letter to Pruitt. This was their only transmission of Chow's letter other than the transmission to Suzuki. Chow\u2019s letter was sent to the SEC and other third parties, however, by Suzuki himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Pruitt then brought this action in federal district court. He complained that Chow\u2019s letter had defamed him and placed him in a \u201cfalse light\u201d in the public eye, and that the defendants\u2019 actions amounted to an intentional infliction of emotional distress. He also claimed that the defendants committed the tort of \u201cabuse of process\u201d by threatening to send Chow\u2019s letter to the SEC and by threatening a civil suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments and reviewing the parties\u2019 affidavits and other documentary evidence, the district court ruled that Chow\u2019s letter was privileged and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-10\">We turn first to the plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim. The plaintiff argues that Chow\u2019s letter defamed him and that it was not a privileged communication because it was not made in good faith. The plaintiff also claims that the defendants should be held responsible for publishing the letter not only to Suzuki, but to the SEC and other third parties. The defendants respond by arguing that Chow\u2019s letter was not defamatory, and that even if it was defamatory, its transmission to Suzuki was privileged. The defendants also contend that they are not legally responsible for publication of the letter to anyone but Suzuki.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-11\">An essential ingredient of libel is a publication. <em>Ginsburg v. Black, </em>237 F.2d 790, 791, 793 (7th Cir.1956), <em>cert. denied, </em>353 U.S. 911, 77 S.Ct. 669, 1 L.Ed.2d 665 (1957). We agree with the defendants that they did not \u201cpublish\u201d Chow\u2019s letter to the SEC or any third party. The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>theory is that by making a threat to Suzuki that they would send the letter to the SEC and others, the defendants forced Suzuki to disseminate the letter himself or at least should have expected that Suzuki would have disseminated the letter himself, since they knew that BSI was in the process of registering its securities with the SEC. The plaintiff has cited no case law to support this theory, and we see no reason to accept the theory. Although Suzuki may have been obligated to disclose to the SEC the possibility of litigation between BSI and Chow, Suzuki was not obligated to simply pass on to the SEC the allegedly defamatory statements made by Chow, without refutation or comment. Moreover, the defendants threatened to disseminate Chow\u2019s letter only if Suzuki refused to negotiate about Chow\u2019s stock option demand. Thus, the defendants actually expressed a desire to avoid the dissemination of Chow\u2019s letter. Under these circumstances, we hold that the defendants did not punish Chow\u2019s letter to anyone but Suzuki.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">It follows that the only allegedly defamatory publication that we must consider is the publication from Chow to Suzuki, through Placek and Pearson. We find as a matter of law that Chow\u2019s letter to Suzuki did not defame Pruitt. Thus, we need not address the question of whether the publication was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-6\">A central feature of Illinois defamation law, which is the appropriate body of law to be applied in this diversity case, is the \u201cinnocent construction\" rule. That rule, as modified two years ago by the Illinois Supreme Court, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-7\">[A] written or oral statement is to be considered in context, with the words and the implications therefrom given their natural and obvious meaning; if, as so construed, the statement may reasonably be innocently interpreted or reasonably be interpreted as referring to someone other than the plaintiff it cannot be actionable <em>per se. </em>This preliminary determination is properly a question of law to be resolved by the court in the first instance; whether the publication was in fact understood to be defamatory or to refer to the plaintiff is a question for the jury should the initial determination be resolved in favor of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlmX\"><em>Chapski v. Copley Press, Inc., </em>92 Ill.2d 344, 352, 65 Ill.Dec. 884, 888, 442 N.E.2d 195, 199 (1982). Applying this rule to the facts of this case, it is clear that Chow\u2019s letter to Suzuki cannot be actionable. The plaintiff has complained specifically about two parts of the letter that he claims contained false and defamatory statements. First is a reference to a possibly undisclosed deal between Pruitt and Suzuki whereby Pruitt allegedly received a finder\u2019s fee for his fundraising efforts on behalf of BSI. The essence of this portion of Chow\u2019s letter was that if the arrangement had not yet been disclosed, it would \u201cbe best to disclose its nature in the public offering and account the amount in the use of proceeds.\u201d We seriously doubt that there is sufficient hint of impropriety in this portion of the letter to make the letter not reasonably susceptible to an innocent construction by anyone who might read it. We need not decide this question, however, since we have ruled that the defendants published the letter only to Suzuki; certainly this portion of the letter could not possibly defame Pruitt in the eyes of Suzuki, since Suzuki would know the truth or falsity of Chow\u2019s claims about the alleged deal between Pruitt and Suzuki.</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-10\">The other allegedly defamatory portion of Chow\u2019s letter is a statement that a memorandum prepared in connection with BSI\u2019s private placement of securities contained a number of false and misleading statements relating to BSI\u2019s research activ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>ity in soft tissue injury assessment and breast cancer screening. Although the letter did not state that Pruitt had prepared the memorandum, Pruitt claims that in fact he did prepare the memorandum and that Chow\u2019s allegations therefore defamed him. However, in making this claim Pruitt has ignored the fact that Chow\u2019s letter explicitly indicated that the attorneys who prepared the memorandum did not know that it contained the allegedly false or misleading information. After describing the alleged improprieties, Chow wrote: \u201cI am aware that the Denver attorneys have asked for documentation from the researchers who are supposed to be doing our clinical studies on these ideas. I hope that you will properly disclose to them the true situation with respect to these studies.\u201d In view of this statement essentially exculpating \u201cthe Denver attorneys,\u201d of whom Pruitt was one, this portion of Chow\u2019s letter clearly is susceptible of a reasonable innocent construction with respect to Pruitt and therefore is not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">The plaintiff argues, however, that the innocent construction rule may be used only to determine whether words are actionable as libel per se. He claims that he is still entitled to prove that Chow\u2019s letter was actionable as libel per quod. Under Illinois law, a statement may be actionable as libel per quod if it is actually defamatory and if specific damage is alleged. <em>See American Pet Motels v. Chicago Veterinary Medical Association, </em>106 Ill.App.3d 626, 629, 62 Ill.Dec. 325, 328, 435 N.E.2d 1297, 1300 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Whether the innocent construction rule applies to libel per quod as well as per se (in other words, whether the rule is used to determine whether words are actionable at all) is a question to which the Illinois courts have not provided a definitive answer. <em>See generally id. </em>at 630-31, 62 Ill.Dec. at 328-29, 435 N.E.2d at 1300-01. Although the Illinois Supreme Court in the <em>Chapski </em>case did state that if a statement reasonably may be innocently construed it cannot be actionable per se, it is possible to interpret this language as meaning actionable <em>as a matter of law. </em>Thus, <em>Chapski </em>has not settled the issue. <em>See generally </em>Malone and Smolla, <em>The Future of Defamation in Illinois After Colson v. Stieg and Chapski v. Copley Press, Inc., </em>32 DePaul L.Rev. 219, 289-95 (1983). In fact, Illinois appellate courts applying the innocent construction rule since the <em>Chapski </em>decision have split on the question of whether it applies only to libel per se. <em>Compare Audition Division, Ltd. v. Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Chicago, </em>120 Ill.App.3d 254, 257, 75 Ill.Dec. 947, 951, 458 N.E.2d 115, 119 (1983) <em>with Cartwright v. Garrison, </em>113 Ill.App.3d 536, 540-41, 69 Ill.Dec. 229, 231-232, 447 N.E.2d 446, 448-49 (1983). Nor was an answer provided by the recent Illinois Supreme Court opinion in <em>Fried v. Jacobson, </em>99 Ill.2d 24, 75 Ill.Dec. 398, 457 N.E.2d 392 (1983), which reaffirmed the innocent construction rule as stated in <em>Chapski.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">We need not decide, however, which application of the innocent construction rule is correct under Illinois law. Even assuming that the innocent construction rule does not preclude a plaintiff from proving that the defendant\u2019s statement is actionable as libel per quod, the plaintiff here has not presented a case for libel per quod sufficient to create a question for the jury. An action for libel per quod is established where a publication not libelous on its face is rendered defamatory by extrinsic facts or innuendo and special damages are proven. <em>Audition Division, Ltd. v. Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Chicago, </em>120 Ill.App.3d at 258, 75 Ill.Dec. at 951, 458 N.E.2d at 119. In this case, the plaintiff has not alleged any facts extrinsic to Chow\u2019s letter that would render the letter actually defamatory when it was not defamatory on its face. Accordingly, we hold as a matter of law that Chow\u2019s letter was non-defamatory as to Pruitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">We turn now to the plaintiff\u2019s other claims, all of which may be rejected without extensive discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>In light of our ruling that the defendants were not responsible for publishing Chow\u2019s letter to anyone but Suzuki, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfalse light\u201d claim clearly must fail. This tort is concerned with \u201cpublicity that unreasonably places the other in a false light before the public.\u201d <em>Geisberger v. Willuhn, </em>72 Ill.App.3d 435, 439, 28 Ill. Dec. 586, 589, 390 N.E.2d 945, 948 (1979). The defendants\u2019 letter to Suzuki obviously does not meet this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendants for intentional infliction of emotional distress is equally devoid of merit. Under Illinois law, such a claim exists only where a defendant\u2019s conduct is \u201cextreme and outrageous.\u201d <em>Public Finance Corp. v. Davis, </em>66 Ill.2d 85, 4 Ill.Dec. 652, 360 N.E.2d 765 (1976). Particularly in view of our holding that Chow\u2019s letter did not even defame Pruitt, we find there is not a triable issue of fact as to whether the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201cextreme and outrageous.\u201d Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s abuse of process claim also must fail. The plaintiff bases this claim on the defendants\u2019 statement that they would send Chow\u2019s letter to the SEC and initiate a civil suit against BSI if Suzuki refused to meet with them to discuss Chow\u2019s grievances. However, the plaintiff has not cited, nor can we find, any Illinois cases in which a person such as Pruitt has made a successful claim of abuse of process where there has been no legal action actually brought against him. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 682 (1977). Indeed, the Illinois courts have stated explicitly that the tort of abuse of process requires \u201csome <em>act </em>in the use of the legal process.\u201d <em>Holiday Magic, Inc. v. Scott, </em>4 Ill.App.3d 962, 966, 282 N.E.2d 452, 454 (1972) (emphasis added). Here, not only is Pruitt\u2019s abuse of process claim based entirely a mere threat of a lawsuit, but the threat was not even directed at him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find that Pruitt\u2019s complaint states no cause of action for abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1213-18\">. We are basing our decision on grounds somewhat different from those stated by the district court, which is our prerogative. <em>See Panter v. Marshall Field &amp; Co., </em>646 F.2d 271, 281 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1092, 102 S.Ct. 658, 70 L.Ed.2d 631 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">. Pruitt also complained that Chow's letter constituted an \u201cinjurious falsehood.\u201d He has not cited, however, any Illinois cases that discuss this tort. Our research has revealed only one reference to \"injurious falsehood\" in the Illinois case law. In <em>Streif v. Bovinette, </em>88 Ill.App.3d 1079, 1082, 44 Ill.Dec. 372, 375, 411 N.E.2d 341, 344 (1980), the court stated that the tort of \u201ccommercial disparagement,\u201d where a person intentionally and falsely disparages another's business, also is known as \"injurious falsehood.\" Because we find that Chow's letter was not defamatory of Pruitt, it follows that Pruitt\u2019s \"injurious falsehood\" claim should fail as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">. The transmission of the letter from Chow to Placek and Pearson might be considered a publication. However, since this was a communication between a client and his attorneys relating to proposed litigation, it was privileged. <em>See Libco Corporation v. Adams, </em>100 IIl.App.3d 314, 55 Ill.Dec. 805, 426 N.E.2d 1130 (1981); <em>Weiler v. Stem, </em>67 Ill.App.3d 179, 23 Ill.Dec. 855, 384 N.E.2d 762 (1978). Moreover, the plaintiffs complaint in this case clearly is focused on the transmission of Chow\u2019s letter to Suzuki, the SEC and others, not to Placek and Pearson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">. The record indicates that Chow actually has brought a suit against BSI, Suzuki, and several others, but not Pruitt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">. The plaintiff also has argued that summary judgment in favor of Placek and Pearson was improper because they did not file an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. However, Rule 56(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a defending party may move for summary judgment \"at any time.\u201d We see no reason not to interpret this language as permitting a defendant, in an appropriate case, to move for summary judgment before filing an answer. <em>See Hubicki v. ACF Industries, </em>484 F.2d 519, 522 (3d Cir.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
