Appellant David F. Craig, Sr. (Craig) is president and a twenty-five percent stockholder of the corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee Southmark Properties (Southmark), formerly Citizens &amp; Southern Realty Investors, was a real estate investment trust engaged in, among other things, financing the construction of residential real estate developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-28\">In 1972, Craig sought and received from Southmark a loan to finance construction of The Charles House. The loan was executed in December 1972, and was secured by a collateral mortgage on the project, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>$1.75 million collateral mortgage note, and the personal guaranties of Craig, Flotte, and Daniel, all dated December 6, 1972. Although the collateral mortgage note, which was payable on demand, specified an interest rate of twelve percent per annum, the mortgage specified that Southmark possessed the right \u201cto issue and re-issue the said note from time to time, as mortgagor\u2019s interest and/or convenience may require.\u201d \u201cHand notes\u201d signed by The Charles House Corporation, by Craig, upon each disbursement of loan funds, each specified an interest rate of four and one-half percentage points per annum above the best commercial lending rate at Citizens &amp; Southern Bank, \u201cas said rate may change from time to time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each hand note reflected that it was secured by the mortgage and provided for a maturity of December 6, 1979, subject to acceleration in the event of default in any of the note payments or under the mortgage. The hand notes were guaranteed by Craig, Flotte, and Daniel. The first hand note was in the amount of $625,205.99 and was executed December 6, 1972. The collateral mortgage required in part that The Charles House Corporation \u201cpay promptly at maturity all payments due on the Note,\u201d \u201cpay and discharge, promptly when due, all taxes\u201d and \u201cnot ... encumber the aforesaid property to the prejudice of this act.\u201d The mortgage stipulated that breach of the above obligations constituted default allowing the lender to declare the entire indebtedness \u201cimmediately due and payable\u201d and to seize and sell the property under executory process. Each of the hand notes stipulated that \u201c[ijnterest ... shall be payable monthly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Craig and Southmark agreed that $192,-000 of the authorized loan amount would serve as an \u201cinterest reserve\u201d fund. The fund was not referred to in any of the loan documents, but was listed in a pro forma statement itemizing the anticipated allocation of the loan proceeds. The parties anticipated that the reserve fund would be sufficient to pay the interest due on the loan at least until the completion of the project. Interest rates, however, rose dramatically after commencement of The Charles House construction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cdepleting\u201d the interest reserve faster than anyone had anticipated. The interest reserve was \u201cexhausted\u201d by August 1974. Although The Charles House Corporation, through Craig, at that time requested and received from Southmark an additional $100,000 loan, $45,000 of which was used to pay accrued interest, no further interest payments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">In April 1975, after The Charles House Corporation had failed to pay interest on its loan for approximately eight months, and failed to pay local taxes due in January 1975, and after approximately $106,000 in construction liens had been filed against the project, Southmark initiated proceedings in Louisiana state court to foreclose its mortgage on The Charles House property. Southmark also filed suit against the loan guarantors in state court to recover any deficiency due it beyond that covered by proceeds from the foreclosure sale. On the scheduled date of the foreclosure sale of The Charles House property, three unsecured creditors of The Charles House Corporation filed a Chapter 10 reorganization petition against the corporation in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The Charles House Corporation admitted the petition\u2019s allegations and acquiesced in the reorganization proceedings. The district court enjoined completion of the state foreclosure proceedings. After unsuccessfully seeking dismissal of the reorganization petition in the district court, and filing an appeal from the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss, South-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>mark asserted, without opposition, a claim as a secured creditor in the reorganization proceedings. The claim was later accepted by the trustee and the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AliO\">While the reorganization proceeding was in progress, The Charles House Corporation, through Craig, with the concurrence of Flotte and Daniel, reached an agreement with Southmark to allow Southmark to bid on The Charles House property in a reorganization trustee\u2019s sale. In return for Craig\u2019s and The Charles House Corporation s promise not to oppose such a sale, Southmark agreed to dismiss its state court suits agamst the corporation and the guarantors, and to dismiss its appeal ehalleng- \u2019 . .. &amp; mg the reorganization proceedings. Pursu- \u00ae . <em>.... </em>\u201e ... ant to a petition from the reorganization , , ., , . , , <em>, f,, </em>, mi_ trustee, the district court ordered that The Charles House property be sold at public auction, and that Southmark be allowed to bid the balance due on its mortgage debt. The order provided that the property \u201cshall be sold free and clear of all ... claims.\u201d The property was sold at auction in November 1976 to Southmark, the only bidder, which bid the amount of its debt, surrendered its mortgage on the property, and took title and ownership of it. The sale was confirmed by an order of the district court on December 8, 1976. In accordance with its agreement with Craig, Southmark dismissed its state court actions against The Charles House Corporation, Craig, Flotte, and Daniel with prejudice and dismissed its appeal challenging the reorganization proceedings. Because the reorganization sale had disposed of the only asset of The Charles House Corporation, the reorganization petition was dismissed by the district court upon a motion of the trustee in early 1978. No appeals were taken from the order directing the sale, or that confirming it, or the 1978 order dismissing the reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"AW2\">t_ rwnW 1081 tVip r,Wl\u00ed&gt;\u00ab Hnn\u00ae rw poration filed suit in Louisiana state court against both Southmark and St Charles Avenu6) InC-) a wholly owned subsidiary of Southmark which had aequired ownership of The Char]es Houge from South_ mark gometime after ^ reorganization , \u2122 ., ,, , ,, , c, ,, , , , sale.

Southmark subsequently filed suit in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana requesting declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 2201, <em>et seq., </em>that \u201cits purchase of The Charles House was valid and that The Charles House Corporation has no valid claim against [appellees] arising out of\u201d the reorganization sale. Appellees also asked the court to enjoin The Charles House Corporation from prosecuting pending or future claims against them predicated on actions arising from the trustee\u2019s sale. Appellant The Charles House Corporation filed a motion to dismiss based in part on the anti-injunction act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, and subsequently, joined by Craig, filed a counterclaim which was substantially identical to The Charles House Corporation\u2019s state court claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Following the filing of two motions for summary judgment by appellees, and various depositions and affidavits, the district court granted summary judgment to appellees and dismissed the counterclaim, without further elaboration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Although appellees advance several grounds in support of the district court\u2019s judgment, we need reach only one. We hold that appellants\u2019 counterclaim is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>and that appellees are entitled to declaratory relief to that effect. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment and dismissal of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">FEDERAL JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">Appellants assert that federal jurisdiction is lacking in this suit. It is well settled, however, that a district court possesses ancillary jurisdiction \u201cto secure or preserve the fruits and advantages of a judgment or decree rendered\u201d by that court. <em>Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, </em>292 U.S. 234, 54 S.Ct. 695, 78 L.Ed. 1230 (1934), quoted in <em>Matter of Mooney Aircraft, Inc., </em>730 F.2d 367, 374 (5th Cir.1984). This is such a case. If The Charles House Corporation were successful in its state court action, the district court judgment authorizing and confirming the sale of The Charles House to Southmark free and clear of any claims, and allowing Southmark to bid on its debt, would be effectively nullified. <em>See Miller v. Meinhard-Commercial Corporation, </em>462 F.2d 358 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Samuel C. Ennis &amp; Co., Inc. v. Woodmar Realty Co., </em>542 F.2d 45, 48-49 (7th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1096, 97 S.Ct. 1112, 51 L.Ed.2d 543 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">Appellants insist that because they seek only monetary relief and do not challenge the transfer of title of The Charles House property to Southmark,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> their claim does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>not disturb the earlier judgment. They argue that the reorganization sale was merely incidental to Southmark\u2019s allegedly fraudulent and bad faith scheme to violate the loan agreement and seize The Charles House. We are convinced, however, that \u201c[t]his suit would do everything that [appellees] say[ ] it does not.\u201d <em>Miller </em>at 360. Appellants\u2019 state court action and related counterclaim are nothing more than not-so-thinly veiled attacks on the prior reorganization orders. Critical to appellants\u2019 claims is their assertion that Southmark improperly assumed ownership of The Charles House by way of the trustee\u2019s sale. Appellants themselves note in their counterclaim that the purpose and effect of the alleged improper scheme engaged in by Southmark was to seize The Charles House and convert its \u201cequity, rents, and profits\u201d to its own use. Notwithstanding appellants\u2019 protestations to the contrary, it is obvious that their state court suit attempts \u2014 by seeking to strip Southmark and its successor in title of any benefits received as a result of the reorganization sale \u2014 to effectively nullify that sale and the determination that the mortgage debt, which Southmark was allowed to bid in, was owing to it. The fact that the suit \u201cis brought under a different label in an independent action cannot camouflage its inevitable effect.\u201d <em>Miller </em>at 361. Thus, the district court had jurisdiction over this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">The district court also properly assumed jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 counterclaim. <em>See Bankers Mortgage Company v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 73, 78-79 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 U.S. 927, 90 S.Ct. 2242, 26 L.Ed.2d 793 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">\n<em>RES JUDICATA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">We are equally convinced that the judgment of the district court ordering and confirming the sale and transfer of title of the property to Southmark are <em>res judicata </em>as to the claims asserted by appellants. The test in this Circuit for determining whether a claim is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-10\">\u201c \u2018For a prior judgment to bar an action on the basis of <em>res judicata, </em>the parties must be identical in both suits, the prior judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, there must have been a final judgment on the merits and the same cause of action must be involved in both cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nilsen v. City of Moss Point, Miss., </em>701 F.2d 556, 559 (5th Cir.1983) (en banc), quoting <em>Kemp v. Birmingham News Co., </em>608 F.2d 1049, 1052 (5th Cir. 1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-11\"><em>Res judicata </em>principles apply with full force to orders rendered by a district court pursuant to Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act. IB J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>(hereinafter cited as <em>\u201cMoore\u2019s\u2019\u2019) </em>\u00b6 0.419[3.-1] (2d ed. 1983). <em>See In re Atlas Sewing Centers, Inc., </em>437 F.2d 607 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">The general rule is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-13\">\u201c... that for purposes of the conventional statement that a judgment binds the \u2018parties\u2019 to the action, the word \u2018parties\u2019 does not refer to formal or paper parties, but to parties in interest, that is, that persons whose interests are properly placed before the court by someone with standing to represent them are bound by the matters determined in the proceeding.\u201d IB <em>Moore\u2019s </em>110.411[1] at 390-91.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">Southmark, St. Charles Avenue, Inc., The Charles House Corporation, and Craig as president and a stockholder of appellant corporation, were all \u201cparties in interest\u201d to the prior reorganization orders, and thus are bound by them. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 567, 606. 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>111109.02[2] (15th ed. 1983); IB <em>Moore\u2019s </em>\u00b6 0.411[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">Although appellants assert that Craig was not \u00e1 party to the reorganization proceedings, and the record does not indicate that he formally intervened on his own behalf in the proceedings, Craig \u2014 as a stockholder of the. debtor corporation \u2014 possessed a statutory right to be heard \u201con all matters arising in\u201d the proceedings. 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 606. The record does show that Craig was actively involved in the reorganization proceedings. By participating in the proceedings, Craig became a party to them, regardless of whether he ever was formally named as such. 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 1109.02[2] at 1109-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Moreover, even if Craig were not a party to the reorganization proceedings, a final judgment is <em>res judicata </em>not only between parties to the earlier lawsuit, but also their privies. <em>Drier v. Tarpon Oil Company, </em>522 F.2d 199 (5th Cir.1975) (per curiam). Because Craig, as a major stockholder in appellant corporation, its president, and a guarantor on the construction loan, had a strong and direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the reorganization proceedings, and by his own admission had and exercised substantial control over the litigation on behalf of The Charles House Corporation, he is bound by the reorganization orders. <em>See Drier </em>at 200; <em>Hyman v. Regenstein, </em>258 F.2d 502, 512 (5th Cir.1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 913, 79 S.Ct. 589, 3 L.Ed.2d 575 (1959); IB <em>Moore\u2019s </em>\u00b6 0.411[6] at 47, 450, 110.411[10],</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Finally, we note that St. Charles Avenue, Inc., as Southmark\u2019s successor in interest to the property, may assert whatever rights flowed to Southmark by way of the trustee\u2019s sale. IB <em>Moore\u2019s </em>11 0.411[1] at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">There is no real doubt that the district court possessed jurisdiction to authorize and approve a trustee\u2019s sale. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 515, 516(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">That the district court\u2019s order authorizing the sale of The Charles House property and judgment confirming the sale and passage of title to Southmark operated as \u201ca final judgment on the merits\u201d is evident.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">We next determine whether the reorganization proceedings, and specifically the trustee\u2019s sale of The Charles House property, involved the same \u201ccause of action\u201d or \u201cclaim\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> now asserted by appellants in their counterclaim and state court action. We believe they did. We initially note that this Circuit has adopted the transactional test of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to determine whether two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>suits involve the same claim. <em>Nilsen </em>at 560; <em>United Home Rentals v. Texas Real Estate Commission, </em>716 F.2d 324, 328 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1712, 80 L.Ed.2d 185 (1984). The central transaction involved in both the reorganization sale and appellants\u2019 present claim was the passing of title to and ownership of The Charles House property from The Charles House Corporation to South-mark in exchange for cancellation of the mortgage debt. Although appellants\u2019 present claim alleges various other acts of wrongdoing by Southmark, all of those acts are alleged to have produced or resulted from, and were integrally related to, the sale of the property to Southmark. They all involved a \u201ccommon nucleus of operative facts.\u201d If appellants\u2019 challenge to Southmark\u2019s right to thus take ownership of the property was extinguished by the prior reorganization action, as we hold it was, then appellants\u2019 remedies against Southmark \u201cwith respect to all or any part of the transaction, or <em>series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose,\u201d </em>also were extinguished. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 24(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Because appellants\u2019 present claim and the prior judgment involved the same principal transaction, appellants\u2019 claim is barred by <em>res judicata, </em>if the procedural system available to appellants in the reorganization proceedings permitted appellants to raise that claim in those proceedings. <em>Nilsen </em>at 562-63. Appellants do not assert that they lacked such an opportunity, and they clearly did not. Appellants had an \u201cabsolute and unlimited\u201d right to be heard in the reorganization proceedings. 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>111109.02[2] at 1109-19. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 606.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, under the Bankruptcy Act, a Chapter 10 debtor was obliged to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A51\">\u201c... examine and report to his trustee concerning the correctness of all proofs of claim filed against his estate ... [and] prepare ... a list of all his creditors, including all persons asserting ... disputed claims, ... the amount due to or claimed by each of them, the consideration thereof, the security held by them, if any, and what claims, if any, are ... disputed____\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 25(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">The trustee in turn was obligated by the Act to \u201creport to the judge any facts ascertained by him pertaining to fraud, misconduct, mismanagement and irregularities, and to any causes of action available to the estate.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 567. The trustee also was \u201crequired to examine all proofs of claim and interest and object to the allowance of those that may be improper.\u201d <em>Avery v. Fischer, </em>360 F.2d 719, 725 (5th Cir. 1966). The Act provided that upon the filing of proofs of claims of creditors, the court shall hear and summarily determine \u201c[objections by any party in interest to the allowance of any such claims ____\u201d 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 596. The district court also was granted jurisdiction over all choses in action possessed by the debtor. <em>See, e.g., Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., </em>417 U.S. 467, 476, 94 S.Ct. 2504, 2510, 41 L.Ed.2d 243 (1974) (Stewart, J., concurring).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>\"The debtor, the trustee under an indenture for any securities of the debtor, any stockholder or creditor, is given the right to be heard on all matters. They may appear before the trustee, or the court; they may give information; they may comment upon a reorganization plan. In short, they are given the right to appear either in defense, or in promotion of their own interests and to assist the trustee and the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>If Southmark had violated the terms of its mortgage agreement with appellants, and had committed various fraudulent and unlawful acts with respect thereto, as appellants now allege, appellants had ample opportunity to raise those facts as a defense to Southmark\u2019s claim, and to request that the trustee assert whatever cause of action the debtor possessed in that regard against Southmark. Appellants instead chose to forego any objections to the assertion of Southmark\u2019s secured claim, or the sale of The Charles House property to Southmark. As a result, Southmark\u2019s interest was recognized by the trustee and Southmark was allowed to bid in its mort- \u2022 gage debt for the property, without opposition. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Brown v. Felsen, </em>442 U.S. 127, 131, 99 S.Ct. 2205, 2209, 60 L.Ed.2d 767 (1979), \u201c[r]es judicata prevents litigation of all grounds for, or defenses to, recovery that were previously available to the parties, regardless of whether they were asserted or determined in the prior proceeding.\u201d Appellants cannot now undo a judicial decree which they had a full opportunity to contest, and chose not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">Although it is black letter law that a valid final judgment, even if erroneous, is not open to collateral attack, IB <em>Moore\u2019s </em>U 0.405[4.-l], an independent action under certain circumstances may be brought for relief from a judgment based on \u201cfraud, accident, mistake or other equitable ground ____\u201d <em>Bankers Mortgage Company v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 73, 78 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 U.S. 927, 90 S.Ct. 2242, 26 L.Ed.2d 793 (1970), quoting 7 <em>Moore\u2019s </em>1160.36.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellants assert, as they did below, that if the reorganization sale is <em>res judicata </em>to their counterclaim and state court claim, they should be relieved from the preclusive effects of that judgment for several equitable reasons.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">First, appellants contend that the reorganization orders cannot preclude their present claim because the claim was not discovered until after the reorganization sale. According to appellants, South-mark\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d to acquire The Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>House property was not complete until St. Charles Avenue, Inc. condominiumized and sold the property at a \u201chuge profit.\u201d Although the condominiumization and resale of the property may have given appellants additional evidence regarding damages they may have suffered from the \u201cscheme\u201d and additional evidence as to appellees\u2019 \u201cbad faith,\u201d it was not an essential element of appellants\u2019 cause of action. Whatever improper actions had been performed by Southmark against appellants were completed by the removal of title in the property from The Charles House Corporation in exchange for cancellation of the mortgage debt. At that point, appellants were stripped of any rights they allege were infringed by Southmark\u2019s actions, and appellants\u2019 cause of action matured. Moreover, discovery of evidence not in existence at the time of an earlier judgment is not an available ground for attacking that judgment. 11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 2859 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Second, appellants allege that they were the victims of duress instituted by South-mark, which forced them to acquiesce in the sale of The Charles House property to Southmark. Although appellants have not brought to our attention any decisions granting relief from a judgment on this ground, we note that at least one Circuit may have recognized duress as a basis for such relief. <em>See Hadden v. Rumsey Products, </em>196 F.2d 92, 96 (2d Cir.1952); <em>Ira S. Bushey &amp; Sons v. W.E. Hedger Transportation Corporation, </em>167 F.2d 9, 18 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>335 U.S. 816, 69 S.Ct. 36, 93 L.Ed. 371 (1948). <em>See also United States v. Throckmorton, </em>98 U.S. 61 (8 Otto 61), 25 L.Ed. 93 (1878) (relief from judgment available where successful litigant\u2019s actions prevented an adversary trial). Whether duress of the general kind alleged by appellants could ever suffice as a basis for relief from a judgment, <em>cf., Ira S. Bushey &amp; Sons, </em>167 F.2d at 18-19, we do not decide, for we hold that no genuine fact issue was raised tending to show any character of actionable duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, \u201cwe must view the evidence and any inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable\u201d to the nonmoving party \u201cto determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the party seeking summary disposition is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Prinzi v. Keydril Co., </em>738 F.2d 707, 709 (5th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our review of the affidavits, depositions, and other evidence presented to the district court by the parties convinces us that there is \u201cno evidence from which reasonable persons might draw\u201d an inference that appellants were the victims of duress. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">To demonstrate such duress, appellants rely exclusively on the deposition and affidavits of Craig. In his deposition, Craig testified that he agreed not to resist the reorganization sale of The Charles House property because of a threat made by Jerry A. Brown, Southmark\u2019s attorney in the reorganization proceedings, in a meeting or meetings between Brown and Max Nathan. Nathan was the attorney for Craig, The Charles House Corporation, and The Charles House guarantors in those proceedings. Craig was not present at any such meetings. According to Craig, Nathan told Craig that Brown had threatened \u201cto bring the full force and weight of [the] entire [Citizens &amp; Southern] organization against John Elms, his two sisters, George Zissus ..., Lionel Flotte and Hartman Daniel and myself and that they would attempt to break our backs ... and ruin them.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Nathan testified that the threat regarding the above-named individuals made by Brown and related by Nathan to Craig was that Southmark (then Citizens &amp; Southern Realty Investors) would actively prosecute litigation against these individuals to enforce their guaranties on The Charles House and The Pier Eight Apartments loans if The Charles House Corporation remained in the reorganization proceedings and resisted Southmark\u2019s foreclosure on The Charles House.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is clear from Nathan\u2019s testimony that, according to Nathan, Brown\u2019s threat regarding Flotte, Daniel, Zissus, Elms, Elms\u2019 sisters, and Craig was only to aggressively enforce their guaranties on The Charles House and Pier Eight loan agreements. Nathan\u2019s version of the threat made to him by Brown was corroborated by Brown\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Daniel and Flotte testified that the only threat from Brown of which they were aware was relayed to them by Craig. Daniel and Flotte testified, as did Nathan, that the threat as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>understood by them was only to fully enforce the guaranties on The Charles House and Pier Eight loans in state court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">We do not believe that the district court was required to give any weight, in respect to whether there was a genuine factual dispute as to what threat was actually made by Brown, to Craig\u2019s uncorroborated testimony as to what Craig\u2019s lawyer, Nathan, told Craig that Brown had said to Nathan. This was obviously hearsay insofar as it concerned what Brown had actually said. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, it was contradicted by the testimony of Nathan and Brown, the only witnesses present at the subsequently reported conversation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We note that the hearsay rule is not merely a technicality, but rests on the sound principle that the reliability of out-of-court declarations not made under oath and not subject to cross-examination and other checks of the trial process is inherently suspect. <em>McCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence </em>\u00a7 245, at 581-83 (2d ed. 1972). Therefore, the evidence establishes that the only threat made by Southmark or its agents was to aggressively enforce the personal guaranties on The Charles House and Pier Eight loans. Such a threat does not constitute duress. The general rule is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>\u201c... it is not duress to threaten to do what one has a legal right to do. Nor is it duress to threaten to take any measure authorized by law and the circumstances of the case____ Thus, it is the established rule that it is not duress to institute or threaten to institute civil suits, or take proceedings in court, or for any person to declare that he intends to use the courts wherein to insist upon what he believes to be his legal rights, at least where the threatened action is made in good faith, that is, in the honest belief that a good cause of action exists, and does not involve some actual or threatened abuse of process.\u201d 25 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Duress and Undue Influence </em>\u00a7 18 at 375-76 (1966) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">As Professors Williston and Jaeger explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac_\">\u201cThe law provides certain means for the enforcement of their claims by creditors. It is not duress to threaten to resort to these measures. Therefore, a threat to bring a civil action or to resort to remedies available under a contract is not such duress as will justify rescission of a transaction induced thereby. This is true even though it is subsequently determined that there is no legal right to enforce the claim, provided the threat is made in good faith____ <em>U</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">\u201cBut where a threat of civil action or use of an available remedy is made <em>only </em>for the purposes of extortion, duress may be found.\u201d S. Williston and W. Jaeger, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1606-07 at 672-73, 681 (3rd ed. 1970) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">These principles have been followed in the federal courts, <em>see, e.g., Automatic Radio Mfg. Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>176 F.2d 799, 804 (1st Cir.1949), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>339 U.S. 827, 70 S.Ct. 894, 94 L.Ed. 1312, <em>rehearing denied, </em>340 U.S. 846, 71 S.Ct. 13, 95 L.Ed. 620 (1950); <em>Jamestown Farmers Elevator, Inc. v.

To the contrary, it is undisputed that the Pier Eight guarantors were liable on the Pier Eight loan which was in default at the time of Brown\u2019s threat. Moreover, it cannot be seriously disputed that Southmark had at least a reasonable basis to believe that it had a valid cause of action against The Charles House guarantors. The Charles House Corporation had failed to pay local taxes when due, and liens had been filed against it, both on their face acts of default under the loan agreement. Moreover, although appellants now allege that it was intended under the loan agreement that upon depletion of the interest reserve, interest payments by the debtor would be waived until completion of the project, such a construction of the contract appears to contradict the plain language of the notes (executed by The Charles House Corporation, through Craig, with endorsements by Craig, Daniel, and Flotte) stipulating that interest shall be payable monthly. There is simply no evidence that Southmark lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>a good faith belief that it possessed good causes of action when it threatened to press its claims against the Pier Eight and The Charles House guarantors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, Nathan testified, in effect, that Southmark had enforceable claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Appellees made a <em>prima facie </em>showing of entitlement to summary judgment, and hence appellants, to prevent such a judgment against them, were \u201crequired to bring forward \u2018significant probative evidence\u2019 demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of fact.\u201d <em>In re Municipal Bond Reporting Antitrust Litigation, </em>672 F.2d 436, 440 (5th Cir.1982). <em>See also Ferguson v.

The summary judgment for appellees was accordingly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Because we hold that the district court had jurisdiction and that the trustee\u2019s sale of appellants\u2019 property to Southmark must be given <em>res judicata </em>effect, the judgment of the district court dismissing appellants\u2019 counterclaim and granting appellees declaratory relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-17\">. The original reorganization proceedings in this case arose under the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, 30 Stat. 544, as amended at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, <em>et seq. </em>(1976). The Bankruptcy Act was replaced by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of November 6, 1978, ch. 1, 92 Stat. 2549.

Among the improper acts allegedly committed by Southmark in asserted breach of its contractual obligations were the following:</p>\n<p id=\"AYn\">Initiating foreclosure proceedings on the basis that The Charles House Corporation had defaulted in interest payments on its loan, following depletion of the interest reserve, \"even though it was agreed and contemplated that the interest was to be taken only from the construetion loan and that the depletion of the funds allocated for interest was not to be a ground or cause for foreclosure ;</p>\n<p id=\"AViZ\">Refusing [b efore, durmg, and after the foreclosure, . all requests to increase the construction loan to cover the increased interest \u2018 t ~ . , payments, to defer the interest until maturity, to j *1/ *\u2022 \u00a3 *\u00a3\u2022* . . \u00a3\u25a0 extend the time for payment or interest to rerinance or allow refinancing of the construction loan, or to otherwise resolve the condition of the rapidly rising interest rates and resulting increased interest deductions\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"A5c\">Initiating the foreclosure for the purpose of taking the equity and the profits of The Charles House property;</p>\n<p id=\"ASc\">Refusing to permit The Charles House Corporation to convert The Charles House to condominiums;</p>\n<p id=\"ALtD\">Refusing all offers to resell The Charles House after the trustee-s sale;</p>\n<p id=\"Aa4t\">Converting The Charles House to condominiums several after fhe truste\u00a3.s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"AaqB\">Threatening to foreclose on an unrelated real , . \u2022 7i , , A . estate project known as The Pier Eight Apart- <em>\u00b1 i </em>^ ments unless The Charles House Corporation \u201e , _ . - , A . r , allowed Southmark to complete the foreclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AS7\">.

The district court did not specify whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. Rule 41(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifies, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqQD\">\"Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7M_\">Because none of the exceptions specified in the Rule apply in this case, and the district court made it clear during its hearing on appellees' second summary judgment motion that it intended the judgment to be on the merits, we deem the dismissal of appellants\u2019 counterclaim to be with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"AFYr\">Consistent with the position taken by appellees at oral argument, we construe the portion of the district court\u2019s judgment granting appellees judgment on their count for declaratory relief as in essence being no more than an affirmative declaration of the same rights that are implicit in and flow from that part of the judgment dismissing appellants' counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b976-19\">.

Marathon Pipeline Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982). That decision, however, dealt solely with the constitutionality of the powers exercised by bankruptcy courts established under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. Northern Pipeline </em>in no way suggests that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in the reorganization proceedings (or would not have had jurisdiction over a counterclaim by the trustee against Southmark arising out of the same transaction as that made the basis of South-mark's claim in the reorganization proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b978-9\">. Appellants argue that because the legality of Southmark\u2019s foreclosure on or acquisition of the property was not raised in the reorganization proceedings, there was no final judgment on the merits. Appellants misapprehend the \u201cfinal judgment\" requirement of the <em>Kemp </em>test. As Professor Moore explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-15\">\"A judgment may be final in the sense that it terminates the present action, though it does not bar the plaintiff's claim____ All that can be said, then, is that a final judgment for purposes of res judicata must finally dispose of some matter which under the substantive law to be applied and the procedural law of the forum can be, and has been, finally disposed of.\u201d IB <em>Moore's </em>jf 0.409[1.-1] at 301.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b978-18\">.

Burmingham News Co., </em>608 F.2d 1049, 1052 (5th Cir.1979). However, this Court, sitting en banc in <em>Nilsen v.

Appellants have also stated in the district court and on appeal that they are <em>not </em>attacking the district court's reorganization orders. It is hence arguable that there is no basis for considering their alleged equitable grounds to avoid the <em>res judicata </em>effects of that judgment. However, as we in any event find appellants\u2019 equitable claims to be insufficient on their merits, even if urged in a properly presented attack on the reorganization orders, it is unnecessary to consider the effect of appellants\u2019 disclaimers of such an attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-16\">Further, because we reject these claims of appellants on their merits, we likewise do not reach the distinctly arguable contentions of appellees that appellants' claims in this respect are barred by laches and by appellees\u2019 having dismissed their previous state court suits with prejudice. <em>See Miller v.

And he also mentioned to me that they had threatened a similar action against the shareholders of the Pier 8 apartment building____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">\"Q Was [permitting the reorganization sale] in consideration of an agreement by Citizens and Southern Realty Investors that they would not pursue you, Mr. Flotte and Mr. Craig individually?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">\"A That was the agreement, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-10\">\u201cQ Now, was the only threat that Mr. Craig conveyed to you that C&amp;S Realty Investors was going to pursue you, Mr. Craig and Mr. Flotte individually?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">\"A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-12\">\"Q That was the only threat that he conveyed to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-13\">\"A No, well, that was the only threat against me. I wasn\u2019t involved in the other one, but he conveyed the entire story to me, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-14\">\"Q No, but with respect to you individually?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-16\">\u201cA Yes, that was the only threat against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-17\">\"Q Was to pursue you individually on your guaranty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-18\">\"A .Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-19\">\"Q So that it is correct that at all times you knew that you had the personal obligation if in fact The Charles House Corporation was unable to satisfy the indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-20\">\u201cA No question about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-21\">Flotte\u2019s relevant testimony was as follows: \"Q Did Mr. Craig tell you that through Max Nathan he had received threats that the full weight of the C&amp;S organization would be brought to bear against you as well as all of the others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-25\">\"A Basically, yes, I guess. I am not sure what the full force means. I took it in the effect that C&amp;S would enforce the letter of the law and attack, you know, Hartman Daniel and myself and Dave, of course, but attack all of us on a personal endorsement and to take whatever steps were necessary to extract all of the funds, you know, required to satisfy the thing, which in effect meant, you know, force us against the wall, not just try and make a settlement with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-26\">\"Q At any time did you perceive that to involve any physical threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-27\">\"A No, no way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-28\">\"Q Did you at any time perceive that to involve anything beyond pursuing you with respect to your personal guaranty], and by that I would mean seeking full enforcement of the personal guaranty]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-29\">\u201cA Not specifically, except that there was either a statement made or it was brought out to me flat out that this would also extend to the Pier 8. As 1 recall, it was basically stated that if C &amp; S were not, if we continued to fight C&amp;S and not to allow them to disband the bankruptcy and obtain possession of the property, that they would through their legal thing here of obtaining the additional funds from us as personal endorsers and also pursue it on the Pier 8. It was definitely tied into Pier 8 as far as I can recall.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b983-30\">. We know of no exception to the hearsay rule that would allow admission of Craig\u2019s testimony to prove what Brown said. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802-04.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b983-31\">. And, Daniel\u2019s and Flotte\u2019s testimony shows that they understood the threat in the same way that Nathan\u2019s testimony described it, and that they received this understanding from Craig.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\">. It is to be noted that these authorities do <em>not </em>deal with the kind of duress necessary to set aside a judgment, where arguably there should be a stronger showing and a close, direct relation to the integrity of the prior proceedings. <em>Cf. Ira S. Bushey &amp; Sons, </em>167 F.2d at 18-19; <em>Miller v. Meinhard-Commercial Corporation, </em>462 F.2d 358, 361 (5th Cir.1972) (fraud must be extrinsic). We do not reach that question, as we hold that in any event there was no showing of the kind of duress necessary to set aside a contract or deed or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">It may be an unsettled question whether federal or state law determines the equitable grounds on which a federal judgment may be attacked. See 7 <em>Moore's </em>jf 60.37[2], Because we find no presently material differences between the views of the Louisiana and federal courts on this issue, we need not determine which law governs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b985-11\">. Appellants also argue that because the reorganization sale resulted from the various other acts of misconduct allegedly committed to by Southmark, the earlier judgment should not be given <em>res judicata </em>effect. Appellants do not allege, however, that they lacked knowledge of these actions at the time of the reorganization sale or that these other actions amounted to duress or extrinsic fraud \"which might give rise to the reopening of a former judgment in an independent equitable proceeding.\u201d <em>Miller v. Meinhard-Commercial Corporation, </em>462 F.2d 358, 361 (5th Cir.1972). It is well settled that fraud must be pleaded with particularity. 7 <em>Moore\u2019s </em>\u00b6 60.37[l] at 60-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-25\">We have considered appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find they lack any substantial merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
