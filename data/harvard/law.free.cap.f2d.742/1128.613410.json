The defendants are Woodbury County, the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors, and an individual caseworker and her supervisor. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted the plaintiffs partial relief holding that defendants had violated the applicants\u2019 due process rights. The court enjoined further due process violations and awarded three of the plaintiffs damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the district court\u2019s injunction is not specific enough and seek a clearer enumeration of their due process rights. They also allege that the County\u2019s lack of standards for determining whether applicants are qualified for relief violates due process and that the level of benefits provided by the County is inadequate. Finally, plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in not certifying the case as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">The two individual defendants and the County have cross-appealed. Defendants contend that the court erred in awarding damages to three of the plaintiffs and that the current procedures used by the County provide applicants with all the process that is due. They assert that the standards of eligibility and level of benefits provided by the County comport with both the Constitution and Iowa law. We affirm in part and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">\n<em>The General Relief Program</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-11\">The general relief program involved here is a public assistance plan provided for by Iowa law and administered by the individual counties. <em>See </em>Iowa Code \u00a7 252 (1969). Woodbury County has enacted rules which set forth benefit levels, eligibility requirements, and program procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">These rules, as amended August 1, 1981, provide that upon application the applicant is entitled to a decision by the relief worker within twenty days. The worker must give the applicant an oral explanation of the decision with a written statement to be placed in the record. If the applicant is not present, a copy of the written statement is to be sent to the applicant. If the applicant receives less relief than requested, the rules provide that the applicant be informed, either orally or in writing, of the right to appeal to the County Board of Supervisors. If the applicant requests an appeal, the relief worker is to provide him or her with a copy of the appellate rules and \u201cthe reason for denial of the requested relief shall be stated to the applicant.\u201d A de novo hearing is then held before the Board of Supervisors with the applicant given the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If the applicant is not present at the time the Board renders its decision, a written statement of the decision is to be mailed to the applicant. Apparently a statement of reasons for the decision is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">An applicant is entitled to review his file but all \u201cthird party information\u201d is kept from him. The applicant is required to \u201ccooperate\u201d with the worker and relief can be denied if the applicant does not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-14\">The substantive rules of the County differentiate between \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cneedy\u201d persons. A \u201cpoor\u201d person is a person with no property and who is unable to earn a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>living due to disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A \u201cneedy\u201d person is one who has \u201csome property\u201d and who has an immediate need for relief. Needy persons only qualify for relief on a temporary basis and must seek and obtain employment, usually with the County, as a precondition to eligibility. These restrictions apparently do not apply to poor persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">Woodbury County employs two persons to operate the program. Georgia Schieffer is the fulltime general relief worker and makes most of the initial eligibility decisions. She is supervised by Ralph Klocke, the part-time general relief director. General relief is granted on a onetime basis for a specified period of time. The district court explained that \u201cthe concept of a \u2018termination\u2019 of benefits is not applicable to Woodbury County\u2019s general relief program. To obtain relief beyond the period for which relief was previously granted, another application is required.\u201d This relief program has been called a program of \u201clast resort\u201d wherein applicants are granted relief assistance for such items as food, clothing, shelter and medical expenses if the applicant shows immediate need for such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">\n<em>The District Court\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">After a hearing the district court entered a preliminary injunction specifying certain temporary procedures to be followed by defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After several more days of trial, the court issued its final opinion. The court found that the actions of Schieffer and Klocke have resulted in arbitrary denials of benefits, in failures to notify claimants of their appeal rights, and in failures to provide claimants with the reasons for adverse decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court found that the evidence showed that the administration of the relief program \u201chas not always been in accordance with its own stated rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">In addition, the court found that three of the plaintiffs, George Daniels, Delores Farley and Bluette Caron, were deprived of their civil rights. The court found that, although none of the plaintiffs fit the definition of a \u201cpoor\u201d person, some of them were incorrectly found not to be \u201cneedy,\u201d and thus were arbitrarily denied benefits. The court stated that the two general relief workers had violated the due process rights of citizens by arbitrarily denying benefits to eligible applicants and that this was done in the name of saving money or conserving fiscal resources.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-11\">Based on its findings, the court made the following conclusions of law: (1) the fourteenth amendment requires that due process be observed in acting upon applications for relief since the state statute and County rules created a property interest in the receipt of welfare benefits; (2) the general relief program, as administered by Woodbury County, violated due process; (3) the Board of Supervisors and the individual members of the Board did not act with a clear disregard for plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, and thus they were protected by good faith immunity; (4) Schieffer and Klocke should have known that their actions in arbitrarily denying benefits and in failing to give notice of appeal rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>were in violation of due process, and thus they were not protected by good faith immunity; (5) the County itself was also liable since the individual defendants acted pursuant to governmental custom; (6) the County was not protected by eleventh amendment immunity since the County received no state funds in operating the program; (7) the court determined that it had no authority to interfere with the actual benefit levels or eligibility standards; and (8) certification of a class action was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">The court awarded Daniels, Farley and Caron $500.00 each in damages and enjoined the two individual defendants and the County \u201cfrom further actions in violation of the due process rights of general relief applicants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">We first address defendants\u2019 contention that no process at all is due because applicants for welfare benefits enjoy no property interest protected by the due process clause. They assert that there is no property interest in <em>eligibility </em>for a state conferred benefit as opposed to a <em>termination </em>of the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">We reject the distinction which the defendants have asked us to draw between eligibility and termination of a benefit. \u201cApplicants who have met the objective eligibility criteria of a wide variety of governmental programs have been held to be entitled to protection under the due process clause.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. Pitt, </em>643 F.2d 1261, 1278 n. 35 (7th Cir.1981), and cases cited therein. The distinction oversimplifies the analysis which must be undertaken in determining whether a person has a constitutionally protected property interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The proper inquiry is whether plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement to relief assistance. <em>E.g., Hughes v. Whitmer, </em>714 F.2d 1407, 1414 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1275, 79 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-15\">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-16\"><em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-17\">Whether plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement thus depends upon the nature of the interest created by state or local rule. <em>Id.; Patteson v. Johnson, </em>721 F.2d 228, 230 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Wilson v. Robinson, </em>668 F.2d 380, 382 (8th Cir.1981). Therefore, the district court properly looked to Woodbury County\u2019s general relief rules in order to ascertain whether plaintiffs enjoyed a protected property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-18\">We agree with the court\u2019s analysis that these rules create an expectation in the receipt of general assistance for all people eligible. The language of the Iowa statute and of the County\u2019s rules is mandatory. Iowa Code \u00a7 252.25 (Supp.1983) states that the County \u201cshall\u201d provide for the relief of poor persons. The County rules provide that a person \u201cshall\u201d be deemed eligible for relief if he or she meets established conditions. Just as in <em>Griffeth v. Detrich, </em>603 F.2d 118 (9th Cir.1979), \u201cthe authorizing statute coupled with the implementing regulations of the county creates a legitimate claim of entitlement and expectancy of benefits in persons who claim to meet the eligibility requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121; <em>see also Carey v. Quern, </em>588 F.2d 230, 232 (7th Cir.1978); <em>White v. Roughton, </em>530 F.2d 750, 753-54 (7th Cir.1976); <em>Meyer v. Niles Township, </em>477 F.Supp. 357, 361-62 (N.D.Ill.1979); <em>Alexander v. Silver-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number><em>man, </em>356 F.Supp. 1179, 1179-80 (E.DWis. 1973).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to minimum due process in the administration of Woodbury County\u2019s general relief program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">In determining what process is due, we must recognize that \u201cdue process is a flexible concept which requires procedural protections suited to the particular situation.\u201d <em>Collins v. Hoke, </em>705 F.2d 959, 963 (8th Cir.1983) (citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). This necessarily involves a balancing of the private and public interests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfSC\">[I]dentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\"><em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">Plaintiffs contend that due process requires: (1) written decisions and the reasons for the decisions at both the initial decisional level and on appeal to the Board of Supervisors; (2) written notice of appeal rights; (3) written notice of any requirements for cooperation; and (4) full access to the applicant\u2019s file. They assert that anything less will result in a serious deprivation of due process and that defendants, unless made to comply with the above requirements, will continue to administer the relief program in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">Plaintiffs make a persuasive argument that the suggested procedures are necessary to reduce the risk of arbitrary decisionmaking in the administration of the general relief program. Certainly the private interests are substantial. Plaintiffs appear to be destitute and rely on public assistance to exist. Moreover, plaintiffs argue that because applicants for general relief are many times illiterate, the requirement that each step of the process be in writing would assist them substantially by allowing them to seek help both in understanding defendants\u2019 decisions and in preparing their cases for appeal. Finally, it is alleged that a requirement that initial decisions be in writing would not pose an insurmountable burden on the County since written records are already required to be kept by the current rules. A copy need only be provided to the applicant. Plaintiffs contend that the same is true for the Board\u2019s decision on appeal, the notice of appeal rights, and the cooperation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">However, we are hesitant to hold that such requirements are constitutionally required since the district court did not directly review the current written rules in light of the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test. In other words, the court did not rule on whether the current rules are constitutionally sufficient or whether, as plaintiffs assert, more is required. What is certain is that the court did hold that the general relief program, as administered by the defendants, violated plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights. This finding is fully supported by the record and will not be disturbed. However, before deciding the validity of plaintiffs\u2019 suggested additional procedures, an initial determination must be made as to whether the current rules are constitutionally sufficient. We believe the district court is in a much better position to tailor the necessary safeguards in light of the particular circumstances of this case. Since the trial court had the first-hand opportunity to assess the evidence and listen to the witnesses, that court should initially decide whether the County\u2019s rules are an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>insufficient check against arbitrary decisionmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"AU7y\">The court\u2019s failure to consider this question appears to be related to plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the injunction as being lacking in specificity. The court, in granting equitable relief, simply enjoined defendants \u201cfrom further actions in violation of the due process rights of general relief applicants. The Court hopes that more explicit equitable relief will not be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWG0\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) provides that \u201c[ejvery order granting an injunction ... shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; [and] shall describe in reasonable detail ... the act or acts sought to be restrained ____\u201d <em>Schmidt v. Lessard, </em>414 U.S. 473, 476, 94 S.Ct. 713, 715, 38 L.Ed.2d 661 (1974). In <em>Schmidt, </em>the Supreme Court identified two interests which the rule of specificity serves to advance. It prevents uncertainty on the part of those faced with injunctive orders and gives them explicit notice of what conduct is unlawful. Second, it allows a reviewing court \u201cto know precisely what it is reviewing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 94 S.Ct. at 715-716. To these two functions we would also add that a specific injunction allows those who are protected by its terms to know when the order is being violated so that they may then effectively police the order and enforce its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"ArDX\">While we certainly understand the trial court\u2019s desire to maintain flexibility, we nevertheless must conclude that an injunction which does little or nothing more than order the defendants to obey the law is not specific enough. <em>See Meyer v. Brown &amp; Root Const. Co., </em>661 F.2d 369, 373 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cA general injunction which in essence orders a defendant to obey the law is not permitted.\u201d). Such an injunction serves none of the interests stated above. It neither provides plaintiff or defendant with a clear idea of what conduct is prohibited nor can we \u201cbegin to assess the correctness of the judgment entered ... without knowing its precise bounds.\u201d <em>Schmidt, </em>414 U.S. at 477, 94 S.Ct. at 716. It is clear that the court\u2019s order in this case fails to meet Rule 65(d)\u2019s requirements. For these reasons, and for the reasons previously expressed, we remand for further findings and for the entry \u00b0f a more specific injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"A0mh\">Relatedly, we note that the court did not directly address plaintiffs\u2019 contention concerning the defendants\u2019 failure to find <em>any </em>applicants to meet the definition of a \u201cpoor\u201d person in the twelve months preceding the last hearing in the district court. Plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 lack of standards or guidelines in defining \u201cdisability\u201d and in interpreting the \u201cno property\u201d requirement have allowed the defendants to continually and arbitrarily deny plaintiffs the full relief to which they are entitied.</p>\n<p id=\"AdrT\">Th S th c- \u2022, h t <em>f , </em>i\u00f1e beventh UrCmt haS State&lt;1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxtW\">In the context of eligibility for welfare assistance, due process requires at least assigtance program be administered in such a way as to insure fairness and avcad arbitrary decisionmaking.

Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 487, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970); however, where the defendants have already established a category of eligible applicants, such as the category of \u201cpoor\u201d persons here, the County may not arbitrarily and capriciously deny the availability of that category by lodging unlimited discretion in the hands of the decisionmaker. <em>See Carey, </em>588 F.2d at 232; <em>White, </em>530 F.2d at 754; <em>see also Franklin v. Shields, </em>569 F.2d 784, 792 (4th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1003, 98 S.Ct. 1659, 56 L.Ed.2d 92 (1978); <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>439 F.2d 584, 596-98 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>Holmes v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>398 F.2d 262, 265 (2d Cir.1968); <em>Hornsby v. Allen, </em>326 F.2d 605, 610 (5th Cir.1964). If the court were to find a constitutional violation in this regard, the remedy would not be for the court to define the standards. Instead, defendants would be required to submit proposed standards subject to the court\u2019s approval. <em>See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </em>402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Thus, while a court may not usurp the clearly legislative function of defining the eligibility standards in the first instance, it may require such standards to be promulgated and followed in order to limit and direct the decisionmaker\u2019s discretion. \u201cOnce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad ----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 91 S.Ct. at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">The defendants\u2019 complete inability to find <em>any </em>applicants to be \u201cpoor\u201d certainly appears arbitrary. On the other hand, it may well be that the disability and property requirements are sufficiently defined and that defendants were justified in not finding any applicants to meet their definitions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On remand, the court should specifically address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">\n<em>Failure to Provide for Applicants\u2019 \u201cActual Needs\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">Plaintiffs contend that the level of benefits provided by Woodbury County is inadequate to provide them with the means to meet their actual needs. They assert that the current levels of benefits are so arbitrary and so unrealistic in fact that they violate substantive due process. They also contend in a pendent claim that Iowa law requires that the actual needs of poor persons be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">We agree with the district court that the Iowa legislature has vested broad discretion in the individual counties which administer the program to set the actual level of benefits. Iowa Code \u00a7 252.27 (Supp.1983) states that the amount of benefits is to be determined by the boards of supervisors of each individual county. Although the levels of benefits are, as the district court stated, \u201cunrealistically low,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>the Board was within statutory authority in setting the current assistance levels. <em>See Collins, </em>705 F.2d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Nor are we persuaded that the benefit levels violate substantive due process. The benefits bear a rational relationship to the legitimate government interest in providing for the needs of the poor. No more is constitutionally required. <em>See Flemming v. Nestor, </em>363 U.S. 603, 611, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1373, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960). \u201cWelfare benefits are not a fundamental right, and neither the State or Federal Government is under any sort of constitutional obligation to guarantee minimum levels of support.\u201d <em>Lavine v. Milne, </em>424 U.S. 577, 584 n. 9, 96 S.Ct. 1010, 1015 n. 9, 47 L.Ed.2d 249 (1976). <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">In their cross-appeal, defendants Woodbury County, Georgia Schieffer and Ralph Klocke attack the court\u2019s award of $500.00 each in damages to plaintiffs Daniels, Farley and Caron. They allege that the record fails to establish deprivations of plaintiffs\u2019 due process rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">The evidence clearly reflects that George Daniels was deprived of his civil rights. Schieffer told Daniels that he was required to complete a work project prior to being considered eligible for relief. Thus, Schieffer found Daniels to be \u201cable-bodied\u201d under the regulations. However, at the time of his application, Daniels suffered from emphysema, asthma and was recovering from knife wounds, to his leg which he received when thieves broke into his apartment. Further, at the time, Daniels was overweight, and, due to his disabilities, could walk no more than half a block. In addition, it appears that Schieffer based her decision on out-of-date medical information and did not provide Daniels with a written explanation for the denial of benefits when one was requested. We agree with the district court that the decision that Daniels was in fact able-bodied \u201cwas arbitrary, unfair, and without substantial factual basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">Moreover, the record also abundantly supports the district court\u2019s findings with respect to the other two plaintiffs who were awarded damages. Delores Farley was neither provided with any explanation of the reasons her application was denied nor was she notified of her appeal rights. Bluette Caron was not informed of the Board\u2019s decision on her appeal after she was denied relief by Schieffer. In addition, both Farley and Caron initially were denied relief assistance when it appears they were in fact \u00e9ligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">With respect to the amount of damages, $500.00 to each of the plaintiffs does not appear excessive. Plaintiffs were experiencing serious financial hardships and, as the district court stated, \u201c[t]he arbitrary and insensitive treatment they received in applying for general relief clearly caused a significant amount of emotional distress in the plaintiffs\u2019 lives.\u201d These considerations are proper in awarding damages under \u00a7 1983. <em>E.g., Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 264, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1052, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978); <em>see generally Herrera v. Valentine, </em>653 F.2d 1220 (8th Cir.1981). Plaintiffs are entitled to nominal damages for the deprivation of procedural due process even in the absence of proof of actual injury. <em>Carey, </em>435 U.S. at 248, 98 S.Ct. at 1044. Moreover, actual injury has been proven here. The arbitrary decisions made by defendants caused plaintiffs to be without greatly needed relief assistance. The trial court specifically noted that the distress defendants\u2019 actions caused was evident even at the time of trial when their testimony was heard. We affirm the district court\u2019s award of damages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Class Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">The plaintiffs sought certification of a class composed of all present and future applicants for general relief in Woodbury County. The district court denied certification based on lack of numeros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>ity and because it did not believe that the certification of a class was warranted in light of the individual nature of the due process violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">The requirements for class certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-6\">(i) \u201cNumerosity\u201d \u2014 the class must be \u201cso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;\u201d (ii) \u201ccommonality\u201d \u2014 the presence of \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class;\u201d (iii) \u201ctypicality\u201d\u2014 the claims or defenses of the class representative must be \u201ctypical of the claims or defenses of the class;\u201d and (iv) a class representative that will \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\"><em>Paxton v. Union National Bank, </em>688 F.2d 552, 559 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1083, 103 S.Ct. 1772, 76 L.Ed.2d 345 (1983). We note that the trial court has wide discretion in ruling on a request for class certification. <em>Darms v. McCullock Oil Corp., </em>720 F.2d 490, 493 (8th Cir.1983). \u201c[I]ts decision on the issue will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">No abuse of discretion has been shown here. The court could properly find that the number of plaintiffs suffering procedural due process violations was not so numerous that joinder would prove to be impracticable. Moreover, although there was evidence that other applicants had experienced unfair treatment, the nature and type of due process violation varied greatly from applicant to applicant. In addition, even some of the named plaintiffs were not shown to have suffered deprivations of their constitutional rights. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the requirements of Rule 23(a) were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s award of damages, denial of class certification, and its conclusions concerning defendants\u2019 failure to provide for applicants\u2019 actual needs. We also affirm the court\u2019s finding that defendants have violated the due process rights of applicants in the manner in which they have administered the program. We remand for the court to determine whether the County\u2019s current procedural rules are consistent with minimum due process standards. The court should examine these rules in light of the balancing test enunciated in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra. </em>If the court finds that the rules are constitutionally sufficient, it should enter a more specific injunction enjoining the defendants from violating their own rules; the order should specify which rules are required to meet the demands of the Constitution. If the court finds the current rules to be an insufficient check against arbitrary decisionmaking, it may require defendants to propose additional or substitute safeguards, and then enter a more specific order consonant with its determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">The court should also examine the question whether defendants\u2019 alleged lack of standards in defining the \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cno property\u201d requirements has resulted in a denial of applicants\u2019 due process rights. If the court finds current definitions inadequate, it may require the County to promulgate ascertainable standards of eligibility in defining the two terms. The County may then submit them to the court subject to its approval. In all other respects, the court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-15\">. The Honorable Donald E. O\u2019Brien, United States District Judge, Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">. This definition is derived from Iowa Code \u00a7 252.1 (1969), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-7\">The words \"poor\u201d and \u201cpoor person\u201d as used in this chapter shall be construed to mean those who have no property, exempt or otherwise, and are unable, because of physical or mental disabilities, to earn a living by labor; but this section shall not be construed to forbid aid to needy persons who have some means, when the board shall be of opinion that the same will be conducive to their welfare and the best interests of the public.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">. The court required oral or written explanations of denials of relief and written notice of appeal rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">. The court found that the practice of not informing applicants of their appeal rights was particularly widespread and that this was shown by the fact that no applicant had ever appealed an adverse decision without the assistance of Legal Services attorneys.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1239-13\">. The court stated that for the last several years the County had budgeted $150,000.00 for the poor relief fund, but that each year \u201cthe employees, by design, had spent only $50,000.00 to $100,000.00, the amount varying from year to year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">. The suggested distinction is not unlike the one between \u201crights\" and \u201cprivileges,\" which has been rejected by the Supreme Court. <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 571, 92 S.Ct. 2701, <em>2106, </em>33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 627 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1327 n. 6, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">. Moreover, we assumed that some process was due in a prior decision in which we examined this same Iowa general relief program as administered in a different county. <em>See Collins v. Hoke, </em>705 F.2d 959, 963 (8th Cir.1983) (due process requires that an applicant for general relief be entitled to nonattorney representation at the administrative appeal hearing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AlD\">. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACW\">The Court further finds that the evidence disclosed that not a single person was found to be \"poor\u201d in the twelve months prior to the last hearing and that by design, the general relief worker, who handled the large majority of all applications, operated on the theory that there were no \"poor\u201d persons in the county, which is amazing under the circumstances with which we have been faced in the last few years,</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AmeQ\">. Plaintiffs assert that, because of the complete lack of guidelines utilized in determining whether an applicant is \"disabled\u201d or \"able-bodied,\" defendants have been able to require severely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>disabled people to work prior to receiving benefits. When these people are then unable to complete the work assignments, they are found ineligible for assistance, thus resulting in arbitrary denials of benefits. They point to several applicants, such as George Daniels, Delores Farley and Edna Moore, who were under doctors\u2019 orders not to work and yet were nevertheless found to be \"able-bodied.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">. The district court did find that none of the named plaintiffs met the statutory definition of a \u201cpoor person\" contained in Iowa Code \u00a7 252.1 (1969). However, it is unclear whether this conclusion was based on the fact that plaintiffs were not disabled, based on a finding that plaintiffs had property, or both. Despite the above finding, we believe that plaintiffs are entitled to a more specific resolution of the precise issue they raise: whether the defendants, by allegedly using essentially unbridled and unchecked discretion, have been able to engage in wholesale denials of benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">. The level of benefits available under the County's rules have not been updated for several years. As a result, the current costs of food and shelter exceed the levels of benefits provided by the County. For example, the maximum food allowance for a family of four is $35.00 a week with an $8.00 a month maximum for toilet tissue, soap, tooth paste, and all other incidental household expenses. The rent allowance for a family of four is $135.00 a month with a utility allowance of $35.00 a month in the summer and $60.00 a month in the winter. These amounts represent the maximum allowances according to the County\u2019s regulations dated August 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">. Since none of the court\u2019s findings concerning legislative, judicial, or good faith immunity have been attacked on appeal by either plaintiffs or defendants, we need not discuss the court's conclusions in this regard in any detail. Suffice it to say that we find the court\u2019s conclusions fully supported by the evidence and in accord with the relevant caselaw.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
