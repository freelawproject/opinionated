(Boeing), under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, for breach of the collective bargaining agreement and against his union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Aerospace Industrial District Lodge #751 (the union), for violating its duty of fair representation. The District Court granted summary judgment for Boeing, ruling that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations. The District Court also granted summary judgment for the union based upon Scoggins\u2019 failure to exhaust internal union remedies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-16\">Scoggins was terminated by Boeing on June 25, 1980. As a Boeing employee, Scoggins was represented by the union. Following his termination, Scoggins met with a union business agent, seeking the union\u2019s help in his efforts to get his job back. The agent subsequently interviewed witnesses, reviewed Boeing\u2019s files, and met with Boeing representatives to discuss Scoggins\u2019 termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-17\">On August 27, 1980, the business agent notified Scoggins by letter that further efforts on Scoggins\u2019 behalf would be futile. Scoggins complained to the business agent about the agent\u2019s decision not to pursue the grievance further. However, Scoggins made no effort to contact the local union\u2019s president or to file an internal union appeal of the agent\u2019s decision. On September 16, 1980, the union withdrew Scoggins\u2019 grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>Scoggins brought this action on December 28, 1981, sixteen months after he received notice of the union\u2019s decision not to pursue his grievance. In his complaint, Scoggins alleged that Boeing breached the collective bargaining agreement by terminating him without just cause. He further alleged that the union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to process his grievance through arbitration. Scoggins moved for summary judgment against Boeing and the union, and also moved to strike the defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses of statute of limitations and failure to exhaust internal union remedies. In response, the union moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">The District Court granted the union\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action as to both the union and Boeing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court concluded that Scoggins failed to exhaust explicit and mandatory union remedies. The court also concluded that either the six month statute of limitations established by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) or the three month limitation of Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 7.04.180 (1974) applied to Scoggins\u2019 action, and that Scoggins\u2019 action was therefore time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">A. <em>Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXb3\">Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981), the statute of limitations for hybrid Section 301 actions in Washington was three years. <em>Christianson v. Pioneer Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>681 F.2d 577 (9th Cir.1982) (three year statute of limitations for suits against employers); <em>Washington v. Northland Marine Co., </em>681 F.2d 582 (9th Cir.1982) (three year statute of limitations for suits against unions). In <em>Mitchell, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state limitation period for vacation of an arbitral award controlled the employee\u2019s Section 301 action against his employer Mitchell, 451 U.S. at 64, 101 S.Ct. at 1564. In <em>Washington, </em>this period is three months. <em>See </em>Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 7.04.180 (1974). The <em>Mitchell </em>opinion, however, invited a square presentation of the question whether a more appropriate period would be the six-month limitation period found in Section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act. 451 U.S. at 60 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. at 1562 n. 2. In <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), the Court decided this question. The Court held that the limitation period as to claims against both an employer and a union is six months. We must decide whether either of these decisions applies to Scoggins\u2019 action, filed eight months after <em>Mitchell </em>and sixteen months before <em>DelCostello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">We have held that <em>DelCostello </em>does not apply retroactively either to claims against unions for breach of the duty of fair representation, <em>see Barina v. Gulf Trading and Transportation Co., </em>726 F.2d 560, 562-63 (9th Cir.1984); <em>McNaughton v. Dillingham Corp., </em>722 F.2d 1459 (9th Cir.1984), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>52 U.S.L.W. 3829 (U.S. May 15, 1984) (No. 83-1739); <em>Edwards v. Teamsters Local 36, </em>719 F.2d 1036, 1040-41 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 1599, 80 L.Ed.2d 130 (1984), or to claims against employers under the Labor Management Relations Act. <em>See Barina v. Gulf Trading and Transportation Co., </em>726 F.2d at 563-64. The six-month limitations period announced in <em>Del-Costello </em>cannot, therefore, govern Scoggins\u2019 action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>Scoggins, however, did not file his action until eight months after the Supreme Court decided <em>Mitchell. </em>Scoggins argues that based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), and this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Barina </em>and <em>Singer v. Flying Tiger Line Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1349 (9th Cir.1981), <em>Mitchell </em>should not be applied to bar Scoggins\u2019 action against Boeing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> **In <em>Chevron Oil, </em>the Supreme Court declined to apply a shorter statute of limitations retroactively to extinguish a claim, stating that \u201c[i]t would ... produce the most \u2018substantial inequitable results,\u2019 ... to hold that the respondent \u2018slept on his rights\u2019 at a time when he could not have known the time limitation that the law imposed upon him.\u201d <em>Chevron Oil, </em>404 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. at 356. Based on factors set forth in <em>Chevron Oil,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we refused to apply <em>Mitchell </em>retroactively to a case filed three years prior to the <em>Mitchell </em>decision. <em>Singer v. Flying Tiger Line Inc., </em>652 F.2d at 1353. At the time the plaintiff in <em>Singer </em>filed his action, the statute of limitations, according to an earlier decision by this court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appeared to be three years. It was not until three years after the plaintiff filed his action that the Supreme Court announced that the statute of limitations was actually a shorter period. In <em>Barina, </em>we also held that <em>Mitchell </em>would not be retroactively applied to bar the plaintiff\u2019s suit. The plaintiff had filed his suit within two months of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Mitchell </em>decision and approximately one year after the cause of action accrued. Under the law prevailing prior to <em>Mitchell, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s suit would have been timely filed, but under <em>Mitchell, </em>the statute of limitations would have been 100 days. It would have produced \u201csubstantial inequitable results\u201d to hold that the plaintiff in <em>Barina </em>had \u201cslept on his rights\u201d by not filing within 100 days of the time the cause arose; at that point in time, the statute of limitations was thought to be three years. The plaintiff, however, quickly filed suit after <em>Mitchell </em>announced the shorter statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">The above cases do not help Scoggins. Although Scoggins was not aware of the shorter statute of limitations period when his cause of action accrued in August, 1980, Scoggins slept on his rights after the <em>Mitchell </em>decision. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Singer, </em>who did not know the \u201ccorrect\u201d statute of limitations until several years after he filed his lawsuit, Scoggins knew the correct statute of limitations eight months before he filed his suit. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Barina, </em>who quickly filed his lawsuit after the Court announced in <em>Mitchell </em>the shorter statute <em>of </em>limitations, Scoggins delayed filing his lawsuit until eight months after the <em>Mitchell </em>decision. It is not inequitable to hold Scoggins to the shorter statute of limitations period applicable under <em>Mitchell. </em>Consequently, Scoggins\u2019 action against Boeing is gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>erned by a three month statute of limitations <em>(see </em>Wash.Bev.Code \u00a7 7.04.180 (1974)) appropriate under <em>Mitchell. </em>Since Scoggins did not file his case until eight months after the Supreme Court announced the <em>Mitchell </em>decision, the District Court properly dismissed Scoggins\u2019 action against Boeing as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\"><em>Mitchell, </em>however, applies only to suits against employers; it does not apply to suits against unions. <em>See </em>n. 3, <em>supra. </em>Since neither <em>Mitchell </em>nor <em>DelCostello </em>governs the statute of limitations for Scoggins\u2019 action against the union, the appropriate statute of limitations for this suit is three years. <em>See Washington v. Northland Marine Co., </em>681 F.2d 582, 586 (9th Cir.1982). Scoggins filed suit sixteen months after his cause of action accrued. The suit was therefore timely filed and the District Court erred in dismissing the suit against the union as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">B. <em>Exhaustion of Internal Union Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">The District Court also determined that Scoggins\u2019 suit against the union should be dismissed because Scoggins failed to exhaust internal union appeals procedures. The determination whether to require exhaustion is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Fristoe v. Reynolds Metal Co., </em>615 F.2d 1209, 1214 (9th Cir.1980). Scoggins argues that the District Court abused its discretion in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-11\">The Supreme Court has identified three factors to guide trial courts in determining whether to require an employee to exhaust such appeals procedures: (1) whether union officials are so hostile to the employee that the employee could not obtain a fair hearing; (2) whether the internal union appeals procedures would be inadequate either to reactivate the employee\u2019s grievance or to accord the employee the full relief sought under Section 301; and (3) whether exhaustion would unreasonably delay the employee\u2019s opportunity to obtain a judicial hearing on the merits. <em>Clayton v. Automobile Workers, </em>451 U.S. 679, 689, 101 S.Ct. 2088, 2095, 68 L.Ed.2d 538 (1981). On appeal, Scoggins relies primarily on the second factor in arguing that the District Court improperly required exhaustion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-13\">Although Scoggins argues on appeal that the union could neither award him the complete relief he sought nor reactivate his grievance, a careful search of the record reveals that Scoggins failed to make the reactivation argument to the District Court. When the union moved for summary judgment, the union submitted an affidavit and excerpts from the union constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The union used these documents to demonstrate to the District Court that internal union remedies were available to Scoggins. Scoggins, in his response to the union\u2019s motion for summary judgment, argued only that \u201c[bjecause, in this case, the internal union appeals procedures cannot grant the Plaintiff the complete relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>sought in his \u00a7 301 suit i.e., reinstatement, <em>Clayton </em>mandates that as a matter of law, the Union\u2019s motion [for summary judgment] be denied.\u201d Scoggins completely failed to argue to the District Court that the union could not reactivate the grievance. By emphasizing only half of <em>Clayton\u2019s </em>second factor and ignoring the other half, Scoggins failed to give the District Court a chance to determine whether there was a genuine issue of material fact for trial; i.e., whether the union could have reactivated the grievance. Scoggins may not make this argument for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">In this circuit, when a party moves for summary judgment in a Section 301 action citing failure to exhaust internal union remedies, the moving party must first establish the availability of adequate internal union remedies; the burden then shifts to the party opposing the motion to respond by affidavits or otherwise and set forth specific facts showing that exhaustion of remedies would have been futile. <em>See Keppard v. International Harvester Co., </em>581 F.2d 764 (9th Cir.1978). Scoggins failed to present any facts or arguments to the District Court to indicate that the union could not reactivate the grievance. Since <em>Clayton </em>requires only that the union be able to award the complete relief sought or reactivate the grievance, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in requiring exhaustion where Scoggins failed to suggest the union could not reactivate the grievance. <em>See Hayes v. Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks/Allied. Services Division, </em>727 F.2d 1383, 1386 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>734 F.2d 219 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">The District Court did not err in dismissing Scoggins\u2019 suit against Boeing and the union. The District Court properly dismissed Scoggins\u2019 action against Boeing because the statute of limitations had run. The court also properly dismissed the action against the union because Scoggins had failed to exhaust internal union appeals procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">. Scoggins argues that the District Court could not grant summary judgment for Boeing since Boeing never moved for it. However, where one party moves for summary judgment, the trial court may <em>sua sponte </em>grant summary judgment to the non-moving party. <em>Cool Fuel, Inc. v. Connett, </em>685 F.2d 309, 311 (9th Cir.1982). Of course, \"the moving party against whom summary judgment was rendered [must have] had a full and fair opportunity to ventilate the issues involved in the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. In this case, the statute of limitations question was thoroughly discussed upon Scoggins\u2019 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">. We recognize, as we did in <em>Barina, </em>726 F.2d at 563 n. 5, that other circuits have reached contrary conclusions and applied <em>DelCostello </em>retroactively. <em>Edwards v. Teamsters Local Union No. 36, McNaughton, </em>and <em>Barina, </em>however, establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>the law of this circuit and bind us. We also happen to agree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">. <em>Mitchell </em>applies only to suits against employers; it does not apply to suits against unions. <em>Barina, </em>726 F.2d at 562; <em>Edwards, </em>719 F.2d at 1039; <em>McNaughton v. Dillingham Corp., </em>707 F.2d 1042, 1047-48 (9th Cir.1983), <em>reh'g denied, </em>722 F.2d 1459 (9th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>52 U.S.L.W. 3829 (U.S. May 15, 1984) (No. 83-1739). Consequently, the statute of limitations applicable under <em>Mitchell </em>governs only Scoggins\u2019 action against Boeing; it does not govern his action against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">Scoggins also argues that <em>Mitchell </em>applies only where a final arbitration decision was rendered; Scoggins' grievance was withdrawn prior to arbitration and, consequently, Scoggins asserts <em>Mitchell </em>should not be applied even to his action against Boeing. This court, however, has previously rejected this argument. <em>McNaughton, </em>707 F.2d at 1046. <em>Mitchell </em>applies whether a grievance is withdrawn or goes to arbitration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">. In <em>Chevron Oil, </em>the Supreme Court listed three factors to be considered by courts when reviewing the issue of retroactivity: (1) whether the decision established a new principle of law; (2) whether retroactive application will retard or further the purposes of the rule in question; and (3) whether applying the new decision will produce substantial inequitable results. <em>Chevron Oil, </em>404 U.S. at 106-07, 92 S.Ct. at 355.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1330-13\">. In <em>Price v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co., </em>586 F.2d 750, 753 (9th Cir.1978), this court held that the statute of limitations for a suit against a union in California was three years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">. Scoggins also argues that the first factor\u2014 whether union officials are hostile to the employee \u2014 supports his position that exhaustion should not be required. Scoggins asserts that hostility should be inferred from a statement made by the union business representative who handled Scoggins' grievance; the representative told Scoggins that further pursuit of the grievance would be futile. Scoggins argues that this feeling of futility indicates hostility on the part of the entire union. However, \"[f]or there to be an adequate demonstration of hostility, it must appear that persons involved in the intraunion appeals procedure are hostile toward the union member____\" <em>Hayes v. Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; Airline Clerks/Allied Serv. Div., </em>734 F.2d 219, 220 (5th Cir.1984). <em>See also Varra v. Dillon Companies, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 1315, 1317 (10th Cir.1980). Scoggins failed to present any evidence to the District Court, and fails to present any evidence now, of any indication of hostility on the part of anyone in the union who would have acted on Scoggins' appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1331-15\">. On appeal, Scoggins argues that these documents should not have been considered by the District Court. He objects that they are improperly authenticated and contain hearsay statements. Scoggins, however, failed to object to the evidence in District Court. Consequently, Scoggins waived any objections to the evidence and the District Court properly considered it. <em>United States v. Dibble, </em>429 F.2d 598, 603 (9th Cir. 1970) (Wright, J., concurring); <em>Davis v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>708 F.2d 862, 864 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
