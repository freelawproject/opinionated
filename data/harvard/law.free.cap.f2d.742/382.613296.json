We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Plaintiff suffers from lung abscesses and bronchitis and has been diagnosed as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He applied for disability insurance benefits on May 28,1974, and was awarded benefits as of December 1973. The Social Security Administration terminated plaintiff\u2019s benefits effective November 1975 as a result of a continuing disability investigation. In December 1977, however, on review of that action, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) found that plaintiff\u2019s disability had been continuous from 1973 and ordered that his benefits be reinstated. Later, the Social Security Administration again investigated plaintiff\u2019s disability and terminated his benefits, effective April 1980. Plaintiff requested reconsideration and also applied for supplemental security income benefits. A formal hearing was held before another AU, who affirmed the termination in a written opinion dated October 6, 1981. This second AU found that plaintiff\u2019s condition had improved, that plaintiff no longer had a severe impairment, and that plaintiff could return to his former job as a furniture salesman (although he would occasionally be required to aid in lifting up to 300 pounds). The AU\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Secretary when the Appeals Council denied review. Plaintiff then brought this action for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">This case involves termination of benefits and is therefore governed by the standards set out in <em>Cassiday v. Schweiker, </em>663 F.2d 745 (7th Cir.1981). In <em>Cassiday, </em>we held that \u201conce having found a disability, the Secretary may not terminate the benefits without substantial evidence to justify so doing. This will normally consist of current evidence showing that a claimant has improved to the point of being able to engage in substantial gainful activity; but it might also consist of evidence that claimant\u2019s condition is not as serious as was at first supposed,\u201d 663 F.2d at 747 (quoting <em>Miranda v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, </em>514 F.2d 996, 998 (1st Cir.1975)). The Secretary\u2019s brief essentially treats this appeal as a review of a denial of an initial application for benefits and makes no reference to <em>Cassiday, </em>although plaintiff argues that the case is controlling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary does, however, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>elude with the contention that \u201csubstantial evidence [supports the finding that] plaintiffs condition has improved to the point where he is able to resume his past relevant work.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must, of course, uphold a decision of the Secretary that is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, unless there has been an error of law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). However, in this case we find that we are unable to affirm the decision of the Secretary even under this lenient standard of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In concluding that plaintiff\u2019s condition had improved, the AU who terminated plaintiff\u2019s benefits relied primarily on a reviewing physician\u2019s report, dated May 28, 1980, that states, \u201cCurrent spirometrie studies show that the claimant is not significantly restricted in his breathing capacity.\u201d The only clinical data cited in support of this conclusion is a pulmonary function study conducted on April 18, 1980. This study produced the following results shown as percentages of predicted normal values: <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">FEVj 51 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">FEV3 77 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">MW 86 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">Vital Capacity 84 percent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">An increase in these percentages over time would indicate an improvement in plaintiff\u2019s condition. But the percentages obtained in the 1980 tests had in fact decreased compared to the percentages obtained in tests relied on by the 1977 AU, who found that plaintiff\u2019s disability had remained continuous since his initial application for benefits. The results of those earlier tests are shown below, as they were in the record, as percentages of the volumes predicted for a healthy person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>FEVi 61 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">FEV3 83 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">MW 103 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">Vital Capacity 103 percent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Thus, the 1980 pulmonary function study cited by the reviewing physician provides no support for the Secretary\u2019s contention that plaintiff\u2019s condition had improved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">There are additional difficulties with the AU\u2019s reliance on the report that plaintiff\u2019s breathing capacity was not significantly restricted. First, the report is of uncertain origin and is initialed by a reviewing physician identified only as \u201cJ.R.\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, there is no evidence that \u201cJ.R.\u201d ever examined plaintiff. In contrast, one of plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians, Dr. Sorg, concluded that the 1980 pulmonary function tests \u201cindicate severe restrictive changes with obstructive changes and severe diffusion defect.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Sorg further reported that he expected no significant improvement in plaintiff\u2019s condition. Another physician, Dr. Fouts, who treated plaintiff in June 1981, determined that plaintiff suffered from \u201c[c]hronic air flow obstruction \u2014 moderately severe clinically\u201d and wrote in August 1981 that \u201cMr. Switz-er has been more symptomatic and unable to continue a normal life style.\u201d The determinations by both treating physicians that plaintiff continued to suffer from severe obstructive and diffusion defects were supported by specific laboratory and clinical findings. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1526. Indeed, the reviewing physician and Dr. Sorg based their conclusions on the same test measurements, which were unchallenged and indicated a deteriorating condition when compared with the earlier tests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The AU made no finding discounting either Dr. Sorg\u2019s or Dr. Fouts\u2019 credibility. <em>Whitney v. Schweiker, </em>695 F.2d 784, 789 (7th Cir.1982). We conclude that the reviewing physician\u2019s report that plaintiff\u2019s breathing was not significantly restricted does not provide substantial evidence of improvement in the face of contrary reports by two treating physicians that plaintiff\u2019s condition had remained severe. <em>See Carver v. Harris, </em>634 F.2d 363, 364 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Allen v. Weinberger, </em>552 F.2d 781, 786 (7th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">In support of her position that plaintiff no longer had a severe impairment, the Secretary cites a report by Dr. Sorg, not mentioned by the AU, that indicates that plaintiff could lift up to 20 pounds maximum. However, the Secretary totally ignores the very next line of the doctor\u2019s report, which states that plaintiff could not lift even 5 pounds frequently (defined as up to 10 times in an eight-hour day) and could do extended walking or standing for <em>zero </em>hours. This report is uncontradicted and the Secretary\u2019s attempt to use only the portions favorable to her position, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ignoring other parts, is improper. <em>Garfield v. Schweiker, </em>732 F.2d 605, 609 (7th Cir.1984); <em>Zblewski v. Schweiker, </em>732 F.2d 75, 78-79 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">We conclude that the Secretary has not met her burden of showing by substantial evidence on the record as a whole that plaintiff's condition had improved since he was granted benefits. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and direct the Secretary to reinstate plaintiffs benefits that were wrongfully terminated. <em>See Cassiday v. Schweiker, </em>663 F.2d 745, 750 (7th Cir.1981); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>See also Iida v. Heckler, </em>705 F.2d 363, 365 (9th Cir.1983). We further remand plaintiff\u2019s application for benefits under the supplemental security income program to the Secretary to determine whether, in light of this opinion, plaintiff satisfies the other statutory requirements for those benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\">. We note that the Secretary had announced in Social Security Ruling 82-49c that she did not \"acquiesce\" in and would not follow the holding of <em>Patti v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 582, 587 (9th Cir.1982), which requires the Secretary to come forward with evidence that a recipient\u2019s medical condition has improved before terminating benefits. Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district court injunction ordering the Secretary to restore benefits to a class consisting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>former social security recipients in the Ninth Circuit who were terminated without evidence that their conditions had improved. <em>Lopez v. Heckler, </em>725 F.2d 1489 (9th Cir.1984). Because the Secretary has made some effort, albeit minimal, to justify her decision under the standard set forth in <em>Cassiday v. Schweiker, </em>663 F.2d 745 (7th Cir.1981), we will not comment on her non-acquiescence policy. However, we remind counsel for the Secretary that they have professional obligations as officers of this court and may not, in presenting their position, simply ignore circuit precedent with which they or their client disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. In terminating benefits, the AU acknowledged the existence of plaintiff's earlier disability but found that it had ceased. The Secretary does not argue that plaintiff\u2019s condition was not as serious as was at first supposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. Pulmonary function tests are designed to provide an objective measurement of pulmonary disability. 9 <em>Am.Jur. Proof of Facts </em>649 (1961). FEV stands for \"forced expiratory volume.\u201d It is the volume of air that a person can breathe out during a fixed time period after taking a deep breath and blowing as hard as possible. D. Morton, <em>Medical Proof of Social Security Disability </em>\u00a7 2.4 at 79 (1983). FEV i and FEV 3 represent the volumes of air exhaled in one second and three seconds, respectively. 5A <em>Lawyers' Medical Cyclopedia of Personal Injuries and Allied Specialities </em>\u00a7 33.-63d at 90 (1972).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-15\">MW is an abbreviation for \u201cMaximum Voluntary Ventilation,\u201d and refers to the maximum amount of air that a person can breath in and out of the lungs in one minute. D. Morton, <em>supra, </em>at 78-79.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-16\">Vital Capacity refers to the total volume of air exhaled in one expiration after the patient is asked to inhale as fully as possible and exhale as completely as possible. 9 <em>Proof of Facts, supra, </em>at 653.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">Normal values for each of these measures can be determined based on a patient\u2019s age, height, weight and sex. 5A <em>Lawyers' Medical Cyclopedia, supra, </em>at 89-90; 9 <em>Proof of Facts, supra, </em>at 653. The numbers reported above in the text are the actual volumes measured in pulmonary function studies on plaintiff, divided by the volumes predicted for a healthy person with plaintiff\u2019s physical characteristics, multiplied by 100. Plaintiff took pulmonary function tests both before and after the administration of a broncho-dilator, a chemical agent that makes the bronchial tubes leading to the lungs open wider. <em>See discussion, </em>D. Morton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.4 at 79. In reporting the 1975 results, we have chosen the best values with or without the bronchodilator. In his decision in the instant appeal the ALJ relied on the 1980 study, which does not indicate whether a bronchodilator was administered. An earlier study indicated that a bronchodilator had a very minimal effect on plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\">. The AU also quoted from an x-ray evaluation in September 1980 which states that plaintiff's lungs are \"free of active disease compared to our last examination.\" We do not believe that this supports the AU\u2019s finding. A suggestion that plaintiffs condition had not gotten worse does not support a finding that it has gotten better. The report also states \"Impression: chronic obstructive lung disease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b493-13\">. It is uncertain who wrote this report because it also states that \"due process was afforded.\u201d This is not ordinarily considered to be a medical determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b493-14\">. A change is defined in pathology as a \"structural alteration of which the cause and significance is uncertain.\u201d W. Dornett, <em>Illustrated Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary, </em>258 (5th unabridged lawyer's ed. 1982). Diffusion refers to the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the thin membrane separating blood and air in the lungs. 5A <em>Lawyers\u2019 Medical Cyclopedia of Personal Injuries and Allied Specialities </em>\u00a7 33.63d at 89 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b493-17\">.
