Nimmo </em>(10 Cir. 1982), 695 F.2d 1251, we affirmed, with Judge. McKay dissenting, the judgment of the district court applying the defense of estoppel against the government. On June 4, 1984, the Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford County, Inc. </em>(Pa.1984) \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 5. Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 2673, 81 L.Ed.2d 870. The government has filed a motion for entry of judgment and Home Savings has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">In Community Health Services, reliance is based on the oral advice of a \u201cfiscal intermediary,\u201d Travelers Insurance Company. This advice was wrong. The Court held that there was no estoppel. In the Home Savings case estoppel was claimed because the Veterans Administration failed to advise Home Savings of a government defense of forgery. In Home Savings we analyzed the Supreme Court cases on estoppel against the government and held, supra, 695 F.2d at 1254, that: \u201cNone of the above mentioned cases rejecting estoppel against the government relate to facts comparable to those presented in the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">In Community Health Services, the Court said, \u2014 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 2224, that: \u201cPetitioner urges us to expand this principle into a flat rule that estoppel may not in any circumstances run against the Government. We have left the issue open in the past, and do so again today.\u201d It would be helpful if the Court would clarify the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">The opinion is withdrawn, the Judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court with instruction to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
