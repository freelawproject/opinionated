Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., </em>457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982); and <em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991,102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), in effect overruled this court\u2019s decision in <em>Braden v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>552 F.2d 948 (3d Cir.1977) <em>(in banc), </em>which held that the University of Pittsburgh (and by implication Temple Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>versity) are \u201cstate actors\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The district courts reached differing results. In <em>Krynicky </em>the district court concluded that the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy had undermined <em>Braden, </em>and held that, because the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had not participated with the University of Pittsburgh in making the faculty tenure decision challenged by Krynicky, the University\u2019s decision was not subject to the constraints of the fourteenth amendment. In <em>Schier </em>the district court reached the opposite result, holding that <em>Braden </em>was still controlling, and that the Commonwealth had so far insinuated itself into the operation of Temple University that the institution was subject to the mandates of the fourteenth amendment in connection with Schier\u2019s claim of retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Because we believe that <em>Braden </em>has not been overruled by the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy, we reverse in <em>Krynicky </em>and affirm in <em>Schier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">I. <em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">A. <em>Krynicky</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Harry Krynicky, an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh, brought suit against the University and various administrative officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he had a \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d interest in his employment contract within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment, and that the University infringed those interests when it failed to notify him in a timely fashion of its decision to deny him tenure. In addition, Krynicky alleged that the tenure process generally denied him due process, and that the decision to deny him tenure was made in retaliation for his outspoken criticism of the University administration and his unorthodox teaching methods.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The linchpin of Krynicky\u2019s claim for purposes of this appeal is that the University\u2019s actions were taken \u201cunder color of state law\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 because of the relationship between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">The University and the individual defendants moved for summary judgment, but did not contest the existence of state action in the motion. The district court granted the motions in part. 560 F.Supp. 803.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants then amended their answer to assert that there was no state action as required by \u00a7 1983, and again moved for summary judgment. The district court thereupon granted the motion as to the remaining claims, stating that the reasoning of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum </em>essentially superseded the Third Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Braden, </em>and that, therefore, <em>Braden </em>did not control. The court held that \u201cthe receipt of revenue from the state, membership of state nominees on the University\u2019s Board of Trustees, and statutory recognition that the University is part of the state\u2019s system of higher education are not sufficient to make the University\u2019s employment policies state decisions.\u201d <em>Krynicky v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>563 F.Supp. 788, 789 (W.D.Pa.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">B. <em>Schier</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">Rosemary Schier, who was an employee of Temple University Hospital from Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>tember 1979 through September 3, 1981, brought suit against the University alleging that during the course of her employment, she was discriminated against on grounds of her sex, and that her supervisor had sexually harassed her, had retaliated against her for having filed internal complaints, and had forced her to sign a resignation memorandum. Schier sought relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">At the close of discovery, Temple moved for summary judgment on all claims, asserting that the Title VII claim was time-barred and that Schier had not presented any facts to support her claim that Temple had acted under color of state law for the purposes of \u00a7 1983. The district court granted summary judgment on Schier\u2019s Title VII claim, but denied Temple\u2019s motion on the \u00a7 1983 claim, holding that, under the symbiotic relationship test for state action articulated in <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), the state had a sufficiently close relationship with Temple that actions taken by Temple were subject to constitutional scrutiny under section 1983. In reaching its decision, the district court considered the applicability of the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy to its decision, but concluded that <em>Blum </em>and <em>Rendell-Baker </em>did not overrule <em>Burton, </em>and that, therefore, the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Braden </em>was still good law. <em>Schier v. Temple University, </em>576 F.Supp. 1569 at 1578 (E.D.Pa.1984). However, recognizing that another district court in the circuit had reached the opposite result in the <em>Krynicky </em>case, the court certified for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) the question \u201cwhether, for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, acts performed by employees of a statutorily designated \u2018state-related\u2019 institution of higher education such as Temple University eonstitute \u2018state action.\u2019 \u201d We agreed to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">A. <em>The State Action Requirement and the State Action Tests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">The fifth and fourteenth amendments protect individuals only from governmental action. In order for Krynicky or Schier to benefit from these constitutional protections, they must show that the alleged violations of due process and freedom of speech are \u201cfairly attributable to the state.\u201d <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., </em>457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2754, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). The \u201cstate action requirement\u201d preserves \u201cindividual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power\u201d and avoids \u201cimposing on the state, its agencies or officials, responsibility for conduct for which they cannot fairly be blamed.\u201d <em>Lugar, </em>457 U.S. at 936, 102 S.Ct. at 2754.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The requirement of section 1983 that the challenged activity be taken \u201cunder color of state law\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has been treated as identical to the \u201cstate action\u201d element of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Lugar, </em>457 U.S. at 929, 102 S.Ct. at 2750; <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 152 n. 7, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1606 n. 7, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). What constitutes sufficient state participation to attribute activity to the state under section 1983 has proved to be an extremely difficult question. It has variously been characterized as \u201cmurky waters,\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Mountain Laurel Racing, Inc., </em>607 F.2d 589, 591 (3d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 956,100 S.Ct. 2927, 64 L.Ed.2d 814 (1980); \u201cobdurate,\u201d <em>Braden v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>552 F.2d 948, 955 (3d Cir. 1977); and a \u201cprotean concept,\u201d <em>Magill v. Avonworth Baseball Conference, </em>516 F.2d 1328, 1331 (3d Cir.1975) (quoting Lewis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201cThe Meaning of State Action,\u201d 60 Colum. L.Rev. 1083, 1085 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The Supreme Court to date has not developed a uniform test for ascertaining when state action exists and has stated that no such unitary test is possible. <em>Reitman v. Mulkey, </em>387 U.S. 369, 378, 87 S.Ct. 1627, 1632, 18 L.Ed.2d 830 (1967). Instead, the Court has adopted a number of approaches whose application depends upon the circumstances. The Court has suggested that lower courts investigate carefully the facts of each case. <em>Burton, </em>365 U.S. at 722, 81 S.Ct. at 860. Two of the approaches are relevant to these appeals: the \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d test and the \u201cnexus\u201d test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), the Supreme Court found state action where there was a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d between the acting party and the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court held that state action exists when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">The State has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with ... [the acting party] that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity, which, on that account, cannot be considered to have been so \u201cpurely private\u201d as to fall without the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 725, 81 S.Ct. at 862. In <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974), the Court held that state action may also exist when the state becomes sufficiently involved in the particular challenged activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court suggested that in considering the state action issue, the \u201cinquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action of the ... entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>419 U.S. at 351, 95 S.Ct. at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In <em>Braden v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>552 F.2d 948 (3d Cir.1977), we confronted the question whether the University of Pittsburgh acted under the color of state law with respect to a claim almost identical to that of Ms. Schier. We rejected Pitt\u2019s contention that <em>Jackson </em>had overruled <em>Burton, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">Based on a review of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jackson, </em>we believe that that decision would not preclude application of the precepts of <em>Burton </em>here, <em>should the appropriate state-private relationship exist. </em>Instead of overruling <em>Burton, </em>the <em>Jackson </em>Court merely distinguished the earlier opinion, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cabsent in [Jackson] the symbiotic relationship presented in <em>Burton ...\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAi\"><em>Braden, </em>552 F.2d at 957, citing <em>Jackson, </em>419 U.S. at 357, 95 S.Ct. at 456. Based on the provisions of University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act, Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 2510-201 to 211, we concluded that Pennsylvania had so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the University of Pittsburgh that there was a symbiotic relationship between the two, and we therefore held that the actions of the University could fairly be attributed to the state for purposes of satisfying the state action requirement of section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Unless <em>Braden </em>has been overruled by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Lugar </em>trilogy, it is binding precedent for the proposition that the University of Pittsburgh and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are involved in a \u201csymbiotic relationship,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore, that the actions of the University are actions taken under color of state law for purposes of section 1983. Moreover, since the Temple University-Commonwealth Act, which sets out the relationship between Temple and the State, is virtually identical to University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act, which was the basis for our conclusion in <em>Braden </em>that Pitt and the Commonwealth have a symbiotic relationship, there can be no doubt that, if <em>Braden </em>has not been overruled, it requires the conclusion that the actions of Temple, like Pitt, are actions taken under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Pitt and Temple make two arguments in support of their contention that <em>Braden </em>has been overruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">(1) the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy overruled or, at a minimum, limited <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority </em>to its facts, and therefore <em>Braden, </em>which relies on <em>Burton, </em>is no longer good law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-10\">(2) even if the symbiotic relationship test remains viable, the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy has clarified that test and, as a result, it is now clear that the Third Circuit in <em>Bra-den </em>misapplied <em>Burton </em>when it concluded that a symbiotic relationship existed between Pitt and the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">We consider these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">B. <em>The Impact of the Lugar Trilogy on </em>Burton<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">In <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982), teach\u00e9rs who were discharged from the New Perspectives School, a non-public school, because they had opposed school policies and threatened to form a union, brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of their constitutional rights under the first, fifth, and fourteenth amendments. The plaintiffs cited several factors that allegedly supported attribution of the New Perspectives School\u2019s actions to the state. First, the New Perspectives School, which specializes in dealing with students who have difficulty completing high school, receives nearly all its students from referrals by various city school committees or from a state drug rehabilitation program. Second, the referring school committee pays for the student\u2019s education; consequently, the school receives almost 100 percent of its funding from the state. Third, in order to receive the tuition funding, the school must comply with various regulations created by the State, including some general administrative guidelines on personnel policies such as the type of records that must be kept. <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 833, 102 S.Ct. at 2767.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">Despite the presence of these factors offered to support state action, the Supreme Court held that the actions of the New Perspectives School could not be attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to the state under \u00a7 1983. In reaching this determination, the <em>Rendell-Baker </em>Court first applied the nexus test of <em>Jackson </em>and determined that the state had not \u201ccompelled or even influenced by any state regulation\u201d the decision to fire the plaintiffs. <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>457 U.S. at 841, 102 S.Ct. at 2771. The Court then considered the assertion that the New Perspectives School met the symbiotic relationship test as set forth in <em>Burton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">In <em>Burton, </em>the Court held that the refusal of a restaurant located in a public parking garage to serve Negroes constituted state action. The Court stressed that the restaurant was located on public property and that the rent from the restaurant contributed to the support of the garage. <em>Burton, </em>[365 U.S.] at 723, 81 S.Ct., at 860. In response to the argument that the restaurant\u2019s profits, and hence the State\u2019s financial position, would suffer if it did not discriminate, the Court concluded that this showed that the State profited from the restaurant\u2019s discriminatory conduct. The Court viewed this as support for the conclusion that the State should be charged with the discriminatory actions. Here the school\u2019s fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government. No symbiotic relationship such as existed in <em>Burton </em>exists here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUb\"><em>Id. </em>457 U.S. at 842-43, 102 S.Ct. at 2772. After finding that the New Perspectives School failed the \u201cpublic function\u201d test as well, <em>id. </em>at 842, the Court held that there was no state action, and consequently that no claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 was stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), also involved a suit under section 1983. The plaintiffs alleged violations of due process in the decision of a \u201cUtility Review Committee\u201d of The American Nursing Home in New York City to transfer Medicaid patients from high-care to lower-care facilities pursuant to federal regulations. The Supreme Court once again utilized the nexus test and failed to find state action, stating that there was no evidence that the State had \u201cexercised coercive power or ... provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\u201d <em>Blum, </em>457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct. at 2786. The Court then applied the <em>Burton </em>symbiotic relationship test. It rejected the contention that state licensing and funding converts private action into state action, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">As we have previously held, privately owned enterprises providing services that the State would not necessarily provide, even though they are extensively regulated, do not fall within the ambit of <em>Burton. </em>That programs undertaken by the State result in substantial funding of the activities of a private entity is no more persuasive than the fact of regulation of such an entity in demonstrating that the State is responsible for decisions made by the entity in the course of its business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1011 (citations omitted). Finding that the American Nursing Home also failed to perform a function \u201ctraditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1011, citing <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. at 353, 95 S.Ct. at 454, the Court again concluded that there was no state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\"><em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., </em>the final member of the trilogy, did not have occasion to discuss the <em>Burton </em>symbiotic relationship test, and, therefore, that ease is not directly relevant to the present discussion. However, it is significant to note that the Court did cite <em>Burton </em>in a footnote in <em>Lugar </em>without giving any indication that it had been overruled. <em>See Lugar, </em>457 U.S. at 938 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. at 2754 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">As is apparent from the preceding discussion, the Supreme Court in the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy clearly treated the symbiotic relationship test as a viable framework of analysis, but concluded that <em>Burton </em>was inapposite to the factual scenarios of those cases. The only indicia of state involvement in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum </em>were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>financial assistance and routine state regulation. By comparison, in <em>Burton </em>the state was much more intertwined with the Eagle Coffee Shop: the shop was located in a state-owned building; the state maintained the facility and made all necessary repairs; and the coffee shop and the state conferred mutual benefits on each other because of their location. Thus, we reject Temple and Pitt\u2019s assertion that <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum </em>eliminate the <em>Burton </em>symbiotic relationship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">C. <em>The Impact of the Lugar Trilogy on Braden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Alternatively, Pitt and Temple argue that <em>Blum </em>and <em>Rendell-Baker </em>preclude the finding of a symbiotic relationship unless it can be shown that the state benefits financially from the activities of the defendant. Such a financial relationship was present in the <em>Burton </em>case, but was not proved in <em>Braden, </em>and was not, the defendants contend, demonstrated here. Thus, the defendants argue that although <em>Burton </em>may still be good law after the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy, <em>Braden </em>has implicitly been overruled and we should find that there is no symbiotic relationship in the cases of Pitt and Temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">It is true that the Supreme Court in <em>Blum </em>and <em>Rendell-Baker </em>focused on the financial relationship between the defendants and the State, but that was because the financial relationship was the only significant form of state influence over the defendants in those cases. The Court concluded that merely proving the existence of the limited type of financial relationship present in those cases was not sufficient to establish the requisite symbiotic relationship. By way of contrast, the Court in <em>Burton </em>emphasized the complete intermingling of state and private actions that were present in that case as grounds for its conclusion that a symbiotic relationship existed. The court referred to fact that the state-owned Parking Authority financially benefited from renting to the coffee shop, but the Court also emphasized that the coffee shop was located in a building owned and operated by the State. It is apparent from the opinion that this second factor is at least as important as the financial relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">The Commonwealth\u2019s interrelationship with Pitt and Temple in these cases is more closely analogous to the complete intermingling of state and private actors found in <em>Burton </em>than to the relatively minimal interrelationship between the State and the defendants in <em>Blum </em>and <em>Rendell-Baker. </em>An examination of the statutes that create and define the Commonwealth\u2019s relationship with Pitt and Temple demonstrates this fact. <em>Cf. </em>Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 2510-1 to 11 (Temple University-Commonwealth Act), Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 2510-201 to 211 (University of Pittsburgh-Commonwealth Act). Since the two statutes are virtually identical, we will refer specifically only to the University of Pittsburgh statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">To begin with, the statute was enacted to save the Commonwealth the expense of creating an additional state college.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the statute changes the name of the University of Pittsburgh to \u201cThe University of Pittsburgh \u2014 Of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education.\u201d Pa. Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-203 (Purdon 1966). Consonant with this linkage, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>declares it to be the purpose of the Act to extend the opportunities for higher education in the Commonwealth \u201cby establishing University of Pittsburgh as an <em>instrumentality </em>of the Commonwealth to serve as a State-related institution in the Commonwealth System of higher education.\u201d Pa. Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-202 (Purdon 1966) (emphasis added). This same section also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">That the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania recognizes University of Pittsburgh as an integral part of a system of higher education in Pennsylvania, and that it is desirable and in the public interest to perpetuate and extend the relationship between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and University of Pittsburgh for the purpose of improving and strengthening higher education by designating University of Pittsburgh as a State-related university.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-202 (Purdon 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The statute also furnishes the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of this linkage. It provides that one-third of the University\u2019s trustees are to be selected by the Commonwealth, Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-204(b) (Purdon 1966), and that the Governor of Pennsylvania, the Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, and the Superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction are trustees ex officio.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pa. Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-204(a) (Purdon 1966). The Act provides that the Commonwealth will make annual appropriations to the University, to be used as specified by the state, and that the appropriated funds must be kept in a specific account. Pa. Stat.Ann. tit. 4, \u00a7 2510-207 (1966).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state may further set tuition and fee schedules for Pennsylvania students in the annual appropriation act. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-206 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The Act also mandates that the University \u201cfile with the General Assembly and with the Auditor General of the Commonwealth, a statement setting forth the amounts and purposes of all expenditures made from both the Commonwealth Appropriation Account and other University accounts during the fiscal year.\u201d Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-207 (Purdon 1966). The statute entitles the University to benefit from all Commonwealth programs for capital development, Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-208 (Purdon 1968), and creates a state tax exemption for income derived from bonds issued by the University and loans secured by its mortgages. Pa.Stat. Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-209 (Purdon 1966). Finally, the Chancellor of the University must file annually a report of all University activities, \u201cinstructional, administrative and financial,\u201d with the Board of Trustees who \u201cshall transmit [the report] to the Governor and to the members of the General Assembly.\u201d Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-210 (Purdon 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">The logic of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum </em>is that state contributions to otherwise private entities, no matter how great those contributions may be, will not of themselves transform a private actor into a state actor. In the cases of Pitt and Temple, to the contrary, the issue is not whether the level of state contributions has reached a magic figure necessary to effect this transformation, but rather the affirmative state act of statutorily accepting responsibility for these institutions. This fact, above all, marks the difference between these two institutions and those discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>RendellBaker </em>and <em>Blum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">In addition, unlike the school in <em>RendellBaker </em>and the nursing home in <em>Blum, </em>Temple and Pitt are not merely private contractors with the state. Not only do they receive present financial support, but also the state has committed itself to future financial aid and sets an annual appropriation policy and tuition rate. There is nothing to indicate that the state could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>discontinue its support of the New Perspectives School or the American Nursing Home at any time by the simple means of not renewing their contracts. By contrast, it would require a legislative enactment to disentangle Temple and Pitt from the Commonwealth, and the idea that legislative appropriations to these institutions might be severely curtailed is unrealistic. <em>Cf </em>Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510(b). Furthermore, neither of the institutions in <em>RendellBaker </em>or <em>Blum </em>had to submit to state-sponsored audits or make yearly reports to the State Assembly. Finally, unlike the institutions in <em>Blum </em>and <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>one-third of the Trustees of Pitt and Temple are now appointed by the state. Temple and Pitt are not merely \u201cprivate constractors performing services for the government,\u201d <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>457 U.S. at 843, 102 S.Ct. at 2772; they not only receive funding and are subject to routine state regulations, but are instrumentalities of the state, both in name and in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In sum, we see nothing in either <em>Blum </em>or <em>Rendell-Baker </em>that conflicts with <em>Braden </em>or its rationale, and, therefore, we conclude that the Supreme Court did not overrule our decision in Braden.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"Afz\">We hold that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in the so-called <em>Lugar </em>trilogy do not overrule either the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority </em>or our opinion in <em>Bra-den v. University of Pittsburgh. </em>Therefore, we are bound by Third Circuit precedent to hold that a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d exists between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on the one hand and Pitt and Temple on the other. Actions taken by those two institutions are, therefore, actions taken under color of state law and are subject to scrutiny under section 1983. Consequently, we will reverse the judgment of the district court in <em>Krynicky v. University of Pittsburgh </em>and affirm the judgment of the district court in <em>Schier v. Temple University, </em>and will remand both cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">. -Krynicky asserted several pendent state law claims along with his \u00a7 1983 claims. These included breach of contract, intentional interference with a contractual relationship, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. With respect to the due process claims under \u00a7 1983, defendants asserted that the University had provided Krynicky with complete procedural due process prior to the challenged employment decisions and that, furthermore, as a matter of law, Krynicky had no \"property or liberty\" right in continued employment at the University. With respect to the first amendment claim under \u00a7 1983, they asserted that it was barred by the applicable statute of limitation. The district court granted the motion as to the due process claim but denied it as to the first amendment claim, stating that the cause of action was not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">With respect to the state-law claims, the defendants asserted that under University regulations, Krynicky had received notice within the specified time period and had failed to exhaust all internal University procedures and remedies before filing the suit. They also asserted that the emotional distress claims were time-barred. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion on these two claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b205-5\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. The other tests are the \"public function\" test and the \"state compulsion\u201d test. \"Public function\u201d analysis has been applied in three different situations: first, when the government, after performing a particular function, attempts to avoid its constitutional obligations by transfering the function to a private entity, <em>see Evans v. Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966); second, in cases involving the exercise of powers, such as the supervision of elections that are almost always carried out by government, <em>see Terry v. Adams, </em>345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953); and third, in the first amendment context to determine if private property is the functional equivalent of a municipality. <em>Marsh v. Alabama, </em>326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946). The \"state compulsion\u201d analysis has been used in cases where the state, by its law, has compelled a particular act, <em>see, e.g., Adickes v. S.H, Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 170, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1615, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Peterson v.

In <em>Burton, </em>plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that the Wilmington Parking Authority, a state entity, was responsible for the racially discriminatory practices of a privately owned coffee shop located in a building owned by the authority. In the lease between the coffee shop and the Authority, the shop had agreed to abide by all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations of any federal, state, or municipal authority. The Authority, in turn, agreed to provide all maintenance and upkeep of the premises and to make any necessary structural or exterior repairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b206-12\">. <em>Jackson </em>concerned a privately owned and operated utility. The plaintiff, a customer, alleged a violation of due process when the utility terminated her electric service without notice, a hearing, or any opportunity to pay the past due amounts. In the particular case, the Supreme Court held that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was not sufficiently involved in the particular challenged activity to convert it into state action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">. The statute analyzed in <em>Braden </em>continues in effect at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\">. In <em>Community Medical Center v. Emergency Medical Services of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Inc., </em>712 F.2d 878 (3d Cir.1983), which was decided subsequent to the <em>Lugar </em>trilogy, we stated that <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum </em>treat <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Burton </em>as viable frameworks of analysis. However, inasmuch as this statement was arguably dictum because the challenged entity in <em>Community Medical Center </em>failed every test for state action, we must reach the question, fairly presented by the contentions of Pitt and Temple in this case, whether <em>Burton, </em>which undergirds <em>Braden, </em>is still a viable framework of analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">. As we stated in <em>Braden:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">[P]rior to adoption of the Act, the University desparately needed a source of funds to maintain its operations. The situation was described by Pitt officials and trustees as grave. At the same time, the Commonwealth desired to satisfy the needs of the populace for expanded facilities for higher education. As the existing state educational institutions were insufficient-to satisfy the public demand, and because the creation of new state universities would have been extremely expensive, the decision was made to incorporate established, but financially ailing private institutions into the Commonwealth-system of higher education. The state thus was able to satisfy the educational needs of its citizens at a cost considerably lower than would have been entailed by the creation of wholly <em>new </em>institutions. Concomitantly, Pitt was able to survive as an institution of higher education, even though it may have been forced to relinquish its traditional autonomy as a private facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-15\"><em>Braden, 552 </em>F.2d at 961 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. In the Temple statute, the Mayor of Philadelphia, rather than the Mayor of Pittsburgh, is an ex officio trustee. Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 24, \u00a7 2510-4(a) (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b210-12\">. For example, for the fiscal year July, 1982 through June, 1983, the General Assembly appropriated $78,235,000 to the University of Pittsburgh.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">. Temple and Pitt also argue that, under state law precedent, the state courts have declared them to be private entities despite their statutory relationship with the state. In support of this contention, they cite <em>Mooney v. Board of Trustees of Temple University of Commonwealth System of Higher Educ., </em>448 Pa. 424, 292 A.2d 395 (1972), a case decided five years before <em>Braden, </em>which held that the Temple University-Commonwealth Act did not convert Temple into a public agency for the purposes of the Pennsylvania Inspection and Copying Records Act. <em>Mooney, </em>however, is inapposite to this case. The <em>Mooney </em>court specifically stated that the statute in question did not \u201ctransform Temple into a state agency <em>for purposes of </em>the Inspection and Copying Records Act.\u201d <em>Mooney, </em>448 Pa. at 434, 292 A.2d at 401 (emphasis added). Its determination, therefore, only governs cases involving that Act. More importantly, a state court construction of a state statute has no bearing on whether an entity that is connected with the state is a \u201cstate actor\u201d for purposes of the fourteenth amendment and \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Temple also argues that this court recognized the authoritativeness of <em>Mooney </em>in <em>Philadelphia National Bank v. United States, </em>666 F.2d 834 (3d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1105, 102 S.Ct. 2904, 73 L.Ed.2d 1314 (1982), where we held that Temple was not an \"agency\u201d of the Commonwealth for the purposes of \u00a7 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a)(1) (1976). While it is true that we considered <em>Mooney </em>in our analysis, we specifically noted the distinction between what constitutes a \"state agency\" and what constitutes \"state action\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">On the other hand, such cases as <em>Henderson v. Fisher, </em>631 F.2d 1115 (3d Cir.1980); <em>Braden v. University of Pittsburgh, </em>552 F.2d 948 (3d Cir.1977); and <em>Isaacs v. Board of Trustees of Temple University</em>\u2014of <em>the Commonwealth System of Higher Education, </em>385 F.Supp. 473 (E.D.Pa.1974), which explore whether activities of state-related universities are \u201cstate action\u201d within the ambit of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, are of little assistance here. In those cases, the issue was whether a sufficient symbiotic relationship existed between the school and the Commonwealth so that there was liability for civil rights violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-12\"><em>Philadelphia National Bank, </em>666 F.2d at 839.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
