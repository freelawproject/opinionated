A panel of this court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal on summary judgment. <em>See Harris v. Forsyth, </em>735 F.2d 1235 (11th Cir.1984). Subsequently, appellees timely filed a bill of costs requesting the entry of an order taxing costs in the amount of $38. On June 20, 1984, appellees\u2019 request was returned from the clerk\u2019s office unacted upon. An accompanying form contained the following explanatory postscript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-27\">In an appeal that this court affirms, costs cannot be recovered form [sic] an appellant proceeding in forma pauperis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJa2\">On June 28, 1984, appellees filed a motion for reconsideration of their request for costs. The issue presented here is whether costs can be assessed pursuant to Fed.R. App.P. 39(a) against an unsuccessful appellant proceeding in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-30\">No case has been found which has awarded costs under Rule 39(a) against an appellant proceeding in forma pauperis. At least one appellate court, however, has upheld a district court\u2019s award of costs under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) under the abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>See Flint v. Haynes, </em>651 F.2d 970 (4th Cir.1981). The <em>Flint </em>court relied upon its examination of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) and (e). Subsection (a) provides that \u201cAny court of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>States may authorize the commencement ... of any suit ... or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs____\u201d Subsection (e) provides that \u201cJudgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit or action as in other cases____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATH\">The court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiQj\">[t]he use of the word \u201cprepayment\u201d in subsection (a) indicates that Congress did not intend to waive forever the payment of costs, but rather it intended to allow qualified litigants to proceed without having to advance the fees and costs associated with the litigation. By permitting the court to enter judgment for costs \u201cas in other cases,\u201d subsection (e) evinces a congressional intent that litigants may eventually be liable for costs. It is clear that section 1915 contemplates the postponement of fees and costs for litigants who are granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">651 F.2d at 972 (footnote omitted). Because the statute refers to \u201cany suit <em>... or appeal,\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) (emp. added), it would seem that the <em>Flint </em>court\u2019s reasoning would apply with equal force to costs under Rule 39(a), and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-8\">However, we disagree with appellees\u2019 contention that costs <em>must </em>be assessed against Harris. The decision to enter judgment for costs is clearly discretionary. Indeed, the <em>Flint </em>court expressly acknowledged that \u201ca court, consistent with the discretion vested in it by section 1915(e), may choose not to tax costs against an indigent.\u201d 651 F.2d at 972 n. 5. Thus, even though costs may be assessed against an indigent, it would, nonetheless, be within our discretion to deny appellees\u2019 motion to tax costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">Having determined that the award of costs of appeal against an indigent is within the appellate court\u2019s sound discretion, we must now articulate some standard to guide this exercise of discretion. In our view, an appellate court\u2019s discretion to award costs against an indigent should not be limited to frivolous appeals. We reach this conclusion for two reasons. First, leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal will be denied if the appeal is not brought in good faith. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). Thus, if we were to award costs only in cases where the appeal was utterly lacking in merit or brought in bad faith,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our holding that costs may be taxed against indigents would be greatly undermined: only in those instances in which the court declined to certify that the appeal is not taken in good faith and the appeal in fact turned out to be frivolous would costs be recoverable. Second, as the Fourth Circuit explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-12\">when costs are assessed only in extreme or exceptional cases, those persons granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis have virtually \u201cnothing to lose and everything to gain,\u201d [] and the purpose of \u00a7 1915 \u2014 equal access for the poor and the rich \u2014 is distorted. Non-indigents who contemplate litigation are routinely forced to decide whether their claim is \u201cworth it.\u201d [ ] We see no reason to treat indigents differently in this respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-13\"><em>Flint, supra, </em>651 F.2d at 973 (footnotes omitted). We therefore hold that a court has discretion to award costs against indigents \u201cas in other cases.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-14\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we conclude that appellees\u2019 motion to tax costs in the amount of $38 for printing ten copies of appellees\u2019 brief at $.20 per page should be granted. Rule 39(c) states that the costs of all \u201cnecessary copies of briefs\u201d shall be taxable. The question becomes, then, whether ten copies are \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of 39(c). Although Local Rule 22(e) requires that only seven copies of briefs be filed, 11th Cir. Rule 22(e), Local Rule 28 permits costs for up to 15 briefs to be taxed, 11th Cir. Rule 28. It would seem that, in addition to the seven copies that must be filed, appellees would need to keep some copies for themselves. Therefore, the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>printing ten briefs at $.20 per page is allowable as costs under Rule 39(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-4\">Appellees\u2019 motion to tax costs is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">. <em>Cf.
