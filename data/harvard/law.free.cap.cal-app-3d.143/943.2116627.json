(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1506.) We first considered this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>appeal and reversed the order. <em>(In re Duarte </em>(3 Crim. 11235, Jan. 11, 1982).) Hearing was granted (Supreme Ct. No. 22527, Mar. 17, 1982) and the matter was returned to this court for reconsideration in light of <em>In re Stanworth </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 176 [187 Cal.Rptr. 783, 654 P.2d 1311].</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Upon reconsideration, we conclude <em>Stanworth </em>resolves the question of how petitioner\u2019s parole release date is to be determined, the topic of our previous opinion, but does not address the more narrow issue of how petitioner\u2019s initial <em>suitability </em>for parole is to be determined. Having reexamined this issue, we have determined our prior opinon nonetheless reached the correct result. We shall therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On January 6, 1969, Patrick Duarte robbed a gas station and repeatedly shot the attendant because of the small amount of money available. He was convicted of first degree murder and first degree robbery and was sentenced to life in prison. His minimum eligible parole date was February 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">While serving his prison term, Duarte was convicted on October 26,1978, in San Bernardino County Superior Court of assault on a correctional officer and sentenced to a concurrent term of 16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">In February 1979 and 1980, Duarte\u2019s suitability for parole was evaluated in accordance with guidelines set forth in California Administrative Code, title 15, section 2281. He was found unsuitable as posing an unreasonable risk of danger to society by reason of his violent history, his serious and continuing misconduct in prison (having been found responsible for 37 disciplinary infractions), and psychiatric diagnoses of an antisocial personality disorder and drug dependence on barbiturates.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Duarte then brought the instant petition alleging that at the time of his crime the indeterminate sentencing law (ISL) was in effect, but that at his parole hearing in 1980 his suitability for parole was judged under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) regulations, enacted after his incarceration. While conceding he may have been found unsuitable for parole under the former ISL regulations, petitioner contends the exclusive application of the DSL regulations constitutes an ex post facto law, and a denial of equal protection. He asserts he will eventually be found suitable for parole and is therefore entitled to annual hearings pursuant to both sets of rules, and application of the earliest of the two parole release dates. That was the order of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>It is now established that petitioner, when eligible for parole, will be entitled to have his parole release date determined pursuant to both the regulations in effect under the ISL and the current DSL guidelines, and be given the earlier of the two dates. <em>(In re Stanworth </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 176, 188 [187 Cal.Rptr. 783, 654 P.2d 1311].) <em>Stanworth, </em>however, considered only the two sets of regulations as they applied to a prisoner\u2019s parole release date. That case did not involve the question of which regulations apply in making the initial determination of whether the prisoner is suitable for parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having reexamined this question in light of Stanworth''s discussion of ex post facto laws, we conclude exclusive application of the DSL regulations governing suitability for parole to Duarte constitutes neither an ex post facto law nor a denial of equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Both the United States Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; art. I, \u00a7 10) and the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 9) prohibit the enactment of an ex post facto law. \u201cIn general, \u2018any law which was passed after the commission of the offense for which the party is being tried is an <em>ex post facto </em>law, when it inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime at the time it was committed [citations]; or which alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage. . . .\u2019 <em>(Exparte Medley, Petitioner, </em>134 U.S. 160, 171 [10 S.Ct. 384, 33 L.Ed. 835].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 702, 707 [328 P.2d <em>777, </em>76 A.L.R.2d 911], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 631, 637, fn. 2, 649 [36 Cal.Rptr. 201, 388 P.2d 33, 12 A.L.R.3d 810].) \u201cCritical to relief under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is not an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated. Thus, even if a statute merely alters penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.\u201d (We<em>aver </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 24, 30-31 [67 L.Ed.2d 17, 24, 101 S.Ct. 960].)  There was a retrospective application of the DSL guidelines to Duarte and the issue before us is whether the DSL parole suitability guidelines are \u201cmore onerous\u201d than the ISL guidelines or have altered Duarte\u2019s situation to his disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">At the time Duarte committed his offenses the power to determine a prisoner\u2019s suitability for parole was \u201cvested in the Adult Authority. [Citation.] While a prisoner eligible for parole has the right to apply therefor and to have his application duly considered, he has no right to a parole at any fixed time, or at all; the decision to grant or deny parole is committed entirely to the judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>and discretion of the Adult Authority. [Citations.] \u2018In determining whether the privilege of parole shall be granted a prisoner, that authority is not guided solely by the good conduct of the prisoner while incarcerated. The nature of his offense, his age, his prior associations, his habits, inclinations and traits of character, the probability of his reformation and the interests of public security are all taken into consideration.\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Schoengarth </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 295, 300 [57 Cal.Rptr. 600, 425 P.2d 200].) \u201cThe exercise of this discretion involves the deliberate assessment of a wide array of individualized factors on a case-by-case basis, and the striking of a balance between the interests of the inmate and of the public.\u201d <em>(In re Fain </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 376, 389 [135 Cal.Rptr. 543].) Until 1976, no formal regulations were established to guide the exercise of the Adult Authority\u2019s discretion. As one commentator noted, this \u201c[a]bsence of formal criteria together with lack of written reasons for decisions and the unilateral nature of most decisions result in a completely discretionary and therefore possibly arbitrary decision process.\u201d (Comment, <em>The California Adult Authority\u2014Administrative Sentencing and the Parole Decision as a Problem in Administrative Discretion </em>(1972) 5 U.C. Davis L.Rev. 360, 373-375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Partially in response to this situation, regulations were promulgated in 1976 in title 15 of the California Administrative Code. These parole board rules (hereinafter PBR) were relatively short-lived, being superseded by DSL regulations, the Board of Prison Terms rules (hereinafter BPT), in 1978.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The PBR were somewhat limited in their consideration of a prisoner\u2019s suitability for parole. They provided that at a prisoner\u2019s initial parole hearing, an inmate could be found unsuitable if \u201cin the opinion of the hearing panel an unreasonable risk of danger to society would be posed by release.\u201d (PBR \u00a7 2300.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parole board was given examples of types of factors that could be considered in determining unsuitability. (PBR \u00a7 2031.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If parole was denied, the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>could inform the prisoner what he might do to increase his chances of parole, and was required to give him a written statement of reasons for the denial. (PBR \u00a7 2300.) The inmate was then entitled to subsequent reviews every one or two years. (PBR \u00a7 2304, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">It is apparent from these regulations the discretion of the Community Release Board was not greatly diminished by the PBR rules. An inmate could be denied parole if his release posed an \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to society\u201d and the board was given only <em>examples </em>of factors to consider, such as a history of violent or sexual attacks on others. (PBR \u00a7\u00a7 2300, 2301.) The factors previously used in determining suitability for parole remained relevant criteria under the PBR. The question of suitability was still an individualized balancing of the interests of the inmate and the public. <em>(In re Fain, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d at p. 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Upon passage of the DSL, new parole regulations were promulgated which, inter alia, set a longer range of base terms for first degree murder and required the imposition of certain sentence enhancements. The goal was to achieve uniformity of sentences and stress the criminal activities of the inmate rather than social or personal factors. <em>(In re Stanworth, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 186.) These changes, however, were primarily concerned with the inmate\u2019s parole release date. Regarding an inmate\u2019s suitability for parole, the Legislature left a \u201cconsideration of the public safety\u201d as the fundamental criterion in assessing suitability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In implementing this legislative directive, the Board of Prison Terms followed the same procedure as existed under the PRB. At the life prisoner\u2019s initial parole hearing, the board must first determine the prisoner\u2019s suitability for parole. The prisoner is unsuitable if \u201cin the judgment of the panel the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison.\u201d (BPT \u00a7 2281, subd. (a).) This risk of danger to society is to be assessed in light of \u201c[a]ll relevant, reliable information available to the panel . . . .\u201d (BPT 2281, subd. (b).) This includes the prisoner\u2019s social history, mental state, criminal history, present offenses, and behavior after the crime. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>panel is given a list of factors which tend to indicate either suitability or unsuitability for parole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Upon making a determination on suitability, if parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>status is denied the prisoner must be given a written statement of \u201cthe panel\u2019s reasons . . . , activities which might be of benefit during imprisonment, and when the prisoner can expect to have another parole consideration hearing.\u201d (BPT \u00a7 2268.) The subsequent hearing can be \u201cno sooner than 12 months and no later than 14 months following any parole consideration hearing at which parole was denied.\u201d (BPT \u00a7 2270, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In comparing these regulations, similarity is immediately apparent. <em>In re Stanworth </em>recognized, <em>\u201c[u]nder both </em>the 1976 and the current <em>rules, a life prisoner must first be found suitable for parole before a parole date is set. </em>\u201d <em>(In re Stanworth, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 183; italics added.) Under both sets of rules the parole suitability decision involves a case-by-case analysis of all relevant factors, the basic criteria being whether the prisoner\u2019s release creates an \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to society.\u201d (BPT \u00a7 2281, subd. (a); PRB \u00a7 2300.) While the current regulations specify in much greater detail the criteria to be examined in determining suitability, both sets of regulations contemplate a consideration of <em>all </em>relevant information, and the factors mentioned are merely <em>examples. </em>(BPT \u00a7 2281, subds. (b), (c); PBR \u00a7 2301.) This must be compared with the disparity in the regulations regarding parole release dates, where the BPT rules reflected a change in penal philosophy through a generalized increase in terms of imprisonment, focusing on a prisoner\u2019s crimes, rather than his progress toward rehabilitation. <em>(In re Stanworth, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 185-187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">As to the parole suitability provisions, there has been neither a change in philosophy, nor a change in the criteria used to reach a decision. The only substantive changes we perceive in the regulations are: (1) under the BPT rules a written decision\u2018to deny parole must now include suggestions for increasing the chance of parole, and the expected date of the next hearing (BPT \u00a7 2268) as well as the reasons for the denial (in PBR \u00a7 2300 the suggestions for improvements were optional); and (2) under the PBR the subsequent parole suitability hearing could be held between 12 and 24 months after a denial (PBR \u00a7 2304, subd. (a)), whereas under the PBT the hearing must be held within 12 to 14 months (BPT \u00a7 2270, subd. (c)). These changes can in no way be said to work to the \u201cdisadvantage,\u201d or be \u201cmore onerous\u201d on an ISL life prisoner such as Duarte. If anything, use of the BPT rules works to the prisoner\u2019s benefit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>We conclude the relevant criteria in determining suitability for parole have remained substantially unchanged in the two sets of regulations and that any changes in the new regulations have been to the petitioner\u2019s advantage. The First District Court of Appeal recently reached the same conclusion. In <em>In re Seabock </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 29 [189 Cal.Rptr. 310) (hg. den.), the court stated, \u201c[i]t cannot be said that Seabock could be disadvantaged by application of the DSL guidelines to him; these newer regulations do not in any way decrease his parole eligibility or chance therefor.\u201d (P. 40.) We concur in that court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe standards for determining suitability for parole have not been altered under the DSL. The criteria utilized under the ISL as developed through practice and as modified by case law were not altered by the DSL.\u201d (P. 41.) Petitioner Duarte\u2019s ex post facto claim must fail as the law has not been changed to his disadvantage or become more onerous. Nor are we persuaded by his equal protection argument. If identical treatment is accorded <em>all </em>life prisoners, whether ISL or DSL, any claim of disparate treatment based on the date of the inmate\u2019s offense is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We therefore conclude the trial court erred in finding Duarte was \u201cconstitutionally entitled to an <em>immediate parole release hearing </em>pursuant\u201d to both the ISL and DSL regulations. (Italics added.) Relying on his record of violence, his serious misconduct in prison, and a diagnosed psychopathology related to his criminal behavior, the Board of Prison Terms found Duarte unsuitable for parole and made specific recommendations which would increase his chances of obtaining parole. The criteria used by the board were the same criteria that would have been used under the PBR regulations. Duarte is not entitled to a parole release hearing until he is found to be suitable for parole. Exclusive application of the present BPT guidelines in determining his suitability for parole constituted neither an ex post facto violation nor a denial of equal protection as there has been no change in the law in this respect. Petitioner is correct that when and if he is found suitable for parole he is entitled to have his parole release date set under both the former PRB and present BPT regulations and receive the earlier of the two dates. <em>(In re Stanworth, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 176.) Until this initial threshold of parole suitability is crossed, however, the trial court erred in ordering petitioner a <em>Stanworth </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The order granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Regan, Acting P. J., and Evans, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-10\">The court\u2019s order recited: \u201cOn both ex post facto and equal protection grounds, petitioner is constitutionally entitled to an immediate parole release hearing pursuant to the standards of punishment in effect under the Indeterminate Sentence Law as well as the Determinate Sentence Law, and annual hearings thereafter, and to have a parole release date fixed pursuant to whichever release date provides the lesser period of prison confinement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Stanworth had been found parole-ready in 1979. <em>(In re Stanworth, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 179.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">While we find it interesting that petitioner asks us to compare two sets of rules which were both passed considerably after the date of the commission of his offenses, we are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition \u201cthat these regulations offer a convenient means by which to compare the implementation of parole standards under each statutory scheme.\u201d <em>(In re Stanworth, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 183.) We must confess to being perplexed, however, over what regulations we should compare had there been <em>more </em>than two sets enacted since Duarte\u2019s conviction. We are fortunate the field of choice was so conveniently limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">PBR section 2300 provided: \u201cThe first step in considering an inmate for parole is to determine whether he is suitable for release on parole. An inmate is unsuitable for release on parole and will be denied parole if in the opinion of the hearing panel an unreasonable risk of danger to society would be posed by release. Before an inmate is denied parole for unsuitability, the hearing panel should consider any conditions of treatment or control under which the inmate could safely be released to the community, including the use of special conditions (see \u00a7 2478). If parole is denied, the hearing panel may recommend to the inmate what steps may be undertaken to enhance the possibility of a grant of parole at a future hearing. In all cases where parole is denied, a definitive list of the specific, factual reasons for denying parole will be given the inmate in writing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">PBR section 2301 provided: \u201cExamples of factors which will be considered in determining whether an inmate is unsuitable for release on parole include: [f] (a) History of violent attacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>on others, [f] (b) History of forcible sexual attacks on others.
