D.), J .</author>\n<p id=\"AEm\">In this original proceeding for habeas corpus relief, we set aside petitioner Darrel Wade Darr\u2019s 1978 conviction of first degree murder with use of a deadly weapon. We find that defense counsel\u2019s simultaneous representation of a key prosecution witness constituted an actual conflict of interest which denied petitioner his right to effective assistance of counsel. We also agree with petitioner\u2019s contention that under the circumstances of this case the trial court had a duty to inquire <em>sua sponte </em>into the possibility of conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">This matter previously was before us on direct appeal. (5 Crim. 4192.) In that proceeding we rejected Darr\u2019s contention that he had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free counsel and concluded that the record on appeal did not show as a demonstrable reality a conflict which denied Darr effective representation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Thereafter, Darr filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in Stanislaus County Superior Court, raising the conflict issue and seeking an order setting aside the judgment. After an evidentiary hearing on an order to show cause before the trial judge, the requested relief was denied. The trial court concluded that \u201c. . . Darr was not deprived of a meaningful defense nor did [counsel\u2019s] prior representation of [the witness] in any way affect the quality or vigor of [counsel\u2019s] representation of Darr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Darr then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this court, raising the identical claim of conflict rejected by the superior court. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 10; see <em>In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 873-874 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1].) An order to show cause issued and certified copies of all pleadings, exhibits and declarations filed ,in the superior court habeas corpus proceeding were filed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Paul Larry was stabbed to death about 10:30 p.m. on April 11, 1978. The assailant inflicted 10 wounds with a very sharp double-edged knife, such as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>stiletto, with a blade approximately 8 inches long. The pathologist testified that Larry might have survived 10 to 15 minutes and could have walked some distance after the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Passersby discovered Larry\u2019s body near the intersection of South and Colorado Avenues in Modesto about one-half block from Larry\u2019s home. A sheriff\u2019s detective followed a trail of blood along Colorado for 106 feet to where blood and disturbed gravel indicated a struggle. No weapon was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Adrian Bergaria met decedent, whom she knew from school, outside her house one block from the intersection of South and Colorado Avenues between 9 and 9:30 p.m. Bergaria exchanged greetings with Larry, who said he was going home; he was walking toward Colorado Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In August the police obtained information leading to Darr\u2019s arrest from Charles Allen Fielder. Fielder testified he had known petitioner Darr for \u201c[a]t least five years.\u201d On April 11, 1978, about 10:30 in the morning, he and Darr went fishing. While they were fishing, Darr \u201cacted kind of hyperactive [and] didn\u2019t want to set [szc] down.\u201d Darr spontaneously remarked that \u201che was foolish enough and stupid enough to do something to somebody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Darr drove Fielder home in Darr\u2019s car, an Opel, at approximately 5 p.m. They arranged to go out together again that evening. Darr picked up Fielder at 6:30 p.m., and they drove to several locations where they drank beer and smoked a \u201cjoint.\u201d Darr volunteered that he was \u201cfoolish enough and stupid enough to get Paul Larry\u201d; Darr also mentioned he believed Larry had been having an affair with Darr\u2019s girl friend. Fielder testified he had met Larry only twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Eventually, Darr and Fielder went to a place on the river known as the \u201cdust bowl,\u201d which is a dirt track for motorcycles. Fielder testified they arrived about 9:15 p.m. and no one else was around. Fielder was tired of sitting and walked down to the river with more beer. He then heard a car engine being started and shifted into gear. Assuming Darr had left, Fielder stayed by the river until about 11 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">When Fielder walked up the riverbank, Darr\u2019s car was there and Darr was inside, asleep in the driver\u2019s seat, with a sleeping bag over him. Fielder also went to sleep in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Earlier that day, Fielder had seen Darr with two knives which Darr kept in the glove box and took out while fishing. One was white with a blade that pulled open; the other was a black-handled switchblade or stiletto with a blade seven to eight inches long.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The following morning, Fielder noticed Darr was wearing a T-shirt; he had been wearing a purple dress shirt the previous evening. Darr had blood on his hands. Fielder did not see either of the knives that morning. As Darr was driving Fielder home, he told Fielder that \u201c \u2018if anybody asked about any knife, tell them that we lost them. \u2019 \u201d Darr further stated, \u201c \u2018If anybody asks where we were, we were night fishing all night long.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Later the same morning, Darr telephoned Fielder and repeated that, if questioned, Fielder was to say he and Darr were night-fishing all night. Darr then said he \u201chad to hang up because the detectives were there looking for some knives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On cross-examination, Fielder admitted lying to police officers investigating the killing of Larry on the morning of April 12. He told them he and Darr had been together all of the previous evening and did not mention the blood he had seen on Darr\u2019s hands or Darr\u2019s statements about the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Fielder indicated that it was in August, while jailed on a felony charge, that he first told police the facts to which he testified at trial. Fielder subsequently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and the district attorney recommended that Fielder be sentenced to jail-time served. Fielder spent 15 days in custody on the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Defense counsel elicited that Fielder was on probation from a prior offense. Fielder was told the new offense constituted a violation of probation, but the hearing on revocation would be held after Darr\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">On redirect, Fielder testified that, while he and Darr were at the park on April 11, Darr said he was going to \u201cbeat the holy crap out of Larry, \u201d arid that he (Fielder) lied to police the next day because he was \u201cscared.\u201d When questioned by defense counsel, Fielder said neither he nor Darr was intoxicated on the evening of April 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Rebecca Fielder, Fielder\u2019s 16-year-old sister, testified she saw Darr in his car outside her house about 10 a.m. on April 12, 1978. Darr told her and \u201cTammy Williams\u201d that he had killed Larry; he pulled out a dark-colored switchblade knife, pushed the button and. said if \u201cthey\u201d told the cops, \u201che\u2019d feel like killing somebody else. \u201d Darr had blood on his hands and on his pants. Later, in testimony which clearly surprised the prosecution, Rebecca Fielder said she and \u201cTammy\u201d saw her brother hit and Darr stab Larry at about 9 or 10 o\u2019clock on the night of the homicide. She said the attack occurred near James Marshall Park, on Paradise Road about six blocks from the witness\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>From the witness\u2019 highly contradictory statements regarding \u201cTammy,\u201d and from the testimony of the witness\u2019 mother, Betty Jean Fielder, it is doubtful that \u201cTammy\u201d exists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the morning of April 12, however, Mrs. Fielder did see her daughter outside talking to Darr, who was in his car. One or two days later, Rebecca told her mother Darr said he killed Larry. She did not tell her mother she saw Darr and her brother in a fight with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Detective Richard Breashears testified that on the afternoon of April 12, 1978, he searched Darr\u2019s car and room with Darr\u2019s consent. No switchblade or white-handled knives were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Terri Lee French, called by the defense, testified that she saw the victim in the early afternoon of April 11 at the apartment shared by Darr, his girl friend, Theresa Bower (Avila), and James Mosely; Larry asked to borrow money to buy a pound of marijuana. When she saw the victim again about 9:30 p.m. he appeared to be \u201cloaded\u201d on marijuana. French stated that Fielder\u2019s veracity was \u201cnot quite accurate\u201d and that \u201c[h]e likes to fabricate things to make people like him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">On cross-examination, French said Bower had told her after Larry\u2019s death that she had been having an affair with the deceased, and that Mosely was aware of their relations. Bower said she was not sure whether Darr knew about this affair; she had seen Darr and the victim exchange words on one occasion. French also testified that she had seen Darr in possession of a black knife with a pushbutton.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Sylvia Heredia, who lived a few houses from the intersection of Colorado and South Avenues, testified that at 10:30 p.m. on April 11 she had seen a large white car parked in front of her house, and a black man standing by the car, looking toward the intersection. Lupe Heredia, who lived in the same house, saw four men standing under a tree at the comer of Colorado and South Avenues shortly after 10:30 p.m.; she did not notice any parked cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Fielder, recalled by the defense, said he did not kill or hit Lany; he did not even know the victim. Fielder explained that his sister was mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\n<em>Rebuttal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The People on reopening called Brenda Lou Clem, who testified that she was acquainted with both Darr and the victim. Clem said Darr had told her a week or two weeks before the killing he was \u201cgoing to get Paul\u201d because \u201cPaul was messing with his girlfriend.\u201d She had talked to the victim sometime before his death; he said he had heard Darr was after him for \u201cmessing with his girlfriend,\u201d and that \u201che wouldn\u2019t touch her with a 10-foot pole.\u201d When Clem met Darr near Modesto High School two days after the homicide, Darr said, \u201cT got Paul.\u2019\u201d When Clem inquired what Darr meant, he said, \u201cT killed him.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Clem testified she subsequently received 10 threatening phone calls<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which she reported to police in the early part of May. The caller, whom she believed to be a white male, identified himself as \u201cJohn.\u201d He told Clem \u201cthey were going to get some more black people,\u201d and said Larry had been killed because \u201c[h]e had been burning people that he was selling dope and stuff.\u201d Clem also said she told police the victim had been killed because of his relationship with Darr\u2019s girl friend. Because she was scared, she did not mention to police Darr\u2019s claim that he had killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">On cross-examination, Clem admitted she had first contacted the district attorney regarding her testimony the day before she testified. She explained that Martha Larry, presumably the victim\u2019s relative, had called her and \u201csaid that they needed somebody to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Detective Mac Reece was called by the defense in surrebuttal. He said he had been contacted by Clem in May regarding threatening phone calls. Clem told him the caller said Larry had been killed because \u201che had burned a lot of people in Modesto,\u201d not because of a relationship with Darr\u2019s girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">On the second day of deliberations, the jury requested the rereading of Charles Fielder\u2019s entire testimony, and the testimony of Brenda Clem. Shortly thereafter, the jury returned its verdict finding Darr guilty of first degree murder with the use of a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Facts Relating to Defense Counsel\u2019s Dual Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">During cross-examination of Fielder by Darr\u2019s attorney, Fielder mentioned he had been represented by Darr\u2019s attorney at the hearing at which Fielder entered a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor lesser offense in disposition of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>August 1978 felony charge. Fielder also indicated he was still on felony probation from a previous offense, and was awaiting notice of the revocation hearing, which had been deferred \u201cuntil this [trial] was over, ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Pursuant to Darr\u2019s request in the appeal, this court took judicial notice of certified copies of court documents relating to witness Fielder\u2019s felony probation status and the new offense for which he was arrested in August 1978. These documents, combined with evidence developed at the postappeal hearing in the superior court on the petition for habeas corpus, establish the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On June 7, 1977, Fielder was sentenced in Stanislaus County Superior Court No. 144333 upon a plea of guilty to a violation of Penal Code section 4573.6, knowingly possessing unauthorized drugs in prison or jail, a felony. Imposition of sentence was suspended and Fielder was admitted to three years\u2019 probation, with a condition that he serve seven months in county jail. The public defender who later was appointed to represent Darr represented Fielder in this matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">On August 4, 1978, nearly four months after the initial investigation of the Paul Larry murder, complaint No. 27872 was filed in Stanislaus County Municipal Court charging Fielder with the felony of violating Penal Code section 288, committing a lewd and lascivious act on the body of a child under 14. Darr\u2019s attorney again represented Fielder.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">When arrested on complaint No. 27872, Fielder for the first time implicated petitioner in the Larry murder. On August 16,1978, pursuant to a plea bargain, the section 288 charge was reduced to a misdemeanor violation of Penal Code section 647a, annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18, and Fielder entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge with the understanding that the district attorney would recommend that Fielder be admitted to probation on time served. Darr\u2019s attorney represented Fielder at this hearing. Fielder was sentenced on Septejnber \u00cd3, 1978, to time served; a different deputy public defender appeared at the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">A complaint issued charging petitioner with the murder of Paul Larry on August 9, 1978. Darr was arrested in September; Darr\u2019s attorney was appointed on September 18,1978. On September 25,1978, the public defender\u2019s office received a notice of violation of probation by Fielder. No action was taken to secure Fielder a prompt revocation hearing and the deputy public defender representing Darr did not terminate his representation of Fielder.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Darr\u2019s attorney represented petitioner at the preliminary hearing on October 13, 1978, and at the trial December 18-21, 1978. At this time, he was still attorney of record for Fielder in the felony conviction matter in which probation revocation proceedings were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Hearings were held January 24 and 26, 1979, after Darr\u2019s trial, on the alleged violation of Fielder\u2019s probationary status in superior court No. 144333. Darr\u2019s attorney, appearing with Fielder, stated there was a possible conflict if the public defender\u2019s office continued to represent Fielder; Fielder waived any conflict. On January 26, 1979, Fielder\u2019s probation was revoked upon his admission that he had violated its terms; the court readmitted Fielder to probation with a suspended county jail commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Darr\u2019s attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing on habeas corpus in superior court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that he considered the possibility of a conflict in his representation of petitioner and Fielder at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial and concluded that none existed. However, at the time of the hearing in superior court, he believed there was a conflict. Darr\u2019s attorney did not tell petitioner he had represented Fielder, or that petitioner had a right to a different attorney if his counsel represented conflicting interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Darr\u2019s attorney said he did not feel inhibited in his cross-examination of Fielder because he represented the witness; however, he might have proceeded differently on cross-examination had he not represented both defendant and prosecution witness. Petitioner\u2019s attorney could not think of any specific questions he would have asked, but said he could think of \u201ca lot of things\u201d he might have done differently in the conduct of petitioner\u2019s trial. In retrospect, he thought it \u201cpossible\u201d that bringing out on cross-examination the fact that he had represented Fielder might have affected the jury\u2019s perception of Fielder as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">During trial, Rebecca Fielder, one of the prosecution witnesses, accused her brother of being involved in the murder; Darr\u2019s attorney acknowledged that during the defense case he recalled Charles Fielder to the stand to rebut this accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Petitioner testified he was unaware his attorney had also represented Fielder until Fielder blurted it out at petitioner\u2019s trial. Darr said no one explained to him that he had the right to request another attorney in the event of a conflict, and he did not know he had such a right when Fielder testified. Petitioner testified that had he known of this right, he would have asked the court for another attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">This is an original proceeding under the authority of California Constitution, article VI, section 10, and we do not sit as a mere reviewing body. In addressing the issues raised in Darr\u2019s petition, we are empowered to evaluate the evidence independently and to reach our own factual determination. <em>(In re Hochberg, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 870, 873-874, fn. 2; <em>In re Branch </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 200, 203, fn. 1 [74 Cal.Rptr. 238, 449 P.2d 174]; <em>In re Wright </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 788, 801-802 [144 Cal.Rptr. 538].) Because the superior court judge\u2019s determination of the issues was not based on the credibility of the witnesses, and the essential facts are uncontradicted, the judge\u2019s conclusions are immaterial to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The present record shows concurrent representation by petitioner\u2019s appointed counsel of clients with conflicting interests; damaging omissions and tactical blunders at petitioner\u2019s trial were the result. We disagree with respondent\u2019s argument that petitioner has not established that a conflict \u201cdeprived him of . . . effective representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Active representation by one attorney of clients with adverse and conflicting interests denies effective assistance of counsel to a defendant caught in the conflict. <em>(Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 335, 345 [64 L.Ed.2d 333, 344, 100 S.Ct. 1708]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 765, 774 [73 Cal.Rptr. 10, 447 P.2d 106, 34 A.L.R.3d 454].) Although most of the reported California cases concern codefendants, unquestionably the rule also applies where counsel concurrently represents a criminal defendant and a witness whose interests are adverse. <em>(Castillo </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1974) 504 F.2d 1243 [concurrent representation of defendant and an individual who was both a government witness and a victim]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaVallee </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1968) 282 F.Supp. 968 [concurrent representation of defendant and important government witness]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 831, 843-844 [131 Cal.Rptr. 104]; Annot. (1969) 27 A.L.R.3d 1431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">It is not representation of more than one client which deprives a defendant of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, it is representation of clients with adverse interests. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>LaVallee, supra, </em>282 F.Supp. 968, 971, the court described the hazards of dual representation of a defendant and an important prosecution witness who was under indictment in another case: \u201cIt takes no great imagination to detect the potential dangers that faced the petitioner by being defended by an attorney who was also representing an important prosecution witness. Cordova, a known narcotics addict, had a felony indictment hanging over him at the time he testified against the petitioner. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>possibility existed that Cordova thought that he could secure more favorable treatment from the District Attorney and from the courts if he cooperated with the State in the prosecution of another case. In fact, Cordova did subsequently plead to a reduced charge and did receive as his sentence time already served. If Cordova chose to lie, in order to gain for himself such favorable treatment, a vigorous cross-examination by petitioner\u2019s attorney would be the way to expose, for example, a possibly false identification of petitioner by the police officers. The knowledge that Cordova has a felony charge pending against him might have reduced [defense counsel\u2019s] zeal in cross-examining him, one of his clients\u2014favorable treatment for Cordova could not be expected if he were proven to be a liar. Even if [defense counsel] were not himself involved in any deal to obtain Cordova\u2019s testimony, as an experienced criminal attorney he was surely aware that Cordova\u2019s subsequent treatment might depend on his performance, at petitioner\u2019s trial. That Cordova might have fulfilled a bargain with the District Attorney is not an unreasonable inference to draw, and the existence of such an arrangement would establish a conflict of interest in [defense counsel] between the petitioner and Cordova. A second danger in being represented by an attorney who is also representing a prosecution witness is that the scope of examination of the witness by the attorney might be restricted by the fact that the attorney has learned confidential information about his client-witness which cannot be revealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The appellate record did not reveal whether Darr\u2019s attorney, at the time of the murder trial, had divested himself of a continuing obligation to Fielder, or whether Darr had waived any conflict. These factual gaps have been closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The present record, as augmented by the transcript of the evidentiary hearing in superior court, shows without contradiction that trial counsel simultaneously was representing clients whose interests were adverse. Darr\u2019s attorney\u2019s representation of Fielder, together with his obligations of loyalty and confidence, continued throughout the attorney\u2019s representation of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The interests of petitioner and Fielder clearly were adverse. That Fielder implicated petitioner in the murder in the first instance because Fielder had been jailed on the Penal Code section 288 charge and hoped to help himself in the prosecution of that charge by providing information against his friend \u201cis not an unreasonable inference to draw, ...\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>LaVallee, supra, 282 </em>F.Supp. at p. 971.) A plea bargain was reached on the section 288 charge, with petitioner\u2019s attorney representing Fielder, before petitioner\u2019s trial. Although Fielder had served the sentence on the new offense, probation revocation proceedings were continued until after Fielder testified against petitioner, a clear incentive for Fielder to cooperate with the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>There is no doubt that Darr did not waive the conflict. Petitioner testified at the habeas corpus hearing in superior court that he knew nothing of the dual representation until trial was in progress.  \u201cIt is well settled that a defendant is denied his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel if his attorney represents conflicting interests without his knowledge and assent.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>LaVallee, supra, </em>282 F.Supp. at p. 971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As a matter of federal constitutional law, a conflict must be \u201cactual\u201d; the \u201cmere possibility of conflict\u201d is insufficient to implicate Sixth Amendment rights. <em>(Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S. 335, 345, 348 [64 L.Ed.2d 333, 345, 346].) The majority opinion in <em>Cuyler </em>did not define the difference between \u201cactual\u201d and \u201cpossible\u201d conflict; however, in a concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Marshall explained: \u201cThere is a possibility of conflict ... if the interests of the defendants may diverge at some point so as to place the attorney under inconsistent duties. There is an actual, relevant conflict of interests if, during the course of the representation, the defendants\u2019 interests do diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 356, fn. 3 [64 L.Ed.2d at p. 351].)  A reviewing court may use hindsight to determine whether an actual conflict existed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Angulo </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 514, 519 [148 Cal.Rptr. 517].) If the court finds such a conflict, and determines that the conflict affected counsel\u2019s performance, reversal is automatic. <em>(Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S. at pp. 349-350 [64 L.Ed.2d atpp. 347-348]; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 60, 76 [86 L.Ed. 680, 702, 62 S.Ct. 457].) \u201cThus, a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief.\u201d <em>(Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>at pp. 349-350 [64 L.Ed.2d at p. 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Under <em>Cuyler, </em>if the record shows that counsel in representing clients with conflicting interests does something or omits to do something contrary to what is expected of a reasonably competent attorney under like circumstances, an actual conflict is shown and reversal is required without a showing of prejudice. In <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>315 U.S. 60, defense counsel representing codefendants failed to object to hearsay inadmissible as to one client; the court found this \u201c. . . indicative of [counsel\u2019s] struggle to serve two masters . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 75 [86 L.Ed. at p. 702].) The Supreme Court reversed, finding impermissible conflict: \u201cOur examination of the record leads to the conclusion that [counsel\u2019s] representation of Glasser was not as effective as it might have been .... We hold that the court. . . denied Glasser his right to have the effective assistance of counsel, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 76 [86 L.Ed. at p. 702].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Looking at the total case, an actual conflict is demonstrated in the record. Fielder was an extremely important witness against petitioner. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>statements to police led to the arrest and charging of petitioner. Fielder\u2019s trial testimony established that petitioner had the opportunity, means and motive to commit the killing. Fielder\u2019s testimony was the cornerstone of the prosecution\u2019s case. In the face of the evidence of guilt, defense counsel presented little defense, but relied on weaknesses in the prosecution case, and particularly, attacks on credibility of prosecution witnesses. In <em>Cuyler, </em>a similar approach was held to be a \u201creasonable tactical response\u201d under the circumstances (see <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S. 335, 347-348 [64 L.Ed.2d 333, 345-346]); accepting that strategy in this case, impeachment of prosecution witnesses\u2014especially Fielder\u2014was crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The dual representation appears to have affected counsel\u2019s performance in several areas. Petitioner\u2019s attorney did not seek to obtain a timely probation revocation hearing in Fielder\u2019s felony case. Obviously, it was not in Fielder\u2019s interests to do so, as the decision whether to continue Fielder on probation might be influenced favorably by a showing that Fielder cooperated in the prosecution of petitioner. On the other hand, had Fielder\u2019s revocation hearing proceeded prior to petitioner\u2019s trial, the results of such hearing might have provided further grounds for impeachment of the witness, regardless of whether Fielder\u2019s probation were revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Further, unexplained omissions exist in Darr\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Fielder for bias. Notably, petitioner\u2019s attorney did not ask Fielder at trial whether the witness was aware of the term he faced if his probation were revoked, or whether Fielder had agreed to testify in return for a promise or hope of lenient treatment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Petitioner\u2019s attorney effectively elicited that Fielder implicated Darr for the first time after Fielder had been arrested and was in jail, facing a felony charge and revocation of his probationary status. However, when the witness freely admitted that he lied to the police when they first approached him, and explained that he lied because he was afraid, it was crucial to expose any considerations of leniency influencing Fielder\u2019s decision to testify against his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Here, both the plea to the misdemeanor on the new offense and the suspension of probation revocation proceedings brought out by Darr\u2019s attorney on cross-examination could suggest a deal\u2014an express or implied agreement whereby the witness received strong inducements to testify against Darr ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>cording to his second statement to police. Yet petitioner\u2019s attorney did not ask the obvious questions: Did Fielder agree to testify against Darr in exchange for a favorable disposition of the charges? Did the outcome of the pending probation revocation hearing depend on Fielder\u2019s trial testimony? Was Fielder led to believe he would receive better treatment if Darr were convicted? Was Fielder aware of the possible consequences if his probation were revoked and he was sentenced to prison? A reasonable inference may be drawn that defense counsel did not ask these questions because such inquiry would reach confidential communications with Fielder regarding the advisability of the course of action taken, whether or not there was an express arrangement with the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Defense counsel did argue to the jury that Fielder was a liar and had a motive to fabricate in order to improve his own chances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nonetheless, it is evident that Darr\u2019s attorney\u2019s efforts were limited by his ongoing relationship with the main prosecution witness. Fielder\u2019s cooperation as a prosecution witness only could benefit him in his upcoming probation revocation hearing and his attorney, who now represented Darr, was ethically bound to advance and protect this objective. Petitioner\u2019s attorney also owed a duty to petitioner zealously to attempt to undermine Fielder\u2019s credibility by all means available. \u201cThe Constitution assures a defendant effective representation by counsel whether the attorney is one of his choosing or court-appointed. Such representation is lacking, however, if counsel, unknown to the accused and without his knowledgeable assent, is in a duplicitous position where his full talents\u2014as a vigorous advocate having the single aim of acquittal by all means fair and honorable\u2014are hobbled or fettered or restrained by commitments to others.\u201d <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>United States </em>(5th Cir. 1962) 298 F.2d 461, 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Most troubling is Darr\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201crehabilitation\u201d of Fielder in putting on the defense case after Rebecca Fielder implicated Fielder as an accomplice to the murder. Although even the prosecutor said that Rebecca had \u201cflights of fantasy,\u201d the action of Darr\u2019s attorney in recalling Fielder to impeach this testimony could serve only to enhance Charles Fielder\u2019s credibility. Finally, we are concerned that an aura of credibility or an approval of Fielder and his conduct in testifying against petitioner was created when the jury learned that Darr\u2019s attorney represented Fielder <em>after </em>Fielder had implicated petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The record as a whole shows that Darr\u2019s attorney\u2019s continuing obligation to Fielder, whose interests were adverse to petitioner\u2019s at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance in several significant respects. Because the record reflects an actual conflict of interest, petitioner\u2019s conviction must be set aside, regardless of whether actual prejudice can be shown. <em>(Cuyler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S. 335, 349-350 [64 L.Ed.2d 333, 347].) \u201cThe conflict itself [demonstrates] a denial of the \u2018right to have the effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 349 [64 L.Ed.2d at p. 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Petitioner correctly contends the trial court erred in failing to inquire concerning a possible conflict or to advise petitioner of his right to conflict-free representation when it was revealed during trial that petitioner\u2019s attorney had represented Fielder.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Under <em>Cuyler </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>446 U.S. 335, 347 [64 L.Ed.2d 333, 346], a trial court has no affirmative duty to inquire into multiple representation unless it \u201cknows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists. ...\u201d In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 261 [67 L.Ed.2d 220, 101 S.Ct. 1097], the petitioners, former employees of an \u201cadult\u201d bookstore and movie theatre, had been convicted of distributing obscene materials and faced jail terms upon revocation of probation for failure to pay fines imposed. The Supreme Court found the record demonstrated that \u201cthe <em>possibility </em>of a conflict of interest was sufficiently apparent at the time of the revocation hearing to impose upon the court a duty to inquire further.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 272 [67 L.Ed.2d at pp. 230-231].) The court noted petitioners\u2019 counsel had been retained by the employer, who might have refused to pay the fines in order to precipitate a test case on the equal protection issue whether offenders may be jailed for failure to pay fines beyond their means. The court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter with instructions to hold a hearing on the conflict question and thereafter to grant appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Elston </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 721, 730 [182 Cal.Rptr. 30], this court held the trial court erred in failing to inquire into the possibility of conflict in counsel\u2019s representation of codefendants. We concluded, however, that no purpose would be served by a remand for further hearing as in <em>Wood, </em>because the record disclosed an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Here, it was brought out on cross-examination that Darr\u2019s attorney recently had represented Fielder in a criminal matter and that a hearing on revocation of felony probation was pending. Fielder testified he had received notice that the hearing on probation revocation would be held after petitioner\u2019s trial. On redirect, the prosecutor verified that it indeed was petitioner\u2019s attorney who had represented Fielder.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">This information, developed in open court, sufficiently raised the \u201cpossibility of conflict\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elston, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.3d 721, 730), and should have prompted the court to conduct an inquiry. However, the memorandum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>decision in the superior court habeas corpus proceeding clearly indicates that no inquiry regarding a possible conflict was made by the court at any time, and there was no discussion of the matter by counsel. As discussed above, Darr was not informed of his right to conflict-free counsel by his attorney or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">od The trial judge or either attorney could have initiated a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine die facts, to inform petitioner of his right to conflict-free representation, and to inquire whether Darr desired new counsel or preferred to continue with counsel who represented Fielder, waiving any right to object.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court\u2019s failure to hold such a hearing under the circumstances shown was error of constitutional proportions. <em>(Wo</em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>450 U.S. 261, 272, fn. 18 [67 L.Ed.2d 220, 231].) Where, as here, the record developed through habeas corpus proceedings clearly demonstrates an actual conflict, reversal is mandated; remand for ftuther inquiry by the trial court would be an idle act.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 952, 954, 955; <em>see In re Navarro </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 325 [155 Cal.Rptr. 522], discussing the scope of the attorney-client privilege.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">We repeat a statement from our prior opinion that there is no indication petitioner\u2019s attorney acted other than in good faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">A hearing also would have allowed the court an opportunity to inquire whether Fielder\u2019s rights were being protected in his testimony under oath by advice of independent counsel.
