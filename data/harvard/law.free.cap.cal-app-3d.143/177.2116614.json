J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOr\">The clerk of the County of San Mateo has called an election to be held Tuesday, June 7,1983, for the purpose of determining (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>whether a city of East Palo Alto shall be organized, and (2) whether two public entity districts wholly within its proposed boundaries shall be dissolved, with their facilities reorganized as part of the proposed city.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The election has been called pursuant to the \u201cDistrict Reorganization Act of 1965,\u201d found in Government Code section 56000 et seq. (hereafter DRA). DRA, among other things, provides for the reorganization of public districts, upon a majority vote, at an election petitioned for by not less than <em>5 percent </em>of the resident voters within the concerned territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The superior court concluded that although proceedings under DRA were otherwise proper, the \u201cMunicipal Organization Act of 1977,\u201d codified as Government Code section 35000 et seq. (hereafter MOA), \u201cmust prevail as to procedure.\u201d Since MOA requires, for an election organizing or incorporating a city, a petition of \u201cnot less than <em>25 percent </em>of the registered voters residing in the area\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 35130, italics added), the superior court found the scheduled election legally uncalled for, and <em>invalid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Accordingly, it was adjudged that a writ of mandate issue commanding the above-captioned county commission, board, and officers \u201cto cease any further proceedings\u201d for the June 7, 1983 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The appeal before us is from the judgment ordering the writ of mandate to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">We narrate now, what appears to be the uncontroverted factual-procedural context of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In 1981, a group of interested persons, terming themselves the \u201cEast Palo Alto Citizens\u2019 Committee on Incorporation,\u201d apparently acting under the \u201cnot less than 5 percent of the registered voters\u201d provision of DRA, petitioned the county\u2019s Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) for the incorporation or organization of a city to be known as East Palo Alto, and the contemporaneous dissolution of <em>three </em>public entity districts of the area whose facilities would be reorganized as part of the proposed city. LAFCO approved, and an election was ordered and held. A majority of the electors voted for organization of the city of East Palo Alto, and for dissolution of <em>two </em>of the three districts. The two districts lay wholly within the proposed city\u2019s boundaries. The third was partially outside such boundaries, and a narrow majority voted against its dissolution. As a result the entire election failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Thereafter the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors enacted a resolution seeking incorporation of East Palo Alto.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In October 1982, the East Palo Alto Citizens\u2019 Committee on Incorporation again petitioned LAFCO for incorporation or organization of East Palo Alto, and for dissolution of the two public entity districts whose dissolution had previously been voted for, with transfer of their facilities to the proposed city. (This time the third district was <em>not </em>included.) The petition was according to DRA\u2019s procedures, and carried not less than <em>5 percent </em>of the names of the registered voters within its embraced territory. LAFCO approved the petition, the San Mateo County Clerk found it to comply with DRA\u2019s signature and other requirements. An election thereon has, as indicated, been set to be held June 7, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Thereupon interested citizens, the four above-named respondents, Horwath, Sanders, Breckenridge, and Cenedella, filed the instant mandate petition, joining as defendants LAFCO and the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors and Clerk. The East Palo Alto Citizens\u2019 Committee on Incorporation were joined in the action as \u201creal party in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The critical issue of the appeal is whether, as stated by the superior court, \u201ceven though the proceedings under DRA allow an incorporation [of a city], the incorporation sections of MOA must prevail as to procedure,\u201d and that therefore \u201cthe petition had to be signed by 25 percent of the voters of the proposed municipal corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Before addressing ourselves to that issue, we make some observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In respect of the formation of the contemplated municipality of East Palo Alto the parties, and relevant statutes, use the terms \u201cincorporation,\u201d \u201cformation\u201d and \u201corganization\u201d interchangeably. We give to them, in the context of the case before us, their obvious synonymous meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">There is a strong public policy, in \u201cplanning and shaping the logical and orderly development and coordination of local governmental agencies\u201d so as to avoid their costly and illogical sprawl, and proliferation, and in the <em>\u201creorgani</em>zationi\u201d of such agencies where it will \u201cadvantageously provide for the present and future needs of each county and its communities.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 54773.) (Section 54773 and DRA were enacted contemporaneously; see Stats. 1965, chs. 2043, 2045.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u201cPlainly\u201d the need \u201cto halt the proliferation of special districts [and] to guard against wasteful duplication of services [which DRA was designed to halt, is] of pervasive state concern. \u201d <em>(Friends of Mount Diablo </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 1006,1011 [139 Cal.Rptr. 469]; and see <em>City of Ceres </em>v. <em>City of Modesto </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 545, 550-553 [79 Cal.Rptr. 168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u201c[A] single governmental agency, rather than several limited purpose agencies, is better able to assess and be accountable for community service needs and financial resources and, therefore, is the best mechanism for establishing community service priorities.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 35000.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">And, at the risk of repetition, it will be useful and convenient in our ensuing discussion, to bear in mind that DRA refers to the <em>District </em>Reorganization Act of 1965 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 56000 et seq.) while MOA is the term here given the <em>Municipal </em>Organization Act of 1977 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 35000 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We turn to a consideration of the question, whether MOA commanded that the instant \u201cpetition had to be signed by 25 percent of the voters of the proposed municipal corporation. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">It seems proper here to <em>expressly </em>point out that the proposed new city of East Palo Alto was a <em>\u201cdistrict,\u201d </em>as the term is used and defined by DRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">DRA\u2019s section 56039, subdivision (c), provides that the <em>\u201cdistrict,\u201d </em>as therein used, includes a \u201cnew city\u201d proposed to be incorporated, <em>\u201cwhen the board of supervisors does not object to such incorporation. </em>\u201d Elsewhere DRA reiterates: \u201cThe incorporation of a new city, which is proposed as a part of a plan of reorganization, may also be conducted in accordance with the procedures for reorganization set forth in this division unless the board of supervisors objects thereto.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 56003.1.) \u201c \u2018Change of organization\u2019 . . . includes . . . incorporation of new cities when the board of supervisors does not object to such incorporations.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 56028.) Here, the board of supervisors <em>expressly sought </em>\u201csuch incorporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">It is notable also that cities generally are deemed \u201cdistricts\u201d by DRA for purposes of \u201creorganization\u201d or \u201cchanges of organization.\u201d Government Code section 56068 provides: \u201c \u2018Reorganization\u2019 means one or more changes of organization proposed for: (1) Each of two or more subject districts, <em>including cities, </em>...\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">We note further that DRA is found in <em>Title 6, Division 1, </em>Government Code, while MOA is. framed as Title 4, Division 2 of the same code.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">DRA (\u00a7 56001) provides that: \u201cThis division shall provide the sole and exclusive authority and procedure for the initiation, conduct and completion of changes of organization and reorganization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">MOA (\u00a7 35002) states: <em>\u201cExcept as provided in Division 1 {commencing with Section 56000) of Title 6 </em>[i.e., DRA], this part shall provide the sole and exclusive authority and procedure for the initiation, conduct, and completion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>city incorporations, municipal reorganizations, or changes of organization.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The proposed new city which, with territorially related public entity districts, was sought to be organized or reorganized, was thus a <em>\u201cdistrict\u201d subject to the 5 percent signature </em>and other procedural requirements of <em>DRA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We are unpersuaded that it is unreasonable to ascribe a legislative intent, that while ordinarily signatures of 25 percent of the area\u2019s registered voters are required for a city\u2019s formation election, the far lesser amount of 5 percent is required for such purpose under DRA. It will be seen, unlike MOA, that DRA requires, in addition to its required signatures for such an election, the nonobjection of the county\u2019s board of supervisors. Both such requirements would seem to reasonably assure that the election\u2019s calling, and its consequent expense, was grounded in substantial and responsible public support.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Moreover, and particularly where the legislative purpose is otherwise apparent, \u201c \u2018criticisms of policy, wisdom or technique inherent in any legislative enactment \u201care matters with which the courts have no concern, such arguments being proper ones to address to the legislature for its determination.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Richardson </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 648, 651 [14 Cal. Rptr. 494].)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Another contention of the appeal is founded on MOA (Gov. Code, \u00a7 35264). There it is provided that: \u201cIf proceedings for incorporation [of a city] are terminated ... by failure of a majority of the voters to confirm the incorporation . . ., no new proposal for incorporation of the same or substantially the same territory may be filed with the [local agency formation] commission within two years of the date of the resolution terminating proceedings; provided, however, that the commission may waive the provisions of this section if it finds such provisions are detrimental to the public interest. \u201d Here the second proposal <em>was </em>submitted within two years of the voters\u2019 rejection of the first. <em>But </em>LAFCO, finding the statute\u2019s application \u201cdetrimental to the public interest,\u201d <em>did waive its provisions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">LAFCO, it will be noted, is a quasi-legislative administrative agency. \u201c \u2018. . . [T]he power exercised is legislative and political rather than judicial.\u2019 . . . \u2018Mere ascertainment of facts as a basis for legislation does not render the process judicial or anything less than quasi legislative.\u2019 . . . \u2018An administrative order, legislative in character, is subject to the same tests as to validity as an act of the Legislature. \u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 381, 387, 388, 389 [142 Cal.Rptr. 873]; and see authority there collected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>It is contended that LAFCO\u2019s required \u201cfinding\u201d that MOA\u2019s section 35264 would be \u201cdetrimental to the public interest\u201d was \u201cnot supported by substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d (No complaint is made (nor could there reasonably be) of the fact that LAFCO\u2019s finding was not in writing. See <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d 381, 386-388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We assume, but only arguendo, that MOA\u2019s section 35264\u2019s requirement would ordinarily be applicable to the here questioned DRA proceedings. But we observe that LAFCO had previously approved, and presently had before it a resolution of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors approving, incorporation of East Palo Alto. It was further an established fact that a majority of the area\u2019s voters desired its organization. Moreover, it appeared that upon such incorporation, East Palo Alto would be entitled to annual state and federal subventions of between $800,000 and $1,500,000, which otherwise would be lost to the new city, and the county. These, and perhaps other, matters manifestly constituted substantial evidence on the whole record supportive of LAFCO\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">And: \u201cAdministrative findings need not be stated with the formality required of judicial findings (see <em>Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works, </em>44 Cal.2d 90, 102 [280 P.2d 1]) and are to be liberally construed to support rather than defeat the order under review. (See <em>Jack P. Meyers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., </em>238 Cal.App.2d 869, 873 [48 Cal.Rptr. 259].)\u201d <em>(Realty Projects, Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 204, 213 [108 Cal.Rptr. 71].)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Moreover, the types of \u201cfinding\u201d required of LAFCO, as to whether application of MOA\u2019s section 35264 would be \u201cdetrimental to the public interest,\u201d and of its supportive \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d was pointed out in <em>So. Cal. Jockey Club </em>v. <em>Cal. etc. Racing Bd. </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 167, 177 [223 P.2d 1], where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and weight of the evidence cannot be considered on this appeal. It is clear . . . that the applicant has the burden of proving, at least, that public interest and the purposes of the act would not be detrimentally affected by the proposed new track. There is considerable discussion by the parties as to whether the applicant must affirmatively show that the public interest would be benefited or merely that it would not suffer, but it is not necessary to pass upon that point. Thus it was for the board to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s evidence was such that the burden had been met. This is especially true where most of the evidence consists of opinions, and the issues involved\u2014public interest and purposes of the act\u2014are general and incapable of exact definition. Indeed, plaintiff states in its brief: \u2018A moment\u2019s reflection upon the very nature of the determination that the board was required to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>shows that such determination must be predicated, not upon provable concrete facts, but upon opinion evidence exclusively.\u2019 In such a case, wide discretion is necessarily vested in the fact-finder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">For all of these reasons we conclude that the subject petition did <em>not </em>have \u201cto be signed by 25 percent of the voters of the proposed municipal corporation.\u201d The judgment of the superior court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The judgment is reversed; the superior court will enter judgment against the petitioners for mandate who are the respondents on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-7\">NEWSOM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeV\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Having concluded that certain provisions in the competing statutes cannot be harmonized, I view the later expression of legislative intent contained in Government Code section 35000 et seq. as controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Like the trial judge, I attach great significance to the fact that Government Code section 35130 specifically addresses the signature requirement for an <em>incorporation </em>petition, while the D.R.A. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 56000 et seq.) which provides a 5 percent sign-up for each of the other procedures it addresses, has no such specific requirement respecting incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">I also regard LAFCO\u2019s conclusion, pursuant to Government Code section 35264, that the two-year waiting period, being \u201cdetrimental to the public interest,\u201d was waived, as wholly unsupported by factual findings required of the Agency (Gov. Code, \u00a7 35264).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">For these reasons I would affirm the superior court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 15, 1983.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
