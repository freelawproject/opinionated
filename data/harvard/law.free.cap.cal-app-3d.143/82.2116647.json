J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ago\">The Director of the State Department of Motor Vehicles, Doris V. Alexis, appeals after the trial court granted Duane Doyle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Johnson\u2019s petition for mandate and ordered the director to set aside an order suspending Johnson\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">On October 29, 1975, Johnson drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. He was convicted of that offense January 20, 1976. Four years, 359 days after the first offense, on October 23, 1980, Johnson repeated the crime. He was convicted of the repeat offense on March 16, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">On January 1,1981, amendments to Vehicle Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 13352 became effective, changing the rule requiring a one-year suspension of one\u2019s driver\u2019s license upon a second <em>conviction </em>of the drunk driving offense within five years to a rule requiring the suspension upon a second conviction of a drunk driving \u201coffense which occurred within five years of the date of a prior offense which resulted in a conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Thus, two offenses, rather than two convictions, within five years became the basis for suspension on January 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">On May 21, 1981, the director ordered Johnson\u2019s license suspended, applying the law that went into effect January 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Johnson brought his writ on the theory the director\u2019s application of the new law to his case constituted application of an ex post facto law. The trial court agreed with Johnson\u2019s theory, labeling the change of law an ex post facto provision and a bill of attainder as to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Under settled principles of jurisprudence, it is unnecessary to deal with the constitutional ex post facto-bifi of attainder issues (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>3; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9), for the case may be resolved without doing so.  The rule is \u201cwe do not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so to dispose of the matter before us.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 663, 667 [128 Cal.Rptr. 888, 547 P.2d 1000]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 196-197 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587], conc. opn. by Bird, C. J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">It is settled that \u201ca statute should not be given retroactive effect so as to deprive an individual of a pre-existing right unless the Legislature has <em>clearly </em>expressed its intention to accomplish that end\u201d <em>(Henrioulle </em>v. <em>Marin Ventures, Inc. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 512, 520 [143 Cal.Rptr. 247, 573 P.2d 465], italics added; <em>DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 174 [18 Cal.Rptr. 369, 367 P.2d 865]).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The director\u2019s application of the statute effective January 1, 1981, to Johnson\u2019s second drunk driving offense occurring before that date directly contravenes the rules of <em>Henrioulle. </em>It deprives Johnson of the preexisting right he had to continue his licensed driving unless he suffered two convictions of drunk driving within five years. That this was an existing, important protectable right there can be no doubt (see <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Montrym </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 1, 10 [61 L.Ed.2d 321, 329, 99 S.Ct. 2612, 2617], for procedural due process purposes, suspension of a driver\u2019s license for statutorily defined cases implicates a protectable property interest; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 535, 539 [29 L. Ed.2d 90, 94, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 1589], same; <em>Berlinghieri </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 392, 398 [188 Cal.Rptr. 891, 657 P.2d 383], for purpose of independent judgment review standard, driver\u2019s license suspension has impact on the individual sufficiently vital to compel full and independent review). That the act of suspending one\u2019s driver\u2019s license constitutes punishment is reflected in the following passage from <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 481, 486 [176 Cal.Rptr. 690], involving an erroneous suspension under section 13352: \u201cWe are of the opinion that right and justice demand that, where reasonably possible, a guiltless person should not suffer driver\u2019s license suspension because of an erroneous official act of the state. We discern no rational public purpose to the contrary. And <em>where such punishment has been imposed, </em>it seems proper, under the above-noted authority, that it be ameliorated to the extent reasonably possible.\u201d (Italics added; see <em>Hough </em>v. <em>McCarthy </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 273, 282 [5 Cal.Rptr. 668, 353 P.2d 276]; and <em>see People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>(1932) 124 Cal.App. 752,759 [13 P.2d 989].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">At the time Johnson committed his second drunk driving offense, there was no statute providing automatic suspension of his license for having two drunk driving offenses within five years. There needed to be two convictions of that offense within the five-year period. To impose the suspension sanction upon him under the later enactment is to give retroactive effect to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>There surely is no expression, much less a clear one, of legislative intent the amendments effective January 1, 1981, should have retroactive application. Looking at the amending statute as a whole, chapter 1004 of the Statutes of 1980, it is interesting to note the Legislature provided for either limited future duration or delayed operative effect of most of the other Vehicle Code sections affected by the statute. Yet it was silent in terms of prospective or retrospective operation or effect in its amendments to section 13352.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Under the settled rule, we must give the amendments to section 13352 only prospective operation and effect. The amendments simply do not apply to Johnson\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Staniforth, J., and Wiener, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 8, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-10\">All statutory references are to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Before January 1, 1981, section 13352 provided, in part: \u201cThe department shall ... immediately suspend or revoke the privilege of any person to operate a motor vehicle upon receipt of a duly certified abstract of the record of any court showing that the person has been convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug. . . .
