Bobbitt, Jr., seeks review of the order of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) that it lacked jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>award benefits for injuries allegedly received while he was employed on an oil drilling platform in the Santa Barbara channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Petitioner is a resident of California who was hired by respondent Pool Offshore Company in California as a derrick hand on a stationary oil drilling platform, referred to as \u201cShell Rig No. 2,\u201d in the Santa Barbara channel eight miles from the California coastline. On December 3, 1981, he injured his left knee while pulling blocks on the platform. He is receiving medical treatment, and apparently remains disabled, in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In March 1982 he commenced a proceeding before the federal Longshore Harbor Workers\u2019 Administration for compensation benefits under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA). During pendency of the federal proceeding, he commenced the two cases herein (WCAB Nos. 82 SB A 34495 and 34859) against respondent Pool Offshore Company and its insurance carrier, respondent Crawford Insurance Company, seeking compensation benefits under California law. The WCAB ordered dismissal of both cases for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Whether there is concurrent federal and state jurisdiction of petitioner\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The evolution of the concept of concurrent federal-state jurisdiction of compensation for workers injured in the maritime sphere was recently reviewed by the Supreme Court in <em>Sun Ship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 715, 717-722 [65 L.Ed.2d 458, 460-464, 100 S.Ct. 2432], As stated in <em>Sun Ship (ibid.), </em>the original <em>Jensen </em>doctrine barred states from applying their compensation systems to maritime injuries. <em>(Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen </em>(1917) 244 U.S. 205 [61 L.Ed. 1086, 37 S.Ct. 524].) Subsequently, the federal courts adopted the concurrent jurisdiction concept where the injury occurs in the twilight zone of \u201cmaritime but local.\u201d <em>(Sun Ship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 717-719 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 460-462]; see <em>Calbeck </em>v. <em>Travelers Insurance Co. </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 114, 128-129 [8 L.Ed.2d 368, 377-378, 82 S.Ct. 1196].) Thus, before the 1972 amendments to LHWCA, the evolved law was that \u201cmaritime related injuries fell within one of three jurisdictional spheres as they moved landward,\u201d to wit: (1) nonlocal maritime injuries falling exclusively under LHWCA; (2) maritime, but local injuries upon navigable waters which could be compensated under either LHWCA or state</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>law; and (3) injuries suffered beyond navigable waters remedial under state law. <em>(Sun Ship, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 719 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 462].)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><em>Sun Ship (id., </em>at p. 722 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 464]) held that the 1972 amendments to LHWCA did not alter the existing law of concurrent federal-state jurisdiction in the sphere in which the state may constitutionally operate. Since the injury in <em>Sun Ship </em>occurred on a navigable river within the state, rather than offshore, the jurisdictional issue was not affected by the Outer Continental Shelf Land Act (OCSLA), which expressly extends LHWCA to the outer continental shelf. (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(c).) The Supreme Court has subsequently held, however, that OCSLA does not preclude concurrent federal-state jurisdiction over actions for personal injuries occurring in the domain of the outer continental shelf. <em>(Gulf Offshore Co. </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 473, 481-482 [69 L.Ed.2d 784, 793-794, 101 S.Ct. 2870]; see <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Teledyne Movible Offshore, Inc. </em>(La. 1982) 419 So.2d 822, 824-825, appeal filed Jan. 10, 1983, Supreme Ct. Dock. No. 82-1156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><em>Thompson {ibid.) </em>involved facts substantially identical to the facts in the instant case. A derrick hand hired in Louisiana was injured while working on a fixed oil platform in tidal waters four miles off the Louisiana coastline. Louisiana\u2019s compensation laws included a provision similar to California Labor Code section 3600.5 extending compensation benefits to an employee injured in the course of his employment outside the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a well-reasoned opinion discussing the evolutionary expansion of state-federal concurrent jurisdiction in the context of OCSLA-LHWCA, <em>Sun Ship, supra, </em>and <em>Gulf Offshore, supra, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded (419 So.2d at p. 828) that LHWCA is not the exclusively applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute for injuries occurring on the outer continental shelf, and that Louisiana state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over compensation litigation resulting from work performed on fixed oil platforms on the outer continental shelf. (See also <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>R. T. C. Shipbuilding Corp. </em>(1965) 87 N.J.Super. 313 [209 A.2d 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Respondents\u2019 claim in oral argument that reference to exclusive federal jurisdiction in OCSLA (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333) precludes concurrent federal-state jurisdiction in the domain of the outer continental shelf is mistaken.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Loui-</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>siana Supreme Court <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Teledyne Movible Offshore, Inc., supra, </em>419 So.2d 822 at pp. 825-826), as well as the United States Supreme Court <em>(Gulf Offshore Co. </em>v. <em>Mobile Oil Corp., supra, </em>453 U.S. at pp. 481-482 [69 L.Ed.2d at pp. 793-794]) determined that the statutory reference to exclusive federal jurisdiction did not so preclude federal-state concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Adopting the rationale in <em>Thompson, supra, </em>419 So.2d 822, we conclude that the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board has subject matter jurisdiction over petitioner\u2019s claim for compensation benefits. Consequently, the board\u2019s order denying jurisdiction must be annulled. The fact that petitioner also has a pending claim for benefits under LHWCA does not preclude prosecution of his claim before the WCAB, since any benefits he might receive in the federal proceeding may be credited against benefits he might receive in the instant proceedings. <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 804, 810; see <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Harrison Bros. Dry Dock and Repair Yard, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1962) 306 F.2d 369, 373.) As noted in <em>Sun Ship, supra, </em>447 U.S. at page 724 [65 L.Ed.2d at pages 465-466], where \u201cstate remedial schemes are more generous than federal law, concurrent jurisdiction could result in more favorable awards for workers\u2019 injuries than under an exclusively federal compensation system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The finding of respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board that it lacked jurisdiction in cases 82 SBA 34495 and 34859 and its ensuing order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>dismissing the cases are annulled, and the matter is remanded to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Spencer, P.
