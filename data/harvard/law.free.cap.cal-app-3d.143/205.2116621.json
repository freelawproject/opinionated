We decline to so do and reverse the judgment herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The facts disclose that William and Irene Chirmside were married January 27, 1941. In 1946, William Chirmside commenced working for the San Bernardino City Water Department and on March 1, 1948, became a member of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS). On November 13, 1975, the parties were divorced. The final judgment of dissolution did not adjudicate the parties\u2019 entitlements to William\u2019s PERS account, nor was the pension even alluded to in either the petition, response or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">William retired February 26, 1977, at which time the balance of his contributions to his account totaled $24,827.45, including interest. He elected to take his retirement benefits under \u201coptional settlement one,\u201d which provided for monthly payments of $958.01, the balance of any of his contributions at his death to be paid to his designated beneficiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He designated his sister, Isabel Wall, as beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">At his death on February 18, 1980, the balance of his accumulated contributions was $18,773.37. Isabel Wall claimed the remaining contributions as the designated beneficiary. Appellant also made a claim for her community property interest in the remaining contributions. Following a hearing before an administrative law judge, Isabel Wall\u2019s claim was granted and appellant\u2019s denied. Thereafter, appellant\u2019s petition for mandate in the superior court was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The critical question presented is whether appellant\u2019s community property interest in her former husband\u2019s PERS account terminated with his death. The administrative law judge and the trial court both felt constrained to so hold by the \u201cterminable interest doctrine\u201d established in <em>Benson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 355 [33 Cal.Rptr. 257, 384 P.2d 649], and <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Waite </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 461 [99 Cal.Rptr, 325, 492 P.2d 13]. Briefly stated, this judicially created rule recognizes that an interest in a retirement plan traceable to contributions of community funds or to community labor constitutes community property; however, the interest of the nonparticipant spouse does not extend to benefits payable after the death of either spouse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the doctrine the nonemployee spouse takes a community share in the retirement benefits while the employee spouse is living (see, e.g., <em>Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 32, 43 [89 Cal.Rptr. 61, 473 P.2d 765]; <em>In re Marriage of Peterson </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 642, 656 [115 Cal.Rptr. 184]), but cannot alienate or devise those benefits <em>(Waite </em>v. <em>Waite, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 474), which may be payable to a beneficiary other than the nonemployee spouse at the death of the employee, if so designated by the employee <em>(In re Marriage of Bruegl </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 201, 206 [120 Cal.Rptr. 597]), or to a subsequent spouse who qualifies under the pension plan as the employee\u2019s \u201csurvivor\u201d or \u201cwidow.\u201d <em>(Benson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In the seminal case of <em>Benson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>the pension in question was by the terms of the pension plan payable to the \u201cwidow\u201d of a member of the city fire department in the amount of one-half the deceased member\u2019s salary. (60 Cal.2d at p. 359.) Teresa Benson had been married to August Benson for 20 years of his service in the fire department. After August\u2019s retirement, August and Teresa divorced and August married Olive. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 357-358.) A judgment awarding the entire pension to Olive was affirmed, the court reasoning the widow\u2019s right to the pension was not \u201cvested\u201d until the occurrence of the contingency upon which payment was predicated, death of the PERS member. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 361.) Thus, the only interest in the pension which the community could enforce were the payments to August and upon his death, to his \u201cwidow.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 360.) This apparently unfair result was deemed necessary to permit the city flexibility in making reasonable modifications in the retirement scheme, which might be defeated by the vesting of rights in a nonemployee. <em>(Id., </em>atpp. 361-362.) As August\u2019s \u201cwidow,\u201d Olive was entitled to the pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Waite </em>involved a monthly pension payable to a retired superior court judge. As part of the divorce decree the trial court awarded the judge\u2019s wife <em>or her devisees or heirs </em>one-half of all the pension benefits payable to the retired judge. (6 Cal.3d at p. 466.) The pension benefits were confirmed as community property, but the judgment insofar as it allowed the wife to devise the benefits was reversed. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 472-474.) The court reasoned the state\u2019s concern was for the subsistence of the employee and his spouse, and not some other person or organization. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 473.) Any unequal division of the pension occurring through the earlier death of the wife could be remedied by awarding the entire pension to the judge and compensating the wife out of other community assets. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 473-474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">These cases established the \u201crule\u201d that the community interest in a pension terminates upon the death of <em>either </em>spouse. Subsequent cases have applied the rule in a variety of factual situations without examining its theoretical basis or the validity of its application to different facts. For example, the trial court in the instant case, acknowledging the unfairness of the result, felt compelled to its conclusion by stare decisis. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The doctrine has been criticized by both legal commentators (see <em>Reppy, </em>supra; and Soloman, <em>Beyond, Preemption: Accommodation of the Nonemployee Spouse\u2019s Interest Under ERISA </em>(1980) 31 Hastings L.J. 1021, 1053-1059), and the courts which must apply it. <em>(In re Marriage of Peterson, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d at p. 656.) The primary complaints include its patent unfairness to the nonemployee spouse, its reliance on the implied repeal of statutes prohibiting the unilateral gift of community funds, and its failure to take into account the nature of the death benefits involved. All these criticisms have merit, but the last is the avenue which affords relief in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">None of the cases in which the terminable interest doctrine has been applied involved <em>only </em>the accumulated contributions of the employee spouse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At issue in <em>Benson </em>was a widow\u2019s death benefit, which, although purchased in part with withholdings from the husband\u2019s earnings, was payable for the widow\u2019s life at a rate of one-half the deceased employee spouse\u2019s salary. <em>(Benson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at pp. 358-359.) This pension benefit could involve significantly more than just the employee\u2019s withholdings, depending upon the widow\u2019s life span. Similarly, <em>Waite </em>involved a monthly pension which was unrelated to the employee\u2019s contributions. <em>(Waite, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 465.) Other cases cited by the parties applying the terminable interest doctrine have likewise considered pension packages involving more than just the employee\u2019s contributions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The distinction between accumulated contributions and a pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>sion package purchased with employee contributions may not appear significant when viewed in relation to community property principles, but acquires significance because of the reasoning of the <em>Benson-Waite </em>line of cases. Since we are concerned solely with the employee\u2019s accumulated contributions to the pension system, the public entity\u2019s interest in maintaining the \u201cflexibility\u201d of its pension program, found so compelling in <em>Benson </em>(60 Cal.2d at p. 362), is not present here. The only question is the disposition to be made of the withheld salary remaining in William\u2019s PERS account. We are not determining how PERS is to distribute a surviving spouse\u2019s pension or any other pension. The case is more analogous to the distribution of a savings account containing community funds than the cited pension cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Additional support for our conclusion is found in <em>In re Marriage of Brown </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 838 [126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561, 94 A.L.R.3d 164], wherein the court held that nonvested pension rights derived from employment during marriage are community property subject to division in a dissolution proceeding. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 842.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Brown </em>represents a repudiation of the idea that the nonemployee spouse\u2019s interest in a pension is contingent or not \u201cvested\u201d until he or she actually begins to receive it. <em>(In re Marriage of Peterson, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d at p. 656.) While the holding in <em>Brown </em>can be harmonized with the <em>Benson-Waite </em>rule as to the community interest in the pension while both spouses are alive (see e.g., <em>Phillipson </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 32), it clearly undercuts the rationale of the terminable interest doctrine in terminating a recognized property interest of the nonemployee spouse because the interest is not \u201cvested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The administrative law judge recognized the impact of <em>Brown </em>on the <em>Benson-Waite </em>rule, particularly in <em>In re Marriage of Peterson, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 642, but felt constrained by <em>In re Marriage of Lionberger, supra, </em>97 Cal. App.3d 56, a <em>post-Brown </em>case. Respondent relies heavily on <em>Lionberger, </em>wherein the divorce decree prohibited the employee-husband from electing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>pension option which would decrease his monthly annuity and increase the benefits to the surviving spouse. The court stated, \u201c[b]ecause the divorced wife\u2019s right to share in the pension benefits terminates with the death of the husband, the monetary value of her interest in the pension benefits would be reduced by such an election.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Lionberger, supra, </em>97 Cal. App.3d at p. 67.) <em>Lionberger </em>did not hold the divorced wife\u2019s interest in pension benefits terminated at her former husband\u2019s death but merely assumed this to reinforce its restriction on the former husband\u2019s ability to elect a new pension option. The clear purpose of <em>Lionberger </em>was to avoid the effect of the terminable interest doctrine. We do not consider or accept <em>Lionberger </em>as authority for the assertion that the terminable interest doctrine has survived <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><em>Henn </em>v. <em>Henn </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 323 [161 Cal.Rptr. 502, 605 P.2d 10], in conjunction with <em>In re Marriage of Brown, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, provides persuasive authority that the terminable interest doctrine has passed into legal extinction. The trial court in the instant case recognized <em>Henn </em>\u201cwould help us if we were concerned with the retirement benefits of a living employee.\u201d The court found, however, <em>\u201cHenn </em>does not provide an answer because we are concerned with death benefits.\u201d We disagree. We are concerned with neither retirement benefits nor death benefits, but with the <em>accumulated contributions </em>of William. Nor do we find anything in <em>Henn </em>which limits its holding to living parties. <em>Henn </em>held that a community asset which is not mentioned in the pleadings as community property and is left unadjudicated by the divorce decree is subject to future litigation, the parties, until adjudication, occupying the status of tenants in common.  The rule allowing subsequent litigation is applicable if there was a partial division of the community property or no adjudication at all. (26 Cal.3d at p. 330.) Under <em>Henn, </em>Irene\u2019s community interest in the accumulated contributions became an undivided one-half interest as a tenant in common with her former husband. His death cannot operate to deprive her of this tenancy in common interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">However, it is unnecessary to our disposition in this case to determine whether <em>Brown </em>and <em>Henn </em>have dealt a death blow to the terminable interest doctrine. We have concluded the accumulated contributions of William are distinguishable from the type of pension or death benefits addressed in the <em>Benson-Waite </em>line of cases in that such contributions represent only withheld earnings during marriage. This money was unquestionably community property. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 687.) To hold that William could give his former wife\u2019s interest in the account to his sister by his designation of beneficiary in his pension agreement would violate the antigift provisions of Civil Code section 5125, subdivision (b), and Probate Code section 201.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court has previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>stated these antigift statutes deprive an employee of the power to designate a beneficiary of community property pension benefits other than the nonemployee spouse. <em>(Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Cranston </em>(1962) 211 Cal.App.2d 292, 300 [27 Cal.Rptr. 297]<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> disapproved on another point in <em>Mass </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 612, 627, fh. 9 [39 Cal.Rptr. 739, 394 P.2d 579]; see also <em>Patillo </em>v. <em>Norris </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 209, 217 [135 Cal.Rptr. 210].) To allow William\u2019s designation of his sister as beneficiary to defeat appellant\u2019s interest in the accumulated contributions would be tantamount to a holding that Government Code sections 21332 and 21367.6 (providing for a designated beneficiary for the unpaid accumulated contributions) work an implied repeal of the antigift provisions. This we are unwilling to do.  \u201cRepeals by implication are not favored, and are recognized only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing two potentially conflicting laws. [Citation.] Furthermore, we must assume that when passing a statute the Legislature is aware of existing related laws and intends to maintain a consistent body of rules.\u201d <em>(Fuentes </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 1, 7 [128 Cal.Rptr. 673, 547 P.2d 449].) We find no legislative intent, express or implied, in the statutes governing the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (Gov. Code, \u00a7 20000 et seq.) to repeal the antigift provisions concerning the community property interest in a deceased employee\u2019s accumulated contributions to his PERS account.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead we conclude the nonemployee\u2019s community property interest in the accumulated contributions can be harmonized with the employee\u2019s power to designate a beneficiary by limiting the employee\u2019s power to his community property interest in the remaining contributions. In this way, each statute is given effect, and the unfairness perceived by Justice Kaus in <em>Peterson </em>can be avoided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We must further consider how much of the remaining funds are subject to appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">William was employed and accrued retirement benefits for 347 months. Appellant and William were married for 332 months of this period. The fraction of 332/347 thus gives the community property interest in the accumulated contributions according to the \u201ctime rule\u201d method. (See <em>In re Marriage of Judd </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 515, 522 [137 Cal.Rptr. 318].) Neither party contests the validity of this fraction, but they argue over the total amount to which it should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Appellant urges the fraction formula should be applied to William\u2019s total contributions to the PERS account, $24,827.45, which yields a community interest in the account of $19,066.15, of which her one-half share is $9,533.07. She contends this calculation results in full satisfaction of her community property interest without prejudice to PERS as the $18,773.37 in remaining unpaid contributions is more than sufficient to cover her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">PERS on behalf of Isabel Wall urges the fraction formula should be applied to the $18,773.37 remaining in the account, as the system has been discharged from liability for any amounts previously paid by the operation of Government Code section 21210.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree. Though the accumulated contributions retained their community character while in the hands of PERS, no claim was made by appellant to PERS who apparently remained unaware of such claim until after the death of William. There is no basis to hold the funds paid out to William were exclusively from his share of the asset. PERS had no duty to so segregate the funds and cannot be held accountable for failing to have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Finally, we note each party characterizes the result sought by the other as \u201cunjust. \u201d At the conclusion of <em>Henn, </em>the Court discussed the inequity of allowing a late claim on community property and stated its confidence the problem could be addressed by limiting equitable relief through the defense of laches. <em>(Henn, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 333.) We feel this discussion is appropriate to the limitation we place on the relief accorded appellant. Having allowed William to draw on the community funds without complaint during his retirement, it seems inequitable to allow her to now claim her share of those funds to the detriment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of William\u2019s designated beneficiary. Accordingly, we hold the \u201ctime rule\u201d fraction formula for determining the community interest in William\u2019s PERS account should be applied to the accumulated contributions remaining unpaid in the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Regan, Acting P. J., and Evans, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\">Government Code section 21332 defines \u201coptional settlement one\u201d as follows: \u201cOptional settlement one consists of the right to have a retirement allowance paid him until his death and if he dies before he receives in annuity payments the amount of his accumulated contributions at retirement, to have the balance at death paid to his beneficiary or estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\">For a comprehensive discussion of the doctrine, see Reppy, <em>Community and Separate Interests in Pensions and Social Security Benefits After Marriage of Brown and ERISA </em>(1978) 25 UCLA L.Rev. 417, 443-482.
