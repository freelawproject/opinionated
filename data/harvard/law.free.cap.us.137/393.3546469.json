Tour petitioners show that said indictment is a joint indictment against these petitioners and others in said indictment named, charging them with conspiracy and murder. Tour petitioners allege that their- liberty is unlawfully and illegally restrained under said indictment; and they further show that their custody, under said indictment by said marshal is unlawful and- illegal because the matters and things set forth and charged in the said indictment and the several counts thereof do not constitute any offence or offences against the laws of the United States and do not come within the purview, true intent and meaning of the act of Congress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>approved May 31,1870, entitled An act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States, etc., nor any part thereof, and because the matters and things in the said indictment and in the various counts thereof set forth and charged do not constitute any offence or offences cognizable-in the said Circuit Court and do not come within its power- and jurisdiction, and because the said indictment and each and every of the various counts thereof are too vague, general, insufficient and uncertain to constitute an indictment according to the Constitution of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\">Wherefore your petitioners pray that the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>may issue out of this court, directed to the said W.

They have not invoked the action of the Circuit Court upon the sufficiency of the indictment by a motion to quash or otherwise, but ask leave to file in this court a petition for a writ'of <em>habeas corpus, </em>upon the ground that the matters and things set forth and charged do not constitute any offence or offences under the laws of the United States, or cognizable in the Circuit Court, and that for other reasons the indictment cannot be sustained.
