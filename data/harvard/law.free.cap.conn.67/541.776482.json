If sustainable at all it must be by virtue of the general provisions of that instrument relating to the health of the community, or derived from the charter as an implied police power necessary to give effect to some express provision therein. The authority however to enact a penal by-law, is one not to be inferred from language in any respect ambiguous or doubtful. Dillon\u2019s Munic. Corp., \u00a7\u00a7 89-91; Beach Pub.

The legislature having in its wisdom decided what occupations should thus be burdened, the city of Bridgeport cannot enlarge the scope of its licensing power, by resorting to the general welfare clauses of its charter. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>34 Am.

And it is not sufficient that it is simply convenient to exercise the expressly granted power, it must be indispensable. <em>New London </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>22 Conn., 551; 2 Dillon Munic. Corp., 173. This ordinance, in all of its essential provisions, is in contravention of the laws of the State, and therefore invalid. By the provisions of Chap. 235 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Public Acts of 1895, which Act went into effect subsequent to the charter of the city of Bridgeport, it was determined that the standard of purity of all food products (the term \u201c'food \u201d including \u201cmilk \u201d) should be fixed by the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station, when not fixed by statute. The ordinance in question attempts to fix another and quite different standard; one that the legislature of 1895 repudiated as impracticable and unjust. (See Pub. Acts 1895, Chap. 245, repealed by Pub. Acts 1895, Chap. 320.) In fact, the doctrine that a statute and an ordinance covering precisely the same subject, may be in operation concurrently, has been repudiated in this State. <em>Southport </em>v. Ogden, 23 Conn., 131; <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>36 id., 217; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>41 id., 590. The ordinance is also vicious because under the guise of a sanitary measure, it seeks to wrest a revenue from those who bring this farm product into the city for sale. <em>Grumm </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>84 Ga., 365 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stodder, </em>2 Cush., 573. If the ordinance operates in restraint of legitimate trade, it is void. <em>Chaddock </em>v. <em>Day, 4 </em>L. R. A. 809. If the penalty is oppressive and unreasonable, the ordinance is rendered thereby invalid. 1 Dillon Munic. Corp., \u00a7\u00a7 319, 320, 327, 321; Cooley, Const.

The courts will not interfere with the legitimate exercise by municipal bodies of their police powers by which the peace, health, comfort, and general welfare are secured or promoted. <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Ricard, </em>24 N. J. Eq., 169; <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>61 Md., 259; <em>Littlefield </em>v. <em>State, </em>42 Neb., 223. Where a business is beneficial or necessary, but yet liable to cause danger, under certain conditions, to the public health, it can be regulated and those engaged in it can be required to take out licenses and to submit to an inspection of their business. This is far differ\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ent from an attempt to prohibit such beneficial or necessary business. <em>Train </em>v. <em>Boston Disinfecting Co., </em>144 Mass., 528. A distinction is to be carefully observed between an ordinance like the one in question and ordinances which, under the guise of a license, in effect impose a tax. Such latter are void as attempted assumptions of legislative powers of taxation. <em>North Hudson Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>41 N. J. Law, 71; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Avenue R. R.

The general provision of the charter conferring power to pass bylaws, \u201c relative to any and all other subjects that shall be deemed necessary and proper for the protection of the health, property and lives of the citizens,\u201d contains the authority to pass by-laws relative to the sale of milk and require licenses therefor. 1 Dill. Mun. Corp., 4th Ed., \u00a7 315, note 1, p. 393: <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>33 N. H., 424; <em>Husen </em>v. <em>City of Rock Island, </em>128 111., 465; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>South Bend, </em>85 Ind., 277. Chapter 235 of the Public Acts of 1895 fixes no standard at all, and that claim of the defendant is wholly without foundation. The ordinance and the statute do not cover the same ground. The ordinance (\u00a7\u00a7 3 and 6), fixes a standard of purity for milk to be sold in Bridgeport; the statute does not. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>63 Conn., 248.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b557-5\">Baldwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5n\">The charter of the city of Bridgeport, which went into effect July 1st, 1895, authorized the common council to make ordinances, not inconsistent with law, relative to commerce; to the inspection of produce brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>into the city for sale, and the election of inspectors for that purpose; to the sale or offering for sale of unwholesome produce of all kinds; to \u201c licensing oartmen, truckmen, hackmen, butchers, bakers, petty grocers, or hucksters, and common victualers, under such restrictions and limitations as said common council may deem necessary and proper; \u201d to the health of the city; and to \u201c any and all other subjects that shall be deemed necessary and proper for the protection and preservation of the health, propertj\u2019-, and lives of the citizens.\u201d Special Acts of 1895, p. 532, \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 2658 to 2664 are grouped under the heading of \u201cAdulteration of Milk.\u201d A Public Act went into effect August 1st, 1895, to regulate the manufacture and sale of food products, which classes as food, under that description, \u201cevery article used for food and drink by man, horses, or cattle.\u201d Public Acts of 1895, p. 578, Chap. 235, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">General Statutes, \u00a7 2661, prohibits the sale or offer for sale of impure or adulterated milk. Section 2660 forbids the sale of any milk from which any cream has been removed, except out of a can, vessel, or package, to which is affixed, not more than six inches from the top, a metallic tag stamped \u201cSkimmed Milk,\u201d in letters not less than an inch in height. For any violation of these provisions the offender may be fined not more than seven dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The Act of 1895 (\u00a7 8) declares that any article of food shall be deemed adulterated if, among other things, any substance be mixed with it so as to lower or injuriously affect its quality or strength, or if any valuable constituent has been wholly or in part abstracted, or if it is in any part the product of a diseased animal; and that the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station shall make analyses of food products on sale which it is suspected may be adulterated, and \u201c may adopt or fix standards of purity, quality, or strength, when such standards are not specified or fixed by statute,\u201d and when it finds by analysis that adulterated food products have been on sale within the State, shall notify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the grand juror or prosecuting attorney of the town in which they were found. The sale or offer for sale of adulterated food, by one who knows it to be adulterated, and does not disclose this to the purchaser, is made punishable by a fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">At the same session of the General Assembly, two days later, another statute was enacted, but repealed the following week (Public Acts of 1895, pp. 588, 664), which declared the term \u201cadulterated milk,\u201d as used in the statute laws of the State, to have the following meaning: \u201c 1. milk containing more than eighty-eight per centum of water or fluids; 2. milk containing less than twelve per centum of milk solids; 8. milk containing less than three per centum of fats ; 4. milk drawn from cows within fifteen days before or five days after parturition; 5. milk drawn from animals fed on distillery waste or on any substance in a state of fermentation or putrefaction or on any unhealthy food; 6. milk drawn from cows kept in a crowded or unhealthy condition ; 7. milk from which any part of the cream has been removed; 8. milk which has been diluted with water or any other fluid, or to which has been added or into which has been introduced any foreign substance whatever; 9. all adulterated milk shall be deemed unclean, unhealthy, impure, and unwholesome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">It is impossible to compare the ordinance of the city of Bridgeport with these statutory provisions, without seeing that in many respects they cover the same ground, and cover it in a different way.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The ordinance (\u00a7 6) defines precisely adulterated milk, and gives conclusive effect to an analysis made by the chemist employed by the local board of health. The General Assembly, in 1895, first adopting and then repealing a somewhat similar definition, finally left the matter largely in the hands of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The sale of skimmed milk, by the city ordinance, is to be from cans bearing the words \u201c Skimmed Milk \u201d conspicuously stamped upon the side; by \u00a7 2660 of the General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>utes it is to be from cans bearing a metallic tag on which the same words are stamped.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The pecuniary penalties imposed by the ordinance cannot be less than $50, nor more than $100. Under the general laws, they may be considerably less, and for some offenses more, besides an additional liability to imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The public statutes leave the business of a milkman open to all, on equal terms, throughout the State; only imposing certain regulations upon those who may undertake it, and enforcing them, when necessary, by proceedings of a criminal nature, resulting in a sentence proportioned to the gravity of the offense. The ordinance excludes every one who has not received a license from the local health officer, from participating in it, within the city of Bridgeport, under pain of a fixed pecuniary forfeiture, which, in case of a second offense is to be doubled and to entail a loss of the license previously granted. Of these differences between the provisions of the by-laws in question and the general statutes, that last mentioned, unless found to be warranted by the terms of the city charter, is decisive of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Under the Constitution of this State, even the General Assembly has not unrestricted power to provide for the grant or refusal of licenses, without which a citizen cannot engage in what is one of the eommon occupations of life. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conlon, </em>65 Conn., 478. It has confided to the Common Council of Bridgeport the right to make ordinances, relative to licensing cartmen, truckmen, hackmen, butchers, bakers, petty grocers or hucksters, and common victualers. Petty grocers or hucksters and eommon victualers may, as part of their business, sell milk ; but the ordinance in question relates to licenses for all who sell milk, without regard to whether they are petty grocers, hucksters or common victualers, or not. It therefore goes beyond the power specifically conferred, and the \u201c general welfare \u201d clause, with which \u00a7 41 of the charter concludes, must be read with strict reference to what precedes it. The right to license the pursuit of a lawful business, which, as usually carried on, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>not endanger the public health or safety, and thus to limit the number of those who may engage in it, is one of the highest powers of sovereignty. When conferred upon a municipal corporation, the grant cannot be extended by any doubtful implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">After giving full force to all the provisions of \u00a7 41, we are brought to the conclusion that it is, at least, doubtful whether the charter authorized the licensing of milkmen. It therefore did not authorize it; and that part of the ordinance was void upon which the complaint in the case before us was based. <em>Crofut </em>v. Danbury, 65 Conn., 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">There is error in the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In his opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
