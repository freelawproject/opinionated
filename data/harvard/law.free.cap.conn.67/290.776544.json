This envelope with its contents was offered in evidence by the State, in connection with the testimony of said witnesses. The accused objected to its admission because of the manner in which it had been found and taken from his office; claiming that the seizure was in violation of \u00a7 8 of Art. 1 of the State Constitution, and that its admission would be to compel him to give evidence against himself contrary to \u00a7 9 of the same article. The trial court found that the accused was bound by the consent given by his agent, that the search of his premises was not unreasonable, and that the taking was not a seizure, and overruled the objection and admitted the evidence. <em>Held </em>that even upon the assumption that the act of the police officers was a trespass, the constitutional provisions referred to did not render the evidence in question inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b300-7\">Evidence otherwise pertinent and admissible will not be rejected because it was taken from the possession of the accused by a trespass.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b300-8\">One accused of crime, who chooses to testify in his own behalf, subjects himself to the same rules and tests as are applied to other witnesses; and the extent to which he may be cross -examined, where such inquiry tends to show that he has been guilty of willful falsehood in his direct examination, is largely within the discretion of the trial court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b300-9\">Experts called to testify as to their opinion of the hand-writing of disputed documents when compared with admitted or proved standards, cannot be cross-examined as to other writings of unknown authorship, not pertinent to the case, merely to test their ability as experts.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AXRk\">[Argued January 9th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Alm\">decided February 21st, 1896.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-10\">Information for arson, brought to the Superior Court in Hartford County and tried to the jury before Prentice, <em>J.; </em>verdict and judgment of guilty, and appeal by the accused for alleged errors in the rulings and charge of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AC4\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-11\">The defendant was tried for the crime of arson at the June criminal term of the Superior Court in Hartford county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>when the jury disagreed.

O. Jackson, who testified, among other things, that he was, and for many years had been, chief of the letter-carriers of the Hartford post-office; that between September, 1892, and November 15th, 1894, when he established an office of his own as a practicing dentist, his hours of absence from official duty were passed as a student and practitioner in the office of the accused, who was a practicing dentist in Hartford ; that during all that period and down to the time of the latter\u2019s arrest, he, the accused, hired and had a box, No. 1003, in the Hartford post-office, which box was used by him the accused, in the conduct of a clandestine correspondence with a Mrs. Drake; that said box was hired under the .assumed name of R. M. Thane; that about March 1st, 1893, the accused wrote in the presence of the witness, in a disguised hand, and signed Mrs. R. M. Thane, an order to the post-office authorities, directing that all letters received for the addresses of \u201c Mrs. Mary L. Warden,\u201d or \u201c Alleen E. Belton,\u201d be placed in said box, and gave said order to the witness to be duly filed at the post-office, which the witness did on the said March 1st; that said order continued in force until after March 15th last; that said names were names assumed by the accused for the purpose of this correspondence with Mrs. Drake, and that they represented him and no other person; that shortly after the witness entered the accused\u2019s office the latter gave the witness a key to said box and requested him, as he went to and fro, to get and bring to the accused all mail appearing therein; that witness did so thereafter and down to said March 15th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">Said witness further testified that the accused had at his office \u2014 being a portion of the burned premises described in the information \u2014 two pictures of Mrs. Drake; one a cabinet photograph and the other a tin-type, which he kept in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>closet behind a partition; that the accused had shown the witness these pictures upon one or two occasions; that upon one occasion the accused- had told him to save them in the event of a fire; that upon a later occasion, <em>i. </em>e., in August, 1894, the accused had told him that he, the accused, was about to go upon a trip to Old Point Comfort with Mrs. Drake, and that if anything happened to him so that he didn\u2019t come'back, to get the two pictures and put them out of the way; and that the accused went away and was gone about ten days ; that early in the morning following the fire, being March 15th, last, the witness met the accused in front of the burned building; that during the conversation the accused told the witness that there was a letter containing some cards in the box, and asked him to get it and keep it until he, the accused, called for it; that the witness, upon arriving at the post-office, found in said box a letter addressed to \u201c Mrs. R. M. Thane, P. O. Box 1003, Hartford, Conn.,\u201d and bearing two stamps and the post-mark, \u201c Hartford, Conn., Mar. 14, 10 P. M., \u2019 95,\u201d signifying the time it was mailed; that the envelope of this letter was about the size and shape of a cabinet photograph, and that the external face was a piece of brown paper pasted over the whole surface of an old envelope which had been addressed to the accused; that the witness kept this letter at his office until Sunday the 17th, when the accused, being at the witness\u2019 office, was asked by the witness if he had saved the photographs of Mrs. Drake from the fire, and he replied that they were what was in the letter the witness had; that on Friday the 22d (the witness having meanwhile, as the result of events which had transpired, turned over to the authorities the information in his possession) he, for the purposes of the prosecution, handed the letter which had remained in his possession and was in the same condition in which it had been received, and unopened, to Mr. Calhoun, the prosecuting officer of the city; that upon Saturday, the 23d, the letter, still apparently in the same condition, was returned by Mr. Calhoun to the witness with instructions to return it to the accused if he should ask for it, for the purpose of seeing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>what he would do with it; that upon Sunday, the 24th, the accused came to the witness\u2019 office and made a detailed confession of the crime charged in the information, and in connection therewith a statement of his movements and whereabouts during the evening preceding the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">The first portion of this alleged confession, with its introduction, was testified to by Jackson in the following language :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">\u201c Dr. Griswold took his inventory out of his pocket and began looking it over. I said, \u2018Doctor, I think you are taking a great deal of risk to swear to all that stuff which you know was not there.\u2019 He said, \u2018 I am taking no risk at all; because such stuff as was saved I put into the inventory at a fair value, and such stuff as I didn\u2019t have I can say was burned up and went down that hole.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 I says, \u2018Doctor, they are liable to suspect you of setting the fire if you swear to all that.\u2019 He said, \u2018 They can\u2019t suspect me, because I went home at half-past nine that night, and the fire didn\u2019t break out until half-past twelve; I can prove that by Gallivan, who went with me as far as Windsor street, and Mr. Mahon, who crossed over and spoke with me, and by my wife, who will testify I was home by ten o\u2019clock.\u2019 I says, \u2018 Doctor, did you go directly home from your office ? \u2019 He says, \u2018 Yes, I did.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Didn\u2019t you go to the post-office ? \u2019 He said, \u2018 No, I did not.\u2019 I said, \u2018 When did you mail the letter containing the photographs of Mrs. Drake ? \u2019 He said, \u2018 I mailed them the next morning after the fire.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Doctor, you are mistaken, that envelope is post-marked 10 P. M. the night of the fire.\u2019 He started and turned pale, and he could not speak for a few moments; when he did speak he said, \u2018 Well, Jack, I may as well own up to you, I am in your hands; that letter was a loop-hole that I never thought of, and for the first time I have realized the truth of the old saying that women, rum, and fast horses are the ruination of many a man.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">Said witness further testified that at the conclusion of this interview of the 24th, the accused asked for the letter, and that it was then, pursuant to the instructions of Mr. Calhoun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>and for the purposes previously stated, returned to him with the suggestion or advice that he had better burn it, to which the accused replied that he would do so; and that said envelope was then unmutilated and in apparently the same condition in which it was taken from the post-office, and had the superscription, stamps, and post-office marks thereon, and in no way effaced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">Officers Umberfield and O\u2019Malley were also sworn as witnesses, and testified that immediately after the accused\u2019s arrest, which was made upon the street about noon, Wednesday the 27th, they were, without knowledge of the accused and without a warrant of search, dispatched by the chief of police with instructions to search the accused\u2019s then office, to discover what might be there of an incriminating character, and went; that when they reached the office, which was open, they entered and found one Butler in apparent charge, and told him who they were and their errand; that they asked him if he was in charge of the office, that he replied that he was, and that he told them to go ahead; that they then made a search of the-office, Butler at times assisting and aiding them ; that they found, among other things, this envelope upon a shelf in a closet, concealed under some books ; that it was still unopened, but in other respects the same as it was in court, to wit, with the post-marks and stamps removed and the face of the envelope and address partially mutilated. The State offered the envelope and the two inclosed pictures in evidence. Counsel for the accused objected to their admission, upon the ground that the seizure of them by the police and their production in evidence was in violation of the constitutional guaranty that the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and possessions, from unreasonable searches or seizures; and in violation of the further constitutional provision that an accused person shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">Counsel for the accused then asked that the court, before ruling, permit them to put the accused upon the stand for the purpose of showing that said Butler was not, in fact, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>charge of said office at the time of said search. Dr. Griswold thereupon was examined by his counsel, and cross-examined upon the subject. The court found upon the evidence that said Butler, who was a student in the accused\u2019s office, was in charge of it at said time, and admitted said envelope and pictures. Counsel for the accused excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">The accused having denied when upon the witness stand that he had directed said envelope containing the pictures to himself under the assumed name of Mrs. R. M. Thane, and that he hired or had said post-office box 1008 for himself under the assumed name of R. M. Thane, and that the letters directed to R. M. Thane or Mrs. R. M. Thane, post-office box 1008, and which were placed in said box, were intended for him, or were taken therefrom by him or delivered to him for himself, and that he had anything to do with said box except to forward the mail therein to Mr. or Mrs. R. M. Thane, and sometimes to send letters to Mrs. Drake; and having denied that he had ever gone under the assumed name of R. M. Thane or Mrs. R. M. Thane, or used said names or either of them; and having testified that there were such persons as R. M. Thane or Mrs. R. M. Thane, although he did not know where they were and never knew where the}\u2019 lived, and that these persons were the ones for whom said box was rented and to whom the mail thereto was forwarded ; and having testified that said envelope containing said pictures was addressed by him to the address of Mrs. R. M. Thane, and thus directly deposited by him in the post-office at the request of Mrs. Drake, who had a key to\u00fcaid. box, and that said envelope and contents were intended for her and were to be taken from said box by her, \u2014the attorney for the State upon cross-examination, for the purpose of proving that the testimony of the accused that he hadn\u2019t assumed the name of Mr. or Mrs. R. M. Thane, and that he hadn\u2019t directed said envelope to himself trader the assumed name of Mrs. R. M. Thane, was false; and for the purpose of identifying him as R. M. Thane, and for the purpose of disproving the testimony of the accused that there were such persons other than himself, as R. M. Thane or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Mrs. R. M. Thane, and as being pertinent to the examination which had preceded, asked the accused the following questions, to some of which counsel for the accused objected, upon the ground that they were irrelevant and immaterial.

To prove that the letter was in the handwriting of Jackson, the accused introduced as an expert in handwriting one Mr. Carvalho of New York, and presented to him certain admitted specimens of the handwriting of Jackson, which were laid in by the accused to be used as standards with which to compare the handwriting of said anonymous letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">Upon the rebuttal, and for the purpose of rebutting the evidence of Mr. Carvalho that the writer of said standards and of said anonymous letter were one and the same person, the State introduced Messrs. Ames of New York and Fairbanks of Boston as witnesses, both of whom testified that they had for many years given a special study to the subject of handwriting and of the comparisons of handwritings, and had during their experience examined hundreds of cases of disputed handwriting for the purpose of giving their opinions in court as to the genuineness of such writings. These witnesses, having qualified as experts upon handwriting, were allowed by the court to testify as such experts. They testified that they had made a careful examination of said standards of comparison and of said anonymous letter, and a critical comparison of said letter with said standards, and that in their opinion the writer of said standards did not write and could not have written said anonymous letter. Said opinions of said experts were based solely upon the comparison of said anonymous letter with said standards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-7\">The accused having denied that he wrote the post-office order hereinbefore described, and having denied all knowledge of it, the State put in evidence admitted specimens of the handwriting of the accused, to be used as standards of comparison with which to compare the handwriting of said post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>office order, and asked said experts, Ames and Fairbanks, upon rebuttal, for their opinion, from such comparison, as to' whether the handwriting of the post-office order was or was not that of the writer of the standards.

S., 616. The cases relied upon by the State do not touch the case at bar. Undoubtedly concealed weapons, liquors held for illegal sale, poisons, counterfeit money, burglar\u2019s tools, etc. may be seized and used in evidence ; but these things are not \u201c papers.\u201d Ordronaux, Const.

Arson at Hartford in 1895 and adultery at Old Point Comfort in 1894, are distinct and remote, both in time, surroundings, and character. <em>People </em>v. Sharp, 107 N.

The questions asked by the accused of the two experts \u2014 Ames and Fairbanks \u2014 to test their competency, were properly excluded.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-H\">The defendant was tried to the jury upon ap information charging him with the crime of arson, and in another count with setting fire to the same building with the intent to defraud an insurance company. Among other testimony, the State offered evidence of certain acts done by the accused showing preparation for the fire, as well as his subsequent conduct apparently influenced by the fact that he had set the fire or had known that it was going to happen. To illustrate and explain this conduct, the State offered in evidence a small package consisting of the envelope with the marks upon it, and its contents, which are described in the finding. It is admitted \u2014 and the fact is so \u2014 that this package was in its nature pertinent and admissible to be laid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>before the jury, and in connection with it the other testimony in the case became highly incriminatory evidence against the accused. His counsel objected to its being shown in evidence. The counsel said this article ought not to be exhibited in evidence to the jury, because of the manner in which it was found in the room of the accused and taken therefrom by the police officers; that such taking and production in evidence was in violation of the eighth and ninth sections of article 1 of the Constitution of this State. When this objection was made the trial judge excused the jury, and in their absence proceeded himself to hear the evidence upon the question so raised. The accused testified and was cross-examined. Other witnesses were also heard, and upon the evidence so taken, the judge found that the office of the accused, at the time when this envelope was found by the police officers and taken away by them, was in the care and possession of one Butler, as the servant and agent of the accused ; and that said Butler gave permission to the officers to enter the office, to make the said search therein, assisted them in making the search and consented to the taking away by them of the said articles. The judge thereupon admitted them to be laid in evidence before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">This finding is, in effect, a decision that the search was not an unreasonable one, and that there was no \u201cseizure \u201d of anything ; and that the accused must be holden to have consented to the taking away by the officers of the said articles. The evidence upon which this finding was made is not before us, and we are not able to review the finding, even if for any cause it was desirable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Counsel for the accused argue that this finding, although it shows that Butler was in charge of the defendant\u2019s office at the time, does not show that he was the agent of the defendant for the purpose of admitting the police officers and consenting to the search and to the taking away of the said articles. We must assume, notwithstanding this argument, that the precise objection made in this court was made in the Superior Court and decided adverse^ to the defendant; otherwise the defendant has no standing to be heard here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>This finding of the Superior Court might, perhaps, be treated as decisive of the first reason of appeal, because it shows that there has been no violation of the Constitution of this State, or of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We do not, however, place our decision on this ground alone. A constitution is that body of rules and maxims in accordance with which the powers of sovereignty are habitually exercised; and its provisions are the rule of conduct for those branches of the government which exercise the sovereign power. Both the sections cited by the defendant, have reference to the security of the citizen as to his possessions and as to his person. The eighth section forbids the legislature to enact any statute, and the courts from passing any rule, which would authorize any unreasonable search or seizure of the goods of a citizen. And the ninth forbids any legislation or rule of court which would compel any one accused of a crime to give evidence against himself. In this respect neither of the sections so cited have any application to this case. The act of the police was not directed, nor is it sought to be justified, by any statute or by any rule of any court. The theory of the defendant is that that act was a trespass. For the present purposes that theory may be granted to be the true one. And what then ? The police officers would be liable in a proper action to pay to the defendant all damage they had done him. But that consequence does not affect the question now before us. It does, however, show that the eighth section of article 1 has no bearing upon the facts of this case. Indeed the defendant hardly claims that the eighth section alone affects his objection. But he does claim that a search or a seizure may be so made, that the production in evidence of any of his goods or possessions taken, is to compel the accused to furnish evidence against himself; and in that way to become a violation of the ninth section of the first article of the Constitution. This might be the result where the private papers of a suspected person were seized in order to be read to the jury as incriminating evidence against him. To reach this result the word \u201c papers \u201d in the eighth section of article 1 must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>taken to mean writings, \u2014 not pieces, of paper as mere inanimate goods, but papers on which are written or printed words that may be shown in evidence as the words of the suspected man. In this sense a search or seizure of the \u201c papers \u201d of a citizen might be unreasonable, because it might lead to a violation of the provisions of the ninth section. In <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>The U. S., </em>116 U. S., 616, an Act of Congress was held to be unconstitutional, because it required the party to produce his books, invoices and papers, and because the \u201c entries \u201d in the books, invoices and papers so produced, were to be made evidence against him. See also Ordronaux, Const. Legislation, 247; 1 Hare\u2019s Amer. Const. Law, 531. It was against the seizure of \u201c papers,\u201d using that word in the sense just mentioned, that the vigor of Loud Camden\u2019s opinion in <em>Entinck </em>v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr., 1029, was directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The package here shown to the jury was an envelope with certain inclosures, \u2014 a simple piece of the defendant\u2019s personal property; having of itself no voice or meaning so far as his guilt or innocence was concerned, any more than if it had been a lump of clay, or a block of senseless wood. It made no statement. It gave no evidence. Its presence or absence on the trial, if it had stood alone, would have signified nothing. It was his conduct in respect to this piece of \u25a0property, both before and after the fire, his extreme solicitude to save it from destruction, which was incriminating. This conduct was detailed to the jury by sundry witnesses, and to their testimony no objection was made. We think no constitutional provision was violated by permitting the jury to \u25a0see the envelope. And even if it had been taken from the possession of the defendant by a trespass, as he claims, that would have been no valid objection to its admissibility. 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., \u00a7 254 a ; Wharton\u2019s Crim.

The statute of this State permits any person on trial for a criminal offense, at his own option to testify. The defendant chose to avail himself of this privilege. By so doing he subjected himself to the same rules, and was called upon to submit to the same tests, which could by law be applied to other witnesses. Having availed himself of the privilege of the statute, he assumed the burden necessarily incident to the position. Having elected to become a witness in his own behalf, he occupied for the time being the position of any other witness, with all its duties and obligations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>35 Conn., 203; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>52 N. H., 459; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>163 Mass., 411, 431; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>97 id., 545; <em>McGarry </em>v. <em>The People, 2 </em>Lans., 227; <em>Connors </em>v. <em>The People, </em>50 N. Y., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">All cross-examination is intended to afford the jury or the court a test by which to weigh the testimony that the witness has given. In this case the cross-examination of the defendant tended to show that he had made a willfully untrue statement in his direct examination. It was proper that the questions should go far enough to make it entirely clear whether there had been such an untrue statement or not. We think it was fairly within the discretion of the court to permit the questions to which objection was made; not because they tended to show adultery in another State, but because they tended to show perjury on the trial then in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The questions asked in cross-examination of the witnesses Ames and Fairbanks were properly excluded, and for the reason assigned by the trial court: that they would raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>collateral issue. Take one instance to illustrate all: The witness Fairbanks was shown a collection of slips of paper, on each of which there was handwriting, and he was asked, \u201c How many handwritings do you find there ? \u201d These pieces of paper had not been in the case; the writing on them was not admitted or claimed to be that of the defendant or of the witness Jackson. Any possible answer that the witness might have given to the question would have been utterly meaningless, unless other evidence was admitted to show that the answer was incorrect. And then the door would be opened to an unlimited inquiry, collateral to the question on which the jury was to pass. 1 Greenl.

I concur in the foregoing opinion, except with respect to its treatment of the point of constitutional law, which would have arisen, had not the defendant, by his authorized agent, consented to the search of his rooms and the seizure of his papers and effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The Constitution of Connecticut was ordained, as its preamble declares, in order more effectually to define, secure, and perpetuate the liberties, rights, and privileges which its people had derived from their ancestors, and among the \u201cgreat and essential principles of liberty and free government\u201d which they thought it necessary to include in-their Declaration of Rights, is that defined in its eighth section, in the following terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u201c The people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">This constitutes one of the fundamental conditions under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>which the powers of government in this State can be exercised by those in authority. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conlon, </em>65 Conn., 478, 489. The language in which it is expressed was probably adopted from that in the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Mississippi (Art. 1, \u00a7 9, 2 Poole\u2019s Charters and Constitutions, 1055), which had been framed in the preceding year, and is somewhat more precise and explicit than that of the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States. To determine what searches and seizures are to be deemed unreasonable, we must look back to events, then not far distant, in the history of the English people. New judicial precedents had been more familiar in the American colonies than those furnished by the decisions of Lord Mansfield and Lord Camden, which denied the validity of general search warrants. In one of these, the court had said that \u201c papers are often the dearest property a man can have,\u201d and that \u201c the law never forces evidence from the party in whose power it is.\u201d <em>Entinck </em>v. Carrington, 2 Wils., 275, 291, 292. That case was the leading authority upon which, in 1814, this court relied in holding that the magistrate who signed and the officer who served a general warrant to search for certain stolen goods in any suspected place in the town of Wilton, and to arrest all persons suspected of the theft, were both- liable as trespassers to a person arrested. <em>Grumon </em>v. Raymond, 1 Conn., 40. It is not, says Judge Cooley, \u201c allowable to invade one\u2019s privacy for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence against him, except in a few special cases where that which is the subject of the crime is supposed to be concealed, and the public or the complainant has an interest in it or in its destruction. . . . The fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, found also in many State constitutions, would clearly preclude the seizure of one\u2019s papers in order to obtain evidence against him ; and the spirit of the fifth amendment \u2014 that no person shall be compelled in a criminal case to give evidence against himself \u2014 would also forbid such seizure.\u201d Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. (6th Ed.), p. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">It does not seem to me that the prohibitions of the eighth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>section of our Declarations of Rights can be properly read as applying only to acts of legislation or rules of court. The powers of the State are distributed (Const., Art. II.) between three separate magistracies, to one of which are confided those which are executive. The supreme executive power is vested in the Governor (Art. IV.), and among the inferior executive offices for which provision is made is that of sheriff (Art. IV., \u00a7 20). . The police officers appointed by our different municipal corporations are, as fully as the sheriff of the county, officers of the law, charged with the execution of a trust confided to them for and by authority of the State. <em>State ex rel. Rylands </em>v. Pinkerman, 63 Conn., 176, 182. They represent its sovereignty, within their proper sphere of action. They are its immediate agents for the detection and arrest of offenders against its laws. The English precedents which established the doctrine upon which these constitutional guaranties are based, grew out of arrests and seizures made under warrants issued by direction of executive officers of the government, and not-resting upon any statute or rule of court. It is from that quarter, it appears to me, more than from any other,, that danger is to be anticipated. The common law was ready to supply a remedy for any unreasonable search or seizure, by an action of trespass against the individuals who made it. Our Declaration of Rights would be meaningless if it did not seek to do more than this. Its guaranties were designed to protect the citizen against the State, that is, against any and every officer claiming to act under its authority; and to do so in a way that would repress the wrongful act most efficiently. Upon the trial of a civil action between private individuals, either can introduce any relevant paper in evidence, notwithstanding he may have obtained it in a manner not warranted by law. <em>Legatt </em>v. Tollervey, 14 East, 302; <em>Jordan </em>v. Lewis, ibid., 306. If the constitutional guaranty now under consideration is to be liberally interpreted in favor of the citizen, it would be difficult to apply the principle of such decisions to criminal prosecutions, supported by proof of papers illegally seized for that purpose, in the defendant\u2019s house, by public officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>acting professedly as such, without seeming to allow the State to profit by its own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">What was taken by the policemen from the defendant\u2019s rooms was a large envelope, containing a photograph and a tintype. Evidence was introduced by the State tending to show that it had been originally addressed by the defendant to \u201c Mrs. R. M. Thane, P. O. Box 1003, Hartford, Conn.,\u201d and put in the mail by him at about 10 p. M. on the night of the fire, in order to preserve it from being burned; that this box No. 1003 was hired by him under the assumed name of R. M. Thane; that the envelope was taken by his agent, at his request, from the box the next morning, and afterwards given to him at his request; that it then bore a post-mark of 10 p.
