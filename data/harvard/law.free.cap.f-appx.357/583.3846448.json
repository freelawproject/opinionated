The sentence was within the properly calculated advisory guidelines sentencing range and is thus presumed reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Gomez contends that using his pri- or \u201ccrime of violence\u201d conviction to increase his offense level and criminal history score was \u201ceffectively double-counting.\u201d This contention fails because the relevant Guideline specifically allows this kind of counting. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6) (Nov.2008); <em>see United States v. Gaytan, </em>74 F.3d 545, 560 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201cDouble counting is impermissible only where the guidelines at issue prohibit it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">As Gomez concedes, this court has foreclosed his argument that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply where the relevant Guideline is not empirically grounded. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). His arguments concerning his personal and criminal history merely ask us to substitute his assessment of the evidence and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors for that of the district court. This approach is contrary to the deferential review dictated by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Gomez fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness or to show that his sentence was unreasonable. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
