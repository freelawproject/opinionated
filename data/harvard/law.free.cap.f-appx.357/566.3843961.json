Bryson, Jr., federal prisoner # 95662-071, appeals the striking of his pleadings for failure to comply with the sanction order issued in <em>Bryson v. United States, </em>No. 1:08-CV-0142 (W.D.La. Mar. 25, 2008). Bryson argues that the district court abused its discretion in construing his pleadings as a request for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 relief and, as such, abused its discretion in enforcing the earlier-imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The sanction order in <em>Bryson v. United States, </em>No. 1:08-CV-0142, specified that, on account of his filing numerous frivolous collateral challenges to his sentence, Bryson was required to pay a $100 fine and seek written authorization from a district judge before filing \u201cany pleading.\u201d The district court\u2019s construction of Bryson\u2019s pleadings was therefore not germane to its order striking them. Bryson made no attempt to comply with this order, and his appeal from the sanction order was dismissed. The record discloses no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court. <em>See Gelabert v. Lynaugh, </em>894 F.2d 746, 747-48 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
