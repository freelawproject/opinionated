Her amended complaint asserted federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391 and 2671 <em>et seq., </em>and she now argues that jurisdiction exists under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Davis also contends that the court erred in vacating its initial order granting her motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-29\">\u201cThe propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Hall v. U.S. Dep\u2019t Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>85 F.3d 532, 533 (11th Cir.1996). The lack of federal jurisdiction may be raised by a federal court on its own initiative at any stage in the litigation. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>500, 506, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1240, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). Federal subject-matter jurisdiction is proper only when (1) a plaintiffs claim involves a federal question, or (2) there is diversity among the parties. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332. If the court determines that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, it must dismiss the complaint in its entirety. <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 514, 126 S.Ct. at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Davis does not allege any \u201cfederal question\u201d that would give the district court jurisdiction to decide her complaint. A federal question exists when the plaintiff pleads a \u201ccolorable claim \u2018arising under\u2019 the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 126 S.Ct. at 1244. Davis\u2019s amended complaint mentions 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391, but that provision establishes the rules for proper venue in federal actions; it does not confer jurisdiction. Her amended complaint also mentions 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq., </em>but that provision concerns the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, which only provides an avenue for bringing tort claims against the United States, one of its agencies, or certain federal employees. <em>See Means v. United States, </em>176 F.3d 1376, 1379 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Davis\u2019s amended complaint alleges, among other things, personal injury and property damage, which are actionable under <em>state </em>tort law. The complaint does not allege that Ryan Oaks has any connection to the U.S. government or any federal agency. Thus, her complaint was not proper under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and it failed to raise questions of federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Davis argues that subject-matter jurisdiction exists under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, but that argument was not made in her amended complaint. \u201cA case does not arise under federal law unless a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiffs complaint.\u201d <em>Kemp v. Int\u2019l Business Machines Corp., </em>109 F.3d 708, 712 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also Hall, 85 </em>F.3d at 533 (when case is dismissed on basis of complaint, court must look to face of that pleading to determine subject-matter jurisdiction). Moreover, a new theory raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this Court. <em>Access Now, Inc., v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). In the interest of completeness, however, we note that a claim under \u00a7 1983 requires the defendant to be a \u201cstate actor\u201d or to be acting \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Haney, </em>949 F.2d 1127, 1130 (11th Cir.1992). That is not the case here. Davis argues that Ryan Oaks Apartment receives funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but the Supreme Court has held that the mere receipt of federal funds by a private entity is not sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1983. <em>United States v. Orleans, </em>425 U.S. 807, 813-16, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 1975-77, 48 L.Ed.2d 390 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Davis\u2019s complaint also does not invoke \u201cdiversity\u201d jurisdiction, because both Davis and the defendant are \u201ccitizens\u201d of Florida. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Davis\u2019s amended complaint <em>sua sponte </em>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">We also find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to vacate its initial order granting Davis\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>We review such a denial only for abuse of discretion. <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1306 (11th Cir.2004). The district court did not abuse its discretion because it was authorized, indeed compelled, to dismiss the case once it realized that subject-matter jurisdiction did not exist. <em>See Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 514, 126 S.Ct. at 1244 (\u201c[W]hen a federal court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>must dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\u201d); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (requiring dismissal \u201cat any time\u201d a district court determines an <em>in forma pauperis </em>case to be frivolous); <em>Sun v. Forrester, </em>939 F.2d 924 (11th Cir.1991) (defining a frivolous appeal as one that is \u201cwithout arguable merit\u201d either factually or legally).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
