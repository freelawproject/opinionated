Although many of the details of the alleged persecution are unclear, the central event in Parra\u2019s story is that in March 2005, he was ambushed, kidnapped, and beaten by an armed group of FARC members due to his involvement with the Polo Democr\u00e1tico Independiente Party in Colombia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Parra argues that there is a lack of substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and denial of his claims. Parra also argues that the adverse credibility determination was a result of his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, both before and on the day of the hearing, when counsel withdrew from the representation altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">I. Scope and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b307-18\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA followed the IJ\u2019s reasoning that Parra\u2019s claim was not supported by credible evidence and that his testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application and the addenda thereto. Accordingly, we review the decisions of the BIA and the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>When evaluating a petition to review a decision by the BIA denying an application for asylum, we review findings of fact under the \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d and must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). The test is deferential, and we \u201cconsider only whether there is substantial evidence for the findings made by the BIA, <em>not </em>whether there is substantial evidence for some <em>other </em>finding that could have been, but was not, made.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aou\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Thus, an alien cannot establish eligibility for asylum if he cannot show that any alleged past or future persecution was on account of a protected ground. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. In addition, \u201c[establishing a history of past persecution creates a presumption that an alien has a well-founded fear of future persecution, although that presumption can be rebutted by the government.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286. When a petitioner fails to \u201cestablish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and \u201cthis court may not substitute its judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acq\">[T]he IJ [or BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\"><em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Id. </em>\u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>port the denial of an asylum application.\u201d However, if an applicant produces evidence other than his testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005 (\u201cRIDA\u201d), Congress has directed the immigration courts to base credibility determinations on the totality of the circumstances, which may include inaccuracies or falsehoods that do not go to the \u201cheart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, \u00a7 101(a)(3). A trier of fact can support an adverse credibility determination when the petitioner omits incidents of persecution from an asylum application and then raises those incidents for the first time at the asylum hearing. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In Parra\u2019s case, there was substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that were multiple inconsistencies between Parra\u2019s written statements and his testimony at the asylum hearing. Among other things, Parra failed to mention a second attempted kidnaping by FARC in his initial asylum application and subsequent written addenda. Thus, there was substantial evidence to support the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">As to Parra\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it, because Parra did not raise it before the BIA and therefore did not exhaust it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (nothing that an alien properly exhausts his claim before the BIA by mentioning the claim in his brief and discussing its merits). If Parra wishes to bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he must file a motion to reopen and comply with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-13\">. The record reflects that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) is a guerilla organization that has engaged in the unlawful killing of civilians, journalists, religious leaders, and elected officials, in addition to displacing local populations and recruiting child soldiers in Colombia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">.
