He argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and specifically asserts that, in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline provision applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, is flawed in that it is not supported by \u201cempirical data\u201d and allows previous convictions to be \u201cdouble counted\u201d in the calculation of guidelines ranges. Ayala-Ramos further asserts that the sentence fails to adequately account for his circumstances and motives and that the Sentencing Guidelines produce unwarranted sentencing disparities because of the random availability of \u201cfast track\u201d programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">We have consistently rejected Ayala-Ramos\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument, concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not require courts to independently analyze the empirical grounding behind each individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Guideline. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Furthermore, we have also rejected the argument that using a prior conviction to increase the offense level and in calculating the criminal history-score is impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529-31. Ayala-Ramos has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Ayala-Ramos\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in not considering the circumstances and motives surrounding his offense is equally unavailing. The district court considered Ayala-Ramos\u2019s argument that his circumstances justified a sentence below the guidelines range but ultimately implicitly rejected this argument by imposing the minimum guidelines sentence. Moreover, when reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, we will infer that the district court \u201cconsidered all the factors for a fan* sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">As Ayala-Ramos concedes, the argument that his guidelines range was excessive because it resulted in an unwarranted disparity between defendants to whom the \u201cfast track\u201d program is available and those to whom it is not available is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
