Delgado-Majano concedes that the district court correctly calculated his guidelines range but argues that the imposition of a 70-month sentence is substantively unreasonable under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we \u2018\u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-dis-eretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">We ordinarily expect that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each individually. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must merely acknowledge \u201cthat it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the [\u00a7 8558(a) ] factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Moreover, when considering whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is reasonable, we have compared the sentence actually imposed to the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding sentence as reasonable in part because it was \u201cappreciably below the length of the statutory maximum\u201d). The statutory-maximum for Delgado-Majano\u2019s sentence was 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b) (providing for a 20-year statutory maximum for the crime of reentry by a removed alien if that alien was previously convicted of an aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Here, Delgado-Majano raises only a substantive reasonableness challenge, but has failed to demonstrate that his within-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As the record shows, the district court gave Delgado-Majano\u2019s case an individualized review, explicitly stated that \u201cthe sentencing guidelines, as well as the 3553 factors\u201d were considered, and ultimately agreed with the government\u2019s assertion that his history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the seriousness of the offense all weighed in favor of imposing a 70-month sentence. Delgado-Majano\u2019s sentence also was within the guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 752; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. In sum, Delgado-Majano has not met his burden, in light of the record and the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to show that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-12\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
