Odneal, Texas prisoner # 917382, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted) and \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) (frivolous, malicious, or failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted). In that regard, Odneal\u2019s punishments of 45 days of recreation restriction, 45 days of commissary restriction, and demotion in time-earning class were held not to implicate his due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>rights, according to <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Odneal maintains <em>Sandin </em>could not be relied upon because he was found guilty in a disciplinary hearing without any evidence of guilt and not given a written statement of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). In <em>Sandin, </em>the Court held: a prisoner\u2019s protected liberty interests are \u201cgenerally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d. <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (internal citations omitted). Along that line, punishments such as loss of recreation and commissary privileges, cell restriction, and change in time-earning status do not implicate due process concerns. <em>See Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 958-59 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, Odneal\u2019s punishments \u201cdid not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest\u201d. <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (involving disciplinary segregation for 30 days as punishment for violating prison disciplinary rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Odneal has not identified a constitutionally protected liberty interest. In short, his claims of due process violations at his hearing, even if true, failed to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, he has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his due process claims for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Further, Odneal\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim each count as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Odneal is cautioned that, once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
