We granted a certificate of appealability on \u201cwhether the district court erred by finding that appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the procedures in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b).\u201d Jones argues that, had his appellate attorney raised this issue on direct appeal, his case would have been remanded for resentenc-ing, and that he was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 851(b). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">In a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). We review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a mixed question of law and fact, <em>de novo. Payne v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">To prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, a defendant must show that (1) appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance he would have prevailed on appeal. <em>Shere v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>537 F.3d 1304, 1310 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see Philmore v. McNeil, </em>575 F.3d 1251, 1264 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are governed by the same standards applied to trial counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). If a defendant fails to establish the deficient performance prong, we need not analyze the prejudice prong, or vice versa. <em>Philmore, </em>575 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">In determining prejudice in ineffeetiveassistance-of-appellate-counsel cases, we review the merits of the claim the petitioner asserts his appellate counsel erroneously failed to raise. <em>Id. </em>at 1264-65. Counsel\u2019s performance is prejudicial if we find that \u201cthe neglected claim would have [had] a reasonable probability of success on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265 (quotations omitted). \u201cA \u2018reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, it is unlawful for any person to knowingly and inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tionally distribute a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). A person who distributes five or more kilograms of cocaine \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than [ten] years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II). However, if a person \u201ccommits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, if the government intends to seek an increased punishment based on one or more of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions, the government must file an information with the district court and serve a copy of it to the defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1). The government must serve the copy before the defendant\u2019s entry of a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>After the conviction, but before the pronouncement of sentence, the district court \u201cshall\u201d inquire from the defendant \u201cwhether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 851(b). The district court \u201cshall inform [the defendant] that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>905 F.2d 1466 (11th Cir.1990), the defendant, on direct appeal, alleged that the district court erred because it failed to question him pursuant to \u00a7 851(b). <em>See id. </em>at 1481-82. Even though the district court did not specifically ask the defendant whether he had been previously convicted, as required by \u00a7 851(b), we affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1482. We held that the district court did not have to question the defendant about his conviction because, under the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s attorney \u201call but affirmed\u201d the defendant\u2019s previous drug conviction. <em>Id. </em>We noted that: (a) the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the jury that the defendant had been previously convicted of drugs; (b) at sentencing, when the district court reviewed the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) with the defendant\u2019s attorney, the attorney did not object to the prior conviction; and (c) neither the defendant nor his attorney made any objections to the prior conviction listed in the government\u2019s information. <em>Id. </em>We further observed that the defendant\u2019s prior convictions were more than five years old. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we held that \u201ceven if [the district court] <em>had not done all it tuas required to do </em>under the statute\u201d the imposition of an enhanced sentence would not be subject to attack based on \u00a7 851(e). <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In this case, Jones cannot establish prejudice because, pursuant to <em>Weaver, </em>Jones did not have a reasonable probability of success on appeal. Similar to the defendant in <em>Weaver, </em>Jones knew about the \u00a7 851 enhancement and did not challenge the validity of his prior conviction. First, Jones did not object to the prior conviction, case number CR-94-C-0173-S, as listed in the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information. Second, Jones signed the plea agreement which informed him that his statutory minimum was based on \u00a7 851. Third, Jones signed the guilty plea advice certification form, and indicated that he understood the mandatory minimum sentence provided by law. Fourth, at his plea hearing, Jones stated that he understood that he faced a mandatory minimum punishment of 20 years \u2014 the term identified in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) as the enhanced punishment for having a prior drug felony conviction. Finally, Jones did not object to the PSI which detailed his prior conviction under case number CR-94-C-0173-S. Moreover, the PSI informed Jones that he faced a minimum term of 20 years\u2019 impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>onment based on the enhanced penalty provided in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 851. Thus, based on all of these facts, Jones knew about the enhancement and \u201call but affirmed\u201d his prior conviction. <em>See Weaver, </em>905 F.2d at 1482. Therefore, the district court did not err by denying the claim because Jones would have lost on direct appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
