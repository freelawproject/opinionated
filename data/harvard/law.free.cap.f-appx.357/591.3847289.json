For the following reasons, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-18\">1. All of Petitioners\u2019 arguments are styled on behalf of lead Petitioner Raju Thapa (\u201cPetitioner\u201d). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3). The IJ determined that Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum was untimely and that Petitioner failed to meet the procedural requirements for demonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d based on ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5)(iii)(A). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination. Petitioner has provided no explanation why he failed to comply with the procedural requirements for his out-of-time application. We agree with the BIA\u2019s determination on this issue. Inasmuch as the IJ\u2019s decision to reject Petitioner\u2019s out-of-time application is based on the particular facts and circumstances of Petitioners\u2019 case, we have no jurisdiction to review such findings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-95 (5th Cir.2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-21\">2. Even if we were to excuse the filing requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5)(iii)(A), Petitioner has otherwise failed to demonstrate that he is eligible for asylum as a \u201crefugee\u201d pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Specifically, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>persecution or a well-founded fear that he will be subject to future persecution based on his membership in a particular social group if he returns to Nepal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.2004). We are not persuaded that economic extortion is a form of persecution under immigration law; nor do Nepalese businessmen appear to be a particular social group meriting asylum protection. <em>See, e.g., Davila-Mejia v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 624, 629 (8th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201cunder BIA precedent, the term \u2018family business owner\u2019 is too amorphous to adequately describe a social group\u201d); <em>Himani v. Gonzales, </em>246 Fed.Appx. 879, 882 (5th Cir.2007) (unpub.) (kidnapping for extortion of a successful businessman did not support claim of persecution); <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>192 Fed.Appx. 19, 22 (1st Cir.2006) (unpub.) (affirming IJ decision which held that economic extortion \u201c \u2018is not ... what Congress contemplated when enacting the refugee statutes and creating asylum for people here in the United States\u2019\u201d); <em>Garcia v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>143 Fed.Appx. 217, 222 (11th Cir.2005) (unpub.) (\u201cGroups of people who are connected only on the basis of their economic status do not form a social group for asylum purposes.\u201d) (internal quotes and cites omitted). Finally, there is substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s determination that the Maoist rebels that purportedly extorted Petitioner were motivated by an economic interest and not a desire to persecute Petitioner. <em>Cf. Dhakal v. Holder, </em>320 Fed.Appx. 561, -, 2009 WL 766516, at *1 (9th Cir.2009) (unpub.); <em>Lama v. Mukasey, </em>261 Fed.Appx. 305, 306 (2d Cir.2008) (unpub.); <em>Yadav v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., </em>179 Fed.Appx. 133, 135 (3d Cir.2006) (unpub.). Petitioner is therefore ineligible for asylum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">3. Petitioner argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal. However, \u201cfailure to establish eligibility for asylum is dispositive of claims for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">4. Finally, Petitioner argues that he is entitled to protection under the Convention against Torture. However, we agree with the BIA that Petitioner failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a)(1); <em>Majd, </em>446 F.3d at 595-96.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
