The district court denied Hines\u2019s petition, and Hines now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">The denial of Hines\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was based on the district court\u2019s findings that the BOP had considered Hines\u2019s application and denied it, that the BOP did not err in denying Hines\u2019s application, and that Hines\u2019s claims in the instant \u00a7 2241 petition were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. In his appellate brief, Hines does not address any of these findings. By failing to address the district court\u2019s rationale for denying the \u00a7 2241 petition, Hines has waived any challenge he could bring to the denial of his petition. <em>See Brinkmann v.
