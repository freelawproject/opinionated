The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Vail\u2019s request for asylum as time-barred, and denied his request for withholding of removal based primarily on an adverse credibility determination. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed. Vail contends that the IJ and BIA erred by denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal, because a single encounter with unknown, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>masked men who robbed Vail and his father amounted to past persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and added its own analysis, we will review both of their decisions. <em>See Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">An alien cannot apply for asylum unless he demonstrates \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Section 1158(a)(3) provides: \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3). That provision \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003)). Because we have no jurisdiction to review the denial of Vail\u2019s request for asylum as time-barred, we dismiss Vail\u2019s petition as to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We do have jurisdiction over Vail\u2019s claim that he qualified for withholding of removal. Vail shall not be removed to Guatemala if doing so would threaten his life or freedom on account of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Vail bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he will be \u201cpersecuted or tortured upon being returned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). To meet that burden, he must offer \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">We review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, under which we must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (citations and quotation marks omitted). We cannot reverse those findings unless the record compels it. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was due to several discrepancies in the record, including: (1) Vail\u2019s first asylum application did not mention any specific incidents that occurred in Guatemala, or his uncle\u2019s assassination in 1980; (2) Vail testified that he filed his application so he could renew his driver\u2019s license; (3) The basis of Vail\u2019s first application was persecution for his political opinion, but Vail\u2019s second application was based on different grounds; (4) Vail testified inconsistently regarding the year of his uncle\u2019s death and the year in which Vail and his father were robbed by unknown men.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">We have held that \u201can adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>Id. </em>Vail has failed to meet that burden. His brief asserts that the IJ made a mistake, but it does not specifically challenge the credibility finding. \u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted). In any event, the IJ gave specific, cogent reasons for her credibility determination, which is supported by substantial evidence. Thus, Vail\u2019s testimony cannot establish that he would likely be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Although \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant,\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287, Vail has not produced any corroborating evidence that compels us to reverse the IJ\u2019s findings. Vail submitted a copy of his uncle\u2019s death certificate, but the document does not say how Vail\u2019s uncle was killed or that he was assassinated for political reasons. As the IJ noted, the alleged assassination occurred approximately 15 years before Vail initially left Guatemala in 1995. Vail also submitted the 2007 Country Report on Guatemala, but that document does not show that Vail was targeted for discrimination because he is Mayan.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of Vail\u2019s application for withholding of removal, we deny the petition for review as it pertains to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">. Vail challenged the denial of his request for CAT relief before the BIA but does not challenge it before this Court. We therefore deem that claim to be abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that an appellant's failure to offer argument on an issue constitutes abandonment of that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
