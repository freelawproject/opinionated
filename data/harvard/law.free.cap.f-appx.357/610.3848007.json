Bates\u2019s claims of unlawful arrest and search against Officer Barnhill were dismissed because there was probable cause to arrest and search Bates. Bates\u2019s claims against Pratt and the Rubles were dismissed because they were not state actors. The court further determined that Bates failed to state a claim against the City of Lubbock for inadequate training because he did not show actual injury. The district court denied Bates\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Bates\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">Bates argues only that he would have disputed the existence of the video footage and still photos discussed at the evidentiary hearing, which purportedly depicted him stealing a purse. Bates does not dispute that defendant Pratt reported a theft perpetrated by Bates or that the items stolen were found in his possession. Because there was probable cause, Bates does not show that his arrest and search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>were unlawful. <em>See Parm v. Shumate, </em>513 F.3d <em>135, 142 (5th </em>Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Bates fails to address the district court\u2019s remaining reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Because he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, any argument is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Bates has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bates has two previous strikes. <em>See Bates v. Hill, </em>No. 5:07-CV-00263 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 13, 2008); <em>Bates v. Hill, </em>No. 5:07-CV-00128-C (N.D.Tex. Aug. 13, 2007). Because Bates has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
