Black\u2019s claims arise from a series of incidents that flowed from foreclosure proceedings instituted by Option One Mortgage Corporation on Black\u2019s residence following default and subsequent eviction proceedings during which possession of that residence was taken on the basis of duly issued state court orders while Black, a former incarcerated felon and veteran, was a patient in a Veterans Administration hospital. Those claims assert that he lost personal property that was located in the residence and was either placed outside on his lot or \u2014 in the case of a number of firearms, ammunition, a gun safe, and other sensitive items \u2014 was taken into protective custody by law enforcement officials during the course of executing the eviction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">We have carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the reports and recommendations of the magistrate judge on which the district court grounded its several rulings. From our review, we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Black\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint, given the dilatory timing and defective nature of the filings seeking that amendment. We are further convinced that the district court correctly granted qualified immunity to Defendanb-Appellee Scroggin and summary judgment to him on that basis, and that the court properly granted summary judgment dismissing Black\u2019s conversion claims against all Defendants-Appellees, essentially for the reasons set forth by the magistrate judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Accordingly, the orders and judgments of the district court from which Black appeals are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
