King contends the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over his complaint. King asserts the court was therefore without authority to dismiss the complaint and impose Rule 11 sanctions, and it should have instead reconsidered its dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>missal and granted his motion to remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"A52\">I. JURISDICTION, DISMISSAL, AND RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"A8R\">We review questions of jurisdiction <em>de novo, </em>including a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand. <em>Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc., </em>536 F.3d 1202, 1204 (11th Cir.2008). Pursuant to the well-pleaded complaint rule, a suit \u201carises under\u201d federal law when \u201cthe plaintiffs statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon federal law.\u201d <em>Vaden v. Discover Bank, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 1272, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009) (quotations and alteration omitted). \u201cA complaint alleging a colorable federal cause of action confers district court jurisdiction even if the complaint is ultimately dismissed for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Advanced Bodycare Solutions, LLC v. Thione Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>524 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AFY6\">King has conflated the requirements for a district court to assert jurisdiction with those necessary for a claim to survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). His complaint expressly relies upon federal law, and thus the district court did not err in exercising its subject-matter jurisdiction. Because King has only argued the district court\u2019s dismissal was improper on jurisdictional grounds, he has abandoned any argument the dismissal was inappropriate on other grounds. <em>See Corbitt v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., </em>573 F.3d 1223, 1253 n. 21 (11th Cir.2009) (stating arguments are abandoned if not presented in a party\u2019s brief on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"A_5R\">Regarding King\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201ca motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). King\u2019s motion for reconsideration merely restated his previously submitted arguments, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying it. <em>See Makro Capital of Am., Inc. v. UBS AG, </em>543 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2008) (reviewing a denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"AtBm\">II. SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"At7\">The court\u2019s award of sanctions and attorneys\u2019 fees was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Massengale v. Ray, </em>267 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2001) (reviewing a district court\u2019s award of Rule 11 sanctions for abuse of discretion). For reasons previously stated, King\u2019s argument the court was without jurisdiction to award sanctions is inapposite. The district court considered King\u2019s suit a means to harass a police officer and a judge, and it concluded King\u2019s motion to remand and his continued arguments the complaint did not involve a federal question were frivolous. King sued the city, a police officer, and a traffic court judge for $1.5 million based on an unfavorable disposition of a citation in traffic court. When the case was removed to federal court, he sought to remand the ease back to state court, despite the complaint\u2019s express invocation of multiple federal statutes and the United States Constitution. After the district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim, King continued to argue the case did not involve a federal cause of action. On the morning of his sanctions hearing, King filed a motion to reconsider, which was substantially a recitation of his original argument, and he moved to recuse the presiding judge, despite knowing of the judge\u2019s involvement for many months. \u201cThe goal of Rule 11 sanctions is to reduce frivolous claims, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>fenses, or motions, and to deter costly meritless maneuvers.\u201d <em>Massengale, </em>267 F.3d at 1302 (quotations omitted). Considering King\u2019s actions and arguments in this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that sanctions would advance that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">III. RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">King\u2019s recusal motion was premised on the district judge\u2019s participation as an attorney in an unrelated case that was litigated several years prior. Although the district judge previously participated in unrelated litigation in which King was involved, the record contains no indication that he harbored any resulting bias or prejudice. Further, King failed to raise the issue of recusal until the morning of the sanctions hearing, despite the removal to Judge Royal\u2019s courtroom several months earlier. Even assuming King\u2019s motion should not be denied as untimely, a judge\u2019s service as an attorney in an unrelated matter several years earlier would not raise significant reasonable doubts about his impartiality, and the district judge did not abuse his discretion by denying King\u2019s motion to recuse. <em>See United States v. Siegelman, </em>561 F.3d 1215, 1243 (11th Cir.2009) (stating untimeliness of motion for recusal is basis on which to deny it); <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828-29 (11th Cir.2007) (reviewing district judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself for abuse of discretion, and stating \u201c[o]pinions held by judges as a result of what they learned in earlier proceedings do <em>not </em>constitute bias or prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
