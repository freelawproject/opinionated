Parker, Louisiana prisoner # 300414, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his consolidated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaints. The district court dismissed Parker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), reasoning that Parker\u2019s claims against an assistant district attorney failed due to absolute prosecutorial immunity, Parker failed to allege that his defense counsel acted under the color of state law, and Parker\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). For the same reasons, the district court denied Parker\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that Parker\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Parker is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Parker\u2019s motion contains no argument challenging any of the grounds of the district court\u2019s certification decision. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Parker has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect, and his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Parker is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Parker is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
