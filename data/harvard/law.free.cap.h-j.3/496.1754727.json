Also a deed from <em>James Lytle to Joseph Ford, </em>dated t'ue 18fh August 1801, for the said lands. And also gave evidence, that the lands by the will aforesaid devised to <em>Benjamin </em>Preston, were by him sold to said <em>T.ee, </em>and that the same lands were purchased by the said <em>Ford </em>from the said <em>Lytle. </em>That the said lands were in possession of <em>James Preston, </em>the devisor, a considerable time before his death, and are the same of which the defendant was returned terretenantj and that <em>Benjamin Preston, </em>the devisee, was the person against whom the original judgment was obtained. The defendant then objected to this proof as insufficient: in law to support the issue on the part of the plaintiff, and prayed the court so to direct the jury. But the Court, <em>[Nicholson, </em>Ch. .T.j was of opinion, and so directed the jury, that the proof was evidence of \u2022the seisin of <em>Benjamin Preston, </em>unless the defendant showed that he held the lands in question under some other title; that after the, plaintiff had shown that the defendant derived his title from <em>Preston, </em>the court would not compel the plaintiff to show <em>Preston's </em>title, which the defendant was estopped from questioning, unless he the defendant could show that he held by some other title. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch.
