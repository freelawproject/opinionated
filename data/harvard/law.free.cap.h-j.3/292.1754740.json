ITe also gave in evidence a deed of indenture from <em>Joseph Ensor, </em>in the common recovery mentioned, to the lessor of the plaintiff, for tire said lands, dated the 27th of June 1771. The defendants then gave in evidence, by consent, the deposition of <em>Benjamin jiong, </em>taken in a former action relative to the lands claimed in this action. This deposition, (taken on the survey in the case of <em>Metryman </em>an.d others against <em>lUaydvjell, </em>and sworn to in open court on the 15th of November 1788,) states, that he the deponent, (aged 71 years,) bought a tract of land called <em>The Forrest, </em>of <em>if. Worthington, </em>of the cjuantity of 200 acres; that <em>William Carter </em>agreed with the deponent for half the said laud, on conditio\u00bb that the said <em>Carter </em>paid to <em>Worthington JllO </em>sterling; before the land was made over to the deponent, Carter exchanged his part with <em>Neale Haile </em>for the land that $aid <em>Haile </em>then lived on, with his mother, which is tire land is dispute. That then <em>Caper </em>moved from the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>be then lived to the place that he had of <em>Neale Haile, </em>and <em>Neale Haile </em>moved to the place he had of <em>Carter. </em>That he understood from <em>Ilaile </em>that he gave <em>Carter </em>a bond of conveyance (or the said land. That <em>Haile, </em>about 8^ 10 years after the exchange* told the deponent he did \u00edcnow whether h.e would make over the land to <em>Carter, </em>as he thought the land was worth more than the pepalty of the bond. That <em>Carter, </em>a few months before bis death, told tiie deponent he never gave <em>Haile </em>liberty to make over the said land to <em>Joseph Ensor. </em>That the deponent assisted to build the house shown to the sheriff and surveyor, which house <em>Car,ter </em>moved into and lived with <em>Neale Haile\u2019s </em>mother, until he built a house for himself; and that <em>Carter </em>lived at the s.aid plaice in the hard winter, which the deponent thinks was about 1740, and that he never understood but that the said <em>Carter </em>w\u00a7s in quiet and peaceable possession, until his death. The defendant also gave in evidence, that <em>Frances Haile, </em>the wife of <em>Nicholas, Haile, </em>the devisor and patentee, in the said will mentioned, was alive apd in possession of the said lands, which are part of the same that were devised to her by the will of <em>Nicholas Haile, </em>during her life, at the time when the said common recovery was suffered, and long after. And that <em>Hillijun Carter, </em>owping' two tracts of land in <em>Baltimore </em>county, called <em>The Forrest </em>or <em>The Forrest Besan eyed, </em>did in the fall, of the year 17S9, exchange ami swap the said lands with <em>Neale Haile, </em>for those parts of <em>iiferryman\u2019s Lot, </em>and <em>The Addition, </em>or <em>Llaile\u2019s Addition, </em>which were devis.ed to him by the will of <em>Nicholas Haile, </em>and that each of the said parties respectively delivered to the other the possession of the lands which, they had thus exchanged, in the latter end of the fall of 17\u00a79, or the beginning of the year 1740. That <em>William, Carter, </em>and his family, lived in the same house with <em>Frunces Ilaile, </em>the devisee for life-under the will <em>oi'Nicholas. Haile, </em>during that winter, and in the spring he built himself a house, on said lapd, and began to clear and cultivate the same, and continued in the undisturbed possession of (he same from that time until about, the year 1778, with the approbation and consent of <em>Frances. Haile, </em>the tenant for life, when he removed away, and <em>Joseph Ensor, </em>Under a contract of purchase from <em>Carter, </em>entered.into poa.session of the place. That <em>Joseph Ensor, </em>if he ever paid any part of the consideration which he was to have paid \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to <em>Carter </em>for the said land, altogether failed to pay a eon-' sideral\u00bb!e portion of it. That about the time of the death of <em>Joseph </em>Ensor, which happened sometime about the year <em>1779 </em>or 1780, <em>Carter </em>returned and took possession of th\u00e9 said land again; and that <em>Carter, </em>and the defendants claiming under him, hate beets in the peaceable possession of the lands, for which this ejectment is brought, front that time till the institution of this suit. The plaintiff then further gave in evidence, the deposition of <em>George Chiles, </em>taken by consent, and admitted in evidence, and all and singular <em>the </em>matters therein \u00bfobtained, (subject to the same legal exceptions which might be made to it, if the facts were given in evidence by tlife deponent in person,) to prove that Frances <em>Haile </em>did Surrender her life estafe in the said lands to <em>Est\u00edle Hall\u00e9-, </em>at or before the time of suffering the said common recovery, and that <em>Joseph Ensor </em>entered into and held possession of the said land, under the said common recovery, by and with the assent of <em>Frances Haile, </em>and did pay to her a valuable consideration for the said surrender and assent; and that the said common recovery ^va^suffered, and the said pos session under it taken and by and with the assent of <em>William Carter, </em>in the sa,id deposition of <em>Benjamin Long </em>mentioned, under whom the defendants claim. This deposition of <em>George Chiles, </em>aged upwards of 74 years, was taken on the 4th of May 1807, and stated, \u201cthat he was well acquainted with a parcel of land called <em>The Addition, </em>or <em>Haile's Addition, </em>in <em>Baltimore </em>county, which was part of the dwelling plantation ol <em>Adcholas Haile, </em>deceased, and was by him devised, as this deponent understood, to his son <em>A\"eale </em>Baile; and that he was also well acquainted, with the said <em>Neale Haile, </em>and with <em>Frances haile </em>the \u25a0widow of the said <em>Nicholas Haile, </em>deceased, -and with <em>Joseph Emor, </em>iate of <em>Baltimore </em>county, deceased, and <em>IVilliam Carter, </em>also of the said comity, &lt;k ceased, whose daughter lie this deponent married. That he knew the Sract of land id <em>Baltimore </em>counfy called <em>.Berryman's Imf, </em>adjoining the tract called <em>The Addition, </em>or <em>Haile's Addition; </em>and that the dwelling plantation of <em>Nicholas Haile </em>was chiefly on the tract called <em>Merryman's Lot, </em>and included, also a part of the tract called <em>The Addition, </em>or <em>Haile's Ad</em>dition; and that when he first became acquainted wiih the \u00a1said lauds, and the said <em>Frances Medie, </em>she lived in a house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>on <em>Merry man\u2019s </em>Lot, which was then said to have been the dwelling-house of her husband <em>Nicholas Haile. </em>That about 36 years ago he first became acquainted with <em>William </em>Carter, who .then resided oh the said dwelling plantation, and claimed it-as his own under a purchase from <em>Neale halle; </em>and he hath frequently heard <em>Carter </em>say that he had never obtained a conveyance froth <em>Neale </em>Haile, some difference havihg arisen between them respecting a tract of land which he had given to <em>Neale </em>Ilaile, in payment or exchange for the said plantation. That about two years or a year atid a half after, he so became' acquainted with Carter, he married the daughter of <em>Carter, </em>and about two jmars after his marriage* went to - live with tlie said <em>Joseph Ensor, </em>as his overseer. That after living with <em>Ensor </em>in this manner one year, <em>Ensor </em>purchased from <em>Carter </em>the aforesaid dwelling plantation, consisting of part of <em>Merry man\u2019s Lot, </em>and part of <em>The Addition, </em>or <em>Haile\u2019s Addition; </em>immediately after which <em>Carter </em>put <em>Ensor </em>into possession of said plantation, and removed away from it; that <em>\u00c9nSor </em>thereupon put this deponent oe said plantation as his overseer, with two horses, one cow, and one slave, to cultivate,it. That he does not know tvhat sum <em>\u00c9nsor </em>agreed to pay for the said plantation, but perfectly recollects, that at the time of the purchase he paid and delivered to <em>Carter </em>a negro woman slave in part pajment, but does not remember at what price. That about one year, or something less, after he went to live on said plantation as overseer, <em>Ensor </em>being desirous of obtaining- a conveyance of the said land and plantation from <em>Neale Haile, </em>applied to <em>Carter </em>for his consent that such a conveyance should be made, to which <em>Carter </em>consented, observing that <em>Haile'1# </em>deed or conveyance would be as good as' his own; on which <em>Ensor </em>answered, that it would be better. That this deponent was called as a witness to this conversation, which took place at <em>Ensor1 s </em>house. That <em>Ensor </em>at the same time informed <em>Carter </em>that <em>Haile </em>demanded from him \u00e1?30 for making the said conveyance, which he thought very hard, as the land had already been Sold to him; to which <em>Carter </em>replied, that he could not help it; and that he <em>Ensor </em>and <em>Haile </em>must settle that matter between them. That soon after this transaction, <em>Neale Haile </em>came to the house of <em>Ensor </em>for the purpose of going with him to <em>Annapolis </em>to make the above mentioned con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u00a1peyance. That <em>Frances Haile, </em>who then resided on the said plantation, and in the house which had been her said husband\u2019s dwelling house, as this deponent always understood, and who was then, as this deponent understood and believes, upwards of 90 years old, went with them to <em>Baliimore-Umn, </em>on their way to <em>Annapolis, </em>for the purpose, as this deponent understood, of making over, before a magistrate, her rigid to the said land and plantation, so as to enable <em>Neale Haile, </em>her son, to convey it to Ensor. That this deponent did not go before the magistrate, but knows that <em>Neale </em>Haile, <em>Ensor </em>and <em>Frances, </em>did go together for the above purpose, as they 3aid; and that this deponent\u2019s wife, who was the granddaughter of <em>Frances, </em>together with several other of her grandchildren, did accompany her. That they went, as this deponent understood, before <em>fFil/iam Aisquith, </em>then a justice of the peace for <em>Baltimore </em>county, and now deceased. That this deponent saw them return, and understood from th&lt;?m that a paper bad been signed by <em>Frances, </em>before the said magistrate, for the above mentioned purpose. That after their return <em>Frances </em>went back to her house; and <em>Ensor </em>end <em>Neale Haile, </em>with this deponent, and several other persons, then proceeded to <em>Annapolis </em>to have the conveyance completed, which however was not done at that time, which, as well as this deponent recollects, was in tlse fall of the year; and that in the spring following, they went again to <em>Annapolis </em>for the same purpose, when the said conveyance was executed, for which <em>Ensor </em>agreed to pay <em>Haile 3S5, Haile </em>having increased his demand from \u00a1\u00a330 to <em>\u00a335. </em>That while <em>Carter </em>lived on the said plantation, after this deponent became acquainted with him, <em>Prances Haile </em>had a separate part of the .land in her sole occupation, which she usually rented out; and that all the rest of the land was held and occupied by <em>Carter. </em>That when <em>Carter </em>sold to Ensor, and <em>Ensor </em>placed this deponent on the plantation, he took the whole of the land into his possession, and directed this deponent to pay her <em>35 </em>per annum, to go to mill for- her, to bring and cut her fire-wood, and to render her other services of this nature, as long as she should live, and choose to remain there. That In pursuance of these orders he did, for three years, pay her <em>\u00a35 </em>per annum in necessaries, which he purchased for her use, and did perform for her the said services to the value, as he believes,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>oF <em>\u00a310 </em>per annum more. That she always rteceived tine said payments and supplies, of which this deponent kept an account; but never Heard her say, nor mentioned to hei particularly, what they were for; nor does lie know that the said directions were given to him by <em>Ensor </em>in consequence of any agreement with her; and that at or about the end of the said three years, her house was burnt down; on which her son <em>Georg\u00e9 Haile </em>came and took her away; and after which the said payments, supplies and services, were discontinued, <em>Ens\u00f3r </em>being then dead. That some, time before the death of <em>Ensor, </em>and after they went to <em>\u25a0Jhmapolis </em>the second time, when the conveyance was made by <em>Neale Haile </em>to <em>Ensor; </em>he heard <em>Carter </em>apply to <em>Ensor </em>for payment of the balance due to him for the said land; on which <em>Ensor </em>asked him how much was du\u00e9, and he re* plied <em>\u00a370; </em>and that <em>Ensor </em>then said, that lie could not pay till the fall, biit Would then discharge the whole debt; That after <em>Ensor\u2019s </em>death he remained on the said planta* tion about three or four years, as a tenant, and paid vent to the guardian of <em>Ensor\u2019s </em>sons; and that at the end of this time, <em>Carter </em>came and took possession of the place, alleging that <em>\u00a370 </em>of the purchase money was due to him from Ensor, or his heirs, and that he Would keep the place till it was paid. That he does not recollect the year or precise time at which any of the above mentioned events took place,,further than he hath stated above, And further, that when he, on going to live on the said plantation* as above stated, took possession of the whole of it for <em>Ensor, </em>including that part which liad before been solely occupied by <em>Frances Haile, </em>she made rio objection thereto, nor did she ever afterwards object thereto, but always re - ceived the above mentioned payments and services as her right \u201d The defendant then prayed the court to direct the jury, that the plaintiff had not made title to the lands in. question. And the Court, <em>['Nicholson, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Jones, </em>A. J.] did direct the jury, that the common recovery was defective, there being no legal surrender of the life estate, and of course that the plaintiff had not made title, and could not recover in this action.
