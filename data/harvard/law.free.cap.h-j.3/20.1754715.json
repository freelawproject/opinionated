She also gave in evidence, that no certificates warrants or patents, for the tracts of land called <em>Gibson\u2019s Forest </em>and <em>Warner\u2019s </em>Chance, or either of them, or of, any tracts of either of those names, can be found among the records of the land office, now existing, where they haw been repeatedly searched for, and that no such record books as Liber D D, No. 8, or Liber No. 28, do now exist or can be found among the records of the lain! office, or elsewhere. The defendant then produced two papers, purporting to be true copies from certain books of records in the land office, one called Liber 1) D, No. 8, and the other called Liber No. 28, certified by the said <em>Jennings </em>then clerk of the land office, under his hand as clerk thereof, of two certificates of surveys, one of <em>Gibson\u2019s Forest, </em>and the other of <em>Warner\u2019s Chance, </em>the first surveyed for <em>Miles Gibson </em>on the 20th of October 1695, and. the latter surveyed for <em>John Warner </em>on the 17th of November 1710, and describing each of those tracts as they are described in the deed from <em>Clark </em>to <em>Franklin </em>as herein before set forth. She also proved, by witnesses produced, and sworn, who were well acquainted with the said <em>Jennings, md </em>wirh his signature, that (he name <em>Ihomas Jennings, </em>subscribed to the said papers, purporting to be co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>pies of the certificates of <em>Gibson\u2019s Forest </em>and <em>Warner\u2019s Chance, </em>are the handwriting and signature o{ the said <em>Jennings, </em>and are also in the handwriting with other copies of land records and patents appearing to have been made and issued by the said <em>Jennings </em>while clerk as aforesaid; and she also gave in evidence, that while the said <em>J'ermings </em>was clerk as aforesaid, another person of the name of <em>'Thomas Jennings </em>was an assistant to him, and wrote for him in the said office; and she then produced a paper, purporting to be a true copy from a record book in the said office called Liber No! 28, of the certificate of <em>Gibsons </em>Forest, similar to the dopy herein before mentioned. She also proved by witnesses produced and sworn, which witnesses were well acquainted with the said last mentioned <em>Thomas </em>Jennings, and with his signature and handwriting, that the la3t mentioned paper, and the signature thereto, are in the hand writing- and signature of the last-mentioned Jennings. She also gave in'evidence, that <em>John Lawson, </em>one of the clerks of the land office, did sometimes, in his official certificates, style himself <em>Register. </em>' She also gave in evidence, that the \u25a0body of the last mentioned paper, purporting to be a copy of the certificate of <em>Warner\u2019s Chance, </em>is in the same hand baiting with the b'dyofsome patents issued from the land office before the year 1760. The plaintiff then read in evidence certain entries from the proprietary <em>debt books, </em>for the years 1754 to 1771, inclusive, whereby it does not appear that the <em>quit rents </em>on <em>Gibson\u2019s Forest </em>and <em>Warner\u2019s Chance </em>were charged to <em>Thomas Franklin </em>on the said deb\u00ed books. He also offered in evidence by <em>John Brewer, </em>that be was, and at present is, an assistant clerk to <em>John </em>Kitty, registe!- of the land office, and had for eleven years last past been clerk in the Said office, acting for many years in said office as a clerk to <em>John Callahan, </em>the register thereof, and that he never heard or understood that any record book belonging to the said office hacl been lost or missing of late years; he-never heard or understood that any record book of said office hacl been lost during the revolutionary war, or at any period shortly before. That Mr: Callahan, flow dead, informed him, that he had never seen in the office a reference to a book in the office, which he could not find; that seeing a record book of certificates in the office for a number which he could not find patents, he was some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ifmfis induced to believe a record book of patents might have been lost, but on the whole he thought no book was lost; <em>and that the </em>warrants are all recorded in different books from the books in which the certificates and grants are recorded; and he never heard, nor from many years examination of the records has lie any reason to believe, that any record book of warrants was lost. The plaintiff also offered in evidence the certificate and grant of <em>Franklin\u2019s Delight and Ruthes Garden, </em>surveyed for <em>Thomas, Franklin </em>on the 1st of October 5729, lying in the fork of <em>Gunpowder </em>river, and on the IN' side of the S branch of said river, on <em>the </em>head <em>of </em>a branch called the <em>Water Fall </em>Branch, &amp;c. and that they were truly located on the plots as located by the defendant; and also that the grantee was the same person who is grantee in the deed from <em>Clark </em>to <em>Franklin. </em>Also the certificate of the tract of land called <em>Gibson\u2019s Ridge, </em>surveyed the 19th of September 1683, for <em>Miles Gibson, </em>lying on the S W branch of <em>Bush </em>River; and proved by a witness sworn, aged 61 years, that he has been well acquainted with the last mentioned tract of laud for 37 years, and that no person of-the name of <em>Franklin </em>has held or possessed any part of it during that time. That before 1767 the whole of the said land was possessed by <em>Thomas Bond, </em>&amp;c. who were and had been in possession thereof for 45 years and upwards, and held and claimed the same under purchases from <em>Gibson. </em>That the said land lies now in <em>Harford </em>county, and about 15 miles from where <em>Franklin lived. </em>The defendant <em>then offered to read in </em>evidence the said three papers, (copies of the certificates of <em>Gibson\u2019s Forest </em>and <em>Warner\u2019s </em>Chance,) to support her title to the land for which she takes defence. To the reading of the said three papers to the jury the plaintiff objected. But the court did permit the said certificates tobe read to the jury, to be determined by them whether they were or were not genuine. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-3\">3.
