He then prayed the court to direct the jury, that if they believed the aforegoing testimony, the petitioner was not entitled to, recover. But the Court, <em>[Nicholson, </em>Ch. J.] was of opinion, and so directed the jury, that if they believed that the petitioner was born and raised in the state of <em>Virginia, </em>and continued to reside there until the month of February 1810, that he was then sent by the defendant, or with his consent and approbation, to <em>Baltimore, to </em>be hired, that he was so hired and resided in <em>Baltimore, </em>and that the defendant himself was not a resident of this state, and did not move into this state for the purpose of residing here, that the circumstance of the defendant\u2019s being under the age of 21 years could not operate against the petitioner. That a minor had no other authority to import slaves into this state than an adult, and that neither the one nor the other had such authority, except in the special cases provided for in the several acts of assembly of this state, none of which embraced this ease. The court therefore, refused the defendant\u2019s prayer. The defendant excepted;. t\\rid the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court, where the case was argued before Chase, Ch.
