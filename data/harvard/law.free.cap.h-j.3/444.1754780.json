The plaintiff then offered ill evidence, that after the death of <em>Daniel ED Comas, </em>the two devisees, <em>Darnel </em>and <em>John ED Comas, </em>entered on the land, and became possessed thereof as the law required. He also offered to read in evidence two deeds from (he two devisees, <em>Daniel </em>and <em>John ED Comas, </em>to <em>William AD Comas, </em>for all their right, &amp;c. to <em>Ward\u2019s </em>Purchase\u201e That from <em>Daniel, </em>was dated the' 10th of April 1769, ac~' icrtowledged on the same day, and recorded the 18th of March 1776; and that from <em>John </em>was dated the 21 st of December 1774, acknowledged on the same day, and recorded the 18th of March 1776, To the reading of these deeds the defendants objected as being no evidence in the cause, they not having been recorded within the time prescribed by law; and prayed the opinion of the court, that -the same were not evidence. Of which opinion the Court were, and they refused to let the deeds be read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">The plaintiff then offered in evidence, that from the date of the respective deeds the said <em>William, EDComas, </em>for whose use this suit is brought, obtained the possession of' the land, and held the possession until in or about the year 1794, when,he made a contract with <em>Nicholas D.

M\u2018Comas, </em>one of the defendants, and to a <em>certain Thomas Bond OnionT </em>as herein before mentioned. The defendants also offered in evidence, that <em>Nicholas D. EDComas </em>assigned over his inte-\u25a0rest in said certificate, of <em>Gratuity, </em>to <em>Thomas B. Onion, </em>who returned another certificate thereon called Belguard, on which a patent issued to the said <em>Onion, </em>dated the 1st of January 1800. He also offered in evidence a deed from said <em>Onion </em>to <em>Nicholas D. EDCom\u00e1s, </em>one of the defendants, dated the 29th of August 1800, for two tracts of land called <em>Belguard. </em>and <em>Security. </em>The plaintiff then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>p\u00edayed the'\u00f3pinion of the court to the jury, that from the facts and circumstances aforesaid, they may and ought to presume that legal corivoyances had been made from <em>John </em>arid <em>Oanie! M Comas, </em>thd legatees aforesaid; to <em>William 31'Comas, </em>for whose us\u00e9 this suit is brought. But the court were of opinion, that the doctrine of presumption is tt\u00ed be resorted to, to fortify long and aheient possessions; when from the great lapse of time a probability may arise that title papers \u00a1\u00a1ave been lost. But since the first of May 1767, all conveyances of land are to be placed upon the public records, or no interest for more than seven years will pass, and the court will not direct the jury to presume legal conveyances to have been made, when deeds regularly executed since the 1st of May 17G7) sire produced, which appear to have been recorded several years after the time prescribed by law. Th\u00e9ir being placed ont record by the party, (though not in due time,) operates against the presumption, as it is an evidence that he relied on them to support his tille; and to presume a legal conveyance to support a possession of only thirty-eight years Standing, under thd circumstances existing in this case, would be to elude the act of 1766, and to carry thd doctrine of presumption farther than it is believed ever to have been carried in this state, to support a possession that commenced subsequent to the passage of that act. The court therefore refused to give the direction prayed. The <em>plaintiff </em>excepted.- Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for <em>Fees </em>Adventure.

It appears by the facts stated, that the plain tiff de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>rived Ids title to <em>Ward\u2019s Purchase </em>under a lease from the \u25a0 agent of the Proprietary, granted to <em>John Ward </em>ori the 1st of September if42, and deduced a regular title under that Jeitse to <em>Daniel </em>and <em>John </em>M'Comas, the sons and devisees of <em>Daniel M'Comas, </em>uhderliis will made the 15th of June 1765. It also appears that <em>Daniel \u00f1u'Comas, </em>the son,-was living on the land at the time of making the will. It also appears that the plaintiff claimed title to the land, and offered in evidenfcfe two deeds, one from <em>Daniel \u00c9P Com as </em>dated tiie IO'fh of April 1769, the other from <em>John M'Comas </em>dated the \u00a3lstof December 1774, the said deviseesj to <em>William M'Comas, </em>under whom the, plaintiff claims, for the said land, which deeds were rejected by the court as not being legal evidence \u2014 not having been recorded within the times required by law. If also appears, that <em>William M'Comas </em>became possessed of the said land from the dates of those deeds, and continued in possession until the year 1794, when he made the' contract with <em>N. J). M'Comas, </em>one of the defendants'. It also appears that no title was set up by the defendants adverse to the title under the said lease, and that <em>William M'Comas, </em>and those under whom he claims, have always possessed the land, under the said lease, to the yeah 1794, and that the possession1 of <em>N. D. M'Comas </em>Was acquired under the contract with <em>Willit\u00edM M'Comas, </em>under whom the plaintiff claims, and not in opposition to his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">These facts, in the opinion of the court, laid a sufficient foundation for the jury to presume good and valid deeds from <em>Daniel </em>and <em>John M'Comas </em>to <em>William M'Co~ mas, </em>of the said land, and the jury could not be precluded from making such presumption by defective deeds offered in evidence, because the same not being legally admissible, were properly rejected, and could, have no influence on the minds of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The court dissent from, the opinion stated in the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions, and concur with the opinions in the <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">On the appeal by the plaintiff,.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">JUDGMENT' REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">On the appeal by the defendants,</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
