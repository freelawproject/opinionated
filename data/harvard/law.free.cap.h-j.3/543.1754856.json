This was an action of Trover, brought in the late General Court to Qc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tober term 1796, for the conversion of three boxe3, con\u00bb' taming 1S26 pieces of gold coin, commonly called half Johannes, of the value of 64000 current money. The damages laid in the declaration were 65000 like money. The defendant, (now appellant,) at May term 1797, pleaded not guilty, upon which issue was joined. At May term 1798, the defendant filed the following pica, stated tobe a plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>viz. \u201cAnd the said <em>1). Harris, </em>by <em>Z. llollingworth </em>his attorney, comes and defends the force and injury when, &amp;c. and says that the said <em>J. Jaffray, </em>his action aforesaid further against him to have and maintain ought not, because he says, that the said <em>Jaffray, </em>by <em>J. Winchester </em>his attorney, heretofore, to wit, on,\u201d &amp;c. setting forth another action brought by the present plaintiff .against. <em>William Thompson, </em>for trover and conversion of the same boxes of half johannes, as described in the declaration in this cause, and that a judgment by confession was rendered against <em>Thompson </em>at October term 1797, and that the said judgment was in full vigour and effect, and no wise reversed or annulled; averring that the plaintiff in that action, and the plaintiff in this, was the same person, and that the goods, chattels and money, and the finding and conversion thereof, mentioned in the record and proceedings against Thompson, and the goods,\u2019 &amp;c. mentioned in the.declaration in this action, are also the same. \u201cAnd this the said <em>JD. Harris </em>is ready to verify; wherefore he prays judgment if the said <em>Jaffray, </em>his action aforesaid against him to have and maintain ought, &amp;c.\u201d To this plea there was a general demurrer, and joinder in demurrer. At March term 1807, (the proceedings having been transferred to <em>Baltimore </em>county court on the abolition of the general court,) the demurrer was adjudged good. The defendant then moved the court to amend the pleadings, by putting in a plea of the general issue, which he tendered to the court; but the court refused to sustain the motion, and on motion of the plaintiff ordered a venire for a jury to appear at the next term, to inquire what <em>damages and costs </em>the plaintiff bad sustained, &amp;c. At the next term, (October 1807,) \u201ca jury was ballotted, empannelled and accepted, elected, sworn, and charged to inquire of the damages and costs sustained by the plaintiff in the premises.\u201d The jury returned their inquisition, under their hands and seals, as follows: \u201cThis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>inquisition made, indented and taken, at bar, in <em>Baltimore </em>County court, in an action of trover, depending in the said court between <em>James Jaffray, </em>plaintiff, and <em>David Harris, </em>defendant, witnesseth, that we the jurors, whose names are hereto subscribed, and seals affixed, being duly empanneiled, sworn, and charged to inquire of the damages and costs sustained by the said <em>James J affray </em>in the said action, by reason of the conversion of certain goods and chattels of the said <em>James J affray, </em>by the said <em>David Harris, </em>to his use, having heard the evidence given in the said action, and duly considered the same, do find the damages sustained by the said <em>James J affray </em>in the said action, to the sum of fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty dollars and forty cents current money, and lite sum of forty dollars, costs of the said suit. In witness whereof we have hereto set our names and se\u00e1is this,\u201d &amp;c. Judgment; was rendered upon this inquisition for S 14,500 <em>40 </em>current money', damages, and S40 costs.

But if a judgment is entered upon the verdict, no release, or other act of the plaintiff, can give validity to that judgment, but on an appeal or writ of error, it must be reversed, unless the act of 1809, <em>ch. </em>153, on which the rule in this case is founded, affords a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">And the only question for the courtis, Whether the law in that respect is altered by the act of assembly? The words of the act are, that the court of appeals \u201cmay, on motion, permit and direct any entry to be made, or act to be done, by either party, on the trial of any appeal, or during its pendency, which might or could have been done by <em>such </em>party after verdict, in the court from whose judgment such appeal was made, and which in law might have been necessary to give effect and validity to such judgment,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">This clause of the law in no manner affects the proceedings in the county courts, and authorises no acts to be <em>there </em>done, or entries made, which could not have been done before; nor does it give any efficacy to any acts or entries <em>there </em>done or made by cither party, to a suit, which the same acts or entries would not have had in law before, bat only authorises such entries to be made, or acts to be done, in the <em>court of appeals, </em>by either party to a suit, (and. not by the court,) which might have been made or done by the same party in the <em>court below, </em>after verdict, without giving any eftkacy to such, acts or entries when made in the <em>court of appeals, </em>which the same acts or entries would not haY&amp; had if made in tile county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Independent of this act of assembly, if <em>after </em>a <em>remittitur </em>is entered, <em>a judgment is rendered by the, court, </em>on a verdict for mure than the damages in the declaration, or. if tha <em>remittitur </em>is entered <em>after </em>judgment, and <em>that judgment </em>s$ suffered to remain, in either case the judgment is erroneous, and not cured by the <em>remittitur; a release of parcel of a verdict, not having the effect in ltw&gt; to give validity to a vicious judgment for the, tvhole-, </em>and ho entries or acts being auihorised to be made in the county courts by either party toa suit, which might nht before have been made after Verdict; and no efficacy being given by fbe act of assembly to such acts or entries, when made in the court of appeals, which they would not have hada if made in the court be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>low, it does appear to the court, that <em>&amp; </em>release entered in this court of parcel of a verdict, cannot give validity to a judgment rendered by a court below, for the whole of that verdict, being for a greater amount than the damages laid in the declaration; for that would be giving greater efficacy to a release entered in this court, than the same act would have if entered in the court below, a release entered below of a parcel of a verdict, not having the effect in law to give validity to a vicious judgment for the whole. Suppose, then, the record before this court contained a release, entered below by the plaintiff, of a parcel of the <em>inquisition, </em>there would then be no act to be done by the party, in virtue of the act of assembly, and the judgment being for more than the damages charged in the declaration, it would be erroneous; and could this court be' called upon to affirm that judgment thus clothed in error? They surely could not; nor could this court amend or alter it in conformity with the release, but would be constrained to reverse it; which shows,, that the sum for which a judgment is given, is a substantial part of it, and cannot be altered without altering the judgment. And the court think Hiere is nothing in the act of assembly giving- authority to this court to make any alteration or disposition of a judgment on release entered here, which they could not make of the same- judgment on a <em>remittitur </em>entered in a court b.elow, The court are therefore of opinion, that even if a release is permitted to be entered in this case of a part of the inquisition, they cannot alter the amount of the judgment, which would in fact be to enter a judgment of their own, and then to affirm that judgment; so that there Would be in the record no judgment of the court below; nor can this court reverse it, and give a judgment for the-damages charged in the declaration, for it is well settled, that on an appeal by a defendant, the judgment cannot be reversed, and such a judgment entered for the plaintiff, as the court below ought to have given, and the act of assembly makes no alteration in the law in that respect. The defendant applies to be <em>relieved </em>from an erroneous judgment, and not to have a more perfect one entered against him; and he is driven to his appeal, by the act of the plaintiffin taking a judgment against him for more than by law he is entitled to., If in this case <em>the judgment </em>was for <em>the, </em>of the <em>damages, in, the </em>deqferuiagn, the <em>inquisition </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>being for more, and <em>no release </em>entered on the record, the plaintiff might enter one now. But however this court feel disposed to give effect and operation to the acts of the legislature, they think they cannot, by construction, strain the act in question to a meaning which the language of it v.iil not bear, and thereby take to themselves an authority which the law, (whatever may have been the intention of the makers,) does not give.</p>\n<otherdate id=\"b563-7\">At December term 1813, this rule was argued before</otherdate>\n<judges id=\"Aqj\">Chase, Ch.

And also show cause why this court, after the release and entry aforesaid, should not amend the transcript of the record in this case by entering such judgment, on deciding the appeal, as the nature of the entry or amendment may require, or as the court from which the appeal has been made would have rendered if such entry or amendment had been made before the rendition of the judgment in the said inferior court.</p>\n<p id=\"AJx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>They contended, that this act did not embrace the judgment before the court, it having been rendered on the <em>inquisition </em>of a jury, and not on a verdict; and to show the distinction between an inquisition and a verdict, they refer\u00ed ed to the statutes, 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII, <em>ch. </em>30, and 18 <em>Eliz. ch. </em>14, cited in 1 <em>Bac.

That the fact pleaded in the second plea did not happen after the last continuance, nor does that plea conclude as a plea jom\u00ed,? <em>darrein </em>continuance; and not being such a plea, but simply a further plea under- the statute of <em>.Sun, </em>the first plea was not waived. To show that it was not in the form of * plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>they referred to 2 <em>Harr.

They contended, 1; That every plea of <em>puis darrein continuance </em>must be verified by affidavit. <em>Martin vs. Wyvill, </em>1 <em>Stra. </em>493. 2. That this plea was not pleaded as a plea <em>puis darrein </em>continuance, because in conclusion it strikes at the action itself, and not at its further continuance. 3.- That in a plea of <em>puis darrein </em>continuance, the fact pleaded must 'have happened since the last continuance.
