That a joint <em>assumpsit </em>to the plaintiffs below was laid in the declaration, and that there was proof that there could be no <em>assumpsit </em>to <em>J.

He referred to <em>Ott vs. Chapline, </em>3 <em>Harr. &amp; M\u2018Hen. </em>323, and <em>Goldsmith's Adm'r. vs. </em>Pattison's <em>Ex'r. </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>205.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-7\">2. That the account stated by the treasurer to be copied from the treasury books, was not evidence, because there was no proof that <em>T.

That the probat to the account, that it was truly copied from the books of the treasury office, was not according to the act of 1798, <em>ch. </em>108, that act requiring that the account should be attested by the treasurer, and sworn to be a true copy by the person attesting It, and there was no proof that he did attest it. It also says, that the account proved according to that act shall be evidence in the same manner, and to have the same effect, as if the original books, &amp;c. were themselves produced, and in this case if the books had been produced, they would not of themselves have been evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-8\">No Counsel argued for the Defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b504-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Johnson, J,</author>\n<p id=\"Agma\">The sureties of <em>Williams </em>were compelled as such, to pay the money due from him to the state, and for their reimbursement the acts of assembly authorised them to bring such suits as <em>Williams </em>might \u2014 now <em>Williams </em>could have brought a suit, and recovered on the proof of the taxes having been due, and that they were paid by him do the state.
