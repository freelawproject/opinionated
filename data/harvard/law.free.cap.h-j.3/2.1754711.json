Previous to the adoption of the constitution of this state, all the criminal jurisdiction of the province was vested in, and exercised by, the provincial and county courts. That instrument recognized the county courts, and established a court called The General Court, to which the powers and jurisdiction, exercised by the late provincial court, were transferred. By that instrument an executive power was provided for the .state, consisting of a governor and council. The governor is expressly prohibited from the exercise of any prerogative by virtue of any law, statute, or custom of <em>England. </em>The issuing of commissions of Oyer and Terminer in <em>England, </em>is an exercise of the royal prerogative, inherent in the King by the common law. By the constitution of this stat\u00e9, the. powers to be exercised by the governor and council are expressly prescribed; and it is provided and enjoined, that all judges and justices should thereafter be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the council. The persons named in a commission of Oyer and Terminer, &amp;e. and authorised thereby to hear and determine criminal charges in any particular place, when acting by virtue thereof, are in the exercise of high and important judicial powers,and are known to the law as justices. The act of assembly, passed at <em>November </em>session t8&amp;r; <em>ch. </em>1, by virtue of which the commission, under which this court has-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>been, and now is sitting, has been issued, gives the power to the governor alone, without the advice and consent of -the council, to issue commissions of Oyer and Terminer. Inasmuch, therefore, as the justices of this court have been appointed and commissioned by the governor alone, it is asserted that, under the constitution of the state, the appointment is not only unauthorised, but by the language thereof, expressly prohibited.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b14-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>A special court of oyer and terminer and gaol delivery, acting: under a commission from the governor, has ail the powers and jurisdiction which can he exercised by the county court, in criminal</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b14-12\">Certain objections, made itt arrest of judgment on a verdict of guilty in the above ease, overruled* viz.
