The will was duly executed and proved. The plaintiff then proved, that <em>Alexander W alters </em>was the eldest son and heir at law of <em>Robert W alters, </em>the patentee and testator; and proved a regular descent down from <em>Robert Walters, </em>the patentee and testator, and from <em>Alexander, </em>his eldest son and heir at law, to the lessors of the plaintiff. The defendant then proved that <em>John Walters, </em>the son of <em>Robert, </em>the patentee, and testator, mentioned in the said will, was the father of <em>John Walters, </em>the defendant; and that at the death of <em>Robert, </em>the patentee and testator, <em>John, </em>his son and deviseo under the will, entered on the lands mentioned in the declaration, and was possessed thereof until his death, which happened in the year 1796, when the defendant, his son, entered into the said lands, and was and is now possessed thereof. The plaintiff then moved the court to instruct the jury, that by the will of <em>Robert If alters, </em>the patentee and testator, the fee simple to the lands mentioned in the declaration, and devised as aforesaid to <em>John Walters, </em>did not pass the said <em>John I f alters, </em>the sop of the said <em>Robert </em>Walters, the testator, and that the fee simple in the said lands has not been disposed of by the said testator by any part of his will, consequently that the same descended <em>to Alexander Walters, </em>the son and heir at law; and the same having been regularly transmitted down to the lessors of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. But the court being divided iii opinion, no direction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>given to the jury. The plaintiff excepted: and the verdict and judgment being against him, he brought the present appeal.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>U W, by his will dated m I7t&gt;3f after staunjr, <em>'\u201c\u2018and as for my worldly goods -which it hath pleased God to bles\u00bb me with hi this Ufe-, 1 give and dis* pose of m the fob* lowing manner and fornif </em>dev is-ed, <em>Intel' alia, </em>as fellows.* <em>\"'Item, </em>I giveaudbequeath unto my sen J <em>\\Vf </em>all that part, of a tract of hi ml ealled 1), whereon I pow dwell, accord ing- to the division, which I have already made,\u2019' 1 here woj t; umi\u00bb hu devises o\u00ed oth\u00ab er parts and rrsidue or the tract of irtiid called <em>i)} to </em>his son 15 W, and to his grauihoj* ft W/ also a de* vise of another tract of laud to <em>his </em>grandson \u00bfi W9 <em>\u2018\"'\u2018my aforesaid grandson R W not </em>- jj * t ( <em>% a </em>q <em>to inherit his land9 aforesaid until the death of his father A IV\\ and my will is, that my son A W inherit, the lands aforesaid, and the benefits of then during his natural life,\u201d </em>also a devise of another tract to his hon J J Ws He also bequeathed sundry slaves to his grand daughters, \u201cto be eqqahy divid\u00ed d at the death oftheir lather J J W, <em>the said J J fp to have the use of the </em>a-* <em>foresaid negroes and increase., </em>dur\u00ab <em>ing his natural hfe\u201d </em>rK a.i'O he\u00ae qaealhtd a slave toas.oijiiT arando d.i \u00abissuer, a daughter oi A V/, <em>a and if she dies without heirs lawfully </em>begotten, then!

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHS\">delivered the following opinion, which was concurred in by the other judges. I am of opinion that <em>John Walters, </em>under the will of his father <em>Robert Walters, </em>took only an estate for life in the lands in question. The devise to <em>John </em>is general, without words of limitation or perpetuity, and there are no words in the will connected with the devise to <em>John, </em>or relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>subject matter of it, denoting an intention in the testator to create a greater estate fimo for lire. The introductory clause, although it manifests an intention in the testator to dispose of the whole of his estate, and not to die intestate as to any part, is net so connected with the devise in question to <em>John, </em>as to enlarge the estate for lile into an estate of inheritance; and die rule of law is too firmly established to be shaken, that a genera! devise, without words of limitation or words equipollent or tantamount, will not pass a greater estate than for the life of the devisee. In expounding wills the intention of the testator is the polar star, and must prevail, if consistent with the rules of law, and that intention must be collected from the words of the will, which are applicable to the devise under consideration. The intention of the testator inferrable, or to be conjectured by the court in this case, from a general view of his will and the circumstances of his family, cannot be effectuated, because it stands opposed by the rule of law just mentioned, and because there are no words in the will, connected with the devise under discussion, indicating an intention to enlarge the estate for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">As to the residuary clause, the words \u201call the remainder \u00bbf my estate,\u201d are full and comprehensive enough to pass the whole of his estate, real and personal, remaining, to his son, <em>John Walters, </em>if the generality of these words are not restricted by the antecedent words in such manner as to confine them to the personal estate. In deciding on the operation and effect of these words, the court must consider the whole of the will, for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the testator. In the introductory clause the testator manifests an intention of disposing of his whole estate, and he does it most effectually if these words are taken in their most comprehensive sense. lie devises both real and personal estate, and has given a great many legacies; but it is contended that these words, being connected with the preceding words, \u201cafter ail <em>my </em>just debts, legacies, wife\u2019s thirds, and funeral charges, are paid and discharged\u201d-[We regret that the remaining part of the opinion of the court has been mislaid. But the result of it was, that the general residuary devise to <em>John Walters, </em>when taken in connexion with the other parts of the will, was to be confined to the testator\u2019s personal estate.j</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">JUDGMENT RUyERSED, AN\u00bb PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
