They contended, that the com - mitment of a debtor in execution, being to the <em>custody </em>of the sheriff, and not to the county gaol, or any particular prison, it follows that the sheriff must fix upon the place of confinement within his bailiwick. The law has not provided that aiiy other person shall do it, nor does it declare the county gaol to be the place for such confinement. Sup pose there be no gaol in the county, or that it be insecure, of which the sheriff must judge, shall he not confine elsewhere? The opinion of the court below is in effect, that if a sheriff makes a debtor\u2019s house his prison, and there keeps liliis. confined, yet the sheriff is guilty of an escape. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>They cited <em>Imp.

No injury can be sustained if the person is <em>confined-, </em>and from toe authority referred to in <em>Latch, </em>\u201cconfinement is the whole of the. debtor\u2019s punishment, and of die creditor\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d Here it appears that the party neve? was out of confinement. It would then surely be a very rigid construction to make the sheriff'guilty of an escape, and in op \u2022 posed by the authorities referred to. Such a decioion cam be only authorised upon the principle that he <em>vruoi </em>confino prisoners for debt in the county gaol, and that is in direcS opposition to the authorities cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-8\"><em>Montgomery, </em>(Attorney General,) and <em>Harper, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR6Y\">referred to the stat. 32 <em>Geo. </em>II, <em>ch. </em>22. 1 <em>Backus's Shff. </em>152.
