The plaintiff claims andera deed acknowledged and ret corded in the district of <em>Columbia. Brodhag </em>$t the time was indebted to <em>Dealdns. </em>This sale was void against creditors at the time by act of 1729, <em>ch. </em>8, sect. 5. <em>Brodhag </em>was permitted to hold and exercise every act of ownership over the property, nearly five years after the plaintiff' was authorised, $nd it was his duty to sell the property, if ths <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>debt was not paid. This of itself was evidence, that the debt was paid ta^the bill of sale originally executed to. prott t the property against creditors, ff the deed was not executed with a fraudulent intent, and the debt thereby intended to be secured was not satisfied on the day mentioned in the deed, the possession of <em>Brodhag </em>afterwards was. inconsistent with the deed. <em>Hamilton vs. Russell, </em>1 <em>Cranch, </em>316, <em>Edwards vs. Harben, 2 </em>T. R. 587; in which it is determined, that all such deeds, if the possession does .not accompany and follow the deed, the deed is fraudulent and void' ps to creditors. In these cases, it is true the deed purported to be an absolute transfer, whereas <em>Brad-hag\u2019s </em>deed was conditional. Blit this became absolute upon the arrival of the day of payment. To, suffer <em>Brodhag </em>afterwards to keep possession, exercise every act of ownership over the property, and in every respect to use it as bjs own, would be sufficient to make the deed fraudulent and void as to creditors. In <em>Edwards </em>vs. Harben, Judge <em>Bullet </em>takes the distinction between deeds to take place, immediately, and to take place at a future time, Jn the latter case \u2018Hhe possession continuing with the vendor, till such future time, or the performace of the condition, is consistent with the deed.\u201d If a deed, executed and recorded in the district of Columbia, could be received -ip evidence in a case like this, then ifie object of our act of assembly, to prevent secret sales, would ba defeated, if such a deed could be used after suffering the grantor to keep the possession, of the property in this state four op five years as' his own absolutely, na credftor could be secure. Fraud may be committed with impunity, if a conditional deed will authorise the par\u00bb ty making it to hold the property for any length of time. In order to secure fiis property, and protect it against creditors, a man in debt has nothing to do but to, convey it ta gome person whom he might style a creditor, (for there is no proof, except the deed, of any money basing due to <em>Jones,) </em>and who might, as in this case, refuse ta sell fop payment of the debt, and refuse <em>to, </em>let the claims of other creditors fie paid out of the property. It is contended, that the deed executed in the district of <em>Columbia, </em>could not be used, and ought not to have been, admitted in evidence to establish the plaiufbT\u2019s rigid to this property, and after the long, possession of (he property by <em>Brodhagx </em>the plaintiff coufd not recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>No Counsel argiied for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b517-5\">Chase, Ch.

The copy offered is legal and competent evidence of the bill cf sale, the kws of this state having been adopted in that part of the district of <em>Columbia </em>ceded by this state, and comprehended within the county of <em>Washington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The court concur in the opinions expressed by the court below in the <em>second </em>aiid <em>third </em>bills of exceptions; there being no facts stated to impeach the validity of the bill of sale, or contaminate the transaction with fraud. The circumstances that the grantor was indebted to <em>Francis </em>Dea<em>kins </em>at the time of the obtaining the bill of sale, and the retention of the possession by the grantor, of the negroes for which the action was instituted,- cannot taint the transaction with fraud of collusion to defeat a creditor of h\u00cd3 just claim by covering the property by the bill of sale. It is the right of a debtor to give preference to one of his creditors by a fair and honest transfer of goods and chattels, adequate to the payment of his deb\u00ed; and there are no facts stated to prove that the property transferred was more than sufficient to \u00a1ray the debt intended to be secured, nor is there proof of any collusion between the grantor and grantee to cover the property remaining, from the claims of the other creditors of the grantor, after the debt of <em>Jones </em>was satisfied. The retaining the possession by the grantor is sanctioned by the act of assembly, and the bill of sale cannot be invalidated or impeached by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIBMEDi</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
