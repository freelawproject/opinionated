The court, upon the prayer of the plaintiff, directed the jury, that if they believed the debt from <em>Brown </em>to <em>Norris </em>was due and payable at the time of issuing the <em>capias ad respondendum, </em>in the name of <em>Norris </em>against Brown; and also if they believed the evidence offered by the plaintiff, that the\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tli\u00e9 pl\u00e1intiffis entitled'to recover* The defendant except* ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-3\">3. \u00edll\u00e9 plaintiff then offered evidence to prove, that \u25a0 the lots, for which this ejectment is brought, was part of the land mentioned in the act of assembly aforesaid, (1782, <em>Ah, </em>2,) so claimed by <em>Howard, </em>and laid off into a town, and that the said lot was conveyed by <em>Howard </em>to <em>Di~ \u00bflitir, </em>and was improved by <em>Didier </em>about teri year's ago, and (continued in his occupation and possession until he sold it to <em>Brown, </em>who continued in possession of the lot and premises until fhe22d of February 1802.

In <em>England, </em>under the bankrupt laws, the assignees in suits brought by them, are bound to prove every fact by <em>viva voce </em>evidence. The proceedings, of the commissioners are not evidence' erran in actions to recover money due to the bankrupt; they are not evidence except in actions between- parties and privies. <em>Upon common </em>law principles the judgment of the commissioners is not evidence for any purpose; ami the bankrupt cannot be a witness'to prove his own bank-i-\u00abptcy.

They cited <em>Berrington vs. Parkhurst, </em>2 <em>Stra. </em>1086. <em>Runn. Eject. </em>86. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>105, 106, 86, 87. 2 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>443. 3 <em>Blk.

The demise is a. matter bf form, and is an immateriabpart of the declaration; arid besides, und\u00e9r the act of 1809, <em>ch. </em>153, it could be amended.

The assignment of the commissioners was evidence of all the facts therein stated; add it was Sufficient evidence against an intruder without title.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-9\">Chase, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZq\">delivered the opinion of the court. The court dissent from the opinions of the county court as expressed in the several hills of exceptions taken in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">On the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, the court are of opinion, that the proceedings of the commissioners of bankruptcy are not legally admissible as evidence in this case, to prove the act of bankruptcy committed by <em>Aquila Brown </em>\u2014 the proceedings being <em>res inter alios acta, </em>and not evidence according to the principles of the common law, and not made evidence by the laws of the <em>United States, </em>whifch relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>this subject. The opinion, therefore, of the court below cn this bill of exceptions is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\">On the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, the court are of opinion, that the opinion of the court below is erroneous, this court being of opinion, that it appears by the proof stated in the case that the lessors of the plaintiff below had no title at the time of the demise laid in the declaration of ejectment, but that their title, if they had any, accrued subsequently to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">An ejectment is an action to try the right qf possession to the land in controversy. The lease, entry and ouster, laid in the declaration, are fictitious, and substituted ip the place of a real lease, actual entry and ouster. The time of the demise is matter qf substance, and not form., and the plaintiff must show a title in his lessors anterior to the time of the demise, because without such title they could not make a real lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In an action for the mesne profits, the plaintiff can recover profits from the time of the demise, without showing title, the defendant being concluded by itj but if he claims profits prior to the time qf the demise, the defendant ma,y controvert his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The court will allow the plaintiff to, amend his declaration at any time before verdict, by changing the time of the demise, for the attainment of justice, on such terms as will impose no hardships on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">That clause of the act of last session, <em>(Nov. </em>1809,. <em>eft. </em>153, <em>s. %) </em>which lias been referred to, does pot extend to matters of substance, but to form.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">It appearing on the record that the lessors of the plain-, tiff had no title to the land in question, at the time of the demise, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">On the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions, the court are of opinion, that according to. the whole proof stated in the case, the plaintiff has no right to recover, there being no title deduced from the patentee of <em>\u00bfAin's Lot </em>to <em>John Eager Howard, </em>and there being no possession proved in <em>Jlquila Brown, </em>and those under whom he claims,, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover in ejectment without showing title.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">7V$GM#KT BEYEKSEP*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
