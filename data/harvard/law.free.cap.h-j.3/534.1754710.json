The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they believed these facts, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. Rut the court directed the jury, that if they believed the gin to have been sent to <em>Tates to be </em>sold by him at public auction, and that he sold it at private sale, without the authority of <em>Williams </em>&amp; <em>Hollingsworth, </em>and did not pay over the proceeds, that it was a breach of the condition of his bond as auctioneer.
