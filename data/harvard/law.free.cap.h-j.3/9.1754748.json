They contended that the finding of the jury, as to the beginning of <em>Gist\u2019s Inspection, </em>ought to have been rejected as surplusage, and the court should have corrected the verdict so as to make the beginning at the letter I, and rendered judgment thereon. If the jury find what is contrary to the agreement of the parties, it is mere surplusage, and judgment is to be entered on the remaining part of the verdict. They cited <em>7 Bac.

Dorsey, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai\">stated that two questions arose upon the refusal of the court below to enr fer judgment upon the first verdict \u2014 1. Did the court ere in so refusing? And 2. If they did, was it competent for the appellant to avail himself of it on his appeal? They admitted, on the <em>first question, </em>that the court might mould the verdict so as to carry the intention of the jury into, effect; but they contended, that if it had been done in, this Case there would have been quite a different finding from that contemplated by the jury, since the jury might not have found the same variation of the compass from the beginning at the letter I, which they did from the figure 9. In all-the cases cited by the counsel for the, appellant, after the surplusage was stricken out, there was a. complete verdict remaining upon which judgment could be entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">On <em>the second question, </em>they contended, that the plaintiff below, on the refusal of the court to enter judgment on the. verdict, should have availed himself of the err or at the.time by an appeal or writ of error; but having submitted to the. decision, and prayed the court to award a <em>venire de novoi </em>which was granted to him, he has waived all error, if there was any.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">On the question arising on the <em>bill of exceptions, </em>they referred to <em>Hammond, et al.

Chase, CL J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK\">delivered the opinion of the court. As to the first question, in this case arising on the refusal of the court to enter up judgment on the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">It appears to the court that the verdict was insufficient, and that the court below did not err in refusing to enter judgment on it, and in granting a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">The jury were concluded by the admissions of the parties, and ought to have found the beginning of <em>Gist\u2019s In-ejection </em>at Is the place admitted, but having disregarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the admissions of the parties, and found the beginning o\u00ed' <em>Gist\u2019s Inspection </em>at a different place, figure 9, the subsequent finding of the jury is predicated on that mistake, and the courses and distances of <em>Gist\u2019s </em>Inspection, as found by the jury, must run from figure 9, and the court have no power to change the verdict, and to lay them down from I, contrary to their intention plainly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\">If the verdict of the jury is insufficient, or contrary to the admissions of the parties, the court have the power of granting a new trial, or ordering a venire, for the at-, fainment of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">It is the acknowledged and exclusive province of .the jury to decide on the variation of the compass, and to make such an allowance as corresponds with the proof, and will advance justice. The juries, in fixing the variation of the compass, are not confined to any certain rules, but are governed by the circumstances existing in the case. The juries, in some cases, have refused to make any allowance, in others they have allowed at the rate of one degree for every twenty years, and in others they have been influenced by ancient runnings and proof of possessions, There being,, therefore, no certain criterion by \u25a0which the allowance can be ascertained with precision, it would be assuming too much in the court to change the verdict in this case, by running the courses according to the patent of <em>Gist\u2019s Inspection </em>from I, instead of the fig\u00fare 9, With the same allowance of variation. ' *</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">[<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It appears to <em>me </em>that the plaintiff has relinquished all advantage he might have been entitled to, by \u00e1cquiescing in the opinion of the court, and'moving'for a <em>vepire facias de </em>novo, and obtaining\u2019 \u00e1 new trial. The ground of the'motiqn was the insufficiency of the verdict, and was granted; at the instance and on the suggestion of the plaintiff! If th\u00e9\u2019 court below had\u2019 erred in refusing to enter up judgment ori' the verdict, and (lie plaintiff had rested'his case on itr judgment of <em>non pr\u00e1.ss </em>would have be\u00e9n given, and ' the\u2019 plaintiff could have obtained redress by writ of error; but according to this mode of proceeding, if sanctioned by .this? court, the plaintiff will have the benefit of a second tria!, and the right of afterwards questioning che* judgment below...
