The general demurrer to the rejoinder, that <em>Elizabeth Costin </em>was the guardian of <em>M?m,- </em>accepted the trust, and paid over the money she' received as executrix, to herself as guardian, admits the facts; therefore she did pay over the money; and no presumption is necessary of the payment over, as the demurrer admits it. After the lapse of a year the legacy vested, or must be presumed to have been paid over to the guardian. He cited 2 <em>Harr.
