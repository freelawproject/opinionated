The plaintiff also read in evidence a dee&lt;j from <em>John Parsons to John Hamer, </em>and one from <em>John Parsons </em>and <em>Dameras Parsons </em>his wife, to <em>John Hamer. </em>He then read in' evidence the will of <em>John Hamer, </em>devising his dwelling plantation to his daughter <em>Mary Hamer, </em>and proved that a certain <em>Mary Hamer </em>married one <em>John </em>Chaires, and by him had two sons <em>John Chaires </em>and <em>James Chaires, </em>of whom <em>John Chaires </em>was her eldest son arid heir at law; that she survived her said husband <em>Chaires, </em>and intermarried with a certain <em>Solomon Clayton, </em>and after his death she became the wife of on <em>e Edward Downes, </em>and died the widow of <em>Downes </em>in the year 1779. The plaintiff also proyed by a witness, that he, the witness, was at the funeral of the said <em>Mary Downes, </em>and when he had returned home with .her mother, who is now dead, he was informed by her, that the maiden name of the said <em>Mary Downes </em>was Hamer, but that .hg did not remember to have understood from her that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>-\u00cdW said <em>Mary Dowrtes </em>was the daughter of <em>John Ilamer. </em>The plaintiff also proved by said witness, that the late <em>John Chaims, </em>deceased, who was sometimes called Preacher <em>John, </em>was 1he eldest son of the above <em>named,John Chaires, </em>son of the said, <em>Mary Downes, </em>and that the said <em>Mary Downes, </em>ftt her decease* was a very old woman. By another witness \u2014 that many years ago he lived in the family of the above named <em>Mary Downes, </em>and that he constantly understood From her and others, that preacher <em>John Chaires </em>was her grandson, the son of her eldest son <em>John Chaires, </em>at that time deceased; and that the plantation in <em>Johny Cake Neck, </em>held by the said <em>Mary Downes, </em>she delivered up to her said grandson in her life-time. Which last mentioned evidence was offered, not to prove a possession jii the plantation aforesaid, b\u00fct merely to show that <em>John Chaires, </em>preacher* was grandson and heir at law of <em>Mary Downes, </em>The plaintiff <em>then </em>read in evidence a deed from the said preacher <em>Jo/i\u00f1 Chaires, </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff. \"When the plaintiff had thus traced his title from the patentee, the defendant moved the co\u00fart to instruct the jury, that the above mentioned deed from <em>Thomas Wyatt </em>and <em>Judith </em>his wife, to <em>John Parsons, </em>was inoperative to pass a fe&lt;3 from <em>Judith Wyatt </em>to <em>John Parsons, </em>she not being a grant-'d1 in that deed, and that there was a chasm in the evidence, and that the plaintiff, who is to recover on the strength of bis title, could not therefore support his ejectment. The court, <em>\\_Purnell, </em>A. J.j was of opinion, and did so state to the jury, that the said deed from <em>Thomas Wyatt </em>and <em>Judith </em>his A\u2019ife, to <em>John Parsons, </em>was ineffectual to pass the fee simple estate to <em>John Parsons, </em>the said <em>Judith </em>not being a grantor in the said deed, and that the title of the plaintiff was not fully made out. The plaintiff\u2019excepted; and the verdict being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-3\">The cause was argued before- Polk, Nicholson, and Johnson, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-4\"><em>Girmichael, </em>for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amqt\">contended, that a different construction will be given to a deed of 1688 from what would be given to a modern deed; and although the deed in question would be invalid if a recent <em>one, </em>it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>valid as an ancient deed.
