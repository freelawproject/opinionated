But the court, <em>\\_Hieholson, </em>Ch.J. and Mailings-<em>worth, </em>A. J.-1, overruled the objection, and permitted the commission and depositions to he read in evidence to the jury. The defendant excepted,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">2. The plaintiff, in support of the issue joined on the <em>third count </em>of his declaration, offered <em>to read </em>in evidence an affidavit, dated the 10th of April 1801, and proved to have been made before <em>G. G. Presbury, </em>o.ne of the justices of the peace for <em>Baltimore </em>county, by the defendant, <em>(Wilson,) </em>and to have been signed by <em>Wilson. </em>The only part necessary to be stated is this, viz. \u201cAnd this deponent deposes and declares, that in the outward bound cargo of the sloop <em>Delight, </em>there was a certain quantity of <em>American </em>soap, which to his certain knowledge was sold at <em>Curmou </em>by the said <em>Alexander Mitchell, </em>at six dollars <em>per box, </em>current money of the <em>U. S. </em>of <em>America, </em>any tiling in the account of sales rendered by the said <em>Alexander Mitchell </em>to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d The defendant objected to the reading of this paper to the jury. But the court, f Nicholson, Ch. J, and <em>Hdlingswor\u00edh </em>A. J.j overruled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>objection. The defendant excepte;}; and the verdict and judgment being against [iim, lie appealed to this court,</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-8\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch. J. Buchanan, Gantt, and Earrs, J. .</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-9\"><em>Harper, </em>for tbe Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhH\">L The question under the <em>first </em>bill ot exceptions, arises on the ground that it does not appear that the commissioners, named in the commission, took the oath required, before some person legally authorised to administer it. The court will not presume that the persons, before whom the oath appears to have been taken, had proper authority. This is not similar to <em>Bryden vs. Taylor, </em>2 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>396, nor <em>De Sobry vs. Terrier, Ibid </em>191. In the former case, the court presumed tbgt the person, \\yho acted as a justice, was such, because they were bound tq know who were the justices of the peace, records thereof being- in the court; but this court are not bound to know, nor have they the means of knowing, the officers of - a foreign country; they can only know legally, by having it certified tq them qnder the seal of such country. The court are bound to notice a <em>pyblig seal, </em>as in <em>De Sobry vs. Terrier, </em>such seals being evidence of themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-10\">2. The <em>second </em>bill of exceptions rests upon a variance between the <em>third </em>count in the declaration, and the affidavit offerpd to support it. In thaf count it is stated that the soap was sold at six dollars for <em>the tvholq quantity j awl </em>the affidavit stated it ta have been sold at six dollars <em>per box. </em>This is a substantial variance. But even if it was not, it would still b.e fatal; for where a written instrument is professed to be set out, it inpst be done word fur word.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-12\">Hinder, for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar7\">I. The objection to, the execution of the commission offered in evidence in the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, has no force! If this commission is , defectively executed, there never was one legally executed. Here the coqnty court delegated'an authority to certain persons, who certify that they have performed \\vhat the court directed. If this, fa not evidence, then the court are not to believe that the commissioners examined the witnesses; and they must have other proof that the depositions of the witnesses were properly taken. In the cases of <em>Bryden vs. Taylor, </em>and <em>De Sobry vs. Terrier, </em>the ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>jections did not arise under commissions issued from the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-4\">2. There must be a clerical mistake in the third count, in the omission of the words <em>per box. </em>The objection in the court below was not on this ground, but because the affidavit was not set out at'length. The great strictness'in setting out the wiiole instrument has been greatly relaxed j and where the substantial words are proved, it is now held to be sufficient. This is the case of a <em>libel. </em>Mere the reference is to the affidavit, and the defendant has notice \u00a9f the words charged and relied on. It is so \u00edn a libel, where the publication is referred to, and it may be known,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">3. There being a general verdict in this case, and there being other counts in the declaration, which are good, the action can be sustained, and the judgment may be entered on any one of the good counts, under the act of 1809, <em>eh. </em>153.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b107-6\">Chase, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azxs\">The court could never permit the plaintiff to take a judgment on a count upon which he had given no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The court concur with the court below, in the opinion expressed in the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions, but dissent from, that in the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
