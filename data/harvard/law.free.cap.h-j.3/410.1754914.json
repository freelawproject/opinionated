The lands were sold, inplnding those purchased from Lawson; and the money ap.~ plied to pay the legacies, leaving <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>debt due. <em>Lawson </em>brought a suit against the executors of <em>Caleb Dov,sey, </em>and at August term 1783, obtained judgment.

On t|ie 4th of November 1784, a decree was passed for the sale of <em>Taylgr's Forest, </em>&amp;c. and <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>th? guardian, appointed the trustee to sell. On the 7th <em>ef </em>November' 1784, the trustee\u2019s bond was filed.

The main object of the bill appears tq be to vacate the sale made by <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>as trustee, <em>under the </em>decree therein mentioned, as far as it related to the property purchased by a certain <em>Samuel Godman, </em>(for the use, as it is alleged, of the said <em>Edward </em>Dorsey,) and to annul the deeds executed in consequence of the said sale, on such terms, as on ail account taken should appeal- to be proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">But there ape other objects which will require to be stated and disposed of. The bill prays for an account of the rents and ptofits of the complainant\u2019s estate received by <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>as his guardian; but from the answers of the defendants, the evidence taken, and the arguments adduced, it does not.appear that this is relied on as a distinct ground for relief, or if it is, that a case is made out to entitle the complainant to relief qn that account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">Another account is, that the complainant should not be liable for any part of the debt due from <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>to <em>Alexander Lawsoy, </em>because the land, the foundation of the debt, had been sold and applied to the legacies under the will of <em>Caleb Dorsey. </em>This allegation goes to impeach the decree made by the former' chancellor in November 1784, for the sale of part of the real estate of the complainant, on a bill filed by the executors of <em>Caleb </em>Dorsey, in-which his will and codicil, with a copy of the judgment by <em>Dawson, </em>against them, were exhibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">This decree could tje opened only by a bill \u00f3f review, or by a bill or petition, alleging-that it was obtained by fraud. From the arguments of the complainant\u2019s counsel, it appears that the circumstance of the money due to <em>Lawsan, </em>pot beipg chargeable to the cornplainqnt, is not relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>&amp; 8a dir.finct and substantive ground of relief. Inti to be talc-fen into the account in case of a vacation of the sale, but if this should not be the cas\u00e9, the charge is not supported so as to entitle the complainant to a decree on that ground. The main object of the bill, as above stated^ is considered also as resting ori distinct grounds. <em>First, </em>the circumstances attending the filing of the bill for the sale of the complaiuatit\u2019s land, the answer by <em>Edward </em>Dorsey, as guardian, and his being appointed trustee,- as they are alleged in the present bill. And <em>secondly, </em>the charge that <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>the trustee, was in fact the purchaser by the agency of <em>Samuel Godman, </em>who was returned as siich, and that the lands were sold to him for less than their value. As to the first ground, there is nothing to show that the executors of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>had any view in filing their bill; and obtaining a decree for \u00e1 sale, more than to raise the sum for which <em>Laivson </em>had obtained judgment against them. The conducto!' <em>Edward Dorsey </em>in that suit is not so clear of suspicion, although in his answer he states that a sale would be for the interest and benefit of his ward\u2019s estate, and Would avoid the ruinous consequences of accruing Interest; y\u00e9t it is to be observed, that the answer was put in with unusual promptness; that the facts in the bill were fully admitted, and that in addition thereto, his consentid writing wps given to the sale about to be decreed, and that he was himself appointed trustee. The chancellor considers this as the most doubtful pari of the case, connected also with the time and manner of making the report Or return of (lie sale; but notwithstanding his desire that rules against fraud, (as expressed by ids predecessor in one of thro cases cited.) should be as strict as possible, he is obliged to determine that these circumstances, (independent of the purchase being made by <em>Godman </em>for the trustee,) are not sufficient to establish the charge of fraud, as tirade in this part of the bill. The second ground is viewed as the most important in the bill, because, without giving a positive decision on it, the chancellor is strongly inclined to the opinion, that if established, it would either by itself, or in corroboration of the other circumstances, be sufficient to vacate the sale. 3t is therefore necessary to examine particularly the evidence relating to this charge. The chancellor cannot admit the position, that the circumstances of this case are such as to throw the. <em>onus probandi </em>on- the da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>fend ants, that the sales were to and for <em>Godman. </em>They were so returned by the trustee', though at a late period, \u00e1hd <em>the </em>proof of the allegations in the bill must of course come from the complainant. The circumstances relied on for this proof are the' continued possession of <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>the date of the deeds, and (according to the complainant\u2019s argument,) the want of evidence of ariy payment by <em>t\u00ed adman. </em>But if <em>Godman </em>is considered \u00e1s the real purchaser, or if the complainant fails to prove that lie was not such, it cannot be required, after the lapse of so many years, that the payment of the purchase money by him should be proved by the present defendants. And in this part of the case the chancellor will consider the observations on both sides as to the time of filing the' present bill. The bill for the sale of the present complainant\u2019s real estate was filed, and the decree passed, before the act of 1785. It might possibly have been' filed under the act of November !773, but was not so filed. That act gives to the infant six months after his coming to full age to show cause against the decree,- and in <em>England, </em>the common Course is, to decree in such cases with <em>nisi causa, </em>within six months after the infant should come of agej and this having been fixed On as a reasonable time, it seems to fob\u00bblow that an acquiesence, or a neglect of nearly six years, during three of which the trustee was Living, and could have answered for himself, is a circumstance of considerable Weight against the complainant, although not such as to be a bar to the relief prayed by him, if sufficient evidence' should beproducedjbutthe circumstances above stated douot amount to such evidence, although they create a strong suspicion. It remains to examine what is brought forward as direct evidence of the purchase by <em>Godman </em>having been made for <em>Edioard Dorsey, </em>the trustee. <em>Caleb Owings, </em>one of xhe witnesses, says in answer to the 6th interrogatory, tha'fc it was so understood, (that is, that <em>Godman </em>purchased for <em>Dorsey,) </em>he thinks generally, at the time of the sale,- but does not recollect that any person told him so. It is presumed there can be no doubt as to the ins\u00ediff\u00edciency Of this part of the testimony. The evidence .of <em>Alien Dorsey </em>is to the same effect. <em>Samuel Norwood </em>and <em>Edward Nor-wood </em>both prove that <em>Samuel Godman </em>told them, or said, that he' purchased the land for <em>Edward Dorsey. </em>The fact of his having so said must be considered -as established fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>by these witnesses; but it is also considered by the chancellor, as a point clear of doubt, that his declarations, as proved, not in the presence of the other party, and not assented to or uncontradicted by him, cannot be received as evidence. The next testimony is that of <em>Brutus God-, \u2022man, </em>which is at least eq\u00fcally objectionable; for although the counsel for the complainant argues, \u201cThat the fact of such a letter being there is proved by him,\u201d yet it will appear to be a fact having no weight in the cause. This witness on his first examination, deposed, that about the year 1803, he remembered seeing among his father\u2019s papers a letter from <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>deceased, to the said <em>Samuel Godman, </em>to purchase the said land for him. But on his cross-examination he states that he had no other knowledge that the <em>letter </em>was written by <em>Edward Dorsey </em>than that Iiis name was signed to it. He does not say that he had ever seen him write, or had any knowledge of his handwriting. If the letter was produced} and depended on his knowledge only, it could not be received as evidence, and yet it would be apparently a stronger circumstance than his deposition that such a letter existed. It may be an unfortunate circumstance for the complainant, that <em>Brutus Godman </em>did not know the hand-writing of <em>Edward </em>Dorsey\u00bf or that he did not preserve the letter. But supposing it to have been genuine, it only induces a belief that evidence then existed which is now totally lost. And here, without borrowing from the defendants\u2019 counsel, his remarks as to the cyphers, it may be justly said, that if what is stated by <em>Caleb Owing\u00bb </em>and <em>Mien Dorsey, </em>as to what was understood at the sale, is not evidence; if the declarations of <em>Samuel Godman to Samuel </em>and <em>Edioard Norwood </em>are not evidence, and if the circumstances as to the letter stated by <em>Brutus Godman </em>are not evidence, no greater effect can be produced by combining them together. It is certain that the terms of the decree for the sale, were not fully complied with by the trustee. The return or report was not made in due time, and the bond of indemnity against <em>Lawson's </em>claim has never been procured; but the report, though made at a late period, appears to have been so far received by the court, that no positive measures were taken against it; and it is not alleged that the complainant, hi\u00bbs sustained any loss for want of the bond of iademnitji, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>or that he has been called on to pay again the debt du\u00e9 t3 <em>Lawson^ </em>So that the money, for which the l\u00e1nd sold,- must be considered \u00e1s applied to that debt, according to the report. For the reasons herein <em>stated </em>\u2014 Decreed, that the bill of the' complainant be dismissed, but without costs. From that decree the complainant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">The cat\u00edse w\u00e1=r arg\u00faed befor\u00e9 Chase, Ch.

The special authority given by the will to the executors Was limited to the Sale of the entailed lands for the payment of the legacies alone.- The act of assembly of 1773, <em>ch. </em>2, for the sale of the lands of <em>Caleb </em>Dorsey,- for the payment of the legacies, was simply an authority to sell the <em>Curtis </em>creek lands, and there was Uo' authority given to them to sell <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>Forest,- either for the payment of the debts or the legacies. \u00edt is contended ,-oft the part \u00f3f the appellant,- T. That the bill, proceedings, and decree thereon, in 1784, for the sale'of <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>Forest,- <em>viere </em>irregular. By the record of those proceedings it appears that the bill was-filed against the appellant, then ati infant, in June 1784, by the executors, for the sale of the real estate \u00a9f <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>to pay <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>debt, without showing how the personal assets-had been'administered; that an answer by the guardian was filed in October 1784, admitting all the allegations stated in the bill, and praying that particular lands might be sold, and amongst others, <em>Taylor\u2019s Forest. </em>On the 4th of November 1784, a sale was- decreed for cash,, and <em>Edward </em>Dorsey, the guardian, appointed the trustee to make the sale, who gave bond on the 17th of November 1784. Six months- notice in some newspaper was required by the decree to be given previous to the day of sale. The sale took place, of <em>Taylor\u2019s Foi'est </em>alone, before the 20th of December \u00cd784, so that no- such notice was or could be given, and on the day of sale, <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>debt was paid. There was no report of the sale made to the court, but simply an account filed in 1789 charging money paid to <em>Lawson, </em>&amp;c. and crediting, the sales- to1 <em>God-; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>man </em>and <em>Norwood </em>of <em>Taylor's </em>Forest, and of tins account there was no coniii'mation by the chancellor; nor was any bond given, as directed by the decree, by the claimant to the defendant, in the proceedings. It is contended that there was no legal foundation for fding the bill in 1784 by the executors, as they were not bound to pay the codicil legacies; that the bill was tiled with a suppression of facts, and the statement in it did pot place the subject matter properly before the chancellor; but being admitted by the guardian, the decree passed as a matter of course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-4\">2.

That <em>Edward </em>Dorsey, the trustee, had possession of the land when he sold it, and continued to hold and claim it until his death, having immediately after the salo commenced cutting wood, &amp;c. for his own use and benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">Oil the <em>third point, </em>he insisted, that it was fully proved by the testimony that <em>Godman </em>purchased the land <em>far Edward Dorsey, the trustee. </em>That even if <em>Dorsey </em>furnished <em>Godman, </em>(who is proved not to have been in a situation to piake the payment,) with the money to pay for the land, he was a trustee for the benefit of <em>Dorsey. </em>He referred to <em>Villiers vs. </em>Villiers, 2 <em>Atk. </em>72. To prove that the declarations of <em>Godman </em>were evidence, he referred to <em>Strode vs. Winchester, </em>1 <em>Dickins, </em>397. <em>Willis vs. Willis, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>71. <em>Man vs. </em>Ward, <em>Ibid </em>229. That the trustee could not purchase at his own sale, he cited <em>Whepdale vs. Cookson, 1 </em>Ves. 9. <em>Munro vs. </em>Allaire, <em>2 Caine's Cases, </em>192. <em>Oldin vs. Samborne, 9 Atk. </em>15. <em>Sugd. </em>391. <em>Turner vs. Bouchell, (ante 99;) </em>and <em>Conoway vs. Green, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>151. The recent insolvency of <em>Godman </em>shows that he could not command so large a sum as the purchase money for the land; and <em>Dorsey's </em>retaining the possession, and cutting so largo a quantity as 30,000 cords of wood off the {and, as is iti proof, shows evidently that <em>Godman </em>purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>for <em>Dorsey, </em>The part of the land sold to Norwood, proved not to be better in any respect, brought a much higher price than that purchased by Godman, which was struck off fora sum 86000less than its value.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-3\"><em>Ihartin, Shaaff </em>and <em>Harper, </em>for the Appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqbc\">contended, 1. That all the necessary and legal parties were not before the court; and that as the bill was dismissed it was of no consequence upon what ground, if it was correctly dismissed. They insisted that the legatees under the will and codicil of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>.should have been made par* ties, that they might show whether or not they had any interest. They referred to <em>Harr. Chan. Pr. </em>32, 33. 1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>72. 2 <em>Eq. Ca.

That the decree of 1784, which was fair and proper, and justified by the facts, could not be impeached; but that the copy of the proceedings and decree, as exhibited, not being under seal, cannot be evidence in this case. They cited <em>Norwood vs. Norwood, </em>1 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>525.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-9\">3. That the d\u00e9clarations of <em>Samuel Godman, </em>marie when he had an interest in the land, were not to be reeeiv\u00bb ed as evidence agains.t his alienee or vendee. They cited <em>Ford vs. Lord Grey, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>286. S. C. 6 <em>Mod. </em>44. That jf <em>Godman </em>could not have been a witness at the time he made the declarations, they could never afterwards be evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-11\">4.

Tliat there is not sufficient proof that <em>Samuel </em>God\u00bb <em>man </em>purchased\u2019 the land at the instance and for the benefit of <em>Edward 'Dorsey, </em>the trustee; and that even if the purchase was for the benefit of the trustee, it did not, <em>\u00edps\u00f3 facto, </em>vacate the sale, which must depend upon application being made within a reasonable time to set it aside, 'that if the conduct of the trustee was fair and proper, and the sale was for the interest and advantage of the minor, it must be confirmed.

The objection as to the want of parties, if a valid one, which is not admitted, ought to have been urged in the court below. If all the necessary parties have not been made, this court may remand the record to have the proper parties . added. But the court may presume the legacies have been paid from the lapse of time. It is wholly unnecessary for the legatees to be parties; and if they were parties, no other decree eouid be made, than would be if they were not parlies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-3\">3. As to the record of the proceedings on the bill in 1784, this court may revise the decree on the same evidence which the chancellor had before him, and he might look into the records of his own court, and form his decree accordingly. Here the copy exhibited in the court of chancery was not objected to, of course it was allowed to be considered as evidence, because, if objected to, it might have been easily made evidence. He cited <em>Carroll et al. Lessee vs. </em>Norwood, 4 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Hen. </em>290. Here the' proceedings referred to constitute a part of the record before this court, and is not similar to <em>Norwood vs. Nor-wood, </em>where the proceedings had not beeu exhibited, but were merely referred to. But without these proceedings of 1784., the appellees have no case, because without them, it does not appear that they have a title to the land under any sale. Yet by their answer they have admitted the proceedings as evidence, by not objecting to them, nor exhibiting different proceedings. This court acts here as the chancellor acted in his court, and the same rules of evidence in that court govern in this, and if the proceedings were evidence there, so they will be here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">3. The land in question being an estate in tail in the appellant, it was not liable to sale Tor debts under the decree, of 1784. The debt due to <em>Lawson </em>was a mere personal charge on <em>Samuel Dorsey, </em>which could not affect the appellant, the heir in tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-5\">4. The declarations of <em>Samuel Godman </em>are evidence. The recital in a deed is evidence against the grantor, and his assigns, not on the principle of notice, but because it contains the declarations of the grantor; and upon the same principle <em>Godrnan\u2019s </em>declarations are proof.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-6\">Shttafs,nd <em>Harper,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJV\">with tjie permission of the court, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>answer to (be new matter urged by the ppunsel for the Appellant ip reply, stated\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-5\">1. It has been ppntended by the appellees, that the legatees under thp codicil of <em>Caleb /Jersey, </em>(lie common pncestor, ought tp be before the court, because^ even if the present suit shotijd bp decided jn favour of the appellees, yet these legatees may in future assert their claim, apd that the court of chancery will not allow (he same question <em>to </em>be twice agitated. The appe]\u00a1ppt objects, that this ought to have been urged in the court below. This objection cannot prevail, as is proved by the gmthorities, apd by the judgment of this court in the case of <em>Coale et al. vs. Mildred's Adm'r. (ante </em>278,) where the decree was reversed for want of parties, and yet no objection cif that kind was urged below. It is stated that this court may remand the record to haye the parties added. This is not admitted by the appellees, because fhe chancellor may in guch case either dismiss the bill, or give leave to amend, in his discretion. Ife has here exercised this discretion; ant] there is no instance of reversal for an undue exercise of discretion; this case is still stronger, for here the bill was dismissed, which may well be, for want pf parties, the decree, therefore is right, and must be affirmed, and on affirmance cannot be remanded. Again, it is said that the court must presume these legacies are paid from the lapse of time; this cannot be, because, when Iapsp of time is relied on as evidence pf payment, the fact of payment must be alleged. In this case there is no such allegation, on the contrary, the bil] seems fo imply, that the legatees were not paid,</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-6\">g. On the subject of the copy of tjie record in chancery in ]784 being evidence, it is admitted that any court pipy look into its owp <em>records, </em>every court being acquainted with its own records; but when the judgment of an inferior court is revised, the appellate court can, judicially, only know what is thus looked into by the inferior-court, to bp a record, by the legal evidence of the fact, <em>viz. </em>by a copy under seal. Again, it js said' that this copy not haying been objected to, is evidence. Npt so, because this is oply an allegation of the bill, and the same as if copied into it, and because either, party may file any paper in chancery, and the court decides, only, on the lega] evidence; the contrary in a court of law, where any paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>read in evidence; and not objected to; is considered as admitted; this answers the case of <em>Carroll et al. Lessee vs. Norwood. </em>It is not conceded that without the record of 1784 the appellees have no case, because, being the Statement of the bill, the complainant is confined to it. And because the bill states the existence of a bill, answer, decree and sale \u2014 The answer admits a bill, answer, decree and sale, so far the parties are <em>not </em>at issue \u2014 -The bill States a certain copy, the answer does <em>not </em>admit this; but refers to the proceedings in chancery, alleging a dif\u00ede\u00bb i-ent concltisiori of the case, <em>viz. </em>a ratification. Evefy necessary allegation must be proved; and if the answer is silent as to it, the course is to except to the answer. Again, if it should be thought that no legal title appeared in the appellees, this consequence follows, that the legal <em>title </em>would still <em>be hi the appellant,- and that </em>his remedy would not be in equity <em>to </em>vacate the deed, but at law; to recover possession by ejectment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-3\">3. It is understood that the appellant\u2019s counsel argued, that tills being an estate in fail in the appellant, it was not liable to sale for debts, under the decree in 1784. It is conceded, that the estate of the issue' in fail, was not then liable for the debts of the tenant in tail; but this <em>decre\u00e9 </em>Was for the payment of the debt of the tenant in fee, who by devise created the estate tail, viz. <em>Caleb Dorsey, </em>the common ancestor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-4\">4. On the subject of <em>Godman's </em>declarations. \u2014 The application of the doctrine contended for by the appellant\u2019s counsel is disputed by the appellees: Because the reason why the recital in a deed is evidence,ris that the deed, being the title of the grantee, he must take the deed as it is, not only the conveying part, but the recital also, he\u2019 cannot separate the part which 'is in his favour, from that which operates against him. But the parol declarations of the grantor, made before the title accrued, during its continuance, or after its expiration, stands on different grounds. There is here no evidence of any declarations of <em>Godman </em>made at the time of his purchase. The debt to <em>Lawson </em>is expressly charged on <em>Samvel </em>and <em>Edward, </em>generally, <em>ly </em>the codicil; and the codicil legacies are' specifically , charged on the lands devised to <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Edward. </em>Whence it appears, as the appellees contend, that the lands of <em>Samuel </em>were chargeable in the hands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the complainant with one half of the debt to Lawson, the personal estate being entirely insufficient for debts and legacies, and consequently, that the bill in 1784 was properly filed, and that <em>Edward Dorsey </em>acted correctly in admitting the allegations contained in it. Should it be thought that he did not act correctly, still it must be admitted to have been a very doubtful point, in which his conduct may fairly be ascribed to honest mistake, and cannot be regarded as proof of fraud, in which light the argument of the appellant requires it to be viewed. As to the idea of the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the debt to- <em>Lawson </em>was a mere personal charge on' <em>SaniueL </em>which could not affect the appellant, his heir in tail, it appears to be fallad.ous in both its parts. The charge was not merely personal, but was a charge on his estate; and it was a debt due 'from him who created the intail, that is, <em>Caleb Dorsey, </em>and therefore binds his lands in the hands of his devisee in tail, or the remainder-man, who equally claims undet him by the devise*</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-7\">Buchanan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxD\">delivered the opinion of the court., This suit appears to have grown' out of irregularities practised by those who had the settlement of the estate of <em>Caleb Dorsey, </em>but whether by design, misconception, or the common assent of the parties immediately interested, is difficult to determine-. No part of the real estate of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>is charged, either by the will or codicil, with the payment of debts, though by the will, alt the persona] property is, and so much of the personal estate remaining, after th\u00ae payment of the debts, as should be found not necessary for carrying on certain iron works, is charged with the will legacies. Several specified tracts of land, not including that in dispute, are alone charged with the payment of the le- ' gacies raised by the will, but all the lands devised to <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Edward </em>Dorsey, either by the wilt or codicil, are charged with the codicil legacies. At\u2019the-time of executing the will, the purchase from <em>Lawson </em>had not heen made, from which circumstance, and the provision in the codicil, directing <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Edward Dorsey </em>to pay the debt due to <em>Lawson, </em>it is obvious that <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>did not intend that his executors should apply any part of his personal property to the payment of that debt; and if the executors had, after paying all the debts except <em>Lawson% </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>applied the residue of the persona! estate, with the proceeds of sales of the land directed by the will to be sold for that purpose, to the discharge of the legacies, leaving the debt due to <em>Lawson to </em>be paid <em>by Samuel </em>and <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>they would have acted in conformity with the intentions of the testator; which they may have done, though it no where appears. But notwithstanding it seems to have been the iuteution of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>to make the debt to <em>Lawson </em>a personal charge on <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>it was still in law a debt due from him, with winch the whole of his estate was chargeable, and it is now <em>not </em>necessary to inquire whether the personal property was exhausted, and so followed up by <em>Lawson, </em>as would have enabled him to proceed against the real estate of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>in the haiids of <em>Edward hill Dorsey, </em>the appellant. The decree of the court Of chancery, subjecting a part of that estate to be sold for the payment of one half of <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>debt, is in full force, and cannot <em>in </em>this case be impeached by this court; though it is difficult to account for the executors of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>having gone into chancery to procure a sale of the lands, in the hands of <em>Edward Hill Doisey, </em>to discharge the debt due to <em>Lawson, </em>without showing what application; they had made of the personal estate of <em>Caleb Dorsey, </em>or of the money for which the lands, charged by the will with the payment of the wifi legacies, and the lands and works bought of <em>Lawson </em>were sold; nor is it less remarkable that <em>.Edward Dorsey, </em>then the guardian of <em>Edward Hill </em>Dorsey\u201e should have consented to a decree for the sale of the real estate of bis ward, without calling upon the executors to show how they had applied the funds which had come into their hands. The whole transaction wants explanation, but is not so marked as <em>to </em>bear the character <em>of </em>fraud. It 3s stated in the answers in this case, that no part of the money, for which the lands and works bought of <em>Lawson </em>were sold, was applied to the payment of <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>debt, nor Is there any proof that it was so applied. <em>Samuel Dorsey, </em>Who was one of the executors, until the year <em>1777, </em>when he sited, cannot well be supposed to have acquiesced in any Scheme to cheat his son; and the will and codicil of <em>Caleb Dorsey </em>are referred to by the executors in their bill against <em>Edward Hill Dorsey, </em>as exhibits. With a knowledge of the provisions of both of which instruments the chancellor decreed the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Tile decision, therefore, of the question in this case, whether <em>Edward Dorsey </em>bought the land sold by him as trustee, at his own sale, through the instrumentality of <em>Samuel </em>Godman, must be uninfluenced by anything anterior is the decree of 1784, and must be governed by the Other \u25a0 evidence in this cause particularly relating to that transaction. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">The testimony of <em>Brutus Godman </em>was properly rejected; be had never seen <em>Edward Dorsey </em>write,' and had no knowledge of his hand-writing; proof; therefore, of the contents of the paper spoken of, was clearly inadmissible. But this court think the chancellor erred in not receiving the declaratibns &lt;5f <em>Samuel </em>Godman; that he had purchased the land in question for <em>Edward Dorsey. </em>The declarations of a man respecting his title, made befor\u00e9 he parts with his estate, ai*e evidence against him, and all claiming under hiin; and the distinction attempted to be taken between the case of a voluntary transfer, and that of a con- , veyance lor a valuable consideration, is not supported. In this case <em>Godman </em>was the purchaser at the sale, received a conveyance from <em>Dorsey, </em>the trustee, and afterwards \u00a1r'econveyed to him; and it is clear, from- the proof in the cause, that his declarations were made between the tim\u00ae of the sale, and the date of his deed to Dorsey; they would have been good against him as admissions respecting his title, and \u00bfre competent evidence against those claiming under him, who stand in his place, and hold the land subject to any imperfection of title which attended it in his bands. But the declarations of <em>Godman </em>are not the only evidence that he made the purchase for <em>Dorsey. </em>The situation of <em>Godman </em>at the time, the proof that he never took possession of the land, entered upon, or exercised any act of ownership over it; and the circumstance that <em>Taylor\u2019s Forest, </em>which was devised to <em>Samuel </em>and <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>as tenants in common, had been divided before the sale; that <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>who as guardian of <em>Edward Hill Dorsey, </em>was in_ possession at the time of sate of the part sold to <em>Godman, </em>never parted with the possession, but immediately after the sale commenced cutting down the wood that stood upon it For the use of his furnace, and -continued to cut it until his death, or until all was cut down, are very strong and difficult to be resisted. This court are therefore of opinion, upon the evidence before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the\u00ae, tfiat <em>fiftmad 0oilman </em>did buy the land in cjueSlion for <em>Edward Dorsey, </em>the trustee; and that, on the established principle, that a trustee cap never be a purchaser at his own sale, the deeds made in consequence thereof ought to be vacated, (there being no evidence to satisfy the court that <em>Edward Hill Dorsey, </em>the only person interest\u00bb cd, ever assented to the purchase,) and \u2018hat the decree of ijie chancellor ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The court are also of opinion, that the appellant isi lia* able and ought to pay to the representatives of <em>Edwan{ Dorsey </em>the amount paid by him to <em>Alexander Lawson, </em>with a commission of five <em>per cent, </em>on the sum for which the land bought by <em>Edward Norwood </em>was sold, with other incidental charges, subject to a deduction for the amount of <em>Ed-Ward Norwoods </em>purchase, and an allowance for interest, as by the account referred to in the bill qs an exhibit. But that he is entitled to recover the rents and profits of the. land struck off to <em>Samuel Godman, </em>which under the facts and circumstances in this case, the court think gre equal <em>to </em>the interest of the sum, for which he is so answerable* and that the one is, and ought to be taken as a jqst and full set off against the other.
