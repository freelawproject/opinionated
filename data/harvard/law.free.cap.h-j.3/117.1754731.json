At the trial the plaintiff, (now appellant,) <em>offered </em>in evidence an original patent, granted oil the 3d of February 1801, to the lessor of the plaintiff, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the land for which the action was brought. The patent recites, that <em>Henderson, </em>on the 15th of April 1799, obtained out of tjie land office for the <em>Eastern Shore, </em>a special warrant to resurvey a tract of land called <em>Pig Pen, </em>originally on tire 16th of July 1750, granted to <em>Robert Davis </em>for 50 acres; that in pursuance of the warrant a resurvey had been made, and a certificate returned to the land office, bearing date on the 15th of February 1800, and that he had paid to the treasurer the sum of =03 17 9, being the full composition due. The plaintiff also produced a witness to prove the payment of the composition money, for the land mentioned jn the patent, in April 1800. The defendant objected both to the patent and parol evidence, as inadmissible and incompetent, because the patent was issued and obtained after the demise laid in the declaration, and after the action was commenced, and during its pendency. The court, <em>[Polk, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Robins, </em>A. J.] sustained the objection, being of opinion that the evidence was inadmissible and illegal, without the production of the certificate upon which the patent issued. The plaintiff' excepted; and the verdict and judgment be\u00bb ing against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b129-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The rcfiia) in <em>% </em>\u00bfvina oftee d-ne ot flit; emTiikiti# of survey, upon vuioh the grant wus\u00bb foutderi, ** not \u2022'it\u00ed\u00edic\u00fa nt <em>a </em>\u00bb'i~ ti.-nci? of tito time \" hen the survey was made. grant of a tract oflaijd \u00absued <em>after </em>the time of the demise Ind in a declaration in eK-etment Jor the same land, and <em>afear </em>the suit V.his brought, reciting the date of ihe certif\u00edcate of .-orw'y to he prior to the timet\u00edf binij\u00fanfy the suit, it vas held, that the grant vas not tuiiiuuit evident \u00bf/v title, ?.*i\u2018hout jii\u2019uduoihg the certif\u00edcate o\u00ed sum.*) upon wlncfe She issueda \u25a0 1 1</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b130-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The cause was argued before Buchanan, Nicholson, and Earle, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-6\"><em>J.
