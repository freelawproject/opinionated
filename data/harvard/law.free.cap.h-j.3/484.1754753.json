The chancellor\u2019s opinion sufficiently states the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-13\">Kilty, Chancellor,. (July term 1810.) A bill of revivor, has been filed by the complainant, (no.w appellee,) on a bill filed the 4th of September 1806, by his intestate, against the present-defendant, (now appellant,) and <em>JV. Brewer. </em>,The object of that bill wa.s to have the contract annulled ; between <em>Brown </em>and the defendant <em>Brewer, </em>who had sold to him the properly in question, under a decree of this court in a suit by the defendant, <em>Bell, </em>against a certain <em>TV. Brown, </em>on a'mortgage held by the said <em>Bell. </em>It will be seen, from the proceedings in that suit, that a claim was, made by <em>B. Ogle </em>on a judgment prior to the mortgage, Which claim the complainant\u2019s, intestate had procured an. assignment of,and which he had claimed the benefitof,and was 'about to make use of at law until restrained by an injunction from this court. From the, answer of <em>Bell, </em>and the agreement of June J*810, it appears that the whole case is submitted, aqd the interests of the several parties are. to be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-14\">By the counsel for. <em>Bell </em>it is contended, that <em>Ogle </em>lost his claim by bis own negligence, apd that the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ant\u2019s intestate, having purchased <em>at the </em>sale by <em>Brewer, </em>the trustee, with a knowledge of that claim, ought not to be allowed any deduction on account tnereof, supposing it to be valid. But the chancellor is of opinion,, that the claim of <em>B. Ogle </em>was entitled to a preference, ami that it is now before the court to be considered ip the same manner as if he had been a party to the original bill. <em>Decreed, </em>that (the contract not being annulled as is therein prayed,) the injunction heretofore issued be perpetual, <em>Decreed </em>aL so, that the claim of the complainant on the judgment assigned by <em>B. Ogle </em>have a preference to the claim of the1 mortgagor, <em>Bell, </em>out of the proceeds of the sale made by the trustee, <em>Bremer. </em>From this decree the defendant, <em>Bell, </em>appealed to this court,</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b498-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>; Where lands* Which had been mortgaged, n-vre decreed to-be sold on a bill filed m chancery by the mortgagee, and su eh lands were sold, the proceeds of the sale, if there ib a judgment agninst the mortgagor prior to the moitgage, is first to be applied to the payment <em>of </em>such jirdgment, that having a preference to the claim of the mort\u00ab gasee ,</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The cause was argued before Chase, Ch.
