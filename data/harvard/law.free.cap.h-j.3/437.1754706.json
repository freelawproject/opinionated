This was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>and the declaration contained the usual money counts. The general issue was pleaded; and at the trial, the plaintiff, (nosy appellant,) gavein evidence, an admission ot the defendant, (the gppellep,) under hi\u00bb hand, that he had received on the 6th of April 1800, the sum of 22,138 livres, 5 sous, and 11 deniers, current mopey of <em>France, </em>equal to the sum of g4,025 14 cents current money of the <em>United Stales, </em>of the money of the plaintiff, arising from the sal.e of the cargo of a vessel called <em>The Patapsco, </em>which cargo belonged to the plaintiff, and had been captured and carried to <em>France, </em>and was there claimed by the defendant, and recovered and sold by him for the said sum. The defendant then read in evidence the following letter from the plaintiff to him, dated the 24th of December 1802; \u2018\u2018Inclosed is my account current, with you, balance in my favour $2600 52, without interest \u2014 nor have I charged you with the ship <em>Patapsco\u2019s </em>cargo received by you in <em>France, </em>which by your account current appears to be 22,138 5 11, or 84.025 14, for two reasons\u2014 <em>first, </em>because the sun) does not agree with my expectations as to the. amount; <em>secondly, </em>the property was insured in <em>New York, </em>and abandoned to the underwriters, who paid me in full. Perhaps, however, they may appoint me their agent, and in that \u00bfase you shall be informed. You will perceive also that no credit is given for what you are pleased to call my proportion qf <em>Fenwick\u2019s </em>judgment, 12\"2 ijvr\u00e9s, or girC6 It), being at present totally dark on that ^subject. At the foot of the'account two items are nut down, but not the amppnts. The first for want of information, and so of the second \u2014 which' will depend upon <em>tkp </em>amount awarded in <em>London. </em>Some other entries may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>occur, both Dr. and Cr. before our accounts are finally clus* ed; if so, you shall be informed.\u201d The defendant read this letter to prove, that before the time of bringing this action, the plaintiff had caused himself <em>to be </em>insured on the said cargo by <em>The New lark Insurance Company, </em>named in the title of this cause as the persons for whose use the atetion was brought, and \u00e1fter the said capture, had abandoned the cargo to the said insurers, and h^d been by them paid for if. The defendant then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that upon the said evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. This direction the court, <em>QHollingsworth, </em>A. gave to the jury. The plaintiff excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b451-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>' In ap action &lt;vf <em>asiuih/tsit </em>brought liv ,T H, for the useof\u2019N Y,against ,7 B, for a sum of money stated <em>to </em>be received for lum Id J B\u00ab fiom the sale of tin1 car* go of a ve'ssel betongm# to J H, which had been captured, &amp;c.\u2014 Z.VW, that ,T. \u00cdJ* having caused (he cargo to he insured by N Y, (for \u2022whose me the action was brought^ and after the capture lias mg abandoned the cargo to the ui!*uur*o and hauug been paid b&gt; tin m, tiie actum could iipt. he maintained'</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b452-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The cause was; argued before Chase, Ch.
