And it was also covenanted and agreed, by the said de\u00e9d, between 7 <em>he Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid, and the said <em>Graham, </em>that th\u00e9 said <em>GrahaWi </em>should abate two per centum to <em>'The Maryland Insurance Company, </em>in case of the loss Of the said cargo in the said voyage, and that such loss should be paid by <em>The.

And it was also further covenanted and agreed by the said deed, mutually between the said parties, that if any disputes should arise relating' to a loss on the said policy of insurance, the same should be referred to two persons, one <em>to </em>be chosen by the said <em>C-raham, </em>the assured, the other by <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid, which said two persons should have power to adjust the same; and if they should differ, to choose a third, any two of whom agreeing, their determination should be obligatory on both parties. In witness whereof <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid did, by the president thereof, subscribe the sum of sixteen thousand two hundred and sixteen dollars current money, thereby assured, and cause the common seal <em>of </em>the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>company to be affixed to the said premises, iti <em>Baltimore, </em>*\u00b0 w^* ^le county aforesaid, on the day and year aforesaid, as by x\u2019eference to the said deed will fully appear. And although he the said <em>Graham </em>hath welt and duly performed, fulfilled and kept, all and singular the covenants,\u201d ,&amp;c. \u201ccontained in the said deed or policy of assurance, on his part to be performed,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cand hath fully paid and satisfied <em>The Maryland </em>In<em>Sur anee Company </em>aforesaid, a large sum of money, to wit, the sum of eight hundred and twelve dollars and five cents current money, as a premium and reward for the assurance of the above mentioned sixteen thousand two hundred and sixteen dollars. The said <em>Graham </em>in fact faith, that the said boat or vessel called <em>The Heiv </em>Geneva, at the time of making the deed or policy, to wit, on\u201d &amp;c. \u201cat,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cwas in safety, and that divex-s goods,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cof a large value, to wit, of the value of,\u201d &amp;e. \u201cwere then and there \u00abhipped by the said <em>Graham </em>in and onboard of the said boat or vessel, to be carried therein from\u201d &amp;c. \u201cto,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cupon the voyage in the said writing or policy of assurance mentioned, whereof <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid, to wit, at,\u201d &amp;e. \u201chad notice; and being so in safety afterwards, that is to say, on,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cdeparted and sailed,\u201d &amp;c.

The <em>policy of insurance </em>was in the usual manner, stating, that \u201cwhereas <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William Young, </em>for account of <em>Thomas Graham, </em>do make insurance, and cause theqiselves, and their and every of them, to be insured, lost or not lost, at and from <em>New. Geneva </em>to the Hatches, with liberty to touch at <em>Charleston </em>on the <em>Ohio,\u201d </em>&amp;c. \u201cand in case of any loss or misfortunes, it shall be lawful to and for the assured, their factors, servants and assigns, (and the assured on their part agree and engage by themselves, their factors, ser\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u25a0yants or assigns,) to sue, labour and travel, for, in and about the defence, safeguard and recovery of the said <em>\u00b0 J </em>, goods or merchandizes, or any part thereof, without prejudice to this insurance, to the charges whereof we the assurera will contribute according to the rate and quantity of \u00bfhe sum herein insured; and so we the assurers are con\u00bb tented, and do hereby bind <em>The Maryland Insurance, Company </em>to the assured, their executors, administrators and assigns, for the true performance of the premises, confessing ourselves paid the consideration due unto us for the assurance by the said assured, or their assigns, after the rate of five per cent, on cargo by said boat insured against all risks. And in case of loss, the assured is to abate two per cent, and such loss to be paid in ninety days after proof and adjustment thereof, the amount of the note given for the premium, unpaid, being first deducted. And it is mutually agreed, that if any disputes shall arise relating to a loss on this policy, it shall be referred to two persons, one to be chosen by the assured, the other by <em>The Maryland Insurance </em>Company, which two persons shall have power to adjust the same; but in case they cannot agree, then those two persons shall choose a third, and any two of them agreeing, their determination shall be obligatory on both parties. In witness whereof <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>have, by the president, subscribed the sum insured, and caused their common seal to be annexed to these presents in Baltimore, the twenty-fourth day of September one thousand eight hundred and two.\u201d The general issue was pleaded.

No person cart sue upon the policy but he who can be considered <em>a party to the specialty. </em>The policy cannot, as to the assurers, be considered a specialty, and as to the assured a simple contract. An agent cannot seal an instrument for another, so as to be obligatory. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>principle is established in <em>Burnett vs. Kensington, 7 T. R. </em>207. <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William Young </em>alone can bring the 0 \u00b0 . \u00b0 action, and be considered <em>parlies </em>to the specialty, <em>Godin vs. The London Assurance </em>Company, 1 <em>Burr. </em>489, was covenant on a policy executed by <em>The London Assurance Company. Godin, </em>&amp; Co. brought the action in their own names, yet they were only the agents who made the in\u00bb surance for the use of <em>TJhthoff. </em>In <em>7 Wentw. </em>38, is a declaration against <em>The London Assurante Company </em>by <em>Jacob Mendes Da </em>Casta, yet he was only <em>the agent </em>who effected the insurance for <em>Solomon Israel. </em>No person can declare upon a policy under seal, but he, who in consideration of law, is party to the specialty. The agents in these kind o\u00ed policies do declare upon them in their own names; therefore, he for whose use the insurance is effected, is not-considered a party to the policy so as to declare in Ids own name. The case of <em>De Ghetoff vs. London Assurance </em>Com<em>pany, </em>3 <em>Brown's </em>P. <em>C. 525, </em>also establishes the principle, that a suit at law must be in the name of the party who effected the insurance. A charter party executed by the master, <em>though said to be done on behalf of the </em>owners, doth not furnish a direct action grounded upon the instru-merit itself against them. <em>Abbott, </em>146, (122.) But the owner? must be made responsible by a special action on the case, or by a suit in equity. Abbott, 88, (80.) The rule of the law of <em>England </em>is, that the force and effect ' which that law gives to a deed under seal, cannot exist unless executed <em>by the party himself, </em>or by someone in his <em>presence </em>and <em>by his </em>direction; or in his absence bv an agent authorised by another deed. And in all these cases the deed must be made \u201cin the name of the principal,\u201d and not by the agent in <em>his </em>name, for <em>the use of his principal. Abbott, </em>146, (122, 123.) If an obligation be made <em>to J D to the use of J S, </em>it is a good obligation to <em>J S </em>in equity, but he cannot sue at law. The suit must be in the name of <em>J D. Shep. Touch. </em>369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArT\">\u25a0 In this case the <em>declaration </em>is not <em>supported </em>by <em>the poli~ cy. </em>The <em>declaration </em>states, that \u201cthe said <em>Graham, </em>according to the usage and custom of merchants, <em>(through and </em>- <em>by Hugh and William loung his attorneys and </em>agents,) in his <em>own \u00f1ame, </em>did make insurance', and cause <em>himself </em>to be insured,\u201d The <em>policy </em>declares, \u201cthat <em>Hugh and William Young, </em>for account of <em>Thomas Graham, </em>do make in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>sarar.ee, and cause themselves, and them, and each of them, to be insured.\u201d The <em>declaration </em>says, \u201cIt was further agreed by said deed, that in case of loss, &amp;c. it should be lawful for the said <em>Graham, hisfactors, servants md assigns, to sue,\u201d </em>&amp;e. <em>The policy </em>says, \u201cin case of loss, \u00bfhe. it shall be lawful to and for the assured, (to wit, <em>Hugh and William Young,) </em>and <em>their </em>factors,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>declaration </em>says, \u201cand so <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid did bind themselves to the said <em>Graham </em>for the true performance,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>policy </em>says, \u2018 \"do bind themselves to the assured, (the said <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William,) their </em>executors,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>declaration </em>says,, \u201cconfessing themselves paid the consideration due to them for the said insurance by the said GrahamThe <em>policy </em>says, \u201cby the said <em>assured, </em>(the said <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William,) </em>or <em>their </em>assigns.\u201d The <em>declaration </em>says, \u201cand it was agreed by the said deed <em>between </em>the said <em>Graham </em>and <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid, that in case of loss the said <em>Graham </em>should abate two per cent, to <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid, and that such loss should be paid by <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>aforesaid, to the said <em>Graham, </em>in ninety days,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>policy </em>has only these words, \u201cand in case of loss the assured, <em>(Hugh </em>and <em>William,) </em>is to abate two per cent, and such, loss to be paid in ninety days,\u201d &amp;c. The <em>declaration </em>says, ir# case of disputes they are \u201cto be referred to two persons,, one to be chosen by the said <em>Graham,\u201d </em>&amp;c. The <em>polity </em>only says, \u201cone to be chosen by <em>the assured,\u201d </em>to wit, <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William Young. </em>Thus the court will perceive, that the declaration is, as if the insurance had been effected by <em>Gra-. ham in his own name, </em>but through his attorneys. Whereas the policy is. entered into by <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William Young in their own names, </em>though for the use of <em>Graham\u2022, </em>and lienee comes within the decisions referred to in <em>Jlbbott </em>and <em>Shepherd\u2019s 7'ouchstone, </em>tha.t though <em>Graham </em>has an equitable interest in the policy, yet the suit upon the policy must be in the name of <em>Hugh </em>and- <em>William Young. </em>Thai the suit at law must be brought in the name of him who has the legal title, whoever may be interested, is so clear, that it would be superfluous to cite authorities to prove it. The court are however referred to one of a very recent date, and of high respectability, <em>Lewis vs. Harwood, 6 </em>Cranch, 32. In that case <em>TPhetcroft </em>assigned a bond given to him by <em>Lewis, </em>to <em>T. </em>&amp; <em>B. </em>Harwood, who instituted a suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>thereon in the Circuit Court of the <em>U. S. </em>for tbe district of <em>Virginia, </em>against <em>Lewis, </em>in <em>their own names. </em>A trial was 0 \" 7 \u00b0 ^ , . , had, and a judgment given in their favour. <em>Lewis </em>brought the case, byjwrit of error, before the Supreme Court of the <em>U. S. </em>where the judgment was' reversed, because, though the defendants in error were indisputably <em>justly entitled to the money, </em>yet the suit was brought <em>in a wrong name.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-6\"><em>tf. Dorsey, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aie\">It is conceded that the only remedy on the policy is debt or covenant. The latter remedy has been resorted <em>to; </em>and the only question is, whether this action can be sustained in the name of <em>Graham? </em>In S <em>Wentw. </em>378, there is a declaration in the.name of the assured on a similar policy. The case of <em>Godin vs. The London Assurance Company, </em>cannot affect the present case. There the insurance was effected by <em>Godin, </em>Guion, &amp; Co. and was made as well in their own names, as for and in the name and names of all and every person or persons to whom the same doth, may,'or shall appertain, in alL or in part; and <em>Godin, Gui\u00f3n, </em>&amp; Co. endorsed on the policy, that the insurance was made by the order of <em>TJhthoff. </em>In that case no objection was made to the right of the plaintiff to sue, but the only question was, whether, the person, for whose benefit the policy was effected, had an insurable interest in tbe thing insured. Besides, the person for whose benefit the insurance was made, was not mentioned in the policy. <em>Abbott, </em>123, (147,) reports a case which unquestionably shows the present action may be maintained. \u201cIf a charter party is expressed to be made between parties, but runs thus \u2014 This charter party witnessed, that C, master of the ship W, with the consent of A and B the owners thereof, lets the ship to freight to E and F, and the instrument contains covenants by E and F, to and with A and B; in this case A and B may bring an action upon the covenants expressed to be made with them A\u2019 , In the case before the court the policy of-insurance is not expressed to be made between <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>of the one part, and <em>Hugh </em>and <em>William Young </em>of the other; but in these words: <em>This policy of insurance witnesseth, that Hugh and William Young, for account of Thomas Graham, do make insurance; </em>and the covenants contained in the deed are between <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>and the assured, <em>to </em>wit, <em>Thomas </em>Graham, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ubis suit is founded on the covenants made by the company to and with the assured. The case cited from <em>Shepherd's Touchstone </em>does not apply, because there was no covenant between the obligor and the <em>cestui que use. </em>It is difficult to conceive how the case of <em>Burnett vs. Kensington, 7 T. R. </em>207, can be brought to bear on the present case, as this suit is founded on a deed executed by <em>The Maryland Insurance Company </em>by their corporate seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\">In answer to the objections urged on the ground of the supposed variances between the declaration and the policy, it is sufficient to observe, that the instrument is declared -on according to its legal eftect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">In De <em>Ghetoff vs. London Assurance Company, </em>3 <em>Brown's P. C. </em>525, the policy was effected in the name of <em>Be Conninck, </em>and the names of the assured did not appear on the face of the policy. And it was held that <em>De Conninck, </em>the trustee, might bring an action of covenant on the policy. If the names of the parties assured had appeared on the instrument, then the assured might have sustained an action in their own names, according to the principles established in the case cited from <em>Abbott.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">It has been the uniform practice in this slate to institute suits in this way, and the objection has never before been suggested, in a case decided by the supreme court of the <em>U. </em>S. at the last term, a similar declaration was sustained. <em>Bigcloiu </em>and <em>Proud </em>effected a policy similar to the present one, for and on account of <em>Jacques linden, </em>with <em>The Maryland Insurance Company, </em>yin action was brought in the circuit court of the <em>U. S. </em>held at <em>Baltimore, </em>on the policy, in the name of the assured against the company, and the plaintiff obtained a verdict and judgment. The cause way removed to the supreme court of the <em>U. S. </em>on bills of exceptions, and the judgment below <em>affirmed. Maryland Insurance Company vs. </em>Ruden, 6 <em>Cranch, </em>388. The case of <em>M\u2018Donough vs. Templeman, 1 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>156, supports the present action. In that case <em>Burrows </em>executed the agreement for and on account of <em>Mil)onovgh, </em>and the declaration was in covenant in the name of <em>McDonough, </em>and was sustained; but the court held, that <em>The George Tovm Bridge Company, </em>and not <em>Temp lemon, </em>ought to have been sued, as he executed the agreement as their agent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\">JTTiD GHENT AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
