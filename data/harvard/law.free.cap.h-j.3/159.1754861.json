Plea, the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">1. The plaintiffs, (the pr\u00e9sent appellants) at the trial, read in evidence a paper purporting to be a promissory note, dated the 3d of July 1804, drawn by the defendant, (now appellee,) in favour of <em>Simon Wilmer, </em>or order, for \u00a73000, and endorsed in blank by <em>Wilmer, </em>It was admitted to have been' signed by the defendant, and endorsed by <em>Wilmer, </em>and that the whole of fhe paper, except the signature of the defendant, was in the hand Writing of <em>Wilmer. </em>The defendant then offered in evidence, from the paper itself, that since it tad passed from his, the defendant\u2019s hands, it had been altered by cutting off and obliterating the date it originally bore, and by giving to it a new and different date, lie then prayed the court to direct the jury, that if they were satisfied that the date of the paper had been altered since it had passed from the hands of the\u2019 defendant, and without his privity and consent, that <em>then the </em>paper offered no ground of action against the defendant, but was as to him a nullity. This opinion and direction the' court gave. The plaintiffs escepteif. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">S. The plaintiffs then, to prove that <em>Wilmer </em>made the alteration in the date of the note, (if any such had been made,) as agent of the defendant, and ivas duly authorised to make the same, and that he, made the same before' the note had been passed to the plaintiffs, read in evidence a\u00f1 agreement between the plaintiffs and defendant in these words: 4Tn some of the cases against <em>Saniuel </em>Ringgold, the dates of the notes appear to be altered; it is admitted that these alterations were made by <em>Simon Wilmer, </em>while the notes were in his possession, and before he passed them to the plaintiffs.\u201d And to prove that <em>Wilmer </em>had authority from life defendant to alter the date of this note, the plaintiffs read in evidence twenty letters from the defendant to <em>Wilmer, </em>which were admitted to be in the hand writing of the defendant, and\u2019 dated from the 5th of October 1804, to' the 19th \u00f3f June 1404, inclusive. Healso read in evidence three notes for \u00a72500, drawn by the defendant in favour of Wilmer, and by him- endorsed, dated, otie the 10th of July 1801, another the' iOtli of May 1803, and the other the 20 th.' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>of September 1803; also another dated the 5th of May 1804 for Si000. \u00edhe plaintiffs then offered in evidence, that \u00e1ll the above notes, except the dates, the sums aiid endorsements, arij in- the haiid writing of the defendant, and that the dates, the sums, and endorsements of <em>Wit* trier\u2019s </em>name; are in the hand writing of <em>Wilmer. </em>They also offered in evidence, that the defendant lives \u00f1ow, and has lived for 10 yeai-s past, in <em>Washington </em>county. And also offered in evidence by a witness, that he had several times seen irt the hands of Wilmer, notes bearing the signature of the defendant, but whether they had been signed by him he. does not know, as he has never seen him write, and isr not acquainted with his hand writing; that <em>Wilmer </em>had purchased goods of the witness, which were sent to the defendant. The defendant then, to show that the note upon which this suit is brought was transferred by <em>Wilmer </em>to the plaintiffs in discharge and satisfaction of a previous debt due from <em>Wilmer </em>to the plaintiffs, and not for any purpose beneficial to the defendant, read m evidence the deposition of a witness taken by consent. The plaintiffs then prayed the court for their opinion and direction to the jury, that if they find, from the evidence above stated, that the note upon \u25a0which this action is brought has been changed or altered in the dating, but that the changes or alterations were made by <em>Wilmer </em>as the agent of the defendant, while the note was in his possession, and before it had ever been discounted or transferred to any one, and that after the change had been made, he transferred the same to the plaintiffs for a fair and valuable consideration, that in that case the fetters and other proof above mentioned, contain sufficient evidence of authority to <em>Wilmer </em>to make the change, apd the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. Upon this prayer the court, <em>(Clagett </em>and <em>Shriver, </em>A. J.) were divided in opinion, and therefore the opinion and direction were not given to the jury. The plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b171-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>If the date of promissory note is altered after <em>it </em>posses from ike nlaker, and with-put his parity anc consent, the note is a nullity as tef ' <em>him.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b171-12\">Contain letter* from the maker of a promissory note to the payee, were held not to eon\u00ae iain sufficient evidence of authority to the - payee <em>to change </em>the date of the note. _ v-.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b171-13\">_ Where a promise sory no\u00ede was delivered by the maker to the pavee , as his a^ent, to be discounted, and <em>it </em>A^as blank as to 'date and sum at the time of the delivery, and the payee filled up the date aud sum* but l/etore he discounted it, and while it continued in &amp;is possession, changed the dat'yand then endorsed it to the plaiiKiff for a fair and <em>bona fide </em>consideration\u2014 <em>Ucldt </em>that such change destroyed the va-* luhtywf tin note? av against the ma-'</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>3.
