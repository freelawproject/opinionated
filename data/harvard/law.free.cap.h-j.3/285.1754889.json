But the court refused to give that direction to the jury, and gave them the following: \u201cThat the jury, to find for the plaintiff, must be satisfied that <em>Colder </em>vas unable <em>to </em>pay, or if able to pay at any time after the assignment, that the debt was not lost by the negligence or default of the assignee or his administrator. That the non-inr.titution of a suit against <em>Colder </em>op the bill, is a circumstance of a negligence or default that ought to weigh with the jury; hut that the bringing of an action on the bill was not indispensably necessary to a recovery against the assignor; and that if any positive facts, evincing negligence or default in the assignee or his representative, exist in the cause, they ought to be established by testimony on the part of the defendant.'
