The plaintiff then offered evidence, that it was previously to the 20t!i of February 1802, concerted between <em>Brown </em>and <em>Norris, </em>the petitioning creditor, that <em>Norris </em>should sue forth a writ of <em>cupias usl respondendum </em>against <em>Brown, </em>and that <em>Brown </em>should keep his house so that he should not be taken or served with the writ, and that <em>Norris </em>should thereupon petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the district judge for a commission of bankruptcy against ' <em>Browns </em>and that in pursuance of the said concerted agreement between <em>Norris </em>and <em>Brown, Norris </em>did sue forth the writ herein before mentioned against <em>Brown, </em>and that <em>Brawn </em>did, in pursuance of the said agreement, keep his bouse at 4 o\u2019clock, P.

That on the 20th of February 1802,, there was no debt due and payable from <em>Brawn </em>to <em>Norris. </em>That the deed from' <em>Brown </em>to the lessor of the plaintiff was executed and de\u00ab livered to the lessor of the plaintiff on Saturday the 20th of February 1802, at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, and that <em>Brown </em>did not consent to commit an act of bankruptcy until the 19th of February 1802, in the evening, and then with reluctance, although persuaded or advised so to do by some of his friends, and that he did not refus\u00e9 to pay any of his creditors their respective debts until the 20th of February 1802, The county court, <em>[Nicholson </em>Ch. J.3 Upon the prayer of the defendants, directed the jury, that if they believed from the testimony in the cause that <em>Brown </em>had agreed, on the 19th of February 1802, with his friends, to deny himself to the sheriff for the purpose of committing \u2022 air act of bankruptcy, thereby to lay a foundation for a commission of bankruptcy; that he did so deny himself on the 20th; that a commission issued in pursuance thereof, and that he was declared a bankrupt; that the deed from liim to the lessor of the plaintiff was executed on the 20th of February, after he had formed tins resolution, with a view Solely to secure the <em>Pleasants </em>against any responsibility which they might afterwards incur on aecount of their endorsements for <em>Proton\u2019s </em>use; and that the lessor'of the plaintiff accepted the said deed, and agreed to take up <em>Brown\u2019s </em>notes endorsed by the <em>Pleasants, </em>when <em>they </em>became payable, with the same view of relieving the <em>Pleasants </em>from their future responsibility, and to secure them againsc any loss which they might sustain in consequence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>derangements of <em>Brown's </em>business, then the said deed is not a <em>bona fide </em>purchase in the purview of the tenth section of the Uct of congress, but must be considered fraudulent is point of law, by giving a preference to certain persons, who might possibly afterwards become creditors, in exclusion of other creditors, if the jury believe that <em>I)fot\u00f3n </em>\u2022had other creditors to a considerably larger amount than las funds. And inasmuch as the deed was a fraudulent conveyance, made in contemplation of, and with a determination to commit an act of bankruptcy, it is void, and is in itself an act of bankruptcy, and will support the commission and adjudication of the commissioners, although the act, upon Which the commission issued, was subsequent to the execution of the deed, but upon the same, day, and although the said act might not have been an act of bankruptcy. The deed <em>to the lessor of the </em>plaintiff being void, he cannot recover in this cause-, as he has shown no other title than that derived from Brown, which did not pass, by reason of the fraud upon <em>Brown's </em>other creditors. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">2. The plaintiff then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that if the jury shall be of \u00abpinion from the evidence, that <em>Brown </em>was, on the 20th of February 1802, seized of the premises mentioned in the declaration, and being so seized did on that day convey the same to the lessor of the plaintiff by deed duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, for a fair and Full price, and that the said deed was executed and delivered to the lessor of the plaintiff by Brown, before the act of bankruptcy committed by <em>Brown, </em>on which the commission of bankruptcy against him issued, and that the lessor of the plaintiff had no knowledge, information or notice, of any act of bankruptcy committed by <em>Brown </em>at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed, that then and in that ease the plaintiff is entitled to recover.

The court are of opinion, that the conveyance from <em>Jlquila Brown </em>to <em>TVilliam M'-Mechen, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, is not fraudulent, the same having been made for a val\u00faa* ble consideration, and for the purpose of substantially complying' with the engagement of <em>Broion </em>to.the Messrs. <em>Pleasants, </em>to transfer or deposit bank stock with them, to secure them, against any loss they might sustain by endorsing the three notes. As <em>Brown </em>could not comply with his engagement to transfer or deposit bank stock with the Messrs. <em>Pleasants, </em>when applied to by them, and as <em>Brown </em>offered to convey the house and lot to them as a substitute for the bank stock, and inasmuch as the conveyance was made to <em>MiMechen, </em>with the concurrence of all the parties then concerned, on his engaging to take up the notes, the preference acquired by the Messrs. <em>Pleasants </em>was consequential, and nothing more than a substantial fulfilment of the engagement made by <em>Brown </em>to them at the time of endorsing the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The court are of opinion, that to render a payment or transfer by a debtor to bis creditor, fraudulent as to the other creditors, under the bankrupt law, it must be spontaneously made in consequence of a formed desigu to bp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>come a bankrupt. In this case the conveyance made by <em>Brown was </em>not voluntary, but produced by the application of the Messrs. <em>Pleasants </em>for a transfer of bank stock, which they were entitled to, and the refusal of <em>Brown </em>to comply with his engagement, or to make any provision to indemnify them, would have subjected him to an action at Jaw, or bill in chancery for a specific execution of his contract, and in that point of view the application of the Messrs. <em>Pleasants </em>must be considered as importunate and pressing.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The court reverse the judgment of the court below, this court dissenting from the opinions expressed in both of the bills of exceptions, and awarded a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, &amp;C\u201e</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
