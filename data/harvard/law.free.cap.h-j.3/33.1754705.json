The declaration contained two counts, one for <em>money had and </em>received, and the other for <em>money lent. </em>The defendant, in the court below, plead, ed <em>non a&amp;mmpsif, </em>and <em>an account in bar, </em>which he filed and offered to set off, &amp;c. General replication thereto, and issues joined. At the trial the plaintiff produced as a witness one <em>Garrett Bice, </em>who proved that the plaintiff advanced <em>to the </em>defendant \u00a7150, to be employed as a capital in trade, S50 whereof to be considered as the plaintiff\u2019s share, another \u00a750 to be considered as the defendant\u2019s share, anil the remaining $50 to be considered as the witness\u2019s share.' three persons were to share in the profits arising in the course of their joint trade, which was to continue for an indefinite period| and that on the dissolution of the partnership, the plaintiff was to be entitled to; receive his gloG, $50 from the defendant, and got) from, the witness, exclusively of his one third of the profits which \u25a0 might be made by the partnership, and also whether there, should be a profit of loss in their business. The witness i also proved that he was present when the plaintiff applied i to the defendant for an account of the profits, which the J defendant refused, alleging that the plaintiff was not cnti-\u00ab tied to any part of the profits, but paid the plaintiff a sum &gt; of naonev, the amount whereof he did not know, it being in' i \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>part of the sum originally advanced by the plaintiff, but he believed it to be less than the \u00a7150 advanced as aforesaid\u00bb The witness also proved, that in a conversation between him and the defendant, the defendant stated that he would raise an account against the plaintiff, which would mor\u00e9 than extinguish the \u00a7150 advanced by the plaintiff\u2019at the commencement of the partnership, provided the witness would swear to it. The witness also proved, that after the commencement of the partnership* and previous to the defendant\u2019s refusal to account, he continued to live with the defendant, who\" had the management of the business* and that while living- with the defendant he, as a partner* Collected sundry debts owing to the concern. The defendant then prayed the court to direct the jury, that Bice* the witness produced on the part of the plaintiff, was not a co\u2019mpeteftt witness; and also, that if the jury should believe the foregoing facts to be true, that in point of law they constitute a partnership, and that it is not competent for the plaintiff in the present form of action, to recover against the defendant. Both of these directions the county court, <em>[Nicholson, Ch. 3.) </em>refused to give; but directed the jury, that the refusal by the defendant to exhibit an account of the profits, alleging that the plaintiff was entitled to no part thereof, and the payment by him to the plaintiff of a part of the original, sum advanced amounted to a dissolution of the partnership, and that upon its dissolution the plaintiff had a right of action in his individual capacity against each of the other copartners in their individual capacity, for the sum of 850 loaned them originally, or for so much thereof as remained unpaid at the time of the insti - tution of the suit. The defendant excepted. Verdict ar.d judgment for the plaintiff for \u00a7103 damages, and costs.

The <em>first </em>. 1 . . , . <em>* </em>. \u00ed\u00fcbjec\u00edion to the opinion of the court below is, that no witness is competent to prove a partnership establishing <em>Ms interest </em>therein, because of the fraud which might be practised by the admission of such evidence; and the <em>second objection </em>is, that the plaintiff misconceived his remedy, the same being only in a court of chancery; because <em>no settlement </em>ever was bad, or <em>account </em>stated\u00bb The plaintiff might have received, out of the copartnership, <em>more, </em>than his capital and profits, and now may be indebted to the partnership, which facts only can be established in chancery. <em>Smith vs Barrow, </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>476. <em>Esp. N. P. </em>96, and <em>Index, </em>tit. <em>ParinersMp. </em>The express promise to pay the 850 loaned, is but what the law would have implied,, and does not change the <em>mode </em>of discovery. The refusal to account, though it may amount to a <em>dissolution </em>of the partnership, cannot rescind the original contract, the samq having Leen <em>partly executed. Huntt vs Silk, 5 East, </em>452. It is not known but the partnership has lost instead of having made profit, and that the defendant, being the acting partner, may have paid \u00cdhe. amount of the claiips against the firm t\u00ab ten times <em>the </em>amount of the capital advanced. By the mode of proceeding resorted to, the defendant wa$ precluded from making every defence allowed a copartner in equity, and hs$ applied to a court which, from its organization, cannot do complete justice to the parties. It may also he. observed, that on thp final liquidation of the partnership accounts, the plaintiff may appear to have not only received his proportion of the profits, but his. capital, and the capital advanced to the defendant, and more, and instead of being a creditor may he a debtor of the defendant. If it should be contended that here is a special promise varying the general rights of partnership, then it is a-<em>special contract, </em>and ought to have been declared on as such, and there, ought to have been a <em>speciql averment, </em>that the partnership was dissolved, whereby an action had accrued to recover the above sum of \u00a750, and a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will not lie. Wherever a duty is to arise, on the <em>happening of </em>a particular <em>event, </em>and it is uncertain <em>at what </em>time the event may take place, or that it may ever take place, this amounts to a <em>special agreementj, </em>and before that duty can be enforced in a cowt of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>thev\u00e9 must be an averment that the event has happened on which the duty arises. As for instance if a promise be made to pay a certain sum of money on A\u2019s going to Rome, \u25a0 or if money should be lent to be repaid on A\u2019s going to <em>Rome, </em>and returning therefrom; on these events happening, the money can only be recovered by a special action on the case, and not on a general' <em>indebitatus assumpsit. </em>This form o\u00ed action is only applicable to cases, where the contract is executed, and the debt is <em>immediately </em>due, or, what is the same tiling, payable at a time <em>certain </em>and <em>specified </em>\u2014 as in the common cases of goods sold and delivered, payable immediately, or in <em>six months. </em>But if goods should be sold to A, and payable <em>.when </em>a certain <em>event </em>should take place, then this agreement is special, and must be declared on as such, and not generally. These distinctions, it is conceived,1 are too obvious to require authorities. But the promise made and proved in this case is nothing more than what arises by implication of law; and therefore does notvary the relative situation of the parties, or give other remedies than are provided for in the ordinary cases of partnership by a suit in chancery. Because it is obvious, that where one partner advances to his active partner the <em>whole </em>capital, on a dissolution of the same he must he charged in the -settlement of, the concern for the money so loaned him, and this duty arises <em>immediately </em>on the dissolution of the partnership. The express promise therefore, raises no <em>other </em>obligation, nor can be enforced <em>in no </em>other <em>manner, </em>than is pointed out in all partnership cases. Besides, this doctrine would lead to this inconvenience, that the rights of the parties in <em>the same </em>transaction must be determined before twoforums \u2014 First the g50 to be recovered in a court of law, and the partnership transaction in a court o\u00ed chancery; and the common law abhors the <em>splitting </em>and multiplying of suits. And what is still more inconvenient aiid absurd is, that on the liquidation of the partnership, cii a filial account the plaintiff might be found to be a , debtor, which would enable the defendant to obtain an injunction, thereby generating three suits, which the proper tribunal would settle in one \u2014 an absurdity in judicial proceedings which the court surely, by every reasonable construction, will endeavour to avoid. The court will also obs\u00e9rve, that by the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, the jury must have taken into view the profit's, because the proof adduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ed on his part proved a receipt of a greater sum than that loaned, which'is an additional proof of the impropriety of sustaining such actions in a court of common law; and which proof was a sufficient ground, in itself, to have defeated the action of the plain tiff without any other cause.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-5\"><em>W. </em>Dorsey, for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abm\">It appears that the appellant, appellee and the witness, agreed to enter into partnership, in which there was no limitation of time as to how long the partnership should continue. , The appellee loaned to the appellant, and the witness, each 850, before the commencement of the partnership. There is no good ground of objection to receiving the evidence of the witness, because of his being one of the partners. The payment made by tiie appellant to the appellee was evidence of the dissolution of the partnership, because it was tobe dissolved when the. 850 was paid. It cannot be a claim against the partnership, although the money was to constitute a part of the fund put into the capital. The loan was made to each partner, the appellant and the witness, in his separate capacity, and it cannot be said to be a partnership transaction, beiug loaned before the partnership. There is no solidity in the objection as to the form of action, if there had been a condition annexed to the payment of the money., then it must be specially averred. The dissolution of the partnership was an event that <em>mus\u00ed take </em>\u00a1dace, and it cannot be assimilated to an event which might never happen.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-6\">Earle, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AF-E\"><em>delivered the </em>opinion of the court.
