The said deed was regularly acknowledged pnd recorded. He also gave in evidence, that be* fore the institution of this suit <em>Mary </em>married <em>Dickerson Gorsuck, </em>and that <em>Anne </em>married <em>Thomas </em>Bond, two of the lessors of the plaintiff', and that they are now their respec* tive wives. The defendant then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. \u2019Which direction the court refused to give. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">3. The defendant then read in evidence a patent, dated th\u00e9 8th of February 1802, to <em>Elizabeth Miles </em>and <em>Dixon Stansbury, </em>reciting, that <em>\u201cAguila Miles, </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>his wife, by their petition to the chancellor did set forth, that a certain <em>Edward Oldham </em>purchased of the commissioners for confiscated estates Lots Nos. S3, 36, 39 and 48, lying in <em>Baltimore </em>county, parts of <em>My Lady\u2019s Manor,j </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>certificates whereof were returned to the land office; that the said <em>Edvard </em>Oldham, afterwards sold the said lots for a valuable consideration, to <em>Edmund </em>Stansbury, (late deceased,) and by an instrument of writing under his hand, bearing date the 14th day of October If S3, requested that the said lots might be conveyed to the said <em>Stansbury; </em>that the said <em>Edmund Stansbury </em>departed this life in the year 1801, without having made a will, whereupon hfs estate descended to the petitioners <em>Elizabeth </em>and <em>Dixon </em>Stansbury, now in liia minority, his only children and heirs at law. The petitioners therefore prayed that patents might issue to them for the \u00ab.aid lots. Patents were accordingly ordered. The state did therefore grant to them lot Ho. SG, &amp;c. It was admitted there were three other patents, of the same tenor and date, to same patentees, for the other three tots in the declaration mentioned. The defendant also gave in evidence, that the said patentees were the children of <em>Edmund, Stansbury, </em>and that he the defendant was the tenant of said patentees. He also gave in evidence, that the lauds specified in said patents, and the premises in the declaration mentioned, were the same. And lie then prayed (he count to direct the jury, that the legal title in the premises passed under and became vested in the patentees, in virtue of the said patents, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. This direction the court refused to give. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him, lie appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch. J. and Buchanan, Eabxe, and Johnson, J,</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-8\">T. <em>Buchanan, </em>for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayr\">contended, 1. That a declaration in ejectment being an original process cannot be amended, because there was nothing to amend by. The amendment ip this case was unauthorised so a\u00bb to change the demise. An anV.rdtnent might be permitted to enlarge the term, but for no other purpose. Here the amendment introduced a new title \u2014 the parties and demises were totally different. The original lessee could not recover under \u00a1he first declaration, the lease therein being a joint depuse of all the. lessors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-9\">2. That the evidence offered in the <em>first </em>bill cf exceptions, to prove that Mr. <em>Duvall </em>was a commissioner of confiscated <em>British </em>property, was not sufficient. That copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>from the commissioners books were not evidence. But if those books were to be considered as now belonging to the auditor\u2019s office, such copies should be certified and proved, as directed by the act of 1798, <em>ch. 108. </em>The evidence of . Mr. <em>DuvalPs </em>appointment could only be had from the records of the eouneil, by whom it ivas made, that less evidence was not admissible, except by proof that there vas no entry of the kind on those records, when inferior evidence might have been received. It was not proved, (as it <em>could not be.) </em>that Mr. <em>Duvall </em>was dead; and as he was not dead his evidence might have been admitted to prove h'js appointment,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-4\">3. As to the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions. IP the evidence offered was sufficient to prove Mr. <em>Duvall to be </em>one of the commissioners appointed in the place of one of those named in the act of October 1780, <em>ch, </em>49, who is said to have resigned, yet it is contended, that there was no power given to the commissioners to convey any land which they were authorised to sell. lie referred to the acts of October 1780, <em>ch. </em>45, <em>ch. </em>49, and <em>ch. </em>51, and 1785, ck. -66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-5\"><em>4. </em>As to the <em>third </em>bill of exceptions. That Oldhamwas a purchaser from the commissioners of the property in question, and if he purchased for the lessors of the plaintiff, it was a trust which the commissioners could not notice, and could only be enforced in equity, If the commissioners had authority to convey, they should have conveyed to <em>Stansbury </em>as the assignee of <em>Ojdhay},</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-6\"><em>Martin, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A83T\">contended, l.That an amendment might be permitted in an action of ejectment, That it was allowed by the general court in <em>Steuart et al. Lessee vs. Mason. </em>On the appearance of the defendant to the declaration filed in 1809, all defects, if any, were waived, pnd the action from that time may be considered as q neW one, and the prior proceedings may be excluded from, the record, so that it is wholly immaterial whether the leave tp amend was proper or not,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-7\">2. As to the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions. The appointment of Mr. <em>fiuvall </em>as a commissioner, was not to be found on the proceedings of the council, and the only evidence of it was in the auditors office. The act of 1798, <em>ch. </em>108, only points out a new way of proving the papers in that office, JJpre the copy was proved by a person who had examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>It with the original. It was? correctly received in evidence under the spirit of the act of 1798, and independent of that act the copy might be received upon common law principles. He cited 2 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>(473,) 764, (475,) 766, (514,) 783.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">S. As to the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions. The copies being received as evidence laid the foundation for what was afterwards introduced. This is a case where the law dispenses with the best evidence which the nature of the case would admit of. It is not necessary to prove more than that an officer was such <em>dejado, </em>and acted as such. He referred to 2 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>783, (515.) <em>Owings vs. Wyant, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Hen. </em>393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">4. The deed by the commissioners was prior to the grant. If the chancellor had known of the deed he would not have granted the patent. There is no other evidence of the assignment to <em>Stansbitry, </em>but the recital in the grant. As the state\u2019s right had passed by the commissioners\u2019 deed, nothing passed by the grant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b397-9\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AqB\">concurred with the County Court in the opiuioris expressed in the several bills of exceptions; and were of opinion there was no error in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">JUDGMHJit AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
