The case as agreed ppon, and subrnitted to the court, was this: <em>John divings, </em>deceased, being seized in fee of the tract of land called <em>Taylor's Forest </em>by his last will and testament, elated the 8th of February 1762, devised, (among other things,) as follow: OAnt! aa to what it has pleased God to bless'me with, I dispose as follows,\u201d &amp;c. \u2018T give and bequeath to my son <em>Caleb Qwings, 60 </em>acres of Jarid, being part\u2019of a tract of land called <em>Taylor's Forest, </em>beginning,\u201d \u00a3lc. \u201cI give and bequeath to my loving wife, <em>Jlscnuih Owlngs, </em>my dwelling plantation, and the remainder part of niy part of <em>Taylor's Forest, </em>joining the said plantation, except the 6(3 acres willed to my son Caleb, to her during her natural life, and after her decease to fall to my sori <em>Lot Owlngs; </em>arid if he should die under age, its my will the said land should fall to my son Caleb, and my daughter <em>Jlsenath Oddi.\u201d John </em>Oioings, . , !

J. The question submitted to the court in this case is, what estate is devised to <em>Lot Owings </em>by the will of his father <em>John Owings, </em>in the lands in question-rail estate in fee simple or for life?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">It is admitted that there are not any words of limitation or inheritance in this will superadded to the devise of <em>Lott Owings; </em>and also, that unless the testator has used words in his will indicating an intention to give a fee in the lands in controversy to <em>Lot Owings, </em>an estate for life only passed to him. But it is contended, the testator has used words in his will which, when the several parts of it are considered together, plainly import an intention to give a fee to <em>Lot Owings; </em>and three circumstances are principally relied on as indicative of such intention\u2014 1, The introductory clause \u2014 2. The limitation over to <em>Caleb Owings </em>, and <em>Asenath Odell, </em>if <em>Lot Owings </em>died in his minority; and 3. There being no clause disposing of the residue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">It is established beyond controversy, that the intention of the testator, is to prevail if not repugnant to some rule or principle, of law; and that such intention is to be collected from the words of the will. That no technical words are necessary to, create a fee. But the principle established by analogy to the rules prevailing in the limitation of estates by daed at common law is, that if law is given ge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Serally without adding words of limitation, att \u00e9state for life only passes; and this rule, though it often interferes with and defeats the intention of the testator, is so firmly settled, that no probable conjecture can shake it. As there are not any words appropriated in a will to the creation of a greater estate than for life, the courts, without infringing the above rule, have decided, that if it appears on consideration of the whole will, to be the plain intention to give a fee in the land, a fee passes. It is also an established rule in the construction of a will, that the heir at law is not to be disinherited unless by express words or necessary implication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\">Having premised thus much, I will ttow consider those circumstances From which it is said a plain intention in the testator to give a fee to <em>Lot Owings, </em>is to be inferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">Introductory clauses are in general mere form, and inserted Without any particular or precise meaning being annexed to them; for almost every person who makes a will, sets down with an intention to dispose of his whole estate; and therefore they cannot have much influence \u2014 and only in favour of the clear intention of the testator. <em>Derm vs. Gaskin, CoWp. </em>659, 660.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">The introductory clause in this case, \u201cas to what it lias pleased God to bless me with,\u201d can have no weight to induce the court to decide a fee passed to <em>Lot Owings. </em>It does not contain the word <em>estate, </em>nor any word of similar import, from whence an inference can be drawn, by couplingitwith the clause in question, that the intention was to give a fee; and besides, there are no words to <em>conned </em>the <em>demise </em>of the land in question with the <em>introduction, </em>so as to pass the whole interest. <em>Derm vs. Gaskin, Cowp. </em>660.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">As to the limitation over, if <em>Lot </em>died in his minority. If: appears to me, the meaning of the testator, to be collected from the words of his will, was that <em>Lot Owings </em>should have an estate for life, with a contingent remainder to <em>Caleb Owings </em>and <em>dsenath Odell </em>for their lives, on the contingency of <em>Lot Owings </em>dying in his minority. But if the contingency did not happen, there are no words to show <em>Lot\u2019s </em>estate was to be enlarged to a fee. If it could be implied, it is by no means a necessary implication, for the substitution was not to the heir at law, but to <em>Caleb Ote</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>mgs </em>and <em>Asenath Odell.

The answer of <em>John </em>Alex\u00ab <em>antler Frazier, </em>an infant defendant, by his guardian, among other things stated, that <em>Alexander Frazier </em>died in June 1790, above the age of twenty years, intestate, and without leaving issue, leaving the said <em>J. A. Frazier, </em>his only brother, his heir at law. That the father of <em>Alexander and J. A. Frazier, </em>by his will dated the 18th of March 1777, devised among other tilings as follow, viz. \u201cI give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Mirt bequeath all the land that T am possessed of to he equally divided between my two sons, <em>Alexander </em>and <em>John Alexander, </em>to them and their heirs, for ever; hut if in case either of my said ^sons should die without any heir lawfully begotten of his body, or before he arrives to the age of twenty years, that then in such case his part to be the solo right and property of my surviving son, his heirs and assigns, for ever.\u201d <em>\u201cHern. </em>Whereas I have given all my land, to my two sons, my will is that the division line shall begin at <em>Rake\u2019s </em>land, and so running towards <em>Fishing creek. </em>My sob <em>Alexander </em>to have the first choice of the land \u201d <em>\u201cItem. </em>My will and desire is, that iny son <em>Alexander </em>do, out of <em>Ms </em>part of my estate, expend so much money as will be sufficient to give my son <em>John Alexander </em>a good education.\u201d My the will the testator appointed his son <em>Alexander </em>his executor. It was Submitted-to the chancellor to determine what estate passed to <em>Alexander </em>under this - devise. It does not appear from the papers in the Case that the chancellor decided what estate <em>Alexander </em>took tinder the devise. In November 1795, an agreement was entered int.0 by the counsel of the parties, in which it is stated that <em>Alexander, </em>under the will of his father, had the right of election as to which part of the land he would choose; and it being doubtful whether any election was made by him, and also doubtful whether the court of chancery could determine the fact of election, for the prevention of controversy in future, it was agreed that the chancellor, with the consent of parties, should decree a sale of the whole of the lands devised, &amp;c. the proceeds of the land tobe equally divided beta een the creditors of <em>Alexander </em>and the defendant, each one half. The chancellor decreed accordingly. A sale having been made, <em>J. A. Frazier </em>exhibited an account, in which, amongst other matters, he charged the deceased as follows, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"AIa\">\u201cTo a charge on the estate for default of expending money in the education of <em>John Alexander Frazier, </em>as directed by the will <em>o\u00ed Alexander Frazier, </em>(the father,) deceased, say 8 years at \u00bf340 per year,</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">\u00bf2330 0 0.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqH\">Haksojt, Chancellor, (August 1799.) This charge is founded on the claimant\u2019s construction of Ids father's will. Now supposing it the intent of the will to Charge <em>Alexander </em>with his brother\u2019s education and maintenance, the strangest words imaginable are used. <em>It </em>is not \u201cI give <em>Alexander </em>one half of my estate on condition that lie lay out the sum of \u2014in the. complete education and maintenance of his brother at some approved school,\u201d or, \u201c1 will that the part of my estate devised to <em>Alexander </em>be charged with the expense of providing a good education to his brother, and likewise completely maintaining him at some approved school.\u201d No! it is, \u2014my will and devise is, that my son <em>Alexander, </em>do, <em>out of Ms part of the estate, </em>expend so much money as will be sufficient to give my son <em>John Alexander </em>a good education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyX\">It is apparent, from the whole will, (setting aside this disputed part,) that the testator contemplated perfect equality between his two sons, except that he gives <em>Alexander, </em>the elder, the choice of two equal parts, and makes hull executor; which is just what was reasonable, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"AyE\">Now, by changing the disposition of the words, and putting <em>\u201c\u2018out of his part of the </em>estate,\u201d at the end of the clause, <em>it </em>stands perfectly consistent with that intended equality, and it is well observed by counsel, that transpositions are frequently made for the purpose of supporting a rational construction of the whole. It may be observed, that there are few men, who, in speaking or writing do not express themselves in such a manner, that if you understand them, according to the strict rules of grammar, you. make them speak contrary to their intention.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj0v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>It ig alleged; without proof, that <em>Alexander </em>was burthened. witfe the education pf his brother, on account of his (the said <em>Alexander\u2019s} </em>.having already received a good education; and that bv <em>so </em>charging him; equality was preserved. But it is not so. In such a case; the. eldest son. would be educated at the charge of the whole estate; and the. younger at the charge of the elder\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"AZI\">For,illustration, suppose the whole esta\u2019e to be'\u00a34000, and that <em>\u00a3300 </em>liad been expended in edupating- <em>Alexander, </em>more than had been expended on J\u00f3te. To make,them equal it ought to be directed that \u00a350Ci shall be expended on <em>John,, and </em>the residue divided between them:. In that case, they will have been educated at equal expense, and the share of each will be \u00a31750. But according to the construction contended for, they will have been educated at equal expense, and <em>John </em>will get \u00a3500 more than his brother! that is, thej. qach share \u00a32000 out of the \u00a34000, J\u00f3te has his part clear; but \u00a3500 is taken from <em>Alexander </em>to educate and maintain <em>John. </em>When the contemplation of equality is so apparent; When an easy obvious transposition will support that equality, and when, without the transposition, such inequality takes place, it is impossible tp admit the claimant\u2019s construction of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac8\">\u201cMy will and desire is, that my son <em>Alexander, </em>out pf his part of the estate, shall expend so much <em>money,\u201d he. </em>as already has been observed, is strange language to. constitute a charge on <em>Alexander\u2019s </em>part. \u201cMy will and desjre,\u201d are words very significant. \u201cTo expend so much ntoiley,\u201d \u00e1re equally so. Tn short, the . meaning of the whole clause was, that <em>Alexander, </em>the executor, should be authorised to lay out as much of <em>John\u2019s </em>part of the personal, estate, as would suffice to give.him a liberal education; Without this provision in the will, <em>John\u2019s </em>education might be defective. The guardian, whom he might choose, or who might be appointed without the provision, might not think - proper to expend so much money as might suffice, particularly if the annual profits should not correspond with the proofs in this cause, oh might happen in some year to fall short.</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">In addition to all this \u2014 supposing qs compelled to take <em>Ms </em>for <em>Alexander\u2019s, </em>it may be asked, whether 'good education <em>must </em>comprehend maintenance; or whether, to prevent the great inequality 'in favour of a younger son, education might not mean barely the price of tuition, books, &amp;c? Lodging, food and clothing, must be had, whether at school or at home; and therefore it might be said, that he who is charged\u2019 with education is not of course charged With those articles of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"ATa\">In construing a will, it is notorious that the judge's have never considered the question as a mere point of grammar. The question ever is, \u201cwhat was the intent of the testator,\u201d to be collected from the whole of his words. Amongst grammarians there is no donbi that <em>his </em>is considered in propriety as referring to the antecedent, if there be one, and not to a subsequent. It may indeed, in this case, be contended that the testator was not aware of any antecedent, or any rule of grammar. It is probable that he was no grammarian.</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">Let it just be supposed that he had appointed <em>two executors, </em>and, had said \u201cmy will and desire is, that <em>my executors, </em>(instead of saying <em>my son Alexander,') </em>do, out of <em>his </em>part of my estate, expend,\u201d &amp;c. is there ev^n a rigid grammarian who would say, that the testator violated the rules of grammar. No! he would say, <em>\"his\u201d </em>refers to the antecedent, if there be one, but the word <em>\"his\u201d </em>may well be placed so as to refer to a subsequent, as is the case of Mr. <em>Frazier </em>directing his two executors, out of his part of the estate, to educate his son <em>John Alexander.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcK\">Op the whole, from the fullest investigation of tin's case, and on foil deliberation, it does not appear to the chancellor that J\u00f3te <em>Alexander Frazier </em>hath any just claim against the estate of <em>Alexander </em>\u25a0Frazier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The Court reversed the judgment of the General Court</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-15\">Gantt, J. gave no opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
