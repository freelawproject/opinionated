Dorsey, </em>for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI2\">This is a plain case, In which it is unnecessary to cite authorities. It is admitted that the defendant must take defence, this he does immediately on Ms appearance, and tisis r\u00e9cord stales that the defendant \u201ccomes and defends the force arid injury when, and so forth, and prays leave to \u00a1\u00f1iparle,\u201d &amp;c. This is a full defence, and it need not be repeated. In 3 <em>Blk. Com. 296, </em>it is said, that \u201cit is incumbent on the defendant within a yeaonable time to make his <em>defente, </em>arid to putin a <em>plea,\u201d </em>showing that it is not necessary that the defence should be in the plea. <em>Co. Litt. 127, </em>is to the same effect. But ifit ia necessary that there should be defence taken in the-plea, the plea might have been refused for that defect, but being ac-r.epted, it is made good, ami the defect cannot betaken ad* vantage of by special demurrer. <em>Ferrer vs. Miller, 1 Salk. 217. </em>it is admitted that defence must be taken in some part of the record. It has been done in this case on the appearance of the defendant, and also in his <em>first </em>plea. Every thing is admitted to give, jurisdiction to the court. If the declaration contains <em>four </em>counts, then Hie <em>fourth </em>count feas not been answered by the pleas of the act of limitations. Where there is a special demurrer the first fault may be resorted to. Here it appears that the <em>third </em>count, if there arc only three, ia defective, for there are two distinct promises alleged ia the same count; first the intestate\u2019s promises and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>then tli\u00e9 hdministrator\u2019s. This is a form of pleadihg which is not allowed, as no one plea which the defendant could plead would answer the case. If it is Considered that there is <em>a.fourth </em>count, then no judgment can be given on it, because it is defective. Each count must be a full declaration of itself, and triust not depend upon any other count. The <em>fourth </em>count speaks of <em>several sums </em>of money, referring to all the antecedent counts, so that take the count alohe and there is no certainty in it; for each count must contain a distinct cause of actions, <em>5 Bac. Ab. </em>tit. <em>Pleas and Pleadings, </em>(B) 328, and the cases there cited. The <em>fourth </em>count is defective, and there is no consideration expressed in it to support a promise. This count was intended to take the case out of the act of limitations, but being defective, and there being a general verdict, the judgment must be reversed. The proper form of a declaration, on a promise made by an executor or administrator, maybe seen in <em>Secar vs. Atkinson's Adm'x, </em>1 <em>H. Blk. </em>Rep. 102, 108, and 1 Harr. <em>Ent. </em>179, 161, 162.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-6\"><em>Kell, </em>was to have argued for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-7\">\n<em>Curia adv. vulL</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b44-8\">Chase, Ch.

The court are of opinion, that the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>pleas of the act of limitations were well pleaded, and that the court below erred in giving judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer to those pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The court are also of opinion, that the judgment on the, verdict be affirmed with costs, the court being of opinion that the last count in the declaration is substantially good, having reference to the precedent counts, and which is founded on the considerations specified in the <em>first, second </em>and <em>third </em>counts in it, and having incorporated so much thereof in the same as is necessary to render that count valid in law.</p>\n<author id=\"b44-10\">Buchanan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQR\">I am of opinion, that the causes assigned for demurrer to the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>pleas of the defendant below, are not available in law, and that the court erred in giving judgment for the plaintiff below on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Full defence was made before imparlance, and is again set out in the <em>first </em>plea; and after defence is once well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>made, it is not necessary to repeat it in every plea. Moreover, \u00cd think the <em>fourth </em>count in the declaration is bad. The canse of action is not sufficiently set out, and can only fee ascertained by reference to the preceding counts, which reference allows that it is for the same sums of money mentioned in the other counts, and in fact blends the three preceding counts into onej whereas eyery count in a declaration should be distinct, and should set out a separate cause of action. I am therefore of opinion that the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
