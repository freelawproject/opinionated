She further gave in evidence, that the general assembly, at November session 1790, passed the following resolution in her favour. \u201cWhereas the \u00edesolotion af this session in favour of <em>Elizabeth Dorsey, </em>executrix of <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>is defective, and does not sufficiently express the meaning and intention of the legislature \u2014 Resolved, That the treasurer of the western shore be and he is hereby authorised and directed, to cancel all bonds now in the treasury, whereon any balance may be due, given to the state by <em>John Dorsey, Edward Norwood </em>and <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>and by <em>John Dorsey, Luke Wheeler, Samuel Chase </em>and <em>Thomas </em>Dorsey.\u201d She also gave in evidence, that at November session 1791, the general assembly passed an act, entitled/1 An act for the relief of <em>Elizabeth Dorsey, </em>executrix of <em>Thomas </em>Dorsey, late of <em>Jlnne Brundel </em>county, deceased/\u2019 reciting, that \u201cthe general assembly, at their last session, did by their resolution authorise the treasurer of the western shore to cancel all bonds then in the treasury, whereon any balance was due, given by the aforesaid <em>'Thomas Dorsey, </em>and other persons in the said resolution mentioned; and it was the intention of the general assembly by the said resolution to benefit the said <em>Elizabeth Dorsrj </em>and her children, and not the creditors of the said <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>or any other persons whatsoever; and the same is not sufficiently expressive of the sense and intention of the legislature: and doubts having alisen whether the said resolution can be of benefit to her or her family; and all the said bonds are yet uncaftceiled, and the said resolution has not been carried into effect; and this general assembly being desirous and willing to carry the intention of the legislature into full effect, Be it enacted, &amp;c. that the saiffire* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>solution be and the same is hereby repealed- and the treasurer of the western shore is hereby authorised and direct- \u25a0 1 \u2022 . <em>\" </em>ed, to receive the said bonds, and deliver them to the said \u25a0 ' - . <em>Elizabeth Eorsey, </em>to her use, after having acknowledged and endorsed on each bond, satisfaction received by (he state from the said <em>Elizabeth Eorsey, </em>for the sum due on each bond at the date of the said resolution; and the said <em>Elizabeth Dorsey </em>shall stand, in law and equity, in the ylace of the state, and be entitled to retain in her hands, in her own right, the money due to the state from the said <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>at the time of passing the before recited resolution; provided that the said <em>Elizabeth Dorsey </em>shall not, in virtue of this act, be entitled to ask, demand, sue for, recover or receiye, the amount or value of the said, bands, or any part of them, of, or from, any of the co-obligors in the said bonds, their heirs, executors or administrators.\u201d She further gave in evidence, that under and by virtue of the said actof assembly, the treasurer ofthe western shore did deliver up to her the said <em>Elizabeth </em>Dorsey,. the-defendant, all the said bonds, with such endorsement on each bond as ishercin beforemenfioned. That in pursuance of the will of the said <em>Thomas </em>Dorsey, and under the assignment aforesaid of the said bonds ftnd debt from the state, she, the defendant, did immediately enter into the possession of: tlie said lands mentioned in the declaration, and had been ever since in possession of the same, claiming right thereto. She further gave in evidence, that <em>Charles Steuart, </em>in (he deed of trust mentioned, prosecuted a suit against said <em>Thomas Dorsey </em>for the debt aforesaid due by him to said <em>Steuart, </em>and obtained a judgment therefor in the genera! court at October term 1?88, upon which he sued forth a writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>against <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>returnable to October term 1789, to lie in the office; and did further sue forth another writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>thereon against the said <em>Thomas.

The plaintiff having produced aq other evidence, than- that which is herein after mention\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ed, to prove that the said <em>Charles Steuart </em>had accepted the said premises in (he declaration mentioned, according to the terms of the said deed of trust, then further t\u00f3 prove the title under the said deed of trust, he offered to read in evidence the proceedings in the court of chancery, on a bill filed by <em>Charles Sleudft 8/ James M'Culloch, </em>surviving executors of <em>James </em>Dick, against <em>Jlrchibahl Moncrief 8? \u00a1Pm. </em>Hammond, on the 14th of August 1794; setting for th that <em>Thomas </em>Dorsey, beirig indebted to the said <em>Steuart M\u2019Culloch, </em>executed to them two bonds, &amp;c. the same being for property belonging to the est\u00e1te of <em>James Dick, </em>sold by the said executors; suits were brought thereon, and judgments recovered. That the said <em>Dorsey </em>executed, a deed of trust to the said <em>Moncrief </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>Hammond, </em>&amp;c. That in virtue of said deed the said trustees, to pay and Satisfy the judgments aforesaid, wbre authorised and empowered to convey to the said <em>Charles Steuart 8?

That t\u00edo other sums of money than the amount of the judgment aforesaid, were due to the said <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>M' C. </em>from the said <em>Dorsey, </em>or <em>Dorsey, Wheeler, </em>&amp;. Co. and that (he name of the said <em>Steuart </em>was alone mentioned in the deed as being a person of more business than the other two co-executors\u00bb 'That the said <em>Steuart, </em>by his attorney, sometime alter the execution of the said deed, accepted and agreed to take the said part of the lot aforesaid, as expressed in the deed, and offered in consideration and satisfaction of the said judgment; and the said <em>Dorsey </em>was pleased therewith, and begged that no execution on the judgments might be served ou him or his property, and in consequence none ever was served. That after the judgments and deed aforesaid, the chancellor, in order to carry the trusts into full effect and operation with the consent of the said <em>Dorsey, </em>conveyed an estate in fee to (he said trustees of the said lot. The trustees refuse to convey, &amp;c. The answers o\u00ed <em>Moncrief </em>and <em>Hammond </em>stated, (hat they were willing to execute the trust in the manner the chancellor shall direct, &amp;c. <em>Decreed, </em>the 21th of August 1801, that the defendants convey by deed, &amp;c. to the complainants, ail that part of a lot, &amp;c. No. 88, in full satisfaction of all claim, &amp;c. by the complainants against the defendants. To this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>dence the defendant objected. But the Court, <em>[_Nicholsotb\u00a1 </em>Cb. J. ahd Hollingsworth, A.

The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">2. The plaintiff then read in evidence a deed, made Under the decree of the chancellor, dated the 21st of Octob\u00e9r 1801* from <em>Moncrief </em>ami <em>Hammond, </em>to <em>John Skinner, </em>reciting the decree of the court of chancery, and an assignment of <em>James M'-Culloch\u2019s </em>right, &amp;c. dated the J8th of September 1801, to the said <em>Skinner. </em>The facts stated in the deed were admitted to be true. The defendant theft prayed the court to direct the jury, that the said evidence, if they believed it, was not sufficient or competent'to prove the acceptance by <em>Charles Sleaart </em>of the said lot so conveyed in trust for his use, in satisfaction of the debt in said deed mentioned, within six weeks from the date of said deed, according to the terms thereof. But the court were of opinion, that the decree of the chancellor, together with the deed from <em>Moncrief 8f Hammond to John </em>Skinnei, was sufficient evidence of a due execution of the trust in the deed of the 12th of August 1788. The de\u00ab fendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">5. The plaintiff then gave in evidence, that <em>John Skinner </em>died since the institution of this suit, having first duly made his last will and testament, dated the 5th of February 1806, whereby he devised all the rest, residue and remainder, of his estate, both real and personal, not before disposed of, whatsoever nature or kind the same may be, ire manner following, viz. The one equal moiety or half part thereof to <em>Elizabeth Rogers </em>and <em>Jinn Rogers, </em>their heirs and assigns, and the other equal moiety to <em>Hercules Courtenay, </em>,his heirs and assigns, for ever. And that <em>Elizabeth Rogers, </em>who hath since intermarried with <em>Robert </em>Maxwell, <em>Jinn Rogers </em>and <em>Hercules Courtenay, </em>are the residuary devisees in said will, and are the persnns made parties in this cause. The defendant there moved the court to direct the jury, that upon the whole evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. But the court refused to give the direction. The defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against her, she appealed to this court. \u2022</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-9\">The cause was argued before Chase, G'h.

In this case the lessors of the plaintiff and defendant claim under the same person, <em>Thomas Dorsey, </em>the latter uuder a bond executed by <em>Dorsey </em>in the year 1782, the former under a deed executed by him in the year 1788.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The bond was to the state of <em>Maryland, </em>and under ati act of assembly gave to the state a lien on the land in question, and that bond having been transferred by the state, under another act of assembly, to the defendant, and that act having Vested in her all the interest the state had, (so far as regards the land in controversy,) she became entitled to the lien on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The deed executed in 1788,-conveyed several tracts of land, including the lands in contest, to trustees, for the benefit of certain specified creditors, provided they within six weeks from the date of the deed, assented to receive the trusts raised for their benefit, in full satisfaction of their claims, and if not, so received, then the trustees were to hold the property, subject to the control of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">It appears to be conceded on the part of the plaintiff that the persons for whose use those original trusts were created, were not to have the benefit of them, except upon their timely assent thereto, and the consequent release of their claims. It would therefore appear to follow, that the plaintiff, claiming under one of those creditors, should establish the due assent and release of that creditor, before he can derive any benefit under the deed. To establish that fact, or to preclude the necessity of its establishment, he produced in evidence a bill filed in chancery by one of those creditors, against the trustees named in the deed, for the conveyance of the land in question, with the proceedings, and the decree passed thereon, directing such \u25a0conveyance to be made. The bill was filed, and the decree obtained long after the expiration of the six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">By the decree the land was directed to be conveyed to the complainant, but he having assigned the decree to the person under whom the plaintiff claims, prior to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>veyanc\u00e9, the conveyance was made to that person, and not, to the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">There is no evidence in the cause to establish the assent and rel\u00e9ase, \u00e9xc\u00e9pt the proceedings in chancery have that fe fleet,. nor is there any thing to exclude the defendant, (claiming indirectly from <em>Thomas </em>Dorsey,) Prom demanding such proof, unless the proceedings in chancery and the deed will do so. The questions then arise, are the proceedings in chancery evidence of those facts? and if not, do they dispense with such proof? and if so, then will the. deed made, n\u00f3t to the complainant in the causey but to his assignee', transfer tb him the legal title?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The proceedings in chancery having taken place in a cause iti which the defendant was no party, cannot be received to establish any on\u00e9 fact necessary to be proved in this cause, and therefore it appears the court below erred in permitting them to go in evidence to prove the assent and release to have been obtained indue time: But although the court have erred, yet if the proceedings super-cede the necessity of such proof, the judgment below having been in favour of the plaintiff, such error of itself presents no foundation for the reversal of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">\u25a0 The trustees were not authorized of themselves, to make the conveyances, except on the terms of the trust deed, and yet as the legal title was in them, there it must remain until parted with, even after the expiration of the time specified in the deed, and it is not perceived how they were io be deprived of that legal title, except by a conveyance, or something equivalent thereto. It may, and to me seems to follow, that therefore a conveyance by those trustees to the creditors, even if voluntarily made, without the timely assent and release of their debts, would have vested the legal estate in such creditors. The only effect would have been, that if the assent and release had existed, then the . creditors would have had the legal estate, free from all trusts, if not, then subject to the future trusts of the grantor created by the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">To me, then, it appears to follow, that the person, to whose use the trustees did convey, holds the legal estate which they had, unless they were divested of the same by the decree, directing the conveyance to the complainants <em>in </em>the suit in chancery, and not to his assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The question then becomes important, did the decree of itself, or by the delay alleged, pass the estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">Before the act of 1785, <em>ch. </em>72, there was no mode to compel a conveyance under a decree directing Lt to be made, provided the person would withstand all the process of the court, such person, although deprived by the decree of the equitable estate, could no,t be divested of the legal one. The design of the legislature was to apply a remedy, and that was, by directing that the decree in certain cases should pass the legfd estate. The legislature might, if they had thought proper, Have directed, that the decree in all instances should have had effect? nor does it appear to me that any good reason can be offered, why such was-sot its provision; but such a construction of it, it appears evident to me, does not comport either with its letter or spirit. If the decree of itself, in all instances, passed the estate, then the deed, which the act directs to.be executed,, even when executed, could have no effect, for if the decree passed the estate, nothing remained for the deed to operate on. The legislature then designed, that subsequent proceedings should be had, to give to the decree the operation of a conveyance, and as the defendant could not refuse to convey, until the conveyance was demanded, therefore the demand was necessary, as he could not be charged with neglecting to convey, until asked to convey, the demand therefore must precede the charge of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Such I have always undeistood to' have been t,he construction of the act of 1785, and indeed I am not sure that the demand must not appear by proof in the court of chancery, and that the refusal or neglect must appear by a subsequent order, or decree of the chancellor, before the conveyance of the legal estate was perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">It has been asked, where would be the legal estate if the defendant should die after the decree, and before the conveyance? If I am correct, it would be in his heir, and it would only be a common case, of the legal interest being in one, and the equifahle one in another, and in the same manner as if after a sale of land, and before tiie conveyance, the person who sold, it should have died, his heir Would have the legal estate, and the purchaser or his representative, the equitable one, it would be one of those ^pualtiesj for which perhaps it is impossible to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>From these remarks then, my opinion is, that the court erred in permitting the proceedings in chancery to go in evidence to prove particular facts, but that they, and the deed by the trustees to the assignee of the complainant, were proper evidence to make out the title of the person under whom the plaintiff claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">I therefore differ in opinion from the court below, on the second bill of exceptions, but as that was pronounced 'upon irrelevant matter, and not affecting the plaintiff\u2019s right who obtained the judgment, that judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The prior lien of the bond can have no effect, on the legal right to the land, the lien did not divest that legal right, and that having been transferred to the lessors of the plaintiff, he was entitled to recover, still (perhaps) holdings it subject to the defendant\u2019s prior equitable right.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">judgment reversed, and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
