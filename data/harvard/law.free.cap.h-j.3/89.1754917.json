The declaration stated, that although six bales were afterwards delivered, yet they were not good, sound; merchantable Finens, but on the contrary bad and unmerchantable, &amp;c The general issue was pleaded; and at the trial the plaintiff prayed the court to direct the jury; that if they should be of opinion from the testimony, that the merchandize in question was sold to the plaintiff for the full merchantable price, that it implies a warranty that the same was, at the time ofth\u00e9 sale, good, sound and merchantable; and that if the merchandize in question was unsound, and that unsoundaess was not obvious to the buyer at the tim\u00e9 of the sale, in the state in which such goods are usually sold, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tiff i\u00e1 Entitled to recover on the ground of such implied warranty; This direction the court, <em>[\u25a0Nieho\u00ed&amp;on, </em>Ch.

Lect. </em>415, &amp; 1 <em>Pow. on Cont. 150. </em>The plaintiff is <em>hot </em>bound to show that the defendant knew of the defect Or damage in' the things sold; for a man ought to have skill in the way of his Business, and ignorance is considered as a deceit upon those with, whom he deals. <em>3 Wood. </em>199. <em>Bevingsay vs. </em>Ralston, <em>Skin. </em>66; &amp; <em>Denison vs. Ralphson, </em>1 <em>Vent. </em>366. The court below grounded their opinion principally on a case of <em>Parkinson vs. Lee, 2 East, </em>314, and the case of <em>Stuart vs. </em>Wilkins, <em>1 Doug. </em>20. The first of these cases ivas a sale by sample, and the commodity was proved to be the same as the sample. That is d very different case from the one before this court, where the sale was of linens in bales, without opening them, and without the exhibition of a sample.' The court below go farther in their decision than the case required; and so far as they appear to decide the case before the court, it is a mere <em>obiter </em>opinion, and that founded on another <em>obiter </em>opinion of Lord Mansfield; for the case <em>Stuart vs. Wilkins </em>was merely as to the form of the declaration. The common Understanding of mankind, and the general usage of merchants, is in favour of the implied warranty. An instance has rarely occurred where, on a sale of goods by invoice or in bales, a concealed damage has been discovered, in which the vendor has refused to refund the money, and take back the goods, or compensate for the injury sustained. Upon this principle substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>justice is clone, for the logs \u00abvill ultimately fall upon the person who knew of the damage, and fraudulently packed up the goods as merchantable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-4\"><em>T.

Com. </em>451, (and <em>Christian\u2019s </em>notes.) That there is no implied warranty as tq tl&gt;e quality, is evident from 3 <em>Blk. Com. </em>164. <em>Parkinson vs. Lee, 2 East, </em>314. <em>Williamson vs. Allison, Ibid </em>446. If a sound price implies a warranty, why are express warranties ever made, or why arq actions of deceit ever brought! The universal understand. <em>ing </em>of every man buying and selling is against implied warranties. The authorities of 2 <em>Wood. Lect. </em>415, 3 <em>Wood. Lect. </em>199, and 1 <em>Pow. on Contracts, </em>150, are the incautious <em>dicta </em>of commentators, unsupported by the decision in <em>Denison vs. Ralphson, </em>1 <em>Vent. </em>366, and <em>Bevingsay vs. Ralson, Skin. </em>66, on which they profess* to, be foundedj these cases were on express warranties, and it was. therefore properly decided that the <em>scienter </em>need not be proved.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b103-5\">JUDCiMEXT AiTIKMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
