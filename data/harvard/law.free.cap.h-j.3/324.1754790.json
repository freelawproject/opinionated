This last letter was received by the plaintiff on the 9th of the same month, and not being able to sell the cocoa on- advantageous terms, he resolved to take t'jie same on purchase on his own account at a certain price., and to ship the same as his. own pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>party to the <em>Venus. </em>That on the 29th of June 1806, he informed <em>Caze </em>\u00e1nd <em>Richaud </em>of this determination, and of the shipment, by letter of that date, which he gave in evidence, and which letter was received by them oh the 3d of July, who dissented immediately from the said purchase, and expressed such their dissent by letter of that date, and which he also gave in evidence. That the said Setter was received by the plaintiff on ths 41b of July, before the writing of the letter in sympathetic ink; and that in consequence of the receipt of the letter from <em>Caze </em>and <em>Richaud, </em>and of their dissent (herein expressed, the plaintiff relinquished his claim to the 101 bags of cocoa under the said purchase, and did, in and by the letter in sympathetic ink, direct the cocoa to be considered by his correspondent aforesaid as the property of R, meaning <em>Caze </em>and <em>Richaud. </em>That <em>Caze </em>arid <em>Richaud </em>were natives of France, but before ths year 1806 were duly naturalize,d as citizens of the, <em>U. S. </em>and did then reside in <em>New-York. </em>That the 23 barrels of sugar, mentioned in the letter in. sympathetic ink, were, before the 5th of June 1306, the property of <em>James Chaytor, </em>and were before that day sold by him to the plaintiff, who shipper! them as aforesaid, they then being his property; and on the 2d of July, and before the writing of the said .letter, Chaytor, who is a native citizen of the <em>IT. S. </em>then residing therein, requested the plaintiff to rescind-the said sale, and permit the 23 barrels sugar to go to <em>Bourdeax </em>in the <em>Venus </em>as the property of him* <em>Chaytor, </em>and so to mention it to the plaintiff\u2019s correspondent; to which the plaintiff consented, through a wish to oblige <em>Chaytor, </em>and in consequence thereof, in the letter in sympathetic ink, informed his correspondent, that the 2;5 barrels of sugar belonged to <em>James Chaytor. </em>The plaintiff further gave in evidence, that a claim was put in for the said goods in the vice admiralty court in his behalf, and duly prosecuted, and that after the condemnation, an appeal on his part was duly made, of which appeal, still de pending, the defendants had due notice. The defendants then prayed the court to direct the jury, that if thej? believed the foregoing evidence, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. This direction the Court, <em>\\_Nichohon, </em>Ch.

The most important question in this case <em>is, </em>whether the war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ranty has been fulfilled? In my opinion the concealed pajpers, the artifice practised to prevent detection of them, the fictitious names used, and the mystery in which the whole are enveloped, contradict and discredit the legal documents, (the bill of lading, manifest aud affidavit, of the appellant <em>John </em>Carrere,) which cover the whole property insured as his property. These circumstances are inconsistent with good faith, that purity cf intention and fair dealing, which should be the concorai'ants of e' ery policy of insuK-nce, and contaminate the whole transaction by indicating a fraudulent design of covering property not the property of the appellant, and justly exciting suspicion that the property belonged to the enemy of the belligerent making the capture. The documents being falsified in pari were deprived of all credit, and the warranty was not complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Although the concealed papers were not known at the tune of the capture, yet being on board of the vessel, and discovered at the time of the trial in the court of admiralty, they were a justifiable cause of capture and detention, and from their suspicious aspect, precluding further proof and explanation, violated the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">JUDGMENT AE\u00cdTKMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
