The nuncupative will of <em>Samuel </em>Brayfield, pronounced by him in the presence of three witnessess on the 22d of April 1807, two days before his death, he being then in his last sickness, at his own house, and after-wards on the 28th of April 1807, reduced to writing, and signed by the three witnesses in the presence of two witnesses, was offered for probate in the orphans court. One of the witnesses of the will was the wife of one of the legatees, but which legatee, by a release duly executed on the 28th of April 1807, released to <em>John Brayfield, </em>(the appellee,) and his sister <em>Milley, </em>a brother and sister of the whole blood of the deceased, all his right, claim and interest, under the will. The other property of the deceased, amounting by an inventory thereof, to \u00a73236 48, he bequeathed to his wife and her two children, <em>S </em>and <em>J. Pancoast, </em>then living with the deceased, and to whom he was guardian. Citations issued for the persons related to the deceased, none of whom but <em>Jane Brayfield, </em>(the appellant,) the widow of the deceased, were summoned. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>appeared, and not objecting, the probate of the will was ordered by the court to be taken and recorded; and probate was accordingly taken before the orphans court on the 9th of June 1807, of the three witnesses of the nuncupative will of <em>S. Brayjield, </em>so reduced to writing, and signed by them; and letters of administration, with a copy of the said will annexed, were granted to <em>Jane Bray-field. </em>On the petition of <em>John Brayjield, </em>the brother of the deceased, the court proceeded to rehear the case, and caused sundry depositions of witnesses to be taken. After which, they decreed that the will, purporting to be the nuncupative will of <em>Samuel Bray field, </em>ought not to prevail, and that the letters of administration be revoked. From that decree <em>Jane Brayjield </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b220-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>X </em>\u2018nuncupative will established \u25a0where the pe\u00ed sosia! property, of which the deceased died possessed, amounted by the iinventorj to \u00a33235 48.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b220-15\">A nuncupative will was proved hy three witnesses, one of whom was the wife of one of the legatees, but which legatee had released all his interest, &amp;c to certain of the representatives of the deceased; and although the release Was not accepted by the releasees, it was held to be a good release, and that the will was legally peeved</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The cause was argued before Polk, Buchanan, Earle, and Johnson, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-4\"><em>Shaaff </em>and <em>Taney, </em>for the Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOq\">contended, that the release by <em>Davis, </em>was a good release, although it . was not accepted by the releasees.
