At the trial the plaintiff read, in eivdence the patent of <em>Mundell's </em>Surveys granted to the lessor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ilie plaintiff on the 21st of October ISOS, and a p\u00e1ienl for <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>dated iii 1695, granted t\u00f3 <em>Mordeca\u00ed Mame, </em>reciting, that the said <em>Moore </em>had set forth that lie had assigned unto him by <em>Ninian Beall, </em>of <em>Culvert </em>county, a certain tract of land for 455 acres in, <em>Calvert </em>county, surveyed for the said <em>Beall </em>the 25th of July 1684, and that the surveyor, in returning the said certificate of said land, had through mistake certified, that said land was laid out for said <em>Beall </em>by virtue of a warrant for 1000 acres, granted to him the 15th of February 1683, whereas in reality the warrant then granted to him, and by virtue whereof the said land was laid out, was for \u00cd500 acres, by means of which mistake of the surveyor, the said <em>Beall\u2019s </em>grant of said land had been delayed to be passed. That the said <em>Moore </em>had made <em>it </em>evidently appear, that the said 455 acres were surveyed for said <em>Beall </em>by virtue of a warrant for 15C0 acres granted him on the said 15th of February, there being so much of the said warrant no otherwise made use of, and no warrant for \u00cd0\u00d30 acres of that date being granted to the said <em>Bead. </em>Wherefore, it appearing palpably that it was merely the mistake of the surveyor in inserting in his certificate the words 1000 only', in lieu of 1500, and that the said <em>Moore </em>prayed that the mistake might be rectified, and a grant to him made pursuant to the said <em>Beall\u2019s </em>assignment, &amp;c. Therefore there was granted to the said <em>Moore </em>all that tract or parcel of land called <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>lying in <em>Calvert </em>county, on the west side of <em>Patuxent </em>river, and in the freshes of the said river, and on the west side of a branch called Collington, and on the west side <em>of Edward Isaac\u2019s </em>land, beginning, &amp;c. containing <em>455 </em>acres. ' lie further gave in evidence, that his locations on the plots in the cause were correct.

'Warrant for 3000 acres, dated the 18th of July 1689, granted to <em>jSfiman Beall </em>of <em>Calvert </em>county', this day renewed for the said quantity. December 20, 1694.

September 21, 1695. Warrant then granted <em>Ninian Beall </em>uf <em>Calvert </em>county, for 400 acres of land, being due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to him by renewal of part of a warrant for 1673 acres of land, granted him by renewment the 20th of December 1694.\u201d And to prove that <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>the land for r which the defendant <em>took </em>defence, was surveyed in virtue of the said warrants, and that'the same had been patented to said <em>Ninian Beall, </em>and that the jury might and ought to presume such patent to have issued, he also offered in evidence a deed from said <em>Ninian Beall </em>to <em>James Ran-ton\u00a1 </em>dated the 15th of July 1706, for all that tract or parcel of land called <em>Beall\u2019s </em>Reserve, lying in <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county, on the west side <em>o\u00ed Patuxent </em>river, in the woods, and on the east side of the main branch of <em>Piscalaway, </em>beginning at a bounded white oak, being the S TV bounded tree of a parcel of land surveyed fur <em>Thomas Brooke, </em>called <em>The Forest, </em>thence S S W 320 ps. to a bounded - white oak, thence ESE 200 ps. thence N N E 320 ps thence with a straight line to the first bounder, containing 400 acres more or less.

Also extracts from <em>Prince George\u2019s </em>county debt book, showing that part of <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>400 acres, was charged to <em>Richard l-.ee, </em>from the years 1753 to 1772, inclusive. And to prove that <em>Richard Lee </em>had, and those claiming under him have been in the possession ancl the use of said land, proved by competent witnesses, that for a number of years past, and as far back as the recollection of the witnesses extended, that\" said land had been cultivated and used by said <em>Lee, </em>and his tenants, and that no person, to the knowledge of the witnesses, had possessed any part of said land, except said <em>Richard Lee, </em>and those claiming under him, claiming the same as <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>a part of <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>as located by defendant, and so much thereof as was comprehended within the lines of <em>The Plains of Shrewsbury Resurveyed, </em>as located on the plots, had been in the continued possession, use and occupation, of the owners of said last mentioned tract of land, from about the time of the same being taken up. It was further proved, that <em>Richard Lee, </em>under whom the defendant claimed, lived at this time about 30 or 40 miles from said land, and that <em>Russell Lee, </em>his heir, was a minor, and died under the age of 21 years? and that the witnesses, who were about the age of sixty years, lived on the adjoining land. And to prove that <em>Richard Lee, </em>and those claiming under him, had been charged with and paid assessments for said land, the defendant offered in evidence the assessment lists of <em>Prince- George\u2019s </em>county for several years? by Which it appeared that in 1781 and 1782, part of <em>Beall\u2019s </em>Pasture, 400 acres, was assessed <em>to Richard Lee. </em>In 1783 part of <em>Beall\u2019s Plains, </em>by resurvey 400 acres, was assessed to him. In 1786 part of <em>Beall's Pleasure, </em>400 acres, tenanted to <em>Sami. Townsend, </em>was assessed to him. In 1793, 1798 and 1804, <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>400 acres, was assessed to his heirs. And to prove that the land stated in the asse.ssment books, and the land included in the deed from <em>Ninian Beall, </em>and referred to in the rent rolls and debt books, were the same, the defendant offered in evidence, that <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve, </em>as located by him, was situated in. the hundred of <em>Prince-George\u2019s </em>county, distinguished by <em>Grub </em>Hundred, from which the said extracts are taken, and that the said <em>Richard Lee </em>had no land called <em>Beall\u2019s Pasture, Beall\u2019s Plains </em>or <em>Beall\u2019s Pleasure, </em>unless <em>Beall\u2019s Reserve </em>had acquired those names by reputation. And also offered in evidence, that <em>Rickard Lee, </em>and those claiming under him, had paid the taxes on the whole of <em>Beall\u2019s </em>Pasture, and that the same had not been assessed to any other person, and that the whole tract was generally understood to be the property of said Zee, and those claiming under him. And also offered in evidence, the following certificates of adjoining surveys, and which were truly located by the defendant, viz. <em>Potomack Landing, </em>surveyed the 5th of April 1685: <em>The Forest, </em>surveyed the 5th of September 1694: <em>Shrewsbury Plains, </em>surveyed the 2d of October 1719: <em>The Widow\u2019s Trouble, </em>surveyed the 15th of January 1732-6: <em>Blacldock\u2019s Venture, </em>surveyed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>15 th of December 1755; and <em>ThePlainsof Shrewsbury, </em>suvveyed the 25th of January 1772. It was also proved, that the record books of the land office had been searched, and no patent for the land called <em>Beall\u2019s Reseive, fot </em>which the defendant took defence, could be found; nor any certificate for tbe same. And further, that the record book for patents and certificates, recorded in the year 1695, was in the land office. The following testimony was also by consent admitted: The deposition of <em>John Callahan, </em>who deposed, that \u201cprevious to the year 1700, the register of the land office did not record, as it appears by the old record books in his office, the payment made by the party of the composition money for lands surveyed for such party, or make any marginal note in the record of the certificate of such payment, whether the certificate was made upon a warrant of resurvey, or whether the certificate, when returned, included more land than was expressed upon the warrant or warrants upon which the same was made. That in the year 1679, and before' and after, as far down as the year 1700, there are many certificates for lands surveyed for different persons, recorded in the land office* upon which it cannot be found that there is or are' any patent or patents recorded in sai.d office. That it is, and always has been, customary to recite in the patent or grant, when issued, the' consideration Upon which the same issiied, and the manner in which the composition money for the land mentioned in such grant was paid. That since the revolution several old patents, granted between the years 1678 and 1701, as far back as the year 1682, which were in the bands of those holding under the patentee therein named, and which had never before been recorded in the land office, have been produced to him-to be recorded, and have \u2022 been recorded; that it has sometimes happened to himself, since he has been in office, that the person for whom a patent was made out, took it to the governor to procure his signature, and having obtained it, never returned the patent to him to be recorded, whereby it happened that a patens in such case did regularly issue, and yet there was and isf no record of it in Ills office. That for near thirty years last past, he has from time to time*, frequently heard a report, that one of the old record books in the Proprietary land office, containing the record of patents, has been lost. That the record books in the land office refer <em>from </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u00abme to the other, and that he never found a reference to any record book which is not to be found in the office, and that lie from thence is of opinion no record book has been lost out of said office, burnt or destroyed. Also the deposition of <em>John </em>Brewer, who dep osed, that he was pud at present is an assistant clerk to <em>John </em>Kilty, register of the land office, and had for eleven years last past been clerk in said office, acting for many years in said office as a clerk to <em>John Callahan, </em>the register of said office, and that he never heard or understood that any record book belonging to said office had been lost or missing of late years. lie never heat\u2019d or understood that any record book of said office had been lost during the revolutionary war, or at any period shortly before. That Mr. <em>Callahan, </em>now dead, informed him, that he had never seen in the office a reference to a book in the office which lie could not <em>find; </em>that seeing a record book of certificates in the office for a number which he could not find patents, he was sometimes induced to believe a record book of patents might have been lost; but-on the whole be thought no book was lost. That the warrants are all recorded in different books from the books in which the certificates aud grants are recorded, and he never heard, nor from many years examination of the records has he any reason to, helieve, that any record book of warrants was lost. The defendant also offered in evidence the warrants and the rent \u2022rolls aforesaid, together 'with the other evidence offered by him, to prove that the said <em>Beall </em>was in the possession of the land until his conveyance to <em>Janies llanfon; </em>and to prove that <em>Mant\u00f3n </em>also possessed the same until his conveyance to <em>Lee. </em>Arid also gave in evidence, that <em>Bussell Zee, </em>the grandson am] heir at law, died without having issue, and leaving <em>Sarah Bussell Conlee, Ann Z.$c, Eleanor Ben.son </em>and <em>Margaret Clcrklee, </em>the wife of the defendant, his heirs at law. The defendant then prayed the opinion of the court, and their direction to the jury, th.at if they find the several facts as stated by the defendant to be true, \u2022that then, although they find the facts stated by the plaintiff to be true, they may and ought to presume a patent issued for <em>Beall\u2019s Beservs, </em>and as contained in the before mentioned deed from <em>Beall </em>to <em>Banton; and </em>if they find the location of the deed as made by the defendant to he true, that, then they ought to find a verdict for the defendan\u00edv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>This opinion and direction the Court, [AY?/ and <em>Clarice, A,.. </em>J.'3 gave to the jury.
