But the court, <em>[Chase, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Harwood, </em>A. J.] were of opinion, that if the jury should Hud the above fact, and should also find from the evidence, that the said transfer was made to <em>Han-</em>\u00bfwry\u2019s executors, to pay and satisfy a debt due from the state to <em>Ilanbury, </em>by mortgage from <em>Dulany, </em>on land confiscated by the state, that in such case the state received the beneficial use of the stock so transferred, and the plaintiff was entitled, according to his contract with the state, and the several acts of the legislature confirmatory thereof, to 4 p. c. commission on the said stock thus transferred by Mr. <em>Pinkney. </em>The court were also of opinion, that the liability of the state to pay the said debt, did not depend on the bank stock, and if it had not been obtained by suit or negotiation, the obligation of the state to pay the said debt, would have remained, as it arose from the act of confiscation, and was secured by the treaty of peace. That the said claim of <em>Ilanbury </em>had no connexion with the bank stock, nor was alien on the same; that the only subject of negotiation was the right of the state to the bank stock, and the means used to obtain it could not be considered as a part of the subject of negotiation. The attorney general excepted on the part of the state; and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, this appeal was prosecuted on the part of the state.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>S C was appointed under ihe act of 17*3, <em>ch </em>35, agent on the part of the state, to receive a transfer o <em>i </em>stock in the Bank of <em>Erigland </em>belonging; to the state, and he was allowed' a commission of 4 per cepl on the net sum to be by him received, \u2018in full satisfaction ibr his trouble^ O H, having a claim agaiiv&gt;t the state on account of land jnort\u00a3iip*edto liitn by JD D, which )mid was coiiiUeattnl by the state, the agent was by the act of 1786, <em>ch, </em>50, uptliorued to assign to O II n portion of the bank stock, not exceeding\u2019 \u00bf11,000, By tbe act \u00f3f 1*01; <em>ch. </em>103, the mir/ister of the <em>U S </em>m <em>London </em>)vus vested with autfioiity to receive a\u2019transfer of the stock and all dividends due, and to1 transfer to the ageht 4\u2018 per cent in bank'stoejc on the amount which might be transferred to him, and psfy to tlie spent tbe lifte/Str <em>centum </em>on the dividends received.
