The converse of the above positions is equally true. The instrument of writing, upon which this suit was brought, creates a debt immediately, to be paid at a subsequent day, to wit, the lpt of April 1809. The plaintiff\u2019s <em>cause of action </em>commenced with the writing obligatory, to wit, the 29th of August 1808, but its legal demand, was suspended until the 1st of April 1809, therefore it was not esseptial to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action to set forth that the defendant did, on or before the 1st of April 1809, refuse to deliver to the plaintiff\u2019 a horse, &amp;c. for before that period ariived there was a debt due, or a cause of action in the plaintiff', liable to be defeated by the defendants delivery of a horse, according to the terms of the writing obligatory; but the plaintiff\u2019s <em>cause of action </em>did not arise irons the nonperformance of the contract by the defendant, for the plaintiff' had a vested interest from the date of the writing obligatory. The delivery of the horse, &amp;c. was a proviso or condition, inserted in the writing obligatory, for the benefit of the defendant, with all the requisites of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>be was bound at his peril to comply. <em>Lamb's </em>Case, 5 Coke, 23. <em>More &amp; Baker vs. Morecomb, Cro. Eliz. </em>864. <em>Studholme vs. Mandell, </em>1 <em>Ld. Raym. 979. </em>The proviso or condition, when performed, or an oiler and readiness to perform, would have operated as a defeasance to the plamtili\u2019s action, and as matter of defence, should have been shown by the defendant, and need not be stated in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pleadings, </em>228, 229. In debt, on a bond with condition, the plaintiff may declare generally, and it is on the defendant\u2019s part to show the condition, which goes by way of defeasance, &amp;c. 3 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>714. If an interest passeth presently and vests, and is to be defeated by matter <em>ex post facto, </em>or condition subsequent, be the condition or act to be performed by the plaintiff or defendant, the plaintiff may declare generally without showing the performance, and it shall be pleaded by him who shall take advantage of the condition, &amp;c. <em>Ughbred's </em>case, 7 <em>Coke, 10. In the </em>case now before the court, there was an interest vested in the plaintiff, upon the execution of the writing obligatory, to be defeated by an <em>ex post facto. </em>act to be performed by the defendant, to wit, the delivery of a horse, &amp;c. on the 1st of April 1809, and if delivered according to the terms of the writing obligatory, should have been pleaded by the defendant, for whose advantage the condition was made. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to aver \u201ca disagreement of the persons to have been appointed to appraise said horse;\u201d the appointment of the men was a duty incumbent on the defendant, as in <em>Lamb\u2019s </em>case, &amp;c. aud it would be a strange thing to require of the plaintiff to aver a disagreement of the men to appraise such horse, when no men were appointed, and no horse offered for the exercise of their judgment; for an averment of a disagreement of the persons, &amp;c. would <em>ex vi termini </em>suppose that men were appointed, and a horse produced for their appraisement. A demand and refusal were equally unnecessary, the horse was not to be delivered until the 1st of April 1809, before that time no such demand could, consistent with the writing obligatory, be made, and after that period the plaintiff was not bound to accept of such horse, if offered by the defendant. In what the variance consists, as alleged in the first cause of demurrer, it would be difficult to conceive, had not tiie defendant's counsel said, in an action on the case on a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>agreement, the plaintiff ought to state the agreement as it really was, though in the alternative. This position, (though determined otherwise by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>in <em>Layton vs. Pearce, </em>1 <em>Doug. </em>16,) may be admitted* yet there is no variance in this case, for this is an action of debt on a writing obligatory; and when a suit is brought on a deed, only so much need be averred as shows the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. <em>Bristow vs. </em>Wright, 2 <em>Doug. </em>667. A request laid in the declaration to pay the debt before it is due* is not material. <em>Frampton vs. Coulson, </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>33.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-7\"><em>Brooke, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
