Brown </em>was a person using trade and commerce, and carrying on mer5 ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>chamlize at the city of Baltimore,- on, after and before, the 19th of October 1801, and that he drew his;bill of exchange for c\u00ed'G\u00f3'OO sterling on <em>TV. </em>and <em>T. Bailees, </em>merchants of London, by the names of <em>TV. </em>add <em>T. Bailees, </em>&amp; Co. in favour of <em>Clarke, </em>the defendant, or order. And. that <em>Clarke. </em>afterwards endorsed the bill of exchange to <em>Harris, </em>or order, and that <em>Harris </em>afterwards endorsed it to <em>G. Simpson, </em>cashier and agent of the Bank of the- <em>United States, </em>or order, for and on account of the president, directors a'nd company, of the Bank of the' <em>United </em>Stales; and further, that <em>Simpson </em>afterwards, as agent' of the president, directors and company, of the Bank of the <em>U, S. </em>endorsed the bill to <em>F. Baring </em>&amp; Co. or order, and that afterwards <em>F. Baring </em>&amp; Co. caused the bill to be protested for nonpayment thereof, viz. on theSSd of March 1802. And the plaintiff offered to prove by the oath of <em>B. </em>Harris, for that purpose sworn to the jury, that the original bill of cxchangOj together with an original protest thereof for nouacceplance, and protest for nonpayment thereof, came to his hands as agent for the Bank of the tf. <em>S. </em>and were respectively delivered by him to the district attorney of the <em>U. S. </em>for the purpose of instituting suits on the bill against <em>Clarke, </em>(die defendant,) and <em>Harris, </em>(the plaintiff). He also offered in evidence the records of proceedings in the circuit court of the <em>U S. </em>in and for the <em>Maryland </em>district, against <em>Harris </em>and <em>Clarke </em>respectively, at the suit of <em>G\u201e Simpson. </em>And offered to prove, that die bill of exchange in those records mentioned is the same bill offered in evidence in this' cause; and that <em>Simpson, </em>the' plaintiff in the records, is the same <em>Simpson </em>who is cashier and agent of the Bank of the <em>U.

To the admissibility of which evidence the defendant objected. But the county court, <em>[Nicholson, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Hollingsworth, </em>A. <em>3.} </em>were of opinion, that the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Was pfopei\u2019 and competent to prove the protest for nonaocepiance.

The plaintiff then offered to give in evidence by <em>D. Harris, </em>the cashier of the Office of Discount and Deposit, that in the usual course of the post from <em>Philadelphia to Baltimore, </em>he received a letter from <em>G. Simpson, </em>cashier of the Bank of the <em>\u00dc. S. </em>dated the 3d of April 1802, enclosing protests for nonacceptance of the bill of exchange* end that he, on the day he received the same, called on the <em>defendant, </em>and gave him verbal notice of such protest; and shortly after, be believes on the 8th of the same month, for greater certainty, he made out a written notice to be sent to the defendant of the protest, and copied such notice in. a book, which the witness produced to the court, and that <em>the defendant </em>did afterwards admit he had received the' written notice. The plaintiff further offered to give evidence by <em>D. Harris, </em>that he received a letter from Simpson, dated in <em>Philadelphia </em>the-day of \u2014 \u2014\u2014 1802, containing protests of the bill of exchange for nonpayment, and that he received tiie same in the usual course of the post from <em>Philadelphia </em>to Baltimore; and that on the day of receiving the same, he called on the defendant, and gave him verba! notice of the last protests; and that on the same or the next day he, for greater certainty, made out a written notice to the defendant, and delivered the same to <em>L. G. </em>to be delivered to the defendant, and that the witness copied this notice in a book, then produced by him; and did offer to prove by the witness, that the defendant, did afterwards acknowledge to him the receipt of <em>the written </em>notice. To this testimony, the defendant objected, because the notices being in writing, and no notice having been given by the plaiutijf to the defendant to produce them, no evidence ought to be given of their contents. But the county court, <em>fNicholson, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Hollingsworth, A. </em>J.y were of opinion, that such evidence was admissible tobe given to the jury; and the same was accordingly given. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">3. The plaintiff then gave in evidence, that the bill of exchange was made by <em>Brown </em>for the sole purpose of being discounted to raise money for his own use; and that for enabling him to do so the defendant, at the request of Brown, and for the sole purpose of enabling him to raise money thereon, but without any other consideration, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>endorse the bill in blank, and immediately delivered H back, so endorsed, to <em>Brown,hat </em>at that time had,no knowledge or information that the bill was to be endorsed alter him by the plaintiff, or that <em>Bi'own </em>intended to apply to ' tlie plaintiff to endorse the bill. And further gave in evidence; that Brown, after receiving back the bill so endorsed by the defendant; carried it to the plaintiff, and requested him to endorse the bill after the defendant, for the purpose of giving it further credit, and of thereby enabling him, Brown, to raise money on it for his own benefit. That \u2022the plaintiff, in compliance with this request, and for the purpose of giving additional credit to the bill, and to enable <em>Brown </em>to obtain money thereon for his own use, did endorse the bill in blank, and immediately delivered it back, so endorsed, to <em>Brown, </em>in blank, who Soon after sold it to <em>G. Simpson, </em>cashier of the Bank of the <em>U. S. </em>for' his <em>Brown\u2019s </em>own benefit. That at the time of the endorsements no consideration had taken place between the plaintiff and defendant respecting the bill or endorsements, o\u00ed*' respecting any endorsement to be made by them, or either of them, for <em>Brown, </em>or for his use or benefit; and that the plaintiff received no consideration for the endorsements, except such as might arise in law from the previous endorsement of the defendant, and from the making of the bill by <em>Broion, </em>and that the bill was never delivered to the plaintiff or to the defendant Brown, except for the purpose before mentioned. The plaintiff also gave in evidence, that the bill having been sold to <em>Simpson, </em>as before mentioned, was duly presented to the drawee for acceptance and payment, and not having been accepted or paid, was duly and regularly protested, for nonacceptance and nonpayment; of which protest notice was duly and legally given by <em>Simpson </em>to <em>Brown, </em>and to the plaintiff and defendant, and payment thereof immediately demanded by <em>Simpson </em>of <em>Brown, </em>who failed to pay it. Whereupon, notice of the failure was duly given by <em>Simpson </em>to the plaintiff and defendant, and payment of the bill was demanded of them by <em>Simpson. </em>The plaintiff further gave in evidence, that he and the defendant, being so called on for payment of the bill, did mutually agree that each of them should pay one half of the sum of money due thereon, but that-the right of the plaintiff to recover from the defendant, as the prior eridorsor of the bill, the sum so by the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>be paid, with interest, should notin any manner be affected by the agreement, And that the plaintiff did, in pursuance of drat agreement, on the 12th of December 1802, pay to <em>S.mpso.n, </em>cashier of the Bank of the <em>U. S. </em>the sum of SI 3,206 <em>67, </em>being one half of what was then due on the bill. The defendant then prayed the court to direct the jury, that the plaintiff, if the jury should believe the facts so offered in evidence by him, is not entitled in law to recover in this action the sum so paid by him to Simpson, cashier of the Bank of the <em>U. S. </em>V/hkh opinion, <em>[Nicholson, </em>Ch. J.] refused to give. The defendant excepted.
