That a division and partition of the said lands were made according to law, between <em>Jane Gale </em>and <em>Alexander </em>Stewart, and those lands mentioned in the declaration were allotted to <em>Jane </em>Gale, as her part of her father\u2019s real estate, to hold iu fee simple and in severalty, and into which she entered and was actually seized thereof in fee simple, and in severalty; and being so seized, in November 1797, died intestate, and without issue, leaving the said <em>Alexander Stewart, </em>her only brother and heir at law, to whom from her the said lands, in the declaration mentioned, descended. <em>Alexander Stewart, </em>after the death ot <em>Jane Gale, </em>entered into the lands so allotted to <em>Jane, </em>and as brother and heir at law ot <em>Jane, </em>was actually seized thereof iu fee simple: and being so seized, on the 22d of June 1810, died intestate, and without issue, or father, mother, brothers or sisters, or descendants from either, and leaving the follow\u00bb \u00edug pe\u00a1t..\u00ed0n8\u00ed his relations, living at the time of his death-, &gt; \u2022 \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>viz. <em>John </em>Stewart, the lessor of the plaintiff, who is the 'eldest son of <em>William </em>Stewart, deceased, who was the eldest brother of Col. <em>John Stewart, </em>and Who was the eldest and only uncle of <em>Alexander Stewart, </em>and which <em>William Stewart </em>died before the said <em>Alexander. </em>Alex\u2022 <em>under Stewart </em>also left other relations living at his death, viz. other children, and grandchildren of the said <em>William Stewart, </em>and children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren, of sisters of tiie aforesaid <em>John Stewart.</em></summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>&gt; J is seized of hinds, died ir.testaf&lt; in Vi^4, k\u2019iiving A, a son, ami J, a daughter, be* twot n whom a division and partition wpro in.ule \u2022 according to law.

Or, whether the said lands descended according to the act of assembly to direct descents? The county court gave judgment for th\u00ab defendant, and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\">The cause was argued before Chase, Ch. X and Buchanan, Nicholson, and Johnson, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-5\"><em>Martin, Bullitt </em>and <em>Whittington, </em>for the Appellant\u00bb'</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOk\">The only question is, whether the land, into which <em>Alexander Stewart </em>entered on the death of his sister, <em>Jane </em>Gale, and which descended from her to him, was operated oft by the act to direct descents, 1786, <em>ch. </em>45; if it was not. then Ihe lessor of the plaintiff, as the eldest son of <em>William Stewart, </em>who was the eldest brother of Col. <em>John Stewart, </em>is entitled to the whole of <em>Jane Gale\u2019s </em>part; but; if it is operated upon by that act, then others must come in for a part. There would be no doubt, except for the act to direct descents, that the lessor of the plaintiff is entitled to the land. Doth that act bar him? The person last seized, and who died seized, is the stock from whom the representatives must claim, without regard to the manner he or she obtained it. <em>Hale's Hist. C. L. </em>246. 2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>29. Suppose before the act to direct descents, lands descended from the nephew to an uncle, (living the father,) and then the uncle died, who would then inherit \u2014 the uncle\u2019s children or the father? <em>Co. Litt. </em>11, 12, <em>s. 4. </em>You. are precluded from showing how <em>Jane Gale </em>entered on the land. Suppose she purchased it, would that make any difiereneo? <em>Doe vs. Whichelo, </em>8 <em>T. R. 211. Goodtitle </em>vs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Newman, </em>3 <em>Wils. </em>526. <em>Doe vs. Morgan, 7 T. R. </em>99. <em>Doe vs. Keen, Ibid </em>382. Would the partition between <em>Alexander Slewart </em>and <em>Jane Gale </em>alter the nature of the estate; or in other words, does it make them hold by put-chase and not by descept? <em>Alexander Stewart </em>did not acquire the land, but <em>from </em>his sister; She was seized, and <em>scisina fa\u00e1t slirpem. </em>Did lie claim the laud <em>through </em>the father? The descent from brother to brother, or from sister to brother, is immediate, and not through the father. <em>Collingwood &amp; Pace, </em>1 <em>Ventr. </em>423. Where a statute uses words known to the common law, you must resort to the common law for their meaning. 4 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>647. The preamble of a statute cannot enlarge the enacting clause. <em>7 Bac. Ab. </em>551, 553.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-4\"><em>W. B. M\u00e1rtin, J. Bayly, f'.

The land descended <em>immediately </em>from tile sister, and <em>mediately </em>from the father. Although the descent was not from or through, yet it was on the part of the father. On the construction of statutes, the preamble mayseive to explain doubtful expressions. 6 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>381, 384. In the construction Of the act to direct descents, that, part Which says, if the estate descended on the port <em>of the father, </em>it should go to him, means that he should be the stock from whom the other claims should be ascertained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b301-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
