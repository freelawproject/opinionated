The appellant, Braun, deposited certain securities, consisting of , <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>30 shares of Paterson Savings Institution, 20 shares of First National Bank of Paterson, and 102 shares of Safety Car Heating stock, to he used together with certain colla! eral notes, as margin for his speculative account. These \u201cdeposit\u201d stocks were included in the pledge to the Mechanics' Bank described in the Bamford Case. After the failure the Mechanics\u2019 Bank sold the S\u00e1fete Car Ilea,ting shares and realized, $L2,(i;5\u201d.21 therefor.

The equities of this appellant are inferior to those of the appellant in the Bamford Case. The account as \u201crestated\u201d by the special master\u2014 whether rightfully or wrongfully \u2014 shows an indebtedness to the bankrupt estate) instead of a balance to the credit of the appellant. Moreover, as in the Bamford Case, the proof is insufficient to establish the conversion of an}\u2019 particular \u201clong\u201d stocks at any particular times. The right of the appellant to he placed in class A, instead of class B, depends altogether upon the testimony showing that at the lime of the failure the bankrupts were not earning <em>the </em>securities which they had purchased for his account and pretended to he carrying for him. As stated in the Bamford Case, this testimony makes out a prima facie case of conversion at some time prior to the failure, and it may be that the bankrupts at the time of the failure had no rights in the pledged \u201cdeposit\u201d securities to which other claimants could have been subrogated. It may be that the bankrupts, before the failure, owed the appellant the duty of withdrawing such securities from the Mechanics\u2019 Bank and of surrendering them to him. But the testimony leaves the actual state of the account between the appellant and the bankrupts in a state of uncertainty. Clearly the \u201crestatement\u201d of the account by the special master was wrong. The bankrupts were not carrying the appellant\u2019s \u201clong\u201d stocks which the statement 'purports to liquidate. But when they had been converted is not shown, so that the value at which their proceeds should have been credited does not appear, and it cannot be determined whether the appellant owed the estate, or vice versa. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the testimony goes far to negative any right in the bankrupts to have-the securities in question in the loan at the Mechanics\u2019 Bank, we think his equities are not strong enough to place the appellant in the superior class.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">While, however, the appellant, with respect to his \u201cdeposit\u201d securities and notes, is properly in class B, a'nd should bear the same burden as other claimants in that class, we think that the special master-erred in requiring him to bear the additional burden of paying the indebtedness as \u201crestated\u201d by the special master. As already shown, this restatement was incorrect. The bankrupts were not carrying the stocks which they were bound to carry. The testimony is wholly insufficient to afford a basis for charging the appellant with the balance stated, nor does it definitely establish any balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The appellant ought not to be required to make any payment on account of this alleged, but not established, indebtedness as a condition to obtaining his \u201cdeposit\u201d stocks; and we also think that this proceeding should not be delayed and reopened for further proof. When it appears that stockbrokers have violated every obligation which they owe a customer, and have converted the shares which they pretend to carry, the courts should not go out of their way to afford them or their trustee the benefit of securities deposited to make good losses incurred through fair dealings. But this conclusion will not prejudice the right of the trustee to bring an independent action against the appellant to recover any balance which he may be able to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The order, of the District Court is reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">For reasons stated in the Bamford Case, the order in the matter of People\u2019s Bank of Passaic is affirmed, with one-half costs,against the appellant, Braun.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
