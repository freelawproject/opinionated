It then states, that \u201cthe question of law decided by said court\u201d was \u201cthat the mortgage was a preferential transfer\u201d and not entitled to enforcement as a lien; and assigns error in various forms upon such rulings. The record shows that issues of fact and law were raised, and testimony was heard thereupon, before the Referee, but neither the testimony nor distinct findings of fact upon such issues, are preserved therein. While the petition further states, that \u201cthe Referee certified to the said court, the question presented, a summary of the evidence relative thereto and his finding and the order made therein,\u201d the only matters so certified, which are exhibited with the petition or in the record, are the order referred to, together with the Referee\u2019s opinion, mentioning several facts as appearing and his deductions against the validity of the mortgage. It is neither designated as a finding of facts, nor does it purport to state either the issues of fact or the ultimate facts thereunder. Without either the testimony or settlement of facts whereon the order is predicated, the petition presents no question of law for review. The petition is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
