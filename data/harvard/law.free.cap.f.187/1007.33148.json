The patent in suit (Edison reissue patent No. 12,037) has four claims. In March, 1907, it was declared valid by this court as to claims 1, 2, and 3, and invalid as to claim 4.

But the complainant insists that it has not had full opportunity to present the facts, and, in view of this contention, we shall go no further than to say that, in our opinion, the case presented is too doubtful to warrant the issuance of preliminary injunctions. . The orders of the Circuit Court are reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
