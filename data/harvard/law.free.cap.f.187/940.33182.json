The Hunter Contracting Company was a subcontractor upon such work which was accustomed in paying off its laborers to deduct from their wages the amounts which they respectively owed to the petitioner for groceries supplied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b952-15\">The Hunter Company abandoned the work and left a number of laborers unpaid. The receiver, in order to avoid delay and, perhaps, the filing* of liens, paid the wages of these laborers, less the amounts which it appeared they owed the petitioner. The receiver, at the time of making such payments, was not indebted to the Hunter Company.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b952-16\">Parker &amp; Ernst, for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b952-17\">John C.

It is undoubtedly true, as urged by the petitioner, that the receiving of money which, consistently with conscience, cannot be retained, is in equity sufficient to raise a trust in favor of the person for whom it is received,. The difficulty with applying this principle in the present case is that the receiver never .received any moneys to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>petitioner was entitled. There was nothing to which a trust could be attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">The theory that the receiver by paying the laborers less than the whole amount due them created a trust in favor of the petitioner with respect to the unpaid balances is without foundation. The receiver was not indebted to the laborers\u2019 employer and owed no duty to the petitioner. He could pay as much or as little as he deemed expedient to safeguard the work. The payments he made may or may not have satisfied the laborers\u2019 demands. If those demands constituted liens, such payments did not discharge the property. But there was nothing retained for the petitioner\u2019s benefit because there was nothing to be retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The petitioner\u2019s demand would undoubtedly be well founded had the receiver owed the subcontractor and in paying its laborers\u2019 wages had deducted the amount of the petitioner\u2019s claim. But the most that can be said is that the receiver took advantage of a practice which he found to exist to pay the laborers less than he probably otherwise would have paid. But as already pointed out, whatever may have been the effect of such payment upon the laborers\u2019 demands, it created no obligation in favor of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The order of the District Court is affirmed with costs</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
