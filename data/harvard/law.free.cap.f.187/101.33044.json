On said March 9, 1908, a lire occurred in the building on said premises, which, under the provisions of said lease, amounted to a total loss, so that the lease terminated, and the plaintiffs were entitled to the return of said deposit of $2,500, and also of a portion of the rent money which had been paid in advance. On March 25, 1908, after negotiations between the parties with respect to a new lease in case the defendant should rebuild, the defendant wrote the following letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney: \u201cI find that Messrs. Bamberger &amp; Lowenthal wrote you under date of March 20, 1908, that in ease I rebuild the property recently burned on Eighteenth street that I would give to Messrs. Haaren, Hencken and Addieg a new lease for 21 years on the same terms as the old lease, in the meantime the deposit held by me under the provisions of the old lease to remain in my hands as an earnest of this agreement.

After the execution of the agreement, the defendant discussed with the plaintiffs plans for rebuilding the building, and had several interviews with them upon the subject. On June 17, 1908, the defendant informed the plaintiffs that he intended to rebuild, and talked with them about looking over plans. The original plans for the new building were filed July 2, 1908, and the building was subsequently constructed. On July 7, 1908, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney wrote the defendant, closing negotiations, and demanding the return of the $2,500 deposit. On July 8, 1908 \u2014 but before the receipt of the letter from the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2014 the defendant wrote to the plaintiffs, insisting that they had agreed to a new lease, and also claiming to hold them upon the old lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">The verdict of the jury awarded the plaintiffs the balance of the rent paid in advance, which was not earned by reason of the fire \u2014 $165.59\u2014but rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 demand to recover the deposit of $2,500.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-6\">H.

'[1] The verdict of the jury established that the terms of the letter of March 25, 1908, were accepted and approved by the plaintiffs, and no contention is made that it was not binding because not signed by them. This letter, then, constituted an agreement between the parties, conditioned. only upon the rebuilding of the structure by the defendant, within a reasonable time. It bound the plaintiffs to take a lease of the new premises upon the terms of the prior lease, if the defendant rebuilt within such time. It bound the defendant, in case he rebuilt, to give the plaintiffs such a lease. It was, in our opinion, a conditional contract, the validity of which was not impaired by the fact that the fulfillment of the condition was dependent upon the act of one of the parties. Furthermore, we think that the agreement, by reference to the terms of the prior lease, was complete, that it possessed mutuality, and that it was upon a valid consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The jury, under the instructions of the court, necessarily found by their verdict, in addition to the fact that the agreement was entered into, that the defendant, within a reasonable time, decided to rebuild, and communicated his intention to the plaintiffs, before receiving notice of their attempted withdrawal, and that the plaintiffs repudiated such agreement, and, consequently, were fully warranted in finding the plaintiffs guilty of breach of contract. Had the proper measure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>damages been applied in the case, we should have no reason for disturbing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The agreement on the part of the plaintiffs was an agreement to take a lease, and the measure of damages in an action for the breach of such an agreement is the actual damage sustained \u2014 presumably the difference between the rent stipulated in the lease and the sum for which the premises were rented to other parties. But there was no evidence in this case to warrant the jury in finding the damages according to this measure, and the fact that the plaintiffs objected to the materiality of certain testimony tending to prove such damage did not preclude them from insisting that a verdict should be directed upon the ground of failure to prove any damage. Consequently, if the same measure of damages \u00edhe applicable in this case \u2014 both with respect to the defense and counterclaim \u2014 as in an action for a breach of an agreement to lease there was error in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is our opinion that the same measure of damages is applicable here \u2014 in both aspects of the case \u2014 as in an action for breach of contract, and that the defendant can retain only so much of the $2,500 deposited as is necessary to compensate him for the actual damages sustained. We think it the better view that the deposit in this case was not a deposit on account of the rent due under the new lease, nor a payment for the purchase of an option.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The money had been held under the old lease as security for damages. In case of tlie breach of any of the terms of such lease, the lessor was authorized to apply so much of said deposit as might \u201cbe necessary to liquidate the damage or damages arising therefrom.\u201d So that, when the ntuv agreement provided that the deposit under the old lease should remain as \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>earnest of this agreement,\u201d we think that it meant that it should be held by the defendant as security for any damage which he might sustain by reason of the breach of such agreement. This interpretation makes good to the defendant his actual loss. To give him more penalizes the plaintiffs, and a forfeiture either by way of the penalty or liquidated damages should only be inflicted when the language clearly requires it.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">For these reasons, we think that there was error in the action of the trial court, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\"> As this case relates to real estate in the state of New York, the following decisions by the courts of this state are. especially in point:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In Rosenfeld v. Silver, 49 Misc. Rep. 117, 96 N. Y. Supp. 1027, it was held: \"Where the receipt, given by defendant to plaintiff for a deposit at 1he time of making an agreement to lease, did not specify for what purpose it. was made, but, upon a fair interpretation, the deposit was to secure the execution of a lease by plaintiff, it is a security for the actual damage, if any, suffered by the defendant by reason of plaintiff's refusal to take the lease; and, where no such damage is pleaded or shown, plaintiff is entitled to a return of the deposit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In Weinberg v. Greenberger. 47 Misc. Rep. 117, 93 N. Y. Supp. 530, it was held: \u201c'Where the receipt, given by the defendants to plaintiff for the amount of a deposit, at the time of the making of an agreement to lease a tenement house, did not specify for what purpose it. was made, but upon the most favorable view for the defendants it. was to secure plaintiff's fulfillment of his agreement to take the lease, and not as a penalty or liquidated damages, defendants are not authorized to relain the deposit merely because of plaintiff's refusal to take the lease: and, no actual damage having been pleaded or shown. It would he assumed that none was suffered, and upon the facts the plaintiff is entitled io a return of the deposit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The case of Abramowitz v. Gray, 50 Misc. Rep. 638, 98 N. Y. Supp. 1096, referred to by the defendant, is not in point, because in that case the. money in question was not deposited at all as security, hut was paid on account of the purchase price of certain land. The same is true with respect to the cases of Havens v. Patterson. 43 N. Y. 218, and Lawrence v. Miller, 86 N. Y. 131. where vendees of land had made payments on account of the purchase price, and, although defaulting, sued to recover them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
