During the same December term he pleaded nolo contendere, was convicted and fined $200, paid the fine; and the money was transferred to the treasury. On April 5, 1909, the Supreme Court declared the harboring provision of the immigration act unconstitutional. Keller v. United States, 213 U. S. 138, 29 Sup. Ct. 470, 53 L. Ed. 737. .At the July, 1909, term of the District Court the following order was entered under the title of the aforesaid criminal cause: \u201cThis day comes the United States, by Edwin W. Sims, its attorney, and come also the defendants, by Benjamin C. Bachrach. their attorney, and this cause coming on to be heard on the motion of said defendants to vacate and set aside all proceedings herein, and for a restitution to said defendants of all the money received from them pursuant to said xirodeedings, and the court, having heard argument of counsel and after due consideration of said motion, finds that that xiortion [of the immigration act] upon which the indictment herein was based having been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, said indictment and all proceedings thereunder are a nullity and are entirely void and of no effect whatever. * * * It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and determined by the court that the indictment herein be and the same is hereby dismissed, and that all orders and proceedings herein, including said order of January 4, 1909, wherein said defendants were each fined $200, he and the same are hereby vacated, set aside, and held for naught. It is further ordered, adjudged, and determined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>court that said Rothstein is of right entitled to the restitution of said $200 by bim paid as a fine,\u201d and that said Rubin is entitled to like restitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">Restitution not having been made, Rothstein brought the present action against the government, under section 2 of-the act of March 3, 1887 (24 IStat. 505, c. 359 [1 IT. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 753]), to enforce his claim. His petition set out the foregoing facts, and was* based particularly on the above-recited order of July, 1909. The government\u2019s answer admitted that the history of the proceedings was correctly stated, but averred \u201cthat said order of July, 1909, was invalid and entirely void by reason of the fact that the term at which the judgments were entered had, prior to July, 1909, expired, and the said District Court was without authority or power to enter an order such as was ordered to be made in said cases vacating said judgment, sentence, and fine,\u201d and further alleged that the fines \u201cwere paid voluntarily .and without protest, and were not paid under duress or threat of any kind.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">The District Court found the facts in accordance with the petition, and rendered judgment in Rothstein\u2019s favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\">Edwin W.

Payment of the fine, even if the judgment of conviction was void, is not to be deemed a voluntary contribution to the government, and therefore is not a bar, if the recovery in other respects is sustainable. Durr v. Howard, 6 Ark. 461; Devlin v. U. S., 12 Ct. Cl. 266; Reinhard v. City of Columbus, 49 Ohio St. 257, 31 N. E. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Contentions for reversal may be summarized thus: The District Court was the organism provided by law and clothed with the duty of hearing the criminal charge against Rothstein. Section 563, Rev. St. (U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 455). When the parties appeared, the court had jurisdiction of them and of the subject-matter of the in-, dictment. Even on Rothstein\u2019s plea, \u201cI will not contest,\u201d the court\u2019s duty of administering justice required that the indictment should be dismissed if it was based on an unconstitutional statute, for the matter charged as a crime would be in truth no crime. Therefore the court\u2019s retention of the indictment, acceptance of the plea, and judgment of conviction necessarily constituted an adjudication of the statute\u2019s validity. That question was as much a part of the subject-matter in the Rothstein as in the Keller Case. Having jurisdiction of the pax-ties and of the subject-matter, the court had lawful power to render a judgment which would be equally binding whether questions of fact or of law were rightly or wrongly decided. An oversight or misconstruction of constitutional law is simply an error of law, for \u201cthe Constitution, the statutes, and the common law together make up the law of the land.\u201d Van Fleet\u2019s Collateral Attack, \u00a7 67. Rothstein\u2019s conviction, however erroneous, was not void, could not be questioned collaterally, was reviewable only on writ of error, became final in the District Court at the close of the December term, and, except for fraud, could not at a subsequent term be open\u00e9d for the correction of errors. Ex parte Reed, 100 U. S. 13, 25 L. Ed. <em>538; </em>Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 26 L. Ed. 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Rothstein\u2019s position is this: The conviction was a nullity. \u201cAn unconstitutional law is void, and is as no law. An offense created by it is not a crime. A conviction under it is not merely erroneous, but is illegal and void, and cannot be a legal cause of imprisonment.\u201d Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 373, 25 L. Ed. 717.; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 654, 4 Sup. Ct. 152, 28 L. Ed. 274; Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 6 Sup. Ct. 734, 29 L. Ed. 868. After the expiration of the term at which it is entered, a void\" judgment majr lawfully be canceled on motion and notice. Ex parte Crenshaw, 15 Pet. 119, 10 L. Ed. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">If Rothstein\u2019s contention as to the law determinative of the validity of the order of July, 1909, is correct, confessedly the judgment would have to be affirmed. If his argument is wrong, it is so because the government\u2019s insistence that the judgment of conviction was not open to a collateral attack is right. But this writ does not bring here the order of July, 1909, for review on assignments of error. It is addressed to a judgment of the District Court, sitting as a court of claims, wherein the court found that in and by the order of July, 1909, the District Court, sitting as a criminal court, had adjudged that Roth-stein\u2019s conviction was based on an unconstitutional statute, that the unconstitutional statute never was a law, that the conviction was a nullity, and that, therefore, it was within the power and duty of the criminal court to cancel the void judgment of conviction and order the restitution of the fine. It was on these facts that the District Court, as a court of claims, rendered the judgment now on review. This writ of error therefore involves a collateral attack upon the order of July, 1909. Eor the government to succeed, that order must be, not merely erroneous, but absolutely void. Now, if a conviction under an unconstitutional statute is a nullity, the court, on motion and notice and hearing, would have jurisdiction after the term to expunge the void judgment; and the order of expungement would not only be within the court\u2019s power, but would be errorless. Surely the government will not insist that the jurisdiction'of the District Court, as a criminal court, being the organism provided by law and clothed with the duty of hearing the parties\u2019 contentions respecting the disposition to be \"made of the motion, was dependent upon its giving an unquestionably correct decision; for, though there may be precedents for holding that an erroneous judgment on the constitutional law is not binding, all the authorities agree that a mistaken decision on the common law shall not be assailed collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
