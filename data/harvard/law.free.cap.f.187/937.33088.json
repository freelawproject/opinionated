After trial by the court (on waiver of a jury), judgment of nonsuit, dismissing the cause \u2018\u2018at the plaintiff\u2019s costs,\u201d was ultimately entered, and this writ of error is brought by the defendant for reversal thereof. Error is assigned: (1) Eor vacation therein of a judgment previously allowed in favor of the defendant, on a general finding of facts; and (2) for granting the nonsuit thereafter, 'on motion of plaintiff.

[1] The judgment, whereof reversal is sought on behalf of the defendant below, dismisses the suit, and thus may be reviewable for error well assigned. So the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss the writ of error, for want of jurisdiction, is overruled, and we proceed to consideration of the proposition of error relied upon for reversal \u2014 in substance, that the grant of a nonsuit, under the facts of record, was an unauthorized exercise of judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">The bill of exceptions does not preserve the testimony, nor circumstances in reference to the prior finding and judgment of the court (April 15th) in favor of the defendant, beyond these statements (in substance): That the plaintiff, introduced evidence and rested his case; that the defendant (under, leave of court) then \u201cfiled a notice of set-off, and moved for a finding in its favor (1) on the issues presented by the plaintiff and (2) on the issue of set-off\u201d; that the court sustained^ such motion as to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, but overruled the branch as to set-off, and thereupon \u201cmade and announced a general finding upon the facts in favor of the defendant, and rendered and announced judgment accordingly in favor of the defendant\u201d; that plaintiff then entered motion for a voluntary nonsuit; and that such motion was taken under advisement by the court, stay was granted, and the cause continued for disposition of the motion. Subsequently the plaintiff entered an alternative motion to have the judgment set aside and a new trial granted, but the request for a new trial was withdrawn at the hearing. On June 29th the hearing occurred, resulting in the rulings and judgment complained of, reciting (in substance) vacation of the \u201cjudgment\u201d of April 15th and granting a judgment of nonsuit and dismissal of the cause \u201cat the plaintiff\u2019s costs.\u201d Exceptions were entered on behalf of the defendant; and this writ is prosecuted therefrom, with no other matters preserved of record affecting the inquiry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Tlie plaintiff in error contends, as formulated in the argument of counsel, that the trial court erred: (1) In vacating the judgment and allowing the nonsuit, \u201cbecause the motion for a nonsuit was interposed too late\u201d; and (2) in allowing the nonsuit, after the filing of motion of set-off, without consent of the defendant, or \u201cgood cause shown\u201d therefor. We believe neither of these contentions to be tenable for reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">1. The first proposition appears to be twofold, resting on the theory that vacation of the prior ruling of the court is inhibited by the stah utory rule of Illinois, which is likewise relied upon for denial of power to' grant the nonsuit. The local statutes cited are two recent enactments (1907) governing the practice of the state courts in Illinois\u2014 one for the municipal court of Chicago (Hurd\u2019s R. S. 1909, \u00a7 293, c. 37) providing that \u201cevery person desirous of suffering a nonsuit on trial shall be barred therefrom unless he do .so before the jury retire from the bar, or before the court, in case the trial is by the court without a jury, states its finding,\u201d and the other, amending the practice act (Hurd\u2019s R. S. 1909, \u00a7 70, c. 110) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">\u25a0\u2018Every person desirous of suffering a nonsuit shall be barred therefrom, unless he do so before the jury retire from the bar, or if the case is tried before the court without a jury, before the case is submitted for final decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Whether either of these provisions, in reference to the practice in cases tried by the court without a jury, is applicable or controlling, in any sense or measure, in the federal court, is not involved for determination, as we believe, for the reason that the right of the trial court to set aside, vacate, or modify its earlier rulings and judgment in the cause, even at any time during the term, is inherent and unaffected by the provisions referred to, if otherwise applicable. This doctrine is settled beyond controversy throughout the federal jurisdiction (Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 167, 21 L. Ed. 872; Goddard v. Ordway, 101 U. S. 745, 752, 25 L. Ed. 1040; Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 415, 26 L. Ed. 797; Phillips v. Neglev. 117 U. S. 665, 672, 6 Sup. Ct. 901, 29 L. Ed. 1013); and it is needless to ascertain whether it prevails as well in all state courts of record. So vacation of the ruling made at the close of the trial was clearly within the judicial discretion of the court; and no doubt is entertainable that the ruling of June 29th, upon hearing of the several motions, was thus not only intended, but operative, to vacate the proceeding which was entitled and mentioned as \u201cjudgment,\u201d and embraced (in terms) the only finding entered in the cause. The effect thereof was to leave no finding or judgment standing in the way of the motion for a nonsuit, and the allowance accordingly, is both presumptively well founded and free from conflict in fact with either rule (statutory or common law) invoked for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> 2. The alleged error for want of \u201cgood cause shown\u201d for granting the nonsuit, after the motion of set-off was filed, is without force, if the contentions on behalf of the plaintiff in error as to the rule applicable under such notice were assumed to be tenable. Not only does it appear of record that the court had previously overruled the set-off, but none of the facts are preserved, either in reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the merits of one or the oth\u00e9r controversy, or of circumstances before the court supporting the motions. If the ruling requires such support, therefore, the judgment is presumptive of \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d and stands unimpeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The judgment of the Circuit Court, accordingly, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
