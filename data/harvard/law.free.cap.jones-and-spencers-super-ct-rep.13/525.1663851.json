Tort being the - whole groundwork of the .action, it is settled that the defendant has a constitutional right of trial by jury, of which neither the court \u25a0nor any statute can deprive him, and that it is no \u25a0answer to his claim of. such a trial to say that the plaintiff may fall back upon an implied promise (Townsend <em>v. </em>Hendricks, 40 <em>How. Pr. </em>143, reversing S. C., 32 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>[2 Sweeny] 503).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The same right exists in an action to recover unliquidated damages for the breach of a contract (Ross <em>v. </em>Combes, 37 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>[5 <em>J. &amp; </em>S.] 289).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The character of the action is determined by the .complaint, and it is only when the complaint sets forth \u25a0an action on contract which is shown to involve the .examination of a long account, that the defendant cannot defeat a reference by a tender of an issue of fraud -in the transaction, and claiming damages by way of recoupment or counter-claim (Welsh v. Darragh, 52 <em>N. Y. </em>590; Patterson v. Stettauer, 39 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>[7 <em>J. &amp; </em>S.] 413).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The order should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Curtis, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
