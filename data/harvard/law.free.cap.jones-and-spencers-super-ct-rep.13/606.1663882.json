Strictly speaking, under the treaty of Washington, this was a claim of the British Government against the United States, and defendant\u2019s claim was against his own government. But, in common parlance, the claims which, under that treaty, were presented to the commisssion for property destroyed, were known and spoken of as the claims of the individual owners of the property. Plaintiffs were employed by defendant to prosecute this claim, under a written agreement showing they were to be paid one-quarter of the amount which should be allowed in respect of the claim, and were given a lien therefor on said claim, and any draft, money, or evidence of debt which should be paid or issued thereon. The services were rendered by plaintiff, a.s agreed on, and an award was made in respect of the claim of $197,100, in gold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-9\">After the allowance of the award, Mr. McDonald, in order to defraud the plaintiffs, made an assignment of it to one William White.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-10\">The plaintiffs then, on October 2,1874, began a suit against McDonald and White in the supreme court, of the District of Columbia, to set aside such fraudulent assignment, to have their lien adjudged valid, and to enforce payment of their claim from the award. McDonald and White were personally served, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>pea,red and submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, and an injunction was issued restraining either of them from collecting the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">About the same time, one Thomas J. Phelps, claiming the award as assignee in bankruptcy of McDonald, also began an action in the same court against him and White, in which action another injunction was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">February 16, 1875, an order was entered by the consent of all the parties to both suits, vacating both injunctions, permitting White to collect half the award from the British Government, and directing George W. Riggs, of Washington, to collect the other half, and hold it, subject to the claims, liens and rights of the plaintiffs herein, Hovey and Dole, and of the assignee, Phelps, to be determined by the further decree of the court. It was further ordered that Riggs, the receiver, should invest the money in the bonds in the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-7\">Riggs drew the money, and invested it in bonds of the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-8\">McDonald and White demurred to the plaintiff\u2019s bill in equity ; the court at special term {sustained the demurrer, dismissed their bill, and, on June 28, 1875, made an order directing the receiver to pay over the funds in his hands to McDonald and White. Upon receiving this order, the receiver handed the bonds over to McDonald, assigning the certificates to him. McDonald then requested the receiver to sell the bonds for him. This was done. He received the money, and, leaving Washington hurriedly, secretly, and by unusual conveyance, took it to New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-9\">The plaintiffs appealed to the general term from the order sustaining the demurrer to their bill, and there it was reversed, and an order1 was made directing McDonald to repay the money into the registry of the court, which he refused to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>McDonald and White then interposed an answer, and a large amount of testimony was taken upon the merits. Meantime the plaintiffs applied to the courts to have McDonald punished for contempt, and finally, the general term, having ordered his answer to be struck out for his contempt in April, 1878, gave final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-5\">This judgment, after reciting the inception of the lien, the fraudulent assignment to White, &amp;c., directed McDonald and White to pay to the plaintiffs $49,297.50, and further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the complaint have a lien upon the claim of McDonald, and upon any draft, money evidence of indebtedness or proceeds thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">Upon this state of facts, McDonald being found in New York, this action was begun. The plaintiffs claim that when the receiver invested this money in the bonds of the District of Columbia, their liens attached to them at once, and that, when McDonald sold these bonds and appropriated their proceeds to his own use (no matter how they came into his possession), he was guilty of conversion, and is now guilty of a wrongful detention of personal property, namely, $49,297.50, belonging to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-7\">Defendant, having been arrested upon an order of arrest, moved at special term to vacate the order, the motion was denied, and defendant appealed from the order entered on such denial, to the general term of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-8\"><em>C. W. </em>Bangs, attorney, and of counsel, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah9\">submitted an elaborate brief, and, among other things, urged strenuously that defendant, having obtained possession under the order of the supreme court of the District of Columbia, had rightfully obtained possession, and had full right to make any subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>disposition or appropriation. that he pleased, without incurring thereby any liability to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-5\"><em>Douglas </em>Campbell, attorney, and of counsel, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b644-6\">Speir, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">wrote for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
