The reasoning that forbade an order of arrest in the case of Lambert v. Snow (17 <em>How. Pr. </em>518), and Madge v. Percy, court of appeals, Dec. 11, 1875 (5 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>593), in which the order was denied because two causes of action were united, ought to apply with equal force when numerous reliefs are asked for, as in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">III. The defendants, Clews and Fowler, are discharged from the debt against them, described in the affidavit on which the order of arrest was granted, and the other proofs used to sustain it in the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">IV. The debt is not one that comes within section 5117 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, providing that \u201cno debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation .as a public officer, or while acting in any fiduciary character, shall be discharged by proceedings in bankruptcy ; but the debt may be proved, and the dividend thereon shall be a payment on account of such debt \u2019 \u2019 (Cronan v. Cotting, 104 <em>Mass. </em>245, and cases cited in the opinion of the court; Owsley v. Cobin, U. S. circuit court, South Carolina, 15 <em>N. B. R. </em>489\u2014Opinion by Waite, Ch. J.; Woolsey v. Cade, 15 <em>N. B. R. </em>238, supreme court, Alabama; Grover v. Clinton, U. S. circuit court, Wisconsin, 8 <em>N. B. R. </em>312\u2014Opinion by Hopkins, J., concurred in by Davis, J.; Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 <em>How., </em>U. S. supreme court, 208; Neill v. Scruggs, 17 <em>N. B. R. </em>102, U. S. supreme court; <em>In re </em>Smith, 18 <em>Id. </em>24, U. S. D. C., S. D. N. Y.\u2014Opinion by Choate, J.). (a) The nature of the claim against the defendants Clews and Fowler is identical with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in Cronan v. Cotting (104 <em>Mass. </em>245). In that case the action was brought to recover for money received by the defendant to the plaintiffs\u2019 use. It was referred to an auditor, whose report showed that the defendant was administratrix of the estate of her husband, between whom, at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>decease, and the plaintiff, there were unsettled accounts ; and the plaintiff sent to the defendant certain acceptances, with directions to apply the proceeds thereof, or such part as should be needful for the purpose, to pay whatever balance was actually due from him to the estate of the intestate. The defendant collected on account of the acceptances, and applied so much of the proceeds as was necessary to pay a balance, which she claimed was due to the estate. But the auditor found that the amount thus applied exceeded, by $3,922.25, the balance actually due. After the judgment in the court below the defendant obtained a discharge in bankruptcy, which was pleaded in bar to said judgment. The plaintiff claimed, at the hearing before the court, that the relation between the plaintiff and defendant was that of a pledgor and pledgee, and that such being the relation, the debt sought to b\u00e9 recovered was created by the defendant while acting in a fiduciary character, and thus within the terms of said bankruptcy statute. The court held that the trust in that case did not constitute a fiduciary relation, and that the debt in that case was simply a debt by contract, and that the defendant sustained no fiduciary character to the plaintiff while acting, in which said debt was created. These defendants claim that the debt in the case at bar, likewise, is simply a debt by contract. In both this and the Massachusetts case, the defendants stood in the relation of pledgees, and in each case, by implication of law they were liable to the plaintiffs, to return to them or account for the pledged property, if any, there should be remaining after the debt or liability was extinguished for or on account of which said property was pledged. In each case the debt arose out of an implied contract. And it is claimed that the defendants, Clews and Fowler, sustained no fiduciary character towards the plaintiffs while acting, in which this debt was created. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>And it is claimed that the remarks of the supreme court of Massachusetts on this point are equally pertinent to the case at bar. Another ground of the decision in the Massachusetts case, was that the debt in that case was excluded from the class of fiduciary debts referred to in the statute, in consequence of the construction given by the United States supreme court in Chapman <em>v. </em>Forsythe (2 <em>How. </em>202), to the phrase \u201c while acting in any fiduciary capacity,\u201d which phrase the court considers the same as, \u201c while acting in any fiduciary character.\u201d By the construction referred to, given by the United States supreme court, the phrase in question embraced cases of special, express or technical trusts of the same class as those enumerated in the bankruptcy statutes of 1841, viz.: ' \u201cThe defalcation of a \u2018 public officer,\u2019 \u201d \u201c executor,\u201d \u201cadministrator,\u201d \u201cguardian\u201d or \u201ctrustee,\u201d and did not embrace implied contracts or those which the law implies from contract. The Massachusetts case decides the question, it would seem, upon what the court in Woolsey <em>v. </em>Cade, above cited, calls a \u201cbroader ground,\u201d and stated in Chapman <em>v. </em>Fersythe in these words, \u201cif the act embraces such a debt it will be difficult to limit its application. It must include all debts arising from agencies, and indeed all cases where the law implies an obligation from the trust reposed in the debtor. Such a construction would have left but a few debts on which the law could operate . . but this is not the relation spoken of in the first section of the act.\u201d The other cases cited are to the same general tenor as the Massachusetts case, and the true construction of said section of the bankruptcy statutes should be deemed settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">V. The construction Of the bankrupt law (\u00a7 5117, <em>supra), </em>must be the same in every State, without regard to the local law of the several States (Grover v. Clinton, <em>8 N. B. R. </em>489, by Judge Hopkins, coincided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>by Justice Davis of the supreme court of the United States; Woolsey <em>v. </em>Cade, 15 <em>Id. </em>239; Owsley <em>v. </em>Cobin, 15 <em>Id. </em>489, decision by Chief Justice Waite, where, in the learned judge\u2019s opinion, he adopts, in so many words, the reasoning and conclusions of these decisions).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-5\"><em>C. Bainbridge </em>Smith, attorney, and of counsel for respondents, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXU\">I. The cause of action against the defendants is to recover of them damages for the unlawful conversion of the plaintiffs\u2019 bonds <em>(Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 549, subd. 2; <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 550, subd. 3).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">II. It is now well settled that where the right to an arrest is identical with the cause of action itself, the court will not try the merits upon affidavits, unless the defendant makes out clearly such a case as would entitle him to a nonsuit or a direction of a verdict in his behalf (Royal Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Noble, 5 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>54, 56, and cases cited; Merritt <em>v. </em>Hecksher, 50 <em>Barb. </em>451; Faris <em>v. </em>Peck, 40 <em>How. Pr. </em>484).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">III. So it is equally well settled that an arrest is not barred when a cause of action exists, on the ground that the plaintiff has accepted notes therefor (Shipman <em>v. </em>Shafer, 14 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>447; Pettengill <em>v. </em>Mather, 12 <em>Id. </em>436; Murphy <em>v. </em>Fernandez, 10 <em>Bosw. </em>665; Harding <em>v. </em>Shannon, 20 <em>How. Pr. </em>25).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b147-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A3j\">The finding upon the facts cannot be disturbed. Nor was the obligation on which the order of arrest was made, discharged by operation of the bankrupt act. There appeared on the argument to be a serious objection to granting an order of arrest in an action for an equitable cause. It was, however, answered, that the action, by the interlocutory judgment, had been turned \"into a pure action at law. This seems to be sufficient, especially since no reversal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that interlocutory judgment can take place, the judgment having been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs, and disbursements to be taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
