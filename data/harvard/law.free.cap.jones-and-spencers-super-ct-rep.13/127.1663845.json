H. Vernon, </em>for appellant, among other things urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqa\">In every application for an order for the examination of an adversary before trial, the statutory conditions must be strictly complied with, and in case an order should be inadvertently made, without such compliance on the part of the applicant, it should be vacated even without regard to the merits of the application. Section 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires \u20181 the person desiring to take a deposition,\u201d to present an <em>affidavit </em>setting forth among other things as follows: \u201c4. . . . that the testimony of such person is material and necessary for the party making such application, or the prosecution or defense of such action,\u201d but the affidavit of W. I. Butler, Esq., the attorney for the plaintiff herein, upon which the order in question was granted, fails to comply with this requirement. It only alleges that the testimony and examination of the defendants \u201care material and necessary to the plaintiff to enable him to prepare for the trial of, and to safely try this action, and to obtain justice between the said parties,\u201d and such an allegation is not sufficient (Beach <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 4 <em>Abb. New Cas. </em>236-240, supreme ct., gen. term reversing, 3 <em>Id. </em>113). In this case, Davis, P. J., says: \u201cAn affidavit to obtain an order for an examination before trial, must comply with the statute and state the particulars required. The order should not be granted when sought for, mainly <em>not as a deposition to be used on the trial, but as a means of ascertaining information to enable the applicant to loolc up other witnesses.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>W.

They disclosed no purpose of using his testimony upon the trial, and this, I think, should clearly appear in every like case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The affidavits say that the plaintiff cannot safely proceed to trial, cannot properly prepare for trial without defendant\u2019s deposition, that the testimony is material and necessary to the plaintiff to enable him to prepare for the trial of, and to safely try this action ; but they nowhere show an intention to use the deposition on the trial. The intention not to use it, then, is implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">For this reason, the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs, and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Van Vorst, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
