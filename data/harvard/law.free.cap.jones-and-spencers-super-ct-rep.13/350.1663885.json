BROWN, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-5\">Principal and broker.\u2014Exceptions to evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-6\">In this case there was a contest over the allowance of a commission to the plaintiff on the purchase and sale of 100,000 pounds of copper, a portion of the gross amount of the sales, which portion defendant claimed was purchased by plaintiff on his own account, and for the purpose of enabling him to procure a sale for 550,000 pounds, a larger amount by 100,000 pounds than defendant had furnished the plaintiff to sell. The exceptions to the evidence in the case relate to this 100,000 pounds of copper. A letter of plaintiff had been read in evidence on the part of defendant, in which plaintiff wrote: \u201c N. S. S. has secured for me 100 M. lbs. of Lake Ingot Copper for July and August delivery. ... I herewith transfer above interest to you.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the plaintiff, while testifying, \u201cWhat did you mean, when you wrote the letter, by the words \u2018 for me This question was objected to, and objection overruled, and exception taken; and plaintiff\u2019s answer was, that he \u201c must have meant\u2014as I had asked Simpkins to sell this copper as a personal favor to me, he put it down in my name; or it must have been in accordance with my way of saying.11 have bought or sold \u2019 when I meant my principal.\u201d Another question in like manner allowed, was: \u201cDid you desire, when you wrote that letter, to inform defendant of anything more than the fact that you had secured of Simpkins 100,000 pounds of copper for his account.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-7\">These exceptions were overruled, the court holding, 1st. The rule to be applied is not the one that relates to the words of a contract; the words \u201cfor me \u201d were not \u00e1 part of the contract, but were in the nature of an admission from the plaintiff, tending to show that he bought this copper on his own account, and he bad a right, to prove what he meant to state or show in the use of the words \u201cfor me,\u201din the letter. 3d. Defendant had examined plaintiff on this subject, in such a way as to entitle him to the questions objected to, in explanation of the facts, and his admissions in the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-8\">The above questions and answers made a fuller statement or explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tion in regard to the matters, part of which defendant had already obtained on the direct examination.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-5\">For the latter reason, the exceptions of defendant to the introduction, by plaintiff, of two entries in his own book of sales, cannot be sustained. The defendant had introduced the first of the entries at an earlier time in the trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-6\">There was a conflict, as to whether the plaintiff had agreed to act for one-half of the usual commission, and defendant had testified that plaintiff\u2019s agreement in this regard had followed his (defendant\u2019s) statement that one Houston had offered to sell this copper for half brokerage, and if plaintiff wanted to do it at that rate, he might do so. As to this, plaintiff testified that he tjien said, \u201c You don\u2019t expect me to do the five hundred and fifty thousand business at one quarter per cent. ?\u201d to which defendant answered, \u201c Certainly not; you shall have one-half per cent.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-7\">The plaintiff asked Houston, when called as a witness, if he had ever offered to sell copper for the defendant at less than usual commissions, within the year 1873, before April 1. Defendant\u2019s exception to the allowance of this question was properly overruled, for the reason that the testimony of Houston on this point would support the testimony of either the plaintiff or defendant, in regard to this contract.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b385-8\">Before Sedgwick, Speir, and Freedman, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b385-9\"><em>Decided November </em>3, 1879.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-10\">Appeal by defendant from judgment, entered on report of referee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-11\"><em>Chandler &amp; Smith </em>and <em>James E. </em>Chandler, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-12\"><em>Erastus </em>New, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-13\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfK\">The action was for the value of plaintiff\u2019s services, as defendant\u2019s broker, in selling copper. It was admitted that some amount was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">The first position that calls for attention is, that the referee erred in allowing a commission upon a .quantity of one hundred thousand pounds of copper, parcel of the gross amount, because, although plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>sold that copper for defendant, and as his broker, yet, as is alleged, the evidence shows, in substance, that the defendant bought and sold the one hundred thousand pounds of copper, for the sole purpose of aiding the plaintiff in selling the rest of the copper, and altogether for plaintiff\u2019s benefi t. The position cannot be sustained. The evidence allowed the referee to find, that the plaintiff\u2019s acts in respect of the parcel was for the interest of the defendant and at his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">There were exceptions that relate to the purchase of the parcel of one hundred thousand pounds. The plaintiff had proposed to defendant to sell for him a quantity of five hundred and fifty thousand pounds of copper, for which, but not for a less amount, he was able to find a buyer. The defendant with others, at a certain time, could command only four hundred and fifty thousand pounds. For the purpose of making up the necessary quantity, the plaintiff bought the one hundred thousand pounds. On the trial the plaintiff alleged that he bought it for the defendant, and on his account, while the defendant alleged that the plaintiff bought it for himself, and transferred it to defendant for the purpose of enabling himself to earn commissions in selling the whole lot. A letter signed by the plaintiff was introduced, notifying.defendant that \u201c 1ST. S. S. has secured for me 100. M lbs. of Lake Ingot Copper for July and August delivery ... I herewith transfer above interest to you.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked plaintiff, while testifying, \u201c What did you mean, when you wrote the letter, by the words \u2018for me\u2019 <em>V\u2019 </em>This was allowed, under exception, and the answer was that he \u201cmust have meant\u2014as I had asked Simpkins to sell this copper as a personal favor to me, he put it down in my name ; or it must have been in accordance with my way of saying \u2018I have bought or sold,\u2019 when I meant my principal.\u201d Another question was, \u201cDid you desire, when you wrote that letter, to inform de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>fendant of anything more than the fact that you had secured of Simpkins one hundred thousand for his account ? \u201d It is argued that the witness had no right to give his undisclosed intentions, or to construe the words which had a definite meaning. The rule to be applied is not the one that relates to the words of a contract, made between the parties. The words \u201c for me \u201d were not part of the contract. They were in the nature of an admission, from which it might be argued that the plaintiff dealt in his own behalf with Simpkins. .He would therefore have a right, not only to give the facts, and to testify in substance that he meant by those words to describe that fact, or he might prove what meaning he thought at the time the words bore, or again, what his purpose at the time was ; all these things were relevant to the question of what did the use of the words show, that he knew or believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">But beyond this, I think that defendant had before examined the plaintiff on the subject, in such a way as to entitle the plaintiff to the questions objected to. When the defendant offered the letter, he put questions to the plaintiff, which drew out the following: \u201cI had bought from Simpkins. It is is not uncommon for a broker to have copper bought by him charged in his own name : that may have been the case in the transaction1 mentioned in said letter, and explains the statement therein about my making the transfer ; such buying or selling in one\u2019s own name is, if buyer or seller does not want to be known in the market; it is usual to say that the sale is on account of the principal and not in the broker\u2019s name when parties don\u2019t want their name to appear.\u201d I think this course of examination gave the plaintiff the right to ask the questions objected to. They made a fuller explanation, part of which the defendant had obtained. On the ground last stated, the exceptions to the introduction by plaintiff of two entries in his own book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of sales, cannot be sustained. As to the first entry, the defendant had himself introduced it at an earlier time. The second entry was \u201cApril 1, N. S. Simpkins, W. H. Brown, 100,000 Lake, July, Aug., 33 cts.\u201d The defendant had drawn from a bookkeeper of plaintiff, that the page containing the above entries was in the witness\u2019s writing, and that on April 1 the plaintiff bought 300,000 pounds from Simpkins; and then gave in evidence, as is to be inferred from the printed case (although the words are \u201cthat he proposes to offer in evidence\u201d), the first entry above alluded to, and the entry \u201cApril 1, IN\". S. Simpkins, Jr., to Mr. Hendrichs, 200,000 Lake, June, July and August,\u201d and stopped there. An argument might have been made, that there was no entry of the purchase of the one hundred thousand for the defendant. I think the plaintiff had the right to meet this by showing the entry of that purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">There was a conflict as to whether the plaintiff agreed to act for one-half of the usual brokerage. The defendant, in giving testimony that he did so agree, testified that his agreement followed a statement by the defendant that another broker named Houston wanted to sell the copper for half brokerage, and if plaintiff wanted to do it for half 'brokerage, he could do so. The plaintiff had testified that the defendant had said to him jokingly, \u201cThisother broker, Mr. Houston, has offered to do this business of one hundred thousand at one quarter per cent. ;\u201d that witness then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to do the five hundred and fifty thousand business for one quarter per cent. ?\u201d and the defendant said, \u201c Certainly not, you shall have one-half per cent.\u201d The plaintiff, after defendant\u2019s testimony, asked of Houston, the other broker, when called as a witness, if he ever offered to the defendant to sell copper at less than the usual commission within the year 1872, before April 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The defendant\u2019s exception to the allowance of this question is not sound. For if, on the one hand, he really had Houston to fall back on, he would have a motive to insist on plaiutiff\u2019s lessening the commissions ; on the other hand, if Houston had not made the offer, he would be more likely to accede to plaintiff\u2019s terms, according to plaintiff\u2019s version.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The other exceptions have been examined, but are not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Speir and Freedman, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
