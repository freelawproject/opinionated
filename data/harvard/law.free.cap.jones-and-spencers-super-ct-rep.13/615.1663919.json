Melville in proceedings supplementary to execution issued on a judgment recovered by the First National Bank of Saugerties against said James M. Melville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-7\">The action was brought to set aside a deed made by said James M. Melville and wife to Edward Wright, of premises 307 West Twenty-second street, as fraudulent and void as against creditors. This deed was made in payment for advances therefor made by Wright to James M. Melville, and for a small amount of costs paid at the time of the conveyance. No other conveyance was sought to be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-8\">Plaintiff claimed that the money out of which the advances were made was the money of James M. Melville himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-9\">The judge at special term dismissed the complaint on the merits, with costs, holding, among other things, that, under the complaint and the evidence applicable to the issues joined by the pleadings, the money could not be regarded as that of James M. Melville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-10\">The original source of the money, and the mode in which it came to the hands of the defendant, Wright, appear in the. opinion of the judge before, whom the cause was tried at special term, which opinion was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-11\">\u201cSedgwick, J.\u2014It appears that the advances made by Wright to Melville, Maginley &amp; Cooke, on Melville\u2019s credit, were from sums deposited to Wright\u2019s credit with Duncan, Sherman &amp; Co. These funds were principally made up of a sum of $9,750, the proceeds of a check to Mrs. Melville\u2019s order,, paid as a consideration of the sale of the Orange Lake Hotel property, stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ing in the name of Mrs. Melville, and the conveyance of this to Mrs. Melville was a part of the consideration paid to her for her conveyance of No. 37 West Twenty-eighth street-. This last property had been conveyed to her by her husband through a third person, December 16, 1873. This action did not comprehend the setting aside of these conveyances to Mrs. Melville as fraudulent. Nor are there any facts in evidence which would justify these being declared fraudulent as against the creditor whom the plaintiff represents. It did not appear that, at the time of the conveyance, December 16, 1873, the defendant, Melville, meant to defraud his future creditors, still less the creditor particularly represented here. But the conclusive consideration is that these conveyances are subsisting and valid, until competently they are adjudged fraudulent, and that they cannot be adjudged fraudulent- upon an examination of them as matters of evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-5\">\u201cThe deposit of Mrs. Melville\u2019s check in Wright\u2019s bank account- made the money Wright\u2019s, and left her a creditor of Wright. There was no proof that she had ever given this money to her husband. The general evidence given by Mrs. Melville, as a witness for plaintiff, viz.: \u2014that she gave to her husband her money whenever he requested it,\u2014does not justify the conclusion that she had given this $9,750 to Melville, so that the advances by Wright were made out of Melville\u2019s money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-6\">\u201cIt cannot be said that the relations between the parties and their transactions that regarded the disposition of Melville\u2019s earnings do not present considerations in favor of plaintiff ; and upon these considerations the counsel for plaintiff has made an exhaustive and very able argument, but the conclusion must be that they do not amount to proof. And it- is further right to say that defendant claimed that the transaction alluded to did not call for explanation on the common issue in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201cIf the money did not belong to Melville, it does not change the legal effect of the action that Mrs. Melville was a creditor of Wright.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\">\u201cThe complaint is dismissed with costs, but no allowance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-6\">From the judgment of dismissal on the merits, with costs, entered upon the findings of facts and law made by the court below, plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b652-7\"><em>Coleridge A. </em>Hart, attorney, and <em>Horace C.
