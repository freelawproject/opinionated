The case falls within the principle on which courts of equity are accustomed to relieve a judgment creditor against impediments fraudulently or inequitably interposed against his legal remedy. No error appears to have been committed in \u201cthe reception of evidence. The only error which appears, is the conclusion under which a personal judgment is directed against both defendants, not only for the costs of the action, but for plaintiffs\u2019 entire claim with interest and costs, and the incorporation of a provision to this effect, in the direction for the entry of judgment, and in the judgment as entered. The plaintiffs cannot have, in addition to the equitable relief awarded to them, and the direction to the sheriff to apply the moneys in his hands to the satisfaction of their just claim, with interest and costs,\u2014a personal judgment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>defendants, enforceable by execution against, them beyond the costs of the action. They already have judgment in the marine court against Maguire, which ig the foundation of the present action!</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Another well founded suggestion is that the judgment appealed from should, in form, provide that the judgment and execution in the marine court action of Maguire <em>v. </em>Maguire be vacated and set aside as against the plaintiffs only.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">But the error and suggestion referred to do not call for a reversal, but only a modification of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The judgment should be modified in accordance with the views above expressed, and, as thus modified, affirmed without costs to either side on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Curtis, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Note.\u2014The following case reported under the same head notes, \u2014Reporters.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
