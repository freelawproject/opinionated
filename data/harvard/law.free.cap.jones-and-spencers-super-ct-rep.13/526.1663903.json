In thus prescribing and enumerating certain specific conditions upon which the judgment is to stand, the court of appeals did not include that the plaintiffs should waive the costs of the appeal to the general term. It certainly could have done so ; but as it did not see fit to do so, it is not for this court to change the conditions upon which the plaintiffs may elect to end the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
