The referee apparently reconciles it by saying that defendant contributed certain \u201c assets,\u201d whose nominal value was $16,169.36; that his representations in regard to them were \u201cwithout consideration,\u201d the mere expression of his \u201copinion,\u201d and that plaintiffs took them, as it were, for better or worse. But he also finds that plaintiffs entered into the co-partnership, and put in their money \u201cbelieving\u201d in his representations ; also, that the defendant himself recognized their binding force upon him at the dissolution of the partnership, by agreeing that the great uncollected and worthless majority of them be charged back to his personal account; that they actually were so charged back. And yet he says all this must go for nothing, and defendant must be credited as if he had actually contributed and lost $16,169.36. The proposition is too absurd for serious refutation. The referee himself repudiates it when called upon to divide the \u201cremaining assets,\u201d and apportions the major part of them to the plaintiffs; whereas, to be consistent, he should have awarded the greater sum to the defendant, in the ratio of $16,169.36 to $11,848.20. The pittance in the hands of the receiver is again divided in the same way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">IV. The articles provide that plaintiffs and defendant shall share equally the losses. How, what are the losses of this firm ? Clearly, it cannot have lost what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>it never had. Those uncollected accounts of the old firm of Dunn &amp; Anderson were, and still remain, mere claims, choses in action\u2014blank paper. Defendant, when he transferred them to the books of the new firm, agreed to take them baqk if not collected, and he took them back. The new firm never had the money represented by them. It never \u201clost\u201d that money. It was not sunk in any business or venture of the firm. Whether there was \u201cconsideration\u201d or not for defendant\u2019s agreement that his worthless contribution to the capital stock of the firm be charged back to him, that it was so charged back is an accomplished fact on the. referee\u2019s findings. To the extent to which he took back his contribution, he withdrew his capital, and the capital so withdrawn by the consent of all the partners cannot be deemed a \u201closs \u201d incurred in the business of the firm. The firm simply did not acquire that money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\">V.

B. </em>Bunnell, attorney, and of counsel, for respondent, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1l\">I. The theory adopted by the referee was correct. There can be no pretense that the articles of agreement do not express the intention of the parties. Representations made before they were executed cannot avail to change the agreement,' nor could subsequent acts, unless acquiesced in sufficiently long to amount to an intention to change its terms. \u201cA written agreement cannot be enlarged or altered in its operation, by evidence of other prior oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>agreements, in consummation of which the written agreement is alleged to be erroneously or deficiently executed\u201d (Peet <em>v. </em>Cowenhoven, 14 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>56). \u201c When the terms of an instrument are plain and unambiguous, the intention of the parties is to be learned therefrom'\u201d (Westcott <em>v. </em>Thompson, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>363). \u201c The rights of the parties must in general be determined by the language of the contract\u201d (Newton <em>v. </em>Woodruff, 2 <em>N. Y. </em>153). \u201cThe intention of the parties is to ascertained, except in cases of latent ambiguity, by a development of the circumstances under which the instrument was made\u201d (Reynolds <em>v. </em>Commercial Fire Ins. Co., <em>47 N. Y. </em>597). The referee had the parties before him, heard all the circumstances in detail under which the agreement was executed, and has found, as matter of fact, that the agreement clearly expresses the intention of the parties. The appellants concede that the referee found correctly as to the facts. So far as the written contract is clear, either in particular words or upon a consideration of its legal effect, no evidence extrinsic of the writing, can be received to contradict or explain its meaning (1 <em>Cow. &amp; H. Notes to Phill. on Ev. </em>468, 470). Evidence of declarations made at the time of executing an instrument to show that the instrument was executed upon a condition not expressed therein, is incompetent (Van Bocklin <em>v. </em>Tyler, 62 <em>N. Y. </em>105). Representations made before the agreement was made are immaterial <em>(lb.). </em>The referee was therefore right in disregarding testimony tending to show that the parties contemplated something not expressed in the agreement. In respect to the representations made after the agreement was -executed, there are still weightier reasons for disregarding them. Anderson\u2019s verbal agreement to assume the payment of the uncollected accounts, and allow them to be charged to his private account, could' not avail to alter or change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>articles of copartnership or the relation of the parties to each other, for ; 1. It was .not in writing. <em>2. </em>After the old assets of Dunn &amp; Anderson had become part and parcel of the capital of James Anderson &amp; Co., they did not belong to Anderson, but to his firm, and such an agreement would be, in effect, an undertaking to pay the debt of a third person, and hence void under the statue of frauds. 3. It was without consideration. The mistake under which the learned counsel for the plaintiffs has all the while labored, is in assuming that Anderson\u2019s capital was represented by dollars and cents instead of property. It was not cash, and never so considered. It was to the capital stock what any other property would have been which belonged to the firm, but was lost or destroyed by fire, or had otherwise become inconvertible into cash. As it was, he contributed it as his share of the capital stock. It was not his fault that so small an amount was realized there from. The loss, from whatever cause, was a firm loss, and must be treated as such. Now the articles of agreement provide, that after payment of the debts the assets remaining shall be divided\u2014one-half to the defendant, and one-half to the plaintiffs, reference being had to the capital actually contributed. We have then, as found by the referee, the following data from which to determine what each partner shall receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">1.

In order to get the assets actually on hand, the overdrafts of the plaintiffs, which were given to Anderson to make his drafts equal to the plaintiffs\u2019, are taken out, to wit, $203.05.

The defendant was bound to put in \u201call the assets of the firm of Dunn &amp; Anderson represented on the books of said firm, as bills due, \u00f3r to become due, except the sum of $1,500.\u201d Assuming that the defendant was not bound to make the real value of these assets equal to their nominal value, the agreement, after providing that profits and losses were to be shared and borne equally, has the reasonable and equitable provision that at the \u201cend, or other sooner termination-of their copartnership,\u201d the copartners will make a final account, and all and every the stock, and stocks, as well as the gains and increase thereof, which shall appear to be remaining, either in money, &amp;c., debts or otherwise, shall be divided between. them, to each his proper and respective proportion, reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>being had to the capital stock put in and invested by the respective parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It is seen, at once, that Anderson, not having invested as much as the Schultes, inasmuch as his contribution proved to be of the value of only $3,876.65, while they had contributed $11,848.90, it was their right and interest to have the accounting include, as assets, all that had been drawn out for the personal use of the partners above what they were entitled to draw out. What was properly drawn out was to be equally shared by the parties, while, if what was improperly drawn out was returned, as it should be, to the firm, the plaintiffs would be interested in it, to a far greater extent than the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The referee proceeded upon the position that the respective proportions of interest in the assets at dissolution, were represented by $11,848.20, the cash put in by plaintiff, and $3,876.75, the cash value of the assets put in by the defendants. I think this was erroneous in making the proportion of the plaintiff too small. For, the assets were increased by charging the plaintiffs with the amount of their capital which they liad failed to contribute as they agreed. That is, the assets were supposed to include this amount, viz. : $2,151.80. It was in effect proposed to consider it as cash. If the plaintiffs had to bear this burden, they could not be deprived of the advantage of its being part of capital contributed by them. And then, the proportion would be as $14,000 is to $3,876.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Again, I think there was a mistake in the mode of ascertaining the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In the course of the business, as is stated above, the plaintiffs and defendant had drawn from the firm more money than was allowed by the partnership articles.</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">The plaintiffs had drawn, . . . $3,036.75</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The defendants had drawn, . . 2,625.28</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The referee finds that it was the right of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ants to draw from the estimated assets, $203.05, to .equalize the amount drawn by him and the amount drawn by plaintiffs, and afterwards, at the end of the accounting, the plaintiffs were held liable to pay the whole of this $203.05. I think there were two errors. 1st. The defendant was not entitled to draw from the assets this sum, because he was entitled to have only the proportion; this has been already stated. 2d. There is no provision of the articles that permit him to draw any amount for the purpose of equalizing his drafts with plaintiffs. Each was entitled to draw but $50 a week for the forty-four weeks they were in business\u2014that is, $2,200. All above that sum should have remained undrawn, and the plaintiffs should return to the assets,.....$836.75 And the defendant also, .... 425.28 The assets should, in view of the referee, be increased by the amount of the capital which plain tiffs should, but had not contributed, viz.,......2,151.80 The plaintiffs had in their possession money collected by them,..... 537.99 The defendants,....._ 208.44 Cash in receiver\u2019s hands, .... 81.07</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">The sum total should be divided according to the proportions in which each was entitled to share in the assets, and that result would show what each had the right to have. If one had received an amount of the assets actually, which, with any sum they had not paid to the firm, but should have, would exceed the amount they wrere entitled to, out of the assets, the excess should be paid to the other party, and this excess would be the correct amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">So far, no attention has been paid to the effect upon the result of a correct application of the provisions of the articles, that provided that the loss should be borne equally. As soon as a loss occurred, the only way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that each could actually bear it equally, would be to pay one half of its amount back into the firm, or, in case it was not paid, to be charged with the one-half, in his individual account, and then, at a later time, to perform the obligation expressed by such a charge. This not having been done before the close of business and the final accounting, these charges in gross, viz., the whole of the losses, should be treated as the plaintiffs\u2019 deficiency of capital was treated, and should increase what was called the assets of the firm, exactly the same as if third persons had promised to bear the losses, and the assets so increased should be divided in the proportions above specified, and each party should then be considered as having already received on account of his share the amount he had omitted to pay over, under his obligation to share equally the losses, <em>i. e., </em>one-half ol the losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The result of this would be so different from the result of the accounting below, that there should be a new trial and a new accounting, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event of the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Speir and Freedman, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
