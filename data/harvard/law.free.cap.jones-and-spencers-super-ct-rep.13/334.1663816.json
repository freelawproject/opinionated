On October 24, 1877, judgment was recovered and entered against defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-17\">Execution against the property of defendant was returned January 9, 1878, unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Execution against the person of defendant was issued October 21, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">The court, by an order, vacated the execution against the person, on the ground that it had not been issued within three months after the entry of judgment, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\"><em>John P.

Section 572 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies only to defendants in actual custody. A defendant released on bail is not in actual custody, within the true intent and meaning of the term, as used in the section referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Section 288 of the former Code contained a similar provision, and, in Bostwick <em>v. </em>Goetzel (57 N. <em>Y. </em>582, affirming 34 N. <em>Y. Super. Ct. </em>23), was held inapplicable to the case of a defendant at large on bail. Coman <em>v. </em>Storm (2 <em>How. Pr. </em>84) is not in point. In that case the defendant, though enjoying the liberties of the jail, was really imprisoned, upon an execution against his person, within the limits of the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The order should be reversed, with costs, and the motion denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
