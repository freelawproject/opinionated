I desire to sell the stock I control, and though I cannot commit myself just yet, I would sell it, at the average price you pay for the balance, which, with mine, would give you a majority of it. I advise you of this, that you may feel assured that if you contemplate purchasing the road, you may depend on the 10,000 or 12,000 shares I hold. . . .

That his administrators, acting by one of them, Henry O. Havemeyer, agreed, in April, 1875, with the defendants, who owned other shares of the stock of the same railroad, that \u201cneither the defendant\u2019s stock nor the Albert Havemeyer stock should be sold, or should unite in a sale which should not include the stock of the other party, unless with the consent of that party that in August, 1875, the Albert Havemeyer stock was partly divided among the distributees of his estate, one of them being the plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>iff, and the administrators continuing to hold certain shares which the intestate had held in trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">That in November, 1875, the said Harry O. Havemeyer, acting for the parties in interest, secured definite proposals from one Poppenhusen for a purchase of the whole of the stock. \u201cHe immediately communicated with the defendants on the subject; thereupon the agreement that neither lot of stock should be sold without the other was reiterated between the parties ; and it was further agreed that the said Harry O. Havemeyer, acting as aforesaid, should proceed with the negotiation for a sale to Mr. Poppenhusen ; that the defendant should aid by obtaining the union of other holders, and that if Mr. Poppenhusen were willing to pay at the rate of seventy-five per cent, of the par value, a sale should be made, and that the defendants would.join.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">The breaches of their alleged agreements are that about December 14, 1875, \u201c an offer was obtained from Mr. Poppenhusen which would have secured to the defendants, and the parties represented by them, at the rate of seventy-five per cent for- their stock. This was communicated to the defendant, and thereupon the defendants, in violation of their agreement previously made, declined to join in the sale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">Another allegation, which may be taken to be a charge of a breach, wras that subsequently, and on or about January 26, 1876, the defendants did sell to Mr. Poppenhusen, including their own stock and the stock of other parties, making altogether about thirty-five thousand shares, leaving out the Albert Havemeyer stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-8\">Further allegations, containing matters upon which the plaintiff, at trial, relied, as making a breach, were that while the defendants were professing to co-operate, and werd thus preventing the parties interested in the Albert Havemeyer stock from acting independently to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>effect a sale, they were themselves using the time to, and they did, make an arrangement with holders of stock, with whom they volunteered to communicate for the common benefit, so as individually to represent and control their stock, and particularly the stock which had belonged to Mr. Charlick, \u201c which was not in the arrangement previously referred to. They thus secured the control of a majority, exclusive of the Albert Havemeyer stock: this enabled them to, and they used it, to defeat a sale, which should include the Havemeyer stock, thus causing to the parties interested in that stock the very loss and jury which it had been the object of the arrangement and agreements between them and the defendants to prevent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">On the trial, Harry O. Havemeyer, a witness for the plaintiff, who was her agent through the transaction, testified as follows: \u201cin April, 1875, I stated to defendant (J. C. Havemeyer), that I wished to combine it (that is, the Albert Havemeyer stock) with his, with the view of selling it at the earliest possible time, that there was no market for it unless it was combined with enough of the stock to form a majority, and I wished to combine, so that his stock should not be sold without mine, and my stock should not be sold without his, as our influence together was sufficient to control the other fifteen thousand shares so as to form a majority. He stated that he was perfectly willing to enter into such a combination, provided the management of the road should go into their hands.\u201d On his direct examination, he was asked, \u201c Will you state all that was said on the subject of an arrangement to unite the stock which you represented with any stock which John C. Havemeyer stated he or the defendants represented or controlled, .in that interview <em>% </em>\u201d His answer was, \u201cWe were to unite the stock; I said that I wished to combine my stock with his and the stock he repf\u00e9sented in these fifteen thousand shares to oust Mr. Charlick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>from the management of the road, to combine it, and that neither part of the stock should be sold without including in the sale the other, to combine it so that when an opportunity offered for its sale, that a majority of the entire road could be sold, and thereby bring a higher price. He said that he was perfectly willing to enter into such a combination, provided I gave him the management of the road. . . .' I said I would consent to that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">The witness stated that he began negotiations for a sale of a majority of the stock to Mr. Poppenhusen, that in the course of them the defendants had expressed their willingness to sell their stock at seventy-\u00f1ve per cent, and certain bonds of railways they owned at-ninety per cent. He said he began these negotiations in September, 1875, and continued them down to December 15, 1875. He further said that on November 24, 1875, he had an interview with the defendants, and that \u201c I told John I had called to renew our agreement, and that I wanted him to state again, that he would sell his stock at seventy-five cents and his bonds at ninety cents, and I wanted also his brother Henry to say so : that the negotiations had reached a point where they were to be consummated, and I did not wish to have any misunderstanding about it. , . . I said then, John, you authorize me to sell a majority of the stock at seventy-five cents and the bonds at ninety cents. He said he did. I addressed the same question to Henry, and he said yes. I said this is a transaction, that involved $1,250,000 and they must pledge themselves not to have any transaction in the stock in any way ; that they must neither buy nor sell; that the position must remain exactly as it was as in the event of its not being sold, the position was to remain unchanged . . they stated that they would . . all this was acquiesced in.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">The question was then asked, on the direct ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>amination, \u201c At that interview, were the terms of what you call the agreement repeated, and if so, what was said upon the subject of what the agreement was ? You said, you wished to renew the agreement ?\u201d The witness answered, \u201cI recall that John stated, 1 Suppose you cannot get the price, suppose the negotiations fall through <em>V </em>and I stated that the affair was to remain as it was, until some arrangement is made, and he stated that was all right.\u201d The witness testified that the defendants required that Poppenhusen\u2019s proposition to buy must be in writing\u2019.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">In a deposition taken in another action the witness testified in reference to the interview of November 24: \u201cJohn G. Havemeyer said that pending the negotiations with Messrs. Poppenhusen, they would have no transactions in the stock in any way, shape or manner, neither buy nor sell, nor do anything to depreciate. I stated the same, that I did not wish to have anything transpire that would interrupt the negotiations, neither were to buy or sell or have anything to do, the situation should remain just as it was. Q. What, if anything, was said about how long any such arraagement should continue; what was said about time in that interview ? A. Pending the negotiations nothing was to be done, no stock was to be bought, no stock was to be sold. Q. Was any period of time mentioned in the interview having reference to any matter; was anything said about time that you now recall in that interview ; I mean about some time in the future ? A. In the event of the sale not being consummated, we were to meet and decide what to do with the stock. Q. I wish to know whether, in reference to any subject mentioned in that interview, you talked over any fixed and definite period of time or number of years, during-which anything was to continue ? A. Nothing was to be done pending the negotiation, that is a matter of time; in the event of their not being successful the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>situation was to remain, as it always had been, until some other arrangement had been made ; that was the understanding. Q. With reference to that, was any number of years spoken of? A. Three, I think. Q. If it was said in that interview what was to be done or what was not to be done for three years or any other number of years, I want you to state to the jury what was said. A. I recollect of something being said about three years. I don\u2019t exactly recollect what it was.\u2019\u2019 On the present trial, the witness was not able to testify that a period of time of the kind referred ,to had been mentioned, or if it had been, to what it was applied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">The testimony in reference to supposed breaches of agreement, by defendant, was in substance, that on \u00a1November 19, one of the executors of Charlick, on request of defendant, called at the house of defendant Henry H., in reference to the Charlick stock. There was another interview on \u00a1November 26, or 27. The definite purpose of these interviews, or what was done at them, is not disclosed by the evidence. The plaintiff read as evidence on her own behalf, from the deposition of one of the defendants on this point the testimony: \u201c We went to learn, first, whether they had been approached for the sale of their stock ; second, what the feeling of Mr. Charlick was toward us, whether friendly, and whether they were willing to sell, and if so, at what price.,\u201d The stock of Charlick\u2019s executors was, after several other interviews, purchased by the defendant on December 11. On Debember 15, plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote to defendant: \u201cTo prevent the possibility of misunderstanding, I think it better to put in writing what passed between us, this morning. What I asked was, whether you desired to join in the sale of the L. I. E. E, Co. Your answer was you did not.\u201d To this one of the defendants made a memorandum: \u201cI declined to join in further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>negotiations for the sale of the L. I. stock I hold and control.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">About January 25, 1876, the defendant sold the stock they owned and controlled to Poppenhusen, for 75 cents on the dollar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">The testimony on which the defendant relied as showing that, if there were an agreement of the kind testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witness, the plaintiff had committed the first breach, was in substance as follows. Before the interview of November 24, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, H. 0. Havemeyer, had written to Mr. Poppenhusen the following letter :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">\u201cDear Sir :\u2014A Mr. Godefroy has had some conversation with me, regarding the stock held by the estate of the late Albert Havemeyer. Will you be kind enough to inform me, if you contemplate purchasing a controlling interest in the Long Island Railroad? Not knowing Mr. Godefroy, I am not sure that he is authorized to represent you in tipis matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-8\">\u201c What you choose to tell me, will be regarded strictly as confidential, as in this matter I desire to work in your interest, and not in the interest of those who have the present control. I desire to sell the stock I control, and could sell it, though I cannot commit myself just yet, at the average price you pay for the balance, which, with mine, would give you a majority of ib. I advise you of this, that you may feel assured, that if you contemplate purchasing the road, you may depend upon the 10 or 13,000 shares I hold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-9\">\u201cThe sale of this stock is of such importance to the persons I represent that I would willingly assist you, if you think I can, in getting the majority of the entire stock. An early reply will oblige.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-10\">\u201c Yours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-11\">\u201cH. O. HAVEMEYER.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>On the same day, and before the interview with the defendant on that day, Mr. Poppenhusen wrote to Mr. H. O. Havemeyer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">\u201cIn reply to your favor of to-day I beg to say, that Mr. Grodefroy is authorized to act for us, in the matter of L. I. R. R. stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">\u201cThanking you for kind offers of assistance in the matter, we will if necessary make use of them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-7\">The defendants were not informed of this letter or answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-8\">The explanation by Mr. H. O. Havemeyer of his letter was, that shortly before his writing it he had been told by Mr. Grodefroy, that the defendants would be treacherous to him, and he wrote this letter, that he might proceed to sell the Albert Havemeyer stock, if they were treacherous, or, as stated by the learned counsel for plaintiff, \u201c he explains that the reference was to the agreement between him and the defendants, which made it impossible for him to sell, and that the letter was written on an apprehension that the defendants intended to act treacherously, so that if they did, he might be in a position to protect himself so far as possible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-9\">Prom November 24, Mr. H. O. Havemeyer proceeded to negotiate with Mr. Poppenhusen for a sale of the stock and bonds, on the terms limited by the defendants. On December 2, Mr. Poppenhusen wrote to Mr. H. 0. Havemeyer, \u2018 \u2018 I beg to inform you, that your proposition of yesterday, made to me verbally, cannot be accepted, but that we should be willing to close the matter on the basis submitted to you this morning.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-10\">On the same day, December 2, Mr. H. 0. Havemeyer wrote to the defendants :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-11\">\u201cThe proposition for the sale of the L.. I. stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and bonds to Mr. Poppenhusen has been declined by him, and he has submitted one in return, which I have not submitted to you, for the reason that yon expressed no desire to entertain anything different froth that agreed upon, viz., cash.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">After that time, the defendants gave no authority to Mr. H. O. Havemeyer to sell the stock held or controlled by them, but he made some negotiations with Mr. Poppenhusen on the subject, and received an offer upon terms which the defendants had not agreed to take.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">Before the letter of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, written. December 15, Mr. II. O. Havemeyer, on December 14, saw one of the defendants and said, \u201cI have sold the road.\u201d He referred to a sale which he supposed Mr. Poppenhusen would make on other terms than those that had been agreed to by the defendants. The defendant answered, \u201c Ido not wish to sell.\u201d I remonstrated with him. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to sell.\u201d I said, \u201cDo I understand you to say yon will not sell? \u201d He said, \u201cI will not sell.\u201d Then I said, \u201cI suppose I am at liberty to sell my stock.\u201d He said, \u201c You are.\u201d Then I left him. That was the last conversation he ever had with the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">Immediately thereafter, Mr. H. 0. Havemeyer endeavored to sell the Albert Havemeyer stock, irrespective of the defendants\u2019 stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-8\">At the request of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the court charged: \u201cFirst. If the jury find, from the evidence, that before the election of April 13, 1875, there was an agreement between the defendants and Harry O. Havemeyer, he acting for the parties interested in the Albert Havemeyer stock, by the terms of which the stock represented by Harry 0. Havemeyer and that which the defendants represented that they owned and controlled, should be combined for the purpose of improv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ing its value by a change in the management of the road, with a provision that neither stock should be sold without including the other\u2014that such agreement was made in view of the danger that either lot of stock might unite in a sale to Poppenhusen, leaving out the other, and that thereby the other would lose the benefit of a sale at a full price, and might become largely depreciated in value ; that in pursuance of such agreement the management and control of the road passed into the hands of the defendants ; that this agreement was renewed in the fall of 1875, after the division of the Albert Havemeyer stock, and the transfer to the plaintiffs of the nine hundred and twenty-six shares, Harry O. Havemeyer still continuing to represent the Albert Havemeyer stock, and that a further agreement was then made, that if a sale could be effected at seventy-five cents on the dollar, the defendants would include the Albert Havemeyer stock and the stock which they owned and controlled, and that the negotiation of such sale should be put in the hands of Harry O. Havemeyer, with a further provision that, during the negotiation, the defendants should neither buy stock, nor do anything else to interfere with negotiations ; and if the jury are further of the opinion that such agreement was broken by the defendants,\u2014then they are responsible in damages for the loss which thereby resulted to the plaintiff. Second. If the jury find, from the evidence, that, while Harry O. Havemeyer, and the parties represented by him, were acting according to the provisions of such agreement, and were negotiating for a sale, the defendants were engaged in making preparations to enable them successfully to break it, and to defeat a sale of plaintiff\u2019s stock ; that, for that purpose, they procured the undivided control of some seven thousand shares of stock held in Philadelphia, that they purchased the Charlick stock, consisting of some nine thousand and odd shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>at sixty-five ; that as soon as they felt themselves strong-enough to defeat the agreement they refused to unite in the sale, but, instead, made arrangements with other stockholders, by which they were enabled to combine a majority of the stock, excluding the Albert Havemeyer stock, but including the defendants\u2019 purchased stock; that they then sold to Mr. Poppenhusen at seventy-five cents on the dollar ; then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the difference between the fair cash and market value of the plaintiff\u2019s stock at the time of the breach, and the amount to which the value was reduced by the action of the defendants, with interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-L\">The court also charged : \u201c Th.e plaintiff also claims that on November 24, 1875, after the division of the Albert Havemeyer stock among the next of kin entitled thereto, and the transfer to the plaintiff of her nine hundred and twenty-six shares of stock, the agreement of February, 1875, was renewed, in so far as it-prohibited those interested in the stock derived from Albert Havemeyer and the defendants from selling ox-uniting in a sale which should not include the stock of the other parties, unless with the consent of the other party; that it was further agreed at that time, between Harry O.

The defendants owned and controlled another quantity of that stock. The plaintiff and her associates, acting by an agent, and the defendants agreed that neither quantity of stock should be sold, unless it was in a sale that included the other quantity, and the defendants then authorized plaintiff\u2019s agent to sell to Mr. Poppenhusen the stock which defendants owned and;' controlled, for seventy-five per cent, of its nominal value, and certain bonds owned by them for ninety per cent, of their amount, in cash, if Mr. Poppenhusen should put his offer to pay that in writing. The defendants further agreed that during the'negotiations for the sale, they would neither buy stock nor do anything else to interfere with the negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s agent then began negotiations for a sale-on these terms. While they were on foot, the defendants had interviews with the executors of Mr. Charlick, to learn if they would be willing to sell to the defendants stock of the same railroad owned by the executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and on what terms. On December <em>2, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s agent wrote to the defendants, that Mr. Poppenhusen had declined the proposition for the sale of the stock and bonds, but had submitted5 one in return, which the agent did not submit to the defendants, for the reason that they had expressed no desire to entertain anything different from that agreed upon, viz.: cash. On December 11, the defendants bought from the executors of Charlick, their stock, at sixty-five per cent, of the nominal value. On December 14, the plaintiff \u2019 s agent, in ignorance of ,the purchase of the Charlick stock, obtained from the defendants leave to sell the stock in which plaintiff was interested, by itself, and proceeded to attempt to sell it without including defendants\u2019 stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On January <em>26, </em>1875, the defendants sold to Mr. Poppenhusen the stock owned and controlled by them for seventy-five per cent, in cash. The plaintiff claimed that the purchase from Charlick\u2019s executors and the sale to Mr. Poppenhusen, were violations of defendants\u2019 obligations to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">After all the evidence was in, the defendants\u2019 counsel moved to dismiss, upon several grounds. One of them was that \u201ceven if the pretended agreement was made, continuing and valid, the purchase by the defendants of the Charlick stock on December 11 (the negotiation for a joint sale, pending on November 24, having ended on December 2), was not a breach of such agreement.\u201d They also asked the court to charge, that 1 \u2018 the evidence conclusively shows, that on or about December 14, 1875, and before the sale to Poppenhusen, which is complained of by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was by the consent of the defendants released from any further obligation, to hold her stock or keep it out of the market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A further request to charge was, that the conduct of the parties after\" December 14, 1875, as established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>undisputed evidence on the part of the plaintiff and given by the witness, Parsons, is inconsistent with the theory, that after that date there was any binding contract or obligation in force between the parties. They also asked the court to charge, that \u201c the purchase by the defendants, at the time and under the circumstances given in evidence, of the stock known as the Charlick stock, was not a breach of any contract established by the evidence to have been made at any time between the plaintiff and the defendants also, that \u201c upon the whole case, the defendants are entitled to a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Beyond controversy, the complaint does not set out any contract of which the purchase of the Char-lick stock was a breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The court instructed the jury to find whether the parties, before April, made any arrangement with a provision \u201c that neither lot of stock should be sold without-including the other,\u201d and whether this agreement \u201cwas renewed in the fall of 1875;\u201d \u201cand a further agreement then made, that if a sale could be effected at seventy-live cents on the dollar, the defendants would include the Albert Havemeyer stock, and the stock which they owned and controlled, and that the xiegotiation for such sale should be put in the hands of Harry O. Havemeyer, with a further provision that during the negotiation, the defendants should neither buy stock nor do anything else to interfere with negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Of course, the purchase of the Charlick stock did not violate the provision, \u201c that neither lot of stock should be sold without the other.\u201d Was it a violation of the other provision, that \u201cduring the negotiation the defendants should neither bay stock nor do any- \u2022 thing else to interfere with the negotiations ?\u201d By the charge (and upon it the jury found for the plaintiff), the negotiations, during which the defendants agreed not to buy stock and not to do anything to interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>with negotiations, were \u201cthe negotiations for such sale.\u201d The sale referred, to was one to be made for cash, at seventy-five per cent, for the stock, and ninety per cent, for the bonds, if a written proposition to buy on those terms should be made by Mr. Poppenhusen. The evidence shows that such was the sale, although the charge refers to it as a sale for seventy-five per cent, for the stock alone. The evidence, by the construction most favorable to plaintiff, shows that defendants\u2019 promise referred only to negotiations for a sale of the kind that has been described. The witness, on this point, for plaintiff, was her agent, and he testified: \u201cI told John . . I wanted him to. state again that he would sell her stock at seventy-five cents, and his bonds at ninety cents, and I wanted also his brother Henry to say so ; that the negotiations had reached a point where they were to be consummated.\u201d After testifying to defendants\u2019 consent to this, he continued, \u201c that they must neither buy nor sell, that the position must remain exactly as it was, as in the event of its not being sold, the position was to remain unchanged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">It should be here observed, that the complaint did not state or base any claim, upon an agreement \u201cthat the position was to remain unchanged.\u201d The plaintiff on the trial did not make any claim upon it; nor did the charge of the court leave it to the jury, or in any way refer to it. Its significance here, is to show, that the negotiations referred to were those for the specific sale mentioned in the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The witness proceeded to say, \u201cI recall that John stated, \u2018 Suppose you cannot get the price; suppose that negotiations fall through,\u2019 and I stated then the affair is to remain as it was, until some new arrangement is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The testimony of the witness on another trial, read on this was, \u201c I stated to John, that my negotiations for obtaining a bid for seventy-five for the stock, and ninety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>for the bonds would probably be successful, and, in connection with that,\u201d John C. Havemeyer said that, pending the negotiations with Messrs. Poppenhusen, they would have no transactions in the stock in any way, shape or manner; neither buy nor sell, nor do anything to depreciate; I stated the same, that I did not wish to have anything transpire that would interrupt the negotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The next question is, did the evidence incontrovertibly show that the negotiations had ended, before the defendant bought the Charlick stock on December 11. On December 2, the witness wrote to the defendant this letter. \u201c Dear sir : The proposition for the sale of the Long Island stock and bonds to Mr. Poppenhusen has been declined by him, and he has submitted one in return, which I have not submitted to you, for the reason that you expressed no desire to entertain anything different from that agreed upon, viz: cash.\u201d It must be seen, that the defendants were notified, that the negotiation for seventy-five cents for the stock, and ninety cents for the bonds in cash, had been ended by Mr. Poppenhusen declining to make the purchase, and making a counter proposition, which plaintiff\u2019s agent did not think worth while even to describe to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The letter gives no intimation to the defendants, that the agent was about to go on with negotiations. If he did so, they were new negotiations, for himself, and not authorized by defendant. There is no proof that before December 11, he ever informed defendants that he was continuing negotiations with Mr. Poppenhusen. He testified that he had one interview with the defendants between November 24 and December 14. He dbes not fix the date of this interview, or describe its contents, so that it would appear to refer to negotiations after December 2. On the other hand, his testimony was, that it might have occurred on the Monday after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>November 24. If there were in fact any negotiations of any kind, after December 2, there was no testimony that they were for a sale on the terms prescribed by \u00abdefendants, for, whenever the negotiations took place, the only testimony as to their character was such as \u2022could be inferred from their consummation, viz., a written offer by Mr. Poppenhusen to buy on terms, which had not been acceded to, and which the defendants were not bound to accept as the court upon the trial charged. In this way it appeared on the trial by evidence, against which the jury could not find, that the negotiations referred to in the promise, had ended on December 2, and also that the agent of plaintiff had informed the defendants and led them to believe that they had ended. From this time, the defendants were not bound by any agreement to refrain from buying stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">There was no proof that the purchase of the Char-lick stock, or the bargaining with the Charlick executors for its purchase \u201c interfered with the negotiation,\u201d to use the words of this charge. No proof was given on the subject. Least of all, was there anything tending to show that this purchase or bargaining had the effect of influencing Mr. Poppenhusen to decline the defendant\u2019s terms. If this had been a ground of a recovery by plaintiff, it would have been necessary to tell the jury that the plaintiff could recover for such damages only as the evidence showed she had suffered from that breach. The damages would have been proportioned to the proved effect of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Moreover, if the liability of defendant arose from their having \u201cinterfered with the negotiations,\u201d the just conclusion from the evidence is that the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s agent was such that the agreement on this point ceased to be binding upon the defendants before any alleged breach by defendants. On the day of the alleged agreement, and before it was made, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s agent wrote to Mr. Poppenhusen the letter of November 94, and also received an answer to it. The defendants made the agreement in ignorance of these letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The agent of plaintiff testified that that part of the letter which stated \u201c I cannot commit myself just yet,\u201d referred to his being at that present time bound to sell the stock, inrespect of which he was agent, with the defendants\u2019 stock, and not separately, and that he wrote the letter from a fear that the defendants would be treacherous, and would endeavor to sell their stock apart from plaintiff\u2019s stock. Whatever was the1 motive, and if good or otherwise, the letter informed Mr. Poppenhusen that in case the plaintiff\u2019s agent ceased to be committed, he would sell to Mr. Poppenhusen the large amount of stock he controlled, which was, in fact, about one-third of a majority of the stock, and would assist him in getting enough besides to make a majority, and would act against \u201cthose in control,\u201d which phrase included\u00bbthe defendants. He knew the fact, that it was in Mr. Poppenhusen\u2019s power to release him from his committal to defendants, by refusing to buy on the terms which defendants had prescribed, and whicli he Avas about to present. He thus influenced Mr. Poppenhusen\u2019s mind against agreeing to defendants\u2019 proposition. He presented a motive that was unfavorable to def\u00e9ndants, and Mr. Poppenhusen\u2019s answer, that if necessary he would act upon the kind offer, shows the effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In substance, the agreement of defendants to allow the plaintiff\u2019s agent to negotiate for a sale of defendants\u2019 stock, was, as argued by the counsel for defendants upon the trial, \u201ca mere authority to Henry O. Havemeyer.\u201d Its tenor professed or purported no more. There was no antecedent obligation of defendants to sell their stock, or to place it in the hands of plaintiff\u2019s agent for sale. The plaintiffs agent or the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>had no interest in the subject matter of the authority ; that is, the defendants\u2019 property. In this way the plaintiff\u2019s agent became defendants\u2019 agent to negotiate, and was bound to the utmost fidelity to defendants, and could not rightfully continue to be agent after a violation of any of his obligation. The plaintiff was b\u00f3und by his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">If the arrangement be considered as an agreement, its promises were mutual. The letter referred to was a first violation of the agreement, and was such a breach that, thereafter, the agreement came to an end, and therefore the defendants ceased to be bound by it. Or if it be considered only as an authority to an agent, his violation of his duty as agent terminated his power to bind his principal, or to continue to act for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">It was suggested that, as the letter was sent and answered before the arrangement of November 24, it could not be a violation of the agreement then made. But the effect was operative, after the negotiation began, as the answer to the letter shows. It is for the effect that there was responsibility. The offer contained in the letter was not withdrawn, but, as it contemplated, remained in the hands of Mr. Poppenhusen, to await the result of the negotiation of defendants\u2019 proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">After the arrangement in respect of the sale, on defendants\u2019 terms, ceased to bind the defendants of the so-called agreement, remained only the provision that neither lot of stock should be sold without the other. This did not forbid any purchase that either party chose to make. Either party might bring it to an end at pleasure, before a breach. Giving to it the greatest force that can be claimed for it, either party could end it by notice. Its benefit to the parties was, that it tended to give an opportunity for the sale of the two lots of stock together ; but it did not bind either party to make a sale. Either party- could obtain the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>to sell separately, by a notice ending the agreement. Without going into the question of whether the arrangement possessed the constituents necessary by law to a contract, or, particularly, of whether there was sufficient consideration, it will not be doubted that the only consideration that sustained the contract was the mutual promise not to sell separately. When the promise ceased to be mutual, the contract ceased. By the undisputed testimony, plaintiff\u2019s agent had failed to bring about any arrangement which could include defendants\u2019 stock, upon the terms which the defendants rightfully demanded. There was no prospect of future co-operation. All efforts had been exhausted. On December 15, the agent acting for plaintiff asked defendants if he were at liberty to sell, separately, the stock he acted for. The defendants, by assenting, gave the liberty. This was nothing else than an annulling of plaintiff\u2019s promise, which was the consideration to 'defendants. It, in. fact, annulled the agreement, for that was a mutual promise. It was not less than a notice by plaintiff that the mutual understanding was to end, and as to defendants, the parties to whom the notice was given, they might treat the agreement as then ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">It was argued that such a construction should not be given, because, at the time, the plaintiff\u2019s agent did not know that the defendants had bought the Charlick stock. It cannot, however, be inferred that, if he had known it, it would have made him the less desirous to have the power of acting apart from the defendants. But, without going further in this direction, it is sufficient to say that, from views already expressed, it results that the defendants were under no obligation to inform plaintiff\u2019s agent of the Charlick purchase. After plaintiff\u2019s agent had received permission to sell her stock, he attempted to sell it by a negotiation, and in a manner that was inconsistent with the exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ence of an agreement, that the two parcels of stock should not be sold separately. As the agreement came to an end on December 14, the defendants could rightfully sell, on January 27, \u25a0 to Mr. Poppenhusen, their own stock, without including the plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">I am further of opinion, that the court should have charged, as requested by defendants\u2019 counsel, that \u201cin estimating damages, the jury cannot take into account any mere chance of making uncertain profits, nor any speculative value arising from or depending upon the possibility of the plaintiff combining her stock with that of other persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The court charged, in accordance with the former decision of the general term, that the measure of damages would be the amount in which the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s stock was lessened by a breach of the contract by defendants. The general term expressed the opinion that the defendants\u2019 sale to Poppenhusen was some evidence of market value. And on this trial the court said to the jury : \u201c The measure of damages for a breach by defendants of this contract, if there was such an agreement, would be the amount of any depreciation, in the fair cash and market value of the plaintiff\u2019s stock, occasioned by the breach. You are to determine, from the evidence, what was the market value at that time, and you are at liberty in this connection to consider the price paid by Poppenhusen, as bearing upon that subject. ' You are not, however, concluded by such a price in estimating the value, but you may consider it, in connection with the other evidence on this subject.\u201d It stood then, in this wise: the jury was charged that they might find, if the evidence justified it, that the sale to Poppenhusen ivas a breach; that they must find what was the market value before the breach, taking as some evidence the price paid by Poppenhusen, and then what the market value was after the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>This sale, as some evidence of market value, was evidently of serious practical importance. It had a tendency to increase the amount of damages to the extent that the price paid represented in the minds of the jury\u2014real market value. If that price paid was, in fact, above market value, the jury should have disregarded the excess. If there were facts tending to show that this sale was brought about by considerations on the part of Poppenhusen, which could not have influenced the market generally, the jury should have taken those facts, in connection with their conclusion from the evidence, as to the probability of the plaintiff having been able to make a sale, of a kind like the one to Poppenhusen. The jury should have found whether it was probable that the plaintiff, or those associated with her, could have procured a sufficient amount of the stock to be a majority of the stock ; and also to what extent the price given by Poppenhusen was influenced by the sale being of a majority. If the evidence satisfied the jury that Poppenhusen would not have paid the price he did, unless for a majority of the stock, and it was only possible that the plaintiff could have procured a majority, or her chance to do it was only speculative, the jury, in using the sale as evidence, should not have enhanced the market value by such part of the price paid, as came from the fact that a majority was sold. In other words, to the extent that it was only possible or speculative whether the plaintiff could have made a sale like the one to Poppenhusen, the jury should have disregarded the price paid by Poppenhusen.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Some facts that appeared in the case may be adduced here. The complaint stated that it was well known by the parties \u201cthat one Adolph Poppenhusen and others co-operating with him, desired to purchase a majority of the stock of the company, and that he would pay for a majority a much larger price than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>after liis purchase could be obtained for the other stock,\u201d and further, \u201cthat by the action of the defendants, the Albert Havemeyer stock has been placed in a minority of the stock of the company and its market value has been made worth, not to exceed twenty per cent, of its par value, instead of seventy-five per cent., at which it could have been sold if the defendants had not been guilty, &amp;c.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s agent' gave testimony of the market value before the agreement which was applicable by the jury to the time immediately before the breach. He testified that he told the defendants, that without a combination, there was no market value for the stock ; and again, that there was no market for it, unless it was combined with enough- of the stock to form a majority ; and. again, that a majority of the entire road could be sold and thereby bring a higher price.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">There was, therefore, some evidence for the jury, that to get the price afterwards paid by Poppenhusen it was necessary to secure control of a majority, and it would have been a substantial aid to the jury to instruct them, that the damages were not to be founded upon a speculative chance that the plaintiff might have been able to offer a majority for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">For these reasons I am of opinion that there should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial with costs of the appeal to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b522-9\">Freedman, J.\u2014[Concurring.]</author>\n<p id=\"Aza\">I concur in the reversal upon the ground last stated in the opinion of Judge\" Sedgwick, viz. : that it was error to refuse to charge, as requested by defendants\u2019- counsel, \u201cthat in estimating damages, the jury cannot take into account any mere chance of making uncertain profits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>nor any speculative value arising from, or depending upon the possibility of the plaintiff\u2019s combining her stock with that of other persons.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
