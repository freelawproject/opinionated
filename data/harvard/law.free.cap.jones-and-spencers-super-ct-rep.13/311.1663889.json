Tyson (45 N. <em>Y. </em>281), and Thompson <em>v. </em>Erie R. R. Co. (45 <em>Id. </em>468), prevent an affirmative defense being stricken out as sham upon affidavits.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Before Sedgwick and Speir, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b346-5\"><em>Decided June </em>13, 1879.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">Appeal from order, denying plaintiffs motion to strike out, as sham, the separate answer of the defendant Poster.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-7\"><em>O.

The answer, among other defenses which it is unnecessary to set out, pleaded, on information and belief, payment by the co-defendant, James Sperry.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The affidavits on which the motion was made did not show at all that at the time1 the answer was made, that it- could not have been true that the defendant Poster had not been informed, and did not and could not believe, that his co-defendant had paid the rent. The Code declares that an averment may be made upon information and belief, to put the fact in issue. Such a pleading cannot, in the nature of things, be stricken out as sham, if, at least, it is not clearly shown that there could be no information or belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">As to the fact of the co-defendant\u2019s not having paid the rent, the affidavits did not so convincingly or indisputably show the non-payment, that a court could determine that there could be no question for the jury, if the action were tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">I further agree with the learned counsel for the respondent, that the principles stated in Wayland v. Tyson (45 <em>N. Y. </em>281), Thompson <em>v. </em>Erie R. R. Co. (45 <em>Id. </em>468), prevent an affirmative defense from being stricken out as sham upon affidavits. If it could, there would be no reason why a defendant should not have the right to strike out a complaint as sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Order affirmed, with $10 costs, and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
