The bond is to be construed and the rights of the parties to be determined as if the bond had been conditioned in express terms that said Hiker shall henceforth obey all orders of the court, touching the trust fund ; and the order directing payment is conclusive (Schofield <em>v. </em>Churchill, 72 <em>N. Y. </em>565; Thomas v. Hubbell, 15 <em>Id. </em>407.) These cases \u201c are not departures from, or exceptions to the general rule, that a judgment concludes only parties and privies, but do not fall within that rule at all, being dependent only on the principle that one may contract to be answerable to another upon such lawful conditions as he pleases \u201d (Thomas <em>v. </em>Hubbell, <em>supra). </em>The following cases illustrate the distinction: Douglass <em>v. </em>Howland, 24 <em>Wend. </em>35; Rapelye v. Prince, 4 <em>Hill, </em>119, 122.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-8\"><em>W. U. Northrop, </em>attorney, and of counsel, for defendant, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUq\">I. The defendant\u2019s bond was executed more than six months after Riker began to discharge his trust as - receiver, and such being the fact, the wrord \u201chenceforth\u201d was interlined in the condition, so that the obligation was simply that he would, from that time, faithfully discharge his trust. Under this restriction, the defendant executed the instrument, and bound himself only for the faithful discharge of his trust in the future. The court, therefore, erred in ruling that the bond covered all the acts of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ceiver before the execution thereof. It is a fundamental principle that \u201ca surety can only be charged where the case is brought within the precise terms of his contract.\u201d \u201c Thus, the condition of a bond may be considered to explain the obligatory part\u201d (2 <em>Parsons on Cont. </em>503; Birckhead v. Brown, 5 <em>Hill, 634, 640, 641; </em>McCluskey <em>v. </em>Cromwell, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>598; Willet v. Kipp, 12 <em>Hun, </em>476). In the case of Bissell <em>v. </em>Saxton (66 <em>N. Y. </em>60), the court of appeals say that \u201cthe engagement of the surety is for his future, and not his past conduct; and it would be a gross imposition upon them, in the absence of a special stipulation to that effect, to import into their undertaking responsibility for prior delinquencies. \u25a0 This has been frequently recognized\u201d (citing Myers <em>v. </em>United States, 1 <em>McLean, </em>493; Farrar <em>v. </em>United States, 5 <em>Pet. </em>372, 389; United States <em>v. </em>Boyd, 15 <em>Pet. </em>187; Vivian <em>v. </em>Otis, 1 <em>American R. </em>199; Willet <em>v. </em>Kipp, 12 <em>Hun, </em>474). The case of Schofield <em>v. </em>Hustis (9 <em>Hun, </em>157), is clearly distinguished from defendant\u2019s case. The bond filed in that case was conditioned, among other things, that the executor \u201c shall obey all orders of the surrogate, touching the administration of the estate committed to him.\u201d The court say, \u201c the bond was not conditioned, that defendant Churchill would account for all moneys received thereafter; it was that he should obey all orders of the court, touching the estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-5\">II. To the accounting of Hiker the defendant was not a party, but an entire stranger, having no knowledge of it until payment of the alleged deficiency was demanded of him. It is therefore submitted that he is in no manner bound or concluded by the order of the court of common pleas on said accounting. Being a stranger to that proceeding against Hiker, he had no opportunity to examine witnesses, or to defend himself, or to appeal from the order (1 <em>Phillips Evidence, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ed. 326, 327; 2 <em>Cowen &amp; Hill's Notes to Phillips Evidence, </em>815, 816, note 569). The case of Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Platt (7 <em>Hun, </em>56), by implication, sustains the principle that no one who is not a party to the proceeding can appeal from an order to which he was a stranger, and therefore he is not bound by it, except in certain cases, by the terms of the contract, cited in the 3d point (Swartwout <em>v. </em>Payne, 19 <em>Johns. </em>294; Bartlett <em>v. </em>Campbell, 1 <em>Wend. </em>50; Douglass <em>v. </em>Howland, 24 <em>Id. </em>35, 52-59; Clark <em>v. </em>Montgomery, 23 <em>Barb. </em>464).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-5\">III. The following cases established the principle that where the surety has notice and acts upon it; or where, by the terms of the contract, he-waives notice of adjustment of his liability; or consents to an <em>ex parte </em>adjustment of the sum he is obligated to pay ; he will be bound to pay the amount fixed upon. This is the essence of his contract, except when he acts on notice (Blasdale <em>v. </em>Babcock, 1 <em>Johns. </em>518; Kip <em>v. </em>Brigham, 6 <em>Id. </em>159; Poillon <em>v. </em>Volkenning, 11 <em>Hun, </em>385; Hotchkiss <em>v. </em>Platt, 7 <em>Id. </em>56; Methodist Church <em>v. </em>Barker, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>463; Cuddeback <em>v. </em>Kent, 5 <em>Paige, </em>92, 97, 98).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArX\">IY. It is submitted that inasmuch as the bond only covered future breaches of trust, and that the defendant was not concluded or bound by the proceedings in the accounting, that the plaintiff should have alleged in his complaint a specific breach of trust, after the execution of the bond, and also the precise amount of damages for which the defendant was liable for Hiker\u2019s dereliction of duty after the bond was given, and should have shown affirmatively a case, under such pleadings, against the defendant. Hence the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that it does not contain facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. And fcr like reason the court erred in denying the motion to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had not established a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-5\">V. The motion made by defendant to dismiss complaint because it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action should have been granted, on the grounds: 1st. The complaint alleges that the bond upon which the action is brought was given to the people of the State of New York, and not to the plaintiff, and it does not appear from the complaint that he has any interest in it, by assignment or otherwise; hence he cannot maintain this action (Annett v. Kerr, 28 <em>How. </em>324). Section 814 of Code of Civil Procedure, relates only to a bond given as prescribed by law. There is no law requiring a receiver of copartnership property to give a bond; it is discretionary with the court whether such bond shall be required or not, hence this bond is not such a bond as is provided for by that section. 2d. Complaint alleges that Biker was appointed receiver, &amp;c., July 9, 1874; that the bond was given January 30, 1875, for the faithful performance of his duties after that time, but contains no allegation that Biker did not faithfully perform his duties as receiver, after the giving of said bond; or any allegation showing any liability on the part of defendant, and no liability can be inferred against a surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-8\">VI. But if the introduction of the order made by the court of common-pleas established a <em>prima </em>facie. case against the defendant, but which is not conceded, the court erred in holding it conclusive for the sum demanded, and in excluding the testimony of Biker, which was offered by the defendant, to show that no breach of his trust had been committed after the execution of the bond.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b236-9\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4I\">The most important question is whether the refusal of Biker to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>amount which the order directed him to pay was a breach of the condition of defendant\u2019s bond. The condition was, \u201cthat if the said Biker shall henceforth faithfully discharge the duties of his trust as such receiver, then this obligation to be void, &amp;c.\u201d The only omission to discharge faithfully his duty was the refusal to pay as commanded by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">There is no doubt that the order was competently made, and was binding upon Biker ; but the appellant claims that it does not show or prove, as against the defendant, who was not a party or privy to the order, that Biker did not faithfully discharge the duties of his trust. But there seems to be no room for doubt, if it were a duty of the receiver\u2019s trust to obey the order, and the refusal to pay was the reverse of a fai thful discharge of duty ; the condition of the bond was broken. In such a case, the defendant has contracted that the receiver will pay, and the order and the proceedings leading to it do not comprise something that is binding upon the defendant as an adjudication, but are evidence of the facts as to violation of duty' in obeying the order.. Of course, if they were to be used as evidence of some former misappropriation of money, and the defendant was to be bound only if such a misappropriation were shown, they would be incompetent against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The cases against sureties upon executors\u2019 or administrators\u2019 bonds are not precedents here, for such bonds, following the statute, specifically provide in the condition that the principal shall obey the orders of the surrogate. Judge Cowen, who delivered the opinion in Douglass <em>v. </em>Howland (24 <em>Wend. </em>35), in deciding Jackson <em>v. </em>Griswold (4 <em>Hill, </em>531), gave an illustration which is in point here. He said that the case of Willey <em>v. </em>Pault, 6 <em>Cow. </em>74), was not cited by counsel in Douglass v. Howland, and was overlooked by the court. \u201cThe action was against the surety, in a probate bond condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tioned, among other things, that the executor should settle the estate according to law. The evidence offered was a judgment against the executor, an execution and demand of payment, which the executor refused to make, though he had assets. The judgment was held to be conclusive. With deference, it seems to me that a judgment against the executor and a refusal to pay, the estate having assets, were, <em>per se, </em>within the terms of the condition. The test of a failure to settle according to law was an unpaid judgment, and the case was therefore the same in effect as if the condition had said, we will abide all judgments that shall be obtained against the executor.\u201d I cannot think that there has been a faithful discharge of duty by a receiver, when he refuses to account and pay as directed by an order, which specifically designates his duty in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">It is urged as a ground of reversal, that in the exact \u25a0construction\u2022 which it is claimed is due to a surety\u2019s contract, a recovery here, on the ground that has been stated, cannot be maintained, for the reason that, before the order, the principal had been removed from the receivership, and thenceforward his act or omissions could not be the violation of the duties of a trust, which could only exist when the receivership was in existence. I think the proper construction is, that the defendant was to be bound, so long as there was any duty of his principal\u2019s trust to be performed, and that included a duty of the trust yet to be performed after his expulsion from the office. The trust and the duty springing from it remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">I am also of opinion that the order permitting the plaintiff to prosecute the bond, authorized him to bring this action. The people of the State had no property interest in the chose in action. By due authority from the people, the court had used their name as the obligee, that the real party in interest or bene-\" ficiary, according to circumstances, might have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>benefit of the contract. It is as if the name of the clerk or of a third party had been competently used for the purpose. A formal assignment was not necessary. The circumstances were equivalent to that, even if, under the Code, the plaintiff had not an absolute right, as a party in interest, subject to the direction of the court. The court has ordered that the plaintiff prosecute the bond, and for formal purposes may be deemed authorized by the obligee to make such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The plaintiff, as receiver appointed to succeed Biker, is the party in interest, and the measure of damages is the amount he would have received if the duty of paying the sum named in the order had been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions are overruled, and judgment ordered for plaintiff, on verdict, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
