Curry, one of the marshals of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>city of New York, in the district court of the city of New York, for the First Judicial District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">Curry appealed from that judgment to the general term of the court of common pleas, and gave the usual undertaking required by section 356 of the Code, to stay proceedings, in which the defendants herein were the sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">It was duly approved by the justice of the district court, and filed in the office of the clerk of the court of common pleas on the day of its approval.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">A transcript of that judgment was filed in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York, on the day of its recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">The judgment appealed from was affirmed by the court of common pleas on November 23, 1877, and, upon entry of judgment of affirmance and filing of transcript thereof in the county clerk\u2019s office, execution was issued on both out of the court of common pleas to the sheriff of the city and county of New York, and, by said sheriff, returned on December 14, 1877, wholly unsatisfied, and the one issued upon the district court judgment was returned to the clerk of the city and county of New York, pursuant to section 1,367 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">This action is brought to recover of the defendants the amount of said judgment upon the undertaking given on appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-10\">At the trial, upon the close of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendants moved for a dismissal of the complaint upon the following grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-11\">I. That no notice of entry of judgment of affirmance had been given, either to the attorney for Curry in the suit of Ennis <em>v. </em>Curry, or to the sureties (who are defendants here), previous to the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-12\">II. That an undertaking to stay proceedings must be delivered to and filed with the justice in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>court. That the undertaking in this action was never delivered to him, but simply approved by him, then \u25a0 immediately taken from him by the person offering it for approval, and filed with the clerk of the court of common pleas, for the mere purpose of perfecting an appeal; and therefore the sureties, at most, are obligated only to the extent of the costs, and the costs having been paid under the order of the court, the plaintiff could recover nothing more in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">III. That no transcript of the judgment against the marshal having been filed in the office of the clerk o\"f the court of common pleas, pursuant to section 8 of chapter 484 of the <em>Laws of </em>1862, the plaintiff could not maintain this action against the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">, IV. That no execution having, been issued and returned to the court of common pleas upon such judgment, the plaintiff could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-7\">The court dismissed the complaint, to which order dismissing.the complaint the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-8\">The court thereupon adjourned for the term. After-wards, plaintiff\u2019s attorney obtained from another judge sitting at Chambers, an order to show cause why a new trial should not be granted upon the minutes of the judge who had presided at the trial. The motion was heard by the judge last referred to, and denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-9\">Plaintiff appealed from the judgment and the order denying motion for new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-10\"><em>L. B. </em>Bunnell, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-11\"><em>Thomas &amp; </em>Wilder, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b128-12\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">The evidence shows that on July 19, 1877, the undertaking- sued upon was duly approved by the justice of the district court, and that thereupon it was filed in the' office of the clerk of the court of common pleas. This was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>sufficient compliance with the statute to operate as a stay upon the judgment appealed from (Jackson <em>v. </em>Smith, 16 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>201).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">By that undertaking the defendants undertook that if the judgment should be affirmed on appeal, and execution issued thereon be returned unsatisfied, they would pay the amount unsatisfied. The judgment was affirmed and the execution issued thereon returned unsatisfied, and that was all the plaintiff was under the pleadings bound to show, in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case (Sperling <em>v. </em>Levy, 1 Daly, 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">By the filing of the transcript in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York, the judgment against Curry became a judgment of the court of common pleas for all purposes of enforcing satisfaction <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 68). The filing of the transcript in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York was necessary, in order to make the judgment against Curry a lien upon his real estate, if he had any, and to enable the plaintiff to issue an execution against both the personal and real property of the judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">If the formal requirement, directing the sheriff to return the execution to the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York, was erroneous, which, however, is not clear since the new Code, it was, as held by Robinson, J., in Ennis <em>v. </em>Curry, a mere informality, which may be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Chapter 484 of the <em>Laws of </em>1862 does not include the case at bar. It provides a cumulative remedy against marshals and their sureties, by suit on their official bonds. Upon proof that a judgment has been recovered against a marshal for official misconduct, that a transcript of such judgment has been filed in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York, and that an execution issued thereon has been unsatisfied, &amp;c., &amp;c., a judge of the court of common pleas may grant leave to sue upon the official bond. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Such suit is to be brought in the marine court, or any of the district courts, and if judgment be recovered, a transcript of such judgment must be filed with the clerk of the court of common pleas, to the end that it may be enforced in that court, as provided for by the said act, and that the clerk of said court, who by law is the custodian of the bond, may cancel the bond to the extent of the judgment. When the bond of any marshal gets entirely canceled by the entry of such judgments against it, the clerk must notify the mayor to that effect, and then the mayor must suspend the marshal. These provisions, it will be seen, do not at all apply to an action against a marshal\u2019s sureties upon an appeal bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The objection that no notice was shown to have been given to the attorney of Curry, or the sureties, the defendants herein, of the entry of the judgment of affirmance, was abandoned bn the argument, and consequently does not require to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs to appellant, to abide the event. But the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion upon the judge\u2019s minutes for a new trial must be affirmed, with costs, because the motion was not made during the term at which the trial took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Curtis, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
