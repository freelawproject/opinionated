This has called for great care in examining the exceptions and the sufficiency of the evidence. There is no benefit in detailing the exceptions, for they involve only general principles that have been often stated. An examination has shown that they were not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">There were many facts that were circumstantial, to support the verdict. As part of the facts, the jury were entitled to draw inferences from the probability of the defense, as it was testified to by defendant\u2019s witnesses. It is not necessary to give all the facts that tended to support the plaintiff\u2019s claim ; but the verdict must have been upheld if the only fact had been that the company gave a promissory note for part of plaintiff\u2019s wages, and handed it, for delivery to plaintiff, to Young, who had employed him on behalf of the company, and who gave him the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
