At their trials, defendants sought to assert the choice of evils defense, ORS 161.200, arguing that the trespass was an emergency measure that was necessary to avoid the imminent deaths of unborn children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the state\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude evidence of the defense on the ground that to allow its assertion would be inconsistent with federal law, specifically <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 US 113, 93 S Ct 705, 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973). Defendants appeal after their convictions, assigning error to the court\u2019s granting of the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Defendants\u2019 first two arguments relate to the propriety of a pretrial exclusionary ruling in these circumstances. Defendants\u2019 arguments were rejected in <em>State v. Whisman, </em>33 Or App 147, 151, 575 P2d 1005 (1978), in which we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cThe intent of the legislature in enacting ORS 161.200 was to \u2018leave it to the trial judge to deal with the matter as he would any other offered evidence.\u2019 <em>See </em>Commentary, Proposed Oregon Criminal Code 20, \u00a7 20 (1970). <em>See also, </em>Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, November 7, 1969, pp 25-30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We went on to say that \u201cthe trial judge must determine in the first instance whether defendant\u2019s evidence relating to the defense of justification is relevant, material, competent and admissible.\u201d 33 Or App at 151. That is what the trial court did here and, in doing so, it acted within the range of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In their remaining assignments, defendants argue that the court erred as a matter of law in excluding evidence in support of their choice of evils defense, ORS 161.200, thereby precluding their arguing their only defense to the jury. The trial court found that defendants had tendered sufficient evidence on all of the elements of the defense, generally, to submit it to the jury but concluded that to submit it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>inconsistent with <em>Roe v. Wade, supra. </em>Although it is not entirely clear, it appears that the court concluded that allowing defendants to present the defense would constitute state action, <em>see, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 US 254, 264, 84 S Ct 710, 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964); <em>Shelley v. Kraemer, </em>334 US 1, 68 S Ct 836, 92 L Ed 1161 (1948), by which the state would be sanctioning defendants\u2019 interference with the women\u2019s federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The trial court, on this record, was correct in holding that the women with whom defendants interfered had a federal constitutional right to be free of interference from the state in seeking an abortion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>the Court held that, through the first trimester of pregnancy, the right to an abortion is absolute. In the second trimester, a state may choose to regulate abortion procedures in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. In the final trimester, the state may regulate abortion for the preservation of the life of the fetus. Defendants offered no evidence at the pretrial hearing that any of the women that they prevented from entering the clinic did not fall within the protection of <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>or that they made any attempt to distinguish among them. Rather, their evidence was that life begins at the time of conception and that, therefore, none of the women had a right to abort their fetuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Because we conclude that there are independent state grounds on which to base our decision, we need not decide whether allowing the choice of evils defenses here would constitute state action, thereby running afoul of <em>Roe v. Wade, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">ORS 161.200 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">\u201c(1) Unless inconsistent with other provisions of chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, defining justifiable use of physical force, or with some other, provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201c(a) That conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u201c(b) The threatened injury is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">\u201c(2) The necessity and justifiability of conduct under subsection (1) of this section shall not rest upon considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the statute, either in its general application or with respect to its application to a particular class arising thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Before considering subsections (a) and (b) of section (1), which set forth the elements of the defense, it is necessary to determine whether, in this case, defendants get past the threshold barrier that the defense is not available if its application would be \u201cinconsistent * * * with some other provision of law.\u201d Although there is little in the legislative history of the statute that helps us to discern what the legislature intended by that language, its conscious choice of very broad language indicates that, if allowing the defense would be inconsistent with any other discernable legislative or other governmental decision, it may not be asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">ORS 161.200 was enacted as part of the 1971 revision of the criminal code. Although the <em>Commentary to the Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, </em>\u00a7 20, states that it was derived from Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.02, New York Revised Penal Law \u00a7 35.05(2) and Michigan Revised Criminal Code \u00a7 605,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the language of section (1) is identical to that of the Michigan statute, with some phrases deleted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>we are concerned, specifying an exception to the availability of the defense, is the broadest of the three sources to which the drafters referred. The New York counterpart provides the least restrictive exception: The defense is available \u201c[ujnless otherwise limited by the ensuing provisions of this article defining justifiable use of physical force[.]\u201d New York Penal Law \u00a7 35.05. The exceptions in Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.02(1) lie somewhere between the other two. It permits the defense if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201c(b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201c(c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Although we agree with Judge Graber\u2019s concurring opinion that the exceptions in the Oregon statute are closer to those in the Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.02(1) than they are to the New York Penal Law \u00a7 35.05(2), the Oregon language, taken from the proposed Michigan statute, is broader than that in either the other two. It is doubtful that the phrase of the Oregon statute, precluding the defense if it would be \u201cinconsistent * * * with some other provision of law,\u201d means the same thing as \u00a7 3.02(1)(c) of the Model Penal Code. ORS 161.200(1) does not require, as does the Model Penal Code, an express legislative foreclosure of the defense; it requires only that the defense be inconsistent with some other provision of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Here, it would be inconsistent with Oregon Laws 1983, chapter 470, section 1, which, after <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>was decided, repealed all of the laws that might inhibit or restrict a woman in obtaining an abortion, <em>former </em>ORS 435.415;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>former </em>ORS 435.425,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>former </em>ORS 435.445,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or mak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ing it a crime to perform or aid in an abortion, <em>former </em>ORS 435.455,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or permitting suspension or revocation of a doctor\u2019s license for performing an abortion. <em>Former </em>ORS 677.190. It would also be inconsistent with ORS 435.475(3), which prohibits any hospital operated by the state or by a political subdivision in the state from denying admission to a woman seeking an abortion. All of those legislative actions make it clear that the Oregon legislature has chosen, not only not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>regulate abortions in any respect,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but also not to interfere with a woman\u2019s right to seek and obtain an abortion. The present state of Oregon law is that a woman\u2019s decision to have an abortion is left to her and her physician. <em>See </em>ORS 435.435 <em>et seq. </em>To permit defendants to prevent or interfere with that freedom of choice would be inconsistent with the \u201cother provisions of law.\u201d It is clear from the legislative action that no interference with a woman\u2019s choice to have an abortion is to be tolerated, and, therefore, the defense is unavailable. ORS 161.200(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> Although defendants were charged and tried separately, the trial court, as a matter of judicial economy, allowed all of them to join in the legal and factual assertions of other defendants in the pretrial proceedings.

I agree with the majority\u2019s result, but not with its analysis. For that reason, I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The majority misunderstands the purpose of the introductory phrase in ORS 161.200(1). When read in full and in context, its purpose is simply to ensure that choice of evils will not override other, more specific justification defenses and will not be available in situations where the legislature has decided not to allow a justification defense at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">ORS 161.200 is derived from Model Penal Code \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>3.02, by way of New York Penal Law \u00a7 35.05(2). <em>See Commentary, Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, </em>\u00a7 20. Section 3.02(1) of the Model Penal Code provides its version of the defense if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\u201c(b) neither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201c(c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Section 35.05(2) of the New York Penal Law provides that the defense is available \u201c[ujnless otherwise limited by the ensuing provisions of this article defining justifiable use of physical force[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">ORS 161.200(1), like New York Penal Law \u00a7 35.05(2), places the exceptions to the choice of evils defense in the introduction to the statute. However, the scope of those exceptions in Oregon is closer to Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.02(1) than to New York\u2019s statute. The Oregon law, as relevant, provides that choice of evils is a defense \u201c[ujnless inconsistent with other provisions of chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, defining justifiable use of physical force, or with some other provision of law[.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first portion reflects Model Penal Code \u00a7 3.02(1) (b); the second portion, on which the majority relies, reflects \u00a7 3.02(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Under the first portion, choice of evils is available unless some other provision of the Criminal Code concerning the justifiable use of physical force supersedes it. Examples of such other defenses include those that immediately follow ORS 161.200. <em>See </em>ORS 161.205 to ORS 161.265. Under the second portion, the Model Penal Code would exclude the defense if the legislature plainly intended to do so; Oregon excludes it if to allow it would be inconsistent with some other provision of law. Although the provisions differ in some respects, both require that the legislature intend to foreclose the use of the defense. <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 US 113, 93 S Ct 705, 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973), of course, does not express Oregon intent, legislative or otherwise. Although the repeal \u00f3f the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>laws regulating abortions might express the legislature\u2019s intent about abortions, that action does not suggest that the legislature meant to affect the availability of the choice of evils defense. No other provision of law is inconsistent with ORS 161.200 in the way that ORS 161.200(1) contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">I would, then, turn to the other requirements of ORS 161.200(1). Defendants concede that they blocked the doors to the clinic and that their acts constituted criminal trespass. They argue that they violated the criminal trespass law in order to prevent the imminent \u201cpublic or private injury\u201d of women entering and having abortions. The evidence at the pretrial hearing showed that 19 abortions were scheduled that day and that the clinic performs about 450 each month. There was also evidence to support defendants\u2019 belief that each abortion involved the taking of a human life. If an abortion can be a \u201cpublic or private injury,\u201d defendants presented evidence from which a jury could find that they had met the requirements of ORS 161.200(1). I would hold as a matter of law, however, that an abortion is not such an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">There is no evidence that the women who were to have abortions on the day of defendants\u2019 trespass were doing so other than voluntarily or that those who were to perform the abortions were compelled to participate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No law prohibited the performance of the contemplated abortions, and no Oregon case has held that a properly performed abortion constitutes a tort.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">A person may legally do anything that is not prohibited; no legislative or judicial authorization is necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, those involved had a right to seek and to perform the abortions that, according to defendants, were public or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>private injuries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accepting defendants\u2019 argument would require us to hold that the alleged immorality of a legal, nontortious act can be a \u201cpublic or private injury.\u201d Nothing in ORS 161.200(1) supports that conclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An action is not an injury within the meaning of ORS 161.200(1) simply because the defendant believes it to be wrong or believes that it <em>ought </em>to be illegal. In arguing otherwise, defendants in effect ask that they be permitted to act on their moral views by violating an otherwise valid law in order to stop another person from doing what is not <em>legally </em>wrongful.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The only condition that defendants would place on their power to interfere with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>legally innocent activities of others is that they must be able to persuade a jury to accept their moral views rather than those of the person whose legal rights they have violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">If defendants\u2019 view is correct, determining the legality of controversial conduct will not be done by the community through the legislative process or by the courts through the application of legal principles. Rather, it will become a subject for after-the-fact determinations by juries, based on jurors\u2019 particular moral views.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The potential effect on those who engage in unpopular but legal activities is obvious. The legislature did not intend so major a change in the location of lawmaking power when it adopted the choice of evils defense. It permitted the jury to balance the injury of violating a law against the benefit of preventing a different injury. It did not intend to permit juries to determine that performing an act that is neither unlawful nor tortious is, nevertheless, an injury by reason of its moral or political content.

That subsection requires that the justifiability of conduct under ORS 161.200(1) not rest on considerations of the morality of the violated statute, \u201ceither in its general application or with respect to its application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder.\u201d <em>See </em>n 8, <em>supra. </em>Defendants base their choice of evils defense on the assertion that the criminal trespass statutes should not apply to their protest, on moral grounds, against abortion.

In his example of the policeman, the officer may well act tortiously if the medical student tells him that he will cause further damage by moving the injured person. Moreover, the harm of the policeman\u2019s conduct does not flow from its moral or political content and is not an inherent quality of all similar conduct, as in the present case. <em>See </em>ORS 161.200(2). The attempt to prevent an execution that is legal in every way, by engaging in criminal trespass and assault, does not give rise to the choice of evils defense for the reasons suggested in this concurrence, because the execution is not a \u201cpublic or private injury\u201d under ORS 161.200(1), even if the condemned person is in fact innocent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> ORS 161.200(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201cThe necessity and justifiability of conduct under subsection (1) of this section shall not rest upon considerations pertaining only to the morality and advisability of the [violated] statute, either in its general application or with respect to its application to a particular class of cases arising thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The commentary notes that, under that subsection, there is no exemption from the criminal trespass statutes for those who invade public offices to protest United States foreign policy.

It unfortunately fails, however, to specifically reject the theory that abortion is not a \u201cpublic or private injury\u201d under the statute, an approach advanced by Judge Graber in her special concurrence. In my view, the majority should have foreclosed any future reliance on that approach, because it unnecessarily restricts the availability of the defense, while implicitly denying that a human fetus may have legal value. I write separately to express that concern and to set forth my own views on the proper application of ORS 161.200.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The rationale of the choice of evils defense is that \u201cthe law ought to promote the achievement of higher values at the expense of lesser values[.]\u201d LaFave <em>&amp; </em>Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>382, \u00a7 50 (1972). Because the legislature cannot possibly foresee and provide exceptions for every situation in which a criminal law will conflict with a higher value, \u201csometimes the greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of the criminal law.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra. </em>Recognizing that fact, the legislature has enacted the choice of evils defense, permitting the jury to weigh competing values \u201caccording to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality\u201d in exceptional situations that the legislature has not itself foreseen and decided. However, \u201cwhen the law has dealt explicitly with the specific situations that present a choice of evils,\u201d the defense does not apply. <em>City of St. Louis v. Klocker, </em>637 SW2d 174, 177 (Mo App 1982); <em>see also </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra. </em>When the legislature already has made specific choices between competing values, there simply is nothing for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Applying the choice of evils defense in defendants\u2019 case would be \u201cinconsistent * * * with some other provision of law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 161.200(1). Consistently with the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 US 113, 93 S Ct 705, 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973), the Oregon legislature has chosen not to regulate abortions in most respects. The legislature has weighed the competing values of fetal life and a woman\u2019s right to privacy and determined that abortion should be permitted. Therefore, the legislature could not have intended abortion to be a type of harm that would justify breaking the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">I am deeply troubled, however, by the theory advanced by Judge Graber that, because abortion is conduct that is neither tortious nor illegal, it cannot constitute a \u201cpublic or private injury\u201d under the statute. That reasoning would withdraw the defense from defendants for whom it was meant to be available. Suppose, for example, that a medical student tried to prevent a policeman from moving an injured man because he believed that the man had a spinal injury that could be worsened by the move.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Judge Graber\u2019s view, assuming that the officer was acting reasonably, the student could not assert the choice of evils defense, because he was seeking to prevent conduct that was \u201cneither unlawful nor tortious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">More dramatic examples are possible. Suppose that an individual obtains information that would prove that a man who is about to be executed is innocent. Unable to reach the governor or take other action in time, he attempts to stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the execution by forcing his way into the prison, knocking down anyone who gets in his way. He is attempting to prevent the lawful and non-tortious conduct of the executioner, conduct which has been given legal protection. Although, under Judge Graber\u2019s analysis, the execution is not a \u201clegal injury\u201d under the statute, few would cont\u00e9nd that the legislature did not intend the choice of evils defense to apply in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In fact, under that view, one could not use the defense to justify \u201cforcibly restraining a person infected with a highly contagious and dangerous disease\u201d unless the ill person\u2019s conduct was either tortious or illegal. <em>Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Code of 1971, </em>\u00a7 20. It might be neither.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet the legislature clearly intended that the defense be available in that situation, because it is given as an example of the statute\u2019s proper application in <em>Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Code of 1971, </em>\u00a7 20.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It has long been clear that \u201c[a] party is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury if there is evidence to support such theory.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>306 Or 599, 604, 761 P2d 1300 (1988) <em>(quoting State v. Newlin, </em>92 Or 589, 594, 182 P 133 (1919)). The choice of evils defense should be available under its plain terms whenever it is not inconsistent with some other provision of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>By arguing that there can be no \u201cinjury\u201d if a defendant has violated an otherwise valid law on the basis of moral views of another\u2019s legal conduct, Judge Graber would inject a defendant\u2019s subjective motivations into the definition of what is a \u201cpublic or private injury.\u201d The fact that a defendant violates a law for moral reasons is relevant to subsection (l)(b), dealing with whether \u201c[t]he threatened injury is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury\u201d or, as Judge Graber points out, to subsection (2), precluding consideration of the morality of the violated statute in deciding the justifiability of the illegal conduct. However, it is <em>not </em>relevant to whether that conduct constitutes a \u201cpublic or private injury.\u201d There are more legitimate bases upon which to deny the defense to defendants, and I see no reason to muddy an already complex area of the law with the special concurrence\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Finally, the analysis creates troubling anomalies. First, if one may only justify preventing the conduct of another if it is wrongful, it is difficult to understand why he would need a defense at all. Second, Judge Graber\u2019s position leads to the conclusion that one may justify trespass to save a VCR, because harm to property is \u201clegal injury.\u201d However, trespass to save what a defendant might view as human life is not justifiable, because destruction of a fetus is not a \u201clegal injury,\u201d at least not in an abortion clinic. Indeed, the argument implies that existence of a fetus has no legal value, a dubious and disquieting proposition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The reason that defendants are barred from asserting the choice of evils defense is <em>not </em>that there is no \u201cprivate or public injury\u201d to a fetus in an abortion. It is that our state, speaking through its democratically elected legislature, already has decided that a woman\u2019s right to procreative freedom outweighs any injury that might exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In short, it is unnecessary and, in my view, unwise to deny defendants an opportunity to assert the choice of evils defense to the jury on the basis that abortion is not a \u201clegal injury.\u201d That rationale could deprive some later defendant of an appropriate defense. Moreover, it is an unnecessary legal fiction with disturbing implications.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-4\">Edmonds, J., joins in this special concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"> According to Judge Graber, the legislative history of ORS 161.200(1) demonstrates that the phrase \u201cinconsistent with * * * some other provision of law\u201d was meant to foreclose use of the choice of evils defense only when it is withdrawn through legislation specifically dealing with its availability. That argument is flawed in two respects. First, the Model Penal Code, on which ORS 161.200 was partially based, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201c(1) Conduct that the actor believes to be necessary to avoid a harm or evil to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>himself or to another is justifiable, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">U* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201c(c) a legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\"><em>Model Penal Code </em>\u00a7 <em>3.02, Official Draft, </em>(1962). That language does not require that the legislature have enacted legislation specifically designed to foreclose the choice of evils defense in a given situation. Rather, it provides that, if a \u201clegislative purpose\u201d to exclude the justification plainly appears, the defense is not available. Such a purpose \u201cplainly appears\u201d when the legislature has passed a law that makes the same value choice as would be required of a jury if the matter were presented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Second, even if we were to accept Judge Graber\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3.02(l)(c) of the Model Penal Code, Oregon has chosen different language, presumably for a good reason. Assigned its plain meaning, that language forecloses the choice of evils defense in every situation in which permitting its use would conflict with some \u201cother provision of law.\u201d As her special concurrence correctly notes, we are bound to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roe v. Wade, supra. </em>Defendants may not assert the defense, because permitting its use would be inconsistent with that law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\"> This was the factual situation in <em>City of Chicago v. Mayer, </em>56 Ill 2d 366, 308 NE2d 601 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-5\"> For example, the person restrained could be delirious or otherwise unaware of the dangers that he posed to others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> Judge Graber apparently concedes that its analysis would foreclose use of the defense in the three specific situations described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> Moreover, it is questionable whether deciding that abortion is not a \u201clegal injury\u201d necessarily bars defendants from using the defense.
