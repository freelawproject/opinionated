We allow the petitions, withdraw our former opinion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We incorporate by reference the facts in our former opinion except to delete this sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201cThe record does not suggest that working around and moving tractors or similar equipment was an ordinary risk of Robbins\u2019 regular work as a farm hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In our opinion we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u201cThe trial court correctly determined that the <em>salvage work </em>was a part of Robbins\u2019 employment. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\"><em>\u201cMoving the tractor, </em>however, was not shown to be an integral part of the salvage project and, therefore, was not a part of Robbins\u2019 employment. On this record, moving the tractor was entirely for the benefit of the fire department, not Marca. * * * He was not acting in the course of his employment when he died.\u201d 99 Or App at 496. (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The insurance policy in effect at the time of the accident provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">\u201cWe do not cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-13\">\u201c(6) Bodily injury to an employee of an insured arising in the course of employment. This exclusion does not apply, however, to bodily injury to domestic employees who are not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">The phrase \u201carising in the course of employment\u201d has the same meaning as in ORS 656.005(7)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>I-L Logging Co. v. Mfgrs. &amp; Whlse. Ind. Exc., </em>202 Or 277, 325, 273 P2d 212, 275 P2d 226 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">In <em>Bos v. Ind. Acc. Com., </em>211 Or 138, 146, 315 P2d 172 (1957), the claimant was injured while returning from working for his employer doing farm work, which at that time was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>exempt from workers\u2019 compensation coverage. He was en route to work that was covered. The court held that the exempt work was but a small portion of his work for employer and merely incidental thereto. The court said, in holding for the claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\">\u201cThe second category of troublesome cases is that which involves employees who go from one class of work to another. Here, as in the other specific exemptions, it is impractical to construe the act in such a way that employees and employers dart in and out of coverage with every momentary change in activity. The great majority of decisions, therefore, attempt to classify the overall nature of the claimant\u2019s duties, disregarding temporary departures from that class of duties even if the injury occurs during one of the departures.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">2. Here, there is no material difference. Had Robbins been killed while returning from the work site, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law would have provided coverage. The fact that Robbins was killed while performing a task that was unrelated to the salvage project just before he and Marca were to depart from the work site did not remove Robbins from the protection of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The dissent relies on <em>Rogers v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 633, 616 P2d 485 (1980), and would hold that it has implicitly overruled <em>Bos v. Ind. Acc. Com., supra. Rogers </em>holds that, if any injury of an employee has a unitary work-connected relationship to his employment, then it is compensable. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cIn adopting a unitary \u2018work-connection\u2019 approach in place of the customary mechanistic two-stage method of analysis, it is not our intention to substantially change fundamental Workers\u2019 Compensation law.\u201d 289 Or at 643.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\"><em>Bos v. Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>is not inconsistent with fundamental workers\u2019 compensation law. It was decided under <em>former </em>ORS 656.202(1), which used the two-step analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">We hold that the task performed by Robbins, although it was a departure from his usual duties, was in the course of his employment and that the trial court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>held that Progressive had no duty to defend or indemnify Marca in the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-16\"> ORS 656.005(7)(a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-17\">\u201cA \u2018compensable injury\u2019 is an accidental injury, or accidental injury to prosthetic appliances, arising out of and in the course of employment requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death; an injury is accidental if the result is an accident, whether or not due to accidental means.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-10\"> We have used this rule in two recent cases in which the issue was whether the claimant was a \u201cnon subject worker\u201d as defined in ORS 656.027(2). <em>Gordon v. Farrell, </em>85 Or App 590, 593-94, 737 P2d 654, <em>rev den </em>304 Or 55 (1987); <em>Anfilofieff v. SAIF, </em>52 Or App 127, 627 P2d 1274 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b769-5\">GRABER, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">I dissent. Although I agree with the majority\u2019s deletion of the next-to-last sentence of our opinion, I would adhere to that opinion with that modification. The majority has answered the wrong question and has thereby deprived Robbins\u2019 estate of benefits to which it is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The majority errs in applying <em>Bos v. Ind. Acc. Com., </em>211 Or 138, 315 P2d 172 (1957). That case, as well as the two later ones that the majority cites, did <em>not </em>consider the issue in the present case: whether the claimant\u2019s injury arose in the course of employment. The question in those cases was whether the claimant was a \u201cnonsubject worker,\u201d as defined in ORS 656.027(2). Only in that context does it make sense to \u201cattempt to classify the overall nature of the claimant\u2019s duties,\u201d 100 Or App at 730, rather than to examine the specific connection between the injury and the employment. Indeed, the majority shows that it has confused the concepts of covered worker and compensable injury when it says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">\u201cThe fact that Robbins was killed while performing a task that was unrelated to the salvage project just before he and Marca were to depart from the work site does not remove Robbins from the protection of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d 100 Or App at 730.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">There is no dispute that Robbins was a covered worker. The only issue is whether his fatal injuries occurred in the course of his employment and were, therefore, excluded from coverage under Marca\u2019s liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The proper test focuses, not on the worker, as in <em>Bos v. Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>but on the injury. We cited <em>Rogers v. SAIF, </em>289 Or 633, 642, 616 P2d 485 (1980), and explained the <em>Rogers </em>test in detail, in <em>Preston v. SAIF, </em>88 Or App 327, 330, 745 P2d 783 (1987). In our opinion, we analyzed the application of <em>Rogers, </em>and the majority does not suggest that we did so incorrectly. Instead, it applies a standard for construing a different section of the statute. Even if the <em>Bos </em>analysis were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>somehow relevant, <em>Rogers </em>controls to the extent that the two cases are inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Robbins was not acting in the course of his employment when he died. The majority distorts the workers\u2019 compensation statutes when it decides otherwise. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
