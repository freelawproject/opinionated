Where a landowner brought an action of trover for certain cottonseed and bales of cotton grown ou his land by another person, and the evidence as to the contract under which the cotton was grown was the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he furnished the land, stock, tools, and supplies for the other party to make the crop, and the other party furnished the labor, and the plaintiff was to receive \u201cas rent\u201d a half of the cotton and two thirds of the corn and fodder, and that these were the terms on which he \u201crented\u201d the land to the other party, it was error to grant a nonsuit on the ground that the evidence did not show that the relation of landlord and cropper existed between the parties. The legal relation of the parties is to be determined, not by the statement that the land was \u201crented,\u201d or that the owner was to receive a part of the crop \u201cas rent,\u201d but by the entire contract; and the testimony tended to show that the legal relation of the party who did the work was that of \u201ccropper.\u201d</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b752-7\">Decided July 26, 1917.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-8\">Trover; from Gordon, superior court\u2014Judge Tarver, March 7, 1917.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b752-9\"><em>Starr &amp; Paschall, </em>for plaintiff, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoFM\">Civil Code (1910), \u00a7 3707; <em>Hancoclc </em>v. <em>Boggus, </em>111 <em>Ga. </em>884-5 (2); <em>Appling </em>v. <em>Odom, </em>46 <em>Ga. </em>583; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Passmore, </em>9 <em>Ga.

E. 970). The person employed to work for a part of the crop under such a contract is a cropper, and '\u201cthe title to the crop, subject to the interest of the cropper therein, and the possession of the land, remain in the owner.\u201d' Civil Code (1910), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 3707, 3705-6. In the present case the plaintiff sought to recover in trover certain cottonseed- and bales of cotton grown on his land by one Davis, and admitted to be -in the defendant\u2019s possession. The plaintiff testified, that he furnished Davis \u201cthe land, stock, tools, and supplies for Davis to make a crop for the year 1915. All he furnished was the labor. I received one half of the cotton and two thirds of the corn and fodder. These were the terms on which I rented him the land.\u201d In response to a question propounded by the court the plaintiff said-: \u201cI rented Davis land on the terms above stated. I was to receive as rent one half of the cotton and two thirds of the corn and fodder.\u201d On redirect examination the witness said, \u201cI rented Davis land on the terms above stated.\u201d His counsel then put the following question to him: \u201cYou furnished land, stock, tools, and supplies, and all he furnished was the labor?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes.\u201d This evidence of the plaintiff strongly tended to establish the relationship of landlord and cropper between himself and the other party to the contract. The fact that he testified that he \u201crented\u201d the land to the other party was in the nature of a conclusion of the witness, and did not, in view of the rest of his evidence, conclusively show that the relation of landlord and tenant existed between himself and Davis. The facts stated in his testimony, that he furnished the land, stock, tools, and. supplies for the other party to make a crop, and that the latter furnished only the labor, tended to establish the relationship of landlord and cropper. The first great essential in the interpretation of a contract, whether written or-oral, is to arrive at what was. the real intention of the parties. It is not every contract which uses the word \u201crent,\u201d by way of description of what is to be paid for the use of property, that creates, in the case of real estate, the relationship of landlord and tenant. To determine what the real status between the parties is, it is necessary to look behind mere technical terms used in the contract and gather from the entire contract what is the legal relation established between them. <em>Blitch &amp; Newton </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>96 <em>Ga. </em>606 (24 S. E. 147) ; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>85 <em>Ga. </em>747, 748 (11 S. E. 833, 9 L. R. A. 373).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">It follows from what is said above that the trial judge erred in granting a nonsuit on the ground, stated in the bill of exceptions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that \u201cthe evidence did not show that the relation of landlord and cropper existed between Hiker and Davis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AYgF\"><em>Jenkins and </em>Bloodworth, <em>JJ., concur.</em></judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
