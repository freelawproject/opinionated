(Kelly), and CNA Insurance Company (CNA) move for review of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner\u2019s (commissioner) denial of their motion for articulation. We conclude that the motion for review is improper and therefore dismiss the motion for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this motion. After an injury to the plaintiffs spine in 1989, the plaintiffs employer at that time, Furniture Concepts, Inc. (Furniture Concepts), accepted the com-pensability of the injury. The plaintiff underwent surgery and, thereafter, did not return to work with Furniture Concepts. He later took a job with Kelly. While working for Kelly in 1993, the plaintiff sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>further injuries to his spine as a result of another accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Although Kelly and its insurer, CNA, accepted com-pensability for the 1993 injury, they sought apportionment of the claim with Furniture Concepts and its insurer, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They argued that the 1989 accident and the 1993 accident were concurrent causes contributing to the plaintiffs injury. The commissioner denied Kelly and CNA\u2019s request for apportionment and found that there were two separate identifiable traumatic incidents. Kelly and CNA appealed from that decision to the board. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">After the appeal was filed, Kelly and CNA filed a motion requesting that the commissioner articulate her decision. The commissioner denied the motion for articulation. Kelly and CNA then filed the present motion in this court for review of the commissioner\u2019s denial of the motion for articulation. The motion argues that the commissioner never made a finding as to whether both accidents were contributing causes to the plaintiffs current injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In <em>Plati </em>v. <em>United Parcel Service, </em>33 Conn. App. 490, 636 A.2d 395 (1994), this court indicated that it would have been proper for the plaintiff-appellant to file a motion for articulation of the commissioner\u2019s decision and a motion for review, if necessary, to create an adequate record for review for this court. The appeal in <em>Plati, </em>however, was taken directly from the commissioner\u2019s decision to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Plati </em>can be distinguished from this action because this appeal was not taken directly from the commissioner\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a (b) (2), but instead was taken from the board\u2019s decision affirming the commissioner\u2019s ruling, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite Kelly and CNA\u2019s contention that the appeal is taken from both the commissioner\u2019s and the board\u2019s decisions, \u00a7 31-301b provides for an appeal to this court in a workers\u2019 compensation case from only the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Under the facts of this case, a motion for review filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4054 is not proper. Section 4054 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the action of the trial judge as regards rectification of the appeal or articulation under Sec. 4051, may within ten days of the issuance of notice of the order sought to be reviewed, make a written motion for review to the court, to be filed with the appellate clerk, and the court may, upon such a motion, direct any action it deems proper. . . .\u201d In <em>Reising </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp./Electric Boat Division, </em>38 Conn. App. 637, 638, 661 A.2d 1042 (1995), we concluded that a motion for review of the board\u2019s denial of a motion for articulation is improper as the board acts not as a trial court, but as an appellate court in workers\u2019 compensation appeals. In this case, the motion for articulation was directed to the commissioner, who does act as a trial judge. This appeal is not, however, taken from the commissioner\u2019s decision, but instead is taken from the board\u2019s decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Because this appeal is taken from the board\u2019s decision, the issues on appeal involve review of only the board\u2019s action. Although this court may consider the commissioner\u2019s decision on appeal, we would consider it only in light of the action taken by the board as to that decision. For these reasons we conclude that the motion for review is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The motion for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The Second Injury Fund is also a defendant to this proceeding, in addition to Kelly, CNA, Furniture Concepts and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny employee who is so discharged or discriminated against may ...
