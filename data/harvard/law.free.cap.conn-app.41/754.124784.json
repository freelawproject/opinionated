The plaintiff, together with the counterclaim defendants, Aglino Masotta and Edward Masotta, also appeal from the judgment rendered against them in favor of the defendant on the defendant\u2019s counterclaims. The plaintiff and the Masot-tas<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claim that the trial court improperly (1) found that the Masottas were the makers of the loans rather than investors in the loans, (2) concluded that the mortgage assignment needed to be recorded, (3) concluded that the loan was unconscionable, (4) concluded that Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Acts 1993, No. 93-130, \u00a7 1 (8),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not apply, (5) concluded that the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> negates the common law requirement of tender back necessary effectively to rescind a transaction, and (6) failed to hold an evidentiary hearing before awarding attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment except as to the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, which we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. The defendant is the owner of a three-family house in Bridgeport. When the defendant needed a loan to repair a leaking roof, she was referred to the plaintiff to apply for a second mortgage. On July 16,1990, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a loan agreement secured by a second mortgage. The amount of the loan was $30,000 with an interest rate of 20 percent. The note required eleven monthly payments of $500 with a final balloon payment of $30,500 on July 20, 1991. In the defendant\u2019s loan application, she stated that her monthly income was $1126.67 and that she owed a monthly amount of $1011 to People\u2019s Bank on a first mortgage. The plaintiff placed the defendant in a class C category that did not require income verification. When the defendant was unable to make the balloon payment in July, 1991, the plaintiff arranged to rewrite the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On July 17, 1991, the parties entered into another loan agreement that allowed the defendant to fulfill her obligation of repayment under the July, 1990 mortgage. The amount of the note in this transaction was $44,000 with an interest rate of 20 percent. The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>required to make eleven monthly payments of $733.33 with a final balloon payment of $44,733.33 on July 22, 1992. Both mortgage transactions required the defendant, as a condition of credit, to pay one year\u2019s interest in advance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On July 22,1992, the defendant was unable to make the required balloon payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">On November 9, 1992, the plaintiff brought a foreclosure action. The defendant filed special defenses, alleging that the mortgage was a scheme to defraud, was unconscionable, lacked consideration because the plaintiff failed to release the July 16, 1990 mortgage, and violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 36-2247.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant also pleaded as special defenses that she had rescinded the loan after learning that the mortgage violated TILA, that the plaintiff had fraudulently concealed that it was acting as a broker, and that the plaintiff had made assignments of the mortgage to defraud the defendant of ownership of her property. The defendant also filed counterclaims alleging that the plaintiff and the Masottas violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7\u00a7 36-224\u00cd, 37-4,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>37-9,\u00ae TILA, and the Connecticut</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The trial court found that the Masottas were the real parties in interest and that the plaintiff lacked standing to maintain the foreclosure action and, therefore, dismissed the plaintiffs claim. The trial court further found that the mortgage transaction was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The trial court also found that the plaintiff and the Masottas violated TILA because they had failed to include the future assignment recording fees as a part of the finance charge. Based on the TILA violation, the trial court found that the defendant had executed a timely rescission pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635 (a), which had terminated the plaintiff\u2019s and the Masottas\u2019 security interest in the property. The trial court determined that because the plaintiff and the Masottas had failed to accept the defendant\u2019s rescission pursuant to the procedures of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635 (b), the plaintiff and the Masottas were barred from foreclosing on the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The trial court further ruled that the plaintiff and the Masottas violated \u00a7 <em>36-2241 </em>by charging the defendant a prepaid finance charge in excess of 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. As a result of this violation, the trial court ordered the plaintiff and the Masottas to pay $2975 to the defendant. The trial court ruled that the violations by the plaintiff and the Masottas of TILA and \u00a7 36-224Z constituted a violation of CUTPA. The trial court awarded the defendant $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees stemming from the CUTPA violation and granted the defendant an injunction \u201cagainst Family Financial Services, Inc., and the Masottas from pursuing now or hereafter any relief or foreclosure of the mortgage and the mortgage debt . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The plaintiff and the Masottas first claim that the trial court improperly found that the Masottas were the makers of the loan. The plaintiff and the Masottas argue that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">\u201c[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The trial court found that \u201c[b]oth Masottas are the real parties in interest, acting under the aegis of Family Financial Services, Inc.\u201d The trial court based that finding on the following evidence: (1) at trial, the attorney who had represented the plaintiff at the closing testified that the $44,000 loan amount came from Aglino Masotta and that none of it came from the plaintiff; (2) Andrew Forte, the plaintiffs vice president, responded to interrogatories by denying that the plaintiff ever sold or assigned the mortgage; and (3) Forte testified that the Masottas did not sign the document purportedly assigning their interest to the plaintiff and failed to swear before a notary public.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by evidence produced at trial and is not clearly erroneous. On the basis of the trial court\u2019s findings and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>record, we cannot conclude that the trial court improperly found that the Masottas were the makers of the loan in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The plaintiff and the Masottas next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the mortgage assignment needed to be recorded. The plaintiff and the Masottas claim that General Statutes \u00a7 47-10 does not apply to mortgages. The plaintiff and the Masottas argue that the trial court improperly relied on \u00a7 47-10 to support its determination that the plaintiff lacked standing because it was not the holder of the mortgage debt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. On August 12, 1993, a pretrial hearing was held on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in which she claimed that the plaintiff lacked standing. After the pretrial hearing, the plaintiff amended its complaint to allege that the plaintiff had assigned the mortgage note and deed to Aglino Masotta and that on September 14, 1993, he assigned the note and deed back to the plaintiff. When the trial resumed on March 29, 1994, the defendant challenged the purported assignment of September 14, 1993, as invalid because Forte had forged the signatures of Aglino and Edward Masotta on that assignment. Forte purportedly had a power of attorney to sign real estate documents for the Masottas. In addition, the assignment in question disclosed an acknowledgment by a notary public, who was an employee of the plaintiff, to the effect that the Masottas had appeared personally before him and acknowledged that the assignment was their free act and deed. The trial court found, in fact, that neither of the Masottas had appeared before the notary public to be sworn. The trial court also found that Forte had forged the signatures of the Masottas. Finally, the trial court found that Forte had neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>signed nor acknowledged the assignment, and that he did not place the power of attorney on the land records together with the assignment of September 14,1993, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 47-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 47-10 provides that \u201c[n]o conveyance shall be effectual to hold any land against any other person but the grantor and his heirs, unless recorded on the records of the town in which the land lies. <em>When a conveyance is executed by a power of </em>attorney, <em>the power of attorney shall be recorded with the deed, </em>unless it has already been recorded in the records of the town in which the land lies and reference to the power of attorney is made in the deed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cBecause the wording of \u00a7 47-10 has remained in essentially the same form since the 1800s, we may presume legislative acquiescence in our interpretation of the mortgage lien statute. \u2018[I]ts subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation.\u2019 <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 134, 527 A.2d 672 (1987), quoting <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987).\u201d <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Garofalo, </em>219 Conn. 810, 817, 595 A.2d 341 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\u201cMortgages have always been regarded as conveyances of land within the meaning of the recording statute. . . . The assignment is in effect a conveyance of the land included in the mortgage. . . . That an assignment of a mortgage falls within the purview of the recording statute follows from the nature of such an instrument . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Second National Bank </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>121 Conn. 263, 267-68, 184 A. 386 (1936); <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Garofalo, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 816 n.8; <em>Cottiero </em>v. <em>Ifkovic, </em>35 Conn. App. 682, 690, 647 A.2d 9, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 938, 651 A.2d 262 (1994). Our courts have clearly interpreted \u00a7 47-10 to apply to the assignment of mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>gages. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly found that \u00a7 47-10 applies to the purported assignment by the Masottas to the plaintiff and that the assignment and the power of attorney needed to be recorded on the land records in order to be effective against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The plaintiff and the Masottas next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the mortgage loan transaction at issue was unconscionable. The plaintiff argues that the court lacked an evidentiary basis to support its finding of procedural and substantive uncon-scionability. We conclude from the facts as found by the trial court, and as supported by the evidence in the record, that the trial court correctly concluded that the mortgage transaction in question was unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Our first consideration is the standard of review for a claim of unconscionability. \u201c[T]he question of unconscionability is a matter of law to be decided by the court based on all the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Iamartino </em>v. <em>Avallone, </em>2 Conn. App. 119, 125, 477 A.2d 124, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 802, 478 A.2d 1025 (1984); <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 87, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992). Our review on appeal is not limited to determining whether there has been clear error. <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 88; <em>Texaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goldart, </em>206 Conn. 454, 461, 538 A.2d 1017 (1988). \u201c[T]he ultimate determination of whether a transaction is unconscionable is a question of law, not a question of fact, and . . . the trial court\u2019s determination on that issue is subject to a plenary review on appeal. It also means, however, that the factual findings of the trial court that underlie that determination are entitled to the same deference on appeal that other factual findings command. Thus, those findings must stand unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pan-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>dolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>[supra, 181 Conn. 221-22].\u201d <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the doctrine of unconscionability is to prevent oppression and unfair surprise. J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts (3d Ed.) \u00a7 9-40.\u201d <em>Edart Truck Rental Corp. </em>v. <em>B. Swirsky &amp; Co., </em>23 Conn. App. 137, 142, 579 A.2d 133 (1990). \u201cAs applied to real estate mortgages, the doctrine of unconscionability draws heavily on its counterpart in the Uniform Commercial Code which, although formally limited to transactions involving personal property, furnishes a useful guide for real property transactions. <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 762, 463 A.2d 242 (1983); <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>180 Conn. 491, 495, 429 A.2d 946 (1980).\u201d <em>Iamartino </em>v. <em>Avallone, </em>supra, 2 Conn. App. 125. \u201cAs Official Comment 1 to \u00a7 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code suggests, \u2018[t]he basic test is whether, in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 495-96. Unconscionability is determined on a case-by-case basis, \u201ctaking into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 89; <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 495-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The trial court found as follows: (1) the defendant had a limited knowledge of the English language, was uneducated and did not read very well; (2) the defendant\u2019s financial situation made it apparent that she could not reasonably expect to repay the second mortgage; (3) at the closing, the defendant was not represented by an attorney and was rushed by the plaintiffs attorney to sign the documents; (4) the defendant was not informed until the last moment that, as a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>credit, she was required to pay one year\u2019s interest in advance; and (5) there was an absence of meaningful choice on the part of the defendant. Finally, in determining unconscionability, the court also took into account the fact that the plaintiff failed to disclose to the defend- ' ant that the real lenders in this transaction were the Masottas. We conclude that these findings are adequately supported by the evidence in the record and are not clearly erroneous. On that basis, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that this transaction was proeedurally unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The plaintiff and the Masottas next argue that the mortgage was not substantively unconscionable. The plaintiff and the Masottas argue that the defendant planned to sell her house and use the proceeds of that sale to make the balloon payment. The defendant testified that she attempted to sell the property before receiving the loan and that she thought about selling the property. She did not testify, however, that it was her plan to sell the property in order to pay off the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The trial court found that the terms of the mortgage were unreasonably favorable to the plaintiff. The trial court also found that the defendant\u2019s monthly income was $1126.67 and that she owed $1011 monthly to People\u2019s Bank on her first mortgage. On the basis of those findings, the trial court concluded that it was obvious that the defendant would not be able to make the required balloon payment at the end of the year. Finally, the trial court found that the defendant lacked a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and the determination of substantive unconscionability is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The plaintiff and the Masottas next claim that the language of No. 93-130 of the 1993 Public Acts (P.A. 93-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>130), is sufficiently clear to demonstrate the legislative intent that it applies to pending actions. The plaintiff and the Masottas argue that the legislature clearly and unequivocally intended to apply the amendment to pending actions by including the following language: \u201cThe provisions of this subsection shall apply to all loans negotiated before, on and after the effective date of this act.\u201d P.A. 93-130, \u00a7 8. If P.A. 93-130 applies to this action, it would eliminate the defendant\u2019s cause of action based on a violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 36-224\u00cd because the prepaid finance charge would be included within the principal amount of the loan and, therefore, the prepaid finance charge would no longer exceed 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan. Contra <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 80.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree with the plaintiff and the Masottas\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">In determining the intended effect of an enactment on earlier legislation, two questions must be asked. \u201c \u2018First, was the act intended to clarify existing law or to change it? Second, if the act was intended to make a change, was the change intended to operate retroactively?\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 277, 528 A.2d 760 (1987), quoting <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 540, 489 A.2d 363 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>In order to determine whether this public act should be characterized as clarifying legislation, we look to the legislative history to determine the legislative intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 278. To the extent that legislative history can illustrate whether an act is clarifying legislation, the legislative history of P.A. 93-130 demonstrates that the legislature intended that act to clarify the definition of the term \u201cprincipal amount of the loan\u201d contained in \u00a7 36-224Z. Senator Martin M. Looney explained: \u201cThe bill deals with the clarification of the definition of principal amount of a loan and the calculation of points to include amounts financed.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1993 Sess., p. 2089. Bob Focht, director of the consumer credit division of the state banking department, explained: \u201cThis bill would clarify that the principal amount of the loan, for purposes of calculating points, would be the gross loan amount the borrower is obligated to repay, including any prepaid finance charge and other charges which are financed.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 1, 1993 Sess., p. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Having decided that P.A. 93-130 is clarifying legislation, we do not reach the second question of whether the change was to apply retroactively. Where an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 284. We note, however, that the retroactive nature of clarifying legislation has limits. Id. It \u201cmust not operate in a manner that would unjustly abrogate vested rights.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 426, 518 A.2d 49 (1986). A vested right is one that equates to legal or equitable title to the present or future enjoyment of property, or to the present or future enforcement of a demand, or a legal exception from a demand made by another. <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 71, 441 A.2d 68 (1981); <em>Rudewicz v. Gagne, </em>22 Conn. App. 285, 290, 582 A.2d 463 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>(1990). An enactment cannot be applied retroactively where, as here, a vested right intervenes. Id. In this situation, the clarifying legislation would produce a change in the substantial vested rights enjoyed by the defendant and would effectively deprive her of her cause of action under \u00a7 36-224L <em>DeAlmeida </em>v. <em>M.C.M. Stamping Corp., </em>29 Conn. App. 441, 451, 615 A.2d 1066 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Our analysis of the legislative history of P.A. 93-130 further reveals that when the legislature considered the amendment, a question arose as to whether there were any individuals who might have a cause of action available, as a result of <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 80, who would lose that right upon the amendment\u2019s enactment. The response indicated a lack of knowledge on the part of the legislature concerning the defendant\u2019s pending action. In addition, there is no express declaration in either the legislative history or the amendment declaring the legislature\u2019s intent that the act should apply to pending actions. To apply this amendment retroactively, when the legislature clearly failed to contemplate its effect on the defendant\u2019s pending action, would unjustly abrogate the defendant\u2019s vested rights. We conclude that the trial court did not improperly refuse to apply P.A. 93-130 retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The plaintiff and the Masottas next claim that TILA does not negate the requirement of \u201ctender back\u201d to rescind a transaction. They argue that in order for the defendant to rescind the mortgage in question, she must restore the plaintiff to his position prior to entering into the loan agreement. The plaintiff and the Masottas argue that the defendant\u2019s failure to restore the plaintiff to the status quo rendered the defendant\u2019s attempt at rescission ineffective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AdAm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The following additional facts found by the trial court are relevant to our resolution of this issue. In the July, 1990 and July, 1991 mortgage loan transactions, the plaintiff charged the defendant fees of $20 and $15, respectively, for the recording of the future assignments of the mortgage. The plaintiff failed to include as finance charges the amounts attributed to the future assignment recording fees. As a result of failing to include the assignment recording fees in the finance charges, the plaintiff underdisclosed the amount of the finance charges by a total of $35, thereby violating TILA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638 (a) (3).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On June 4, 1993, the defendant, in writing, rescinded the mortgage transaction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635 (a) and (f).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not accept the defendant\u2019s rescission. The plaintiffs failure to acknowledge the rescission or to take proper actions after receipt of the notice of rescission within the twenty day period allowed by statute, terminated its security interest and prevented the mortgage from being foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Title 15 of the United States Code, \u00a7 1635 (a), provides in pertinent part that \u201cthe obligor shall have the right to rescind the transaction until . . . the delivery of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>information and rescission forms required under this section together with a statement containing the material disclosures required under this subchapter ... by notifying the creditor, in accordance with regulations of the Board, of his intention to do so. . . .\u201d After an obligor elects to exercise the right to rescind, the effect of that decision and the subsequent exchange of property is governed by \u00a7 1635 (b), which provides: \u201cWhen an obligor exercises his right to rescind under subsection (a) of this section, he is not liable for any finance or other charge, and any security interest given by the obligor, including any such interest arising by operation of law, becomes void upon such a rescission. Within 20 days after receipt of a notice of rescission, the creditor shall return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, downpayment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. If the creditor has delivered any property to the obligor, the obligor may retain possession of it. <em>Upon the performance of the creditor\u2019s obligations under this section, </em>the obligor shall tender the property to the creditor, except that if return of the property in kind would be impracticable or inequitable, the obligor shall tender its reasonable value. . . . The procedures prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by a court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\u201cThe sequence of rescission and tender set forth in \u00a7 1635 (b) is a reordering of the common law mies governing rescission. Under common law rescission, the rescinding party must first tender the property that he has received under the agreement before the contract may be considered void. [17A Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7 590 (1991)]. Once the rescinding party has performed his obligations, the contract becomes void and the rescinding party may then bring an action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>replevin or assumpsit to insure that the non-rescinding party will restore him to the position that he was in prior to entering into the agreement, i.e., return earnest money or monthly payments and void all security interests. Id., [\u00a7 604].\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Homestake Mortgage Co., </em>968 F.2d 1137, 1140 (11th Cir. 1992). \u201cUnder Connecticut law, as a condition precedent to rescission, the parties to a contract must be restored to their original position as nearly as possible.\u201d <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>202 Conn. 106, 113, 520 A.2d 162 (1987). \u201cUnder \u00a7 1635 (b), however, all that the [obligor] need do is notify the creditor of his intent to rescind. The agreement is then automatically rescinded . . . .\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Homestake Mortgage Co., </em>supra, 1140; <em>Aquino </em>v. <em>Public Finance Consumer Discount Co., </em>606 F. Sup. 504, 507-508 (E.D. Pa. 1985).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We conclude that the trial court properly interpreted and applied 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635 (a) and (b). The tender of property is not required by \u00a7 1635 (b) as a condition preceding rescission. The notice given by the defendant properly rescinded the transaction. The failure of the plaintiff to accept the valid rescission by the defendant nullified the plaintiffs security interest. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>plaintiffs security interest became void, it was barred from foreclosing on the mortgage. The trial court correctly concluded that TILA does not require tender back in order effectively to rescind the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The plaintiff and the Masottas claim finally that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant because it failed to hold an evidentiary hearing. The trial court determined that the plaintiff violated CUTPA by engaging in unfair, unethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous conduct. Because General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) expressly permits the court to award attorney\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the defendant clearly is entitled to such fees. The plaintiff and the Masottas argue, however, that the trial court\u2019s award does not have an evidentiary basis. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that it is an \u201cundisputed requirement that the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees and costs must be proven by an appropriate evidentiary showing.\u201d <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 121, quoting <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 85, 91, 438 A.2d 828 (1981). In <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>supra, 121, the defendant\u2019s attorneys submitted affidavits detailing the time spent on the case, the tasks performed and the fees charged. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney objected to the admission of one of the affidavits and was overruled by the trial court, which allowed the affidavits to be filed but did not admit them as evidence. Id. Our Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he parties . . . were given no opportunity to address this issue at trial. . . . [T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>plaintiff was denied the undisputed right to litigate fully the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fees sought by the defendants\u2019 counsel\u201d; id.; and remanded the case fully to address the issue at a further hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The defendant raised the issue of an evidentiary hearing at trial. In response to this, the trial court decided to postpone such a hearing until after a decision in the case was made.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff, the Masottas and the defendant submitted sworn affidavits of attorney\u2019s fees to the trial court, no opportunity was ever presented for either side to litigate that issue. The issue of attorney\u2019s fees must be fully addressed at a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\"> The appellants did not appeal' at oral argument and are deemed to have waived it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\"> The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs foreclosure action based on a finding of lack of standing, leaving the plaintiff as counterclaim defendant. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 102 and General Statutes \u00a7 52-110, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s morion to cite in the Masottas as counterclaim defendants. The appellants in this case are the plaintiff and the Masottas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> Public Acts 1993, No. 93-130, provides in pertinent part: \u201c(8) \u2018Principal amount of the loan\u2019 means the gross loan amount the borrower is obligated to repay including any prepaid finance charge and other charges which are financed.

As a result of this finding, the court held that the lender violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 36-224Z (a) because the prepaid finance charge exceeded 10 percent of the principal amount of the loan, the maximum allowable under the statute. <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 104-105 (court calculated prepaid finance charge at 11 percent).
