The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Any person who possesses or has under his control any quantity of any narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, may be imprisoned not more than seven years or be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
