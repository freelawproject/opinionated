The defendant also claims that General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (f) is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to the facts of this case. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On February 19, 1993, at approximately 12:55 a.m., the defendant was driving a pickup truck on a public highway in Manchester. As he approached the entrance ramp of Interstate Route 384, he traveled at a noticeably slow speed. The speed of the defendant\u2019s vehicle then fluctuated between forty and fifty miles per hour, and the vehicle began swerving between lanes, from right to center to breakdown lane. The truck also had its right turn signal on. Robert Leduc, a Manchester police officer, observed this erratic driving and activated his strobe and flashing lights to stop the defendant. The defendant did not respond to the lights or to the police vehicle\u2019s siren. The defendant, upon exiting the highway, brought his vehicle to a stop. Leduc approached the defendant after notifying the dispatcher by radio of his location. The officer also activated an audio-video camera that was attached to his cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Leduc asked the defendant for his license. The defendant\u2019s eyes were glassy, he had an odor of beer or liquor on his breath and his motions were awkward. Leduc asked the defendant to exit his vehicle to have sobriety tests administered. Upon getting out of the truck, the defendant had the front of his trousers open and appeared to have urinated in his pants. The officer also observed that the defendant slurred his speech and swayed when he walked.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The officer administered a variety of sobriety tests to the defendant. The defendant could not stand on one leg with his arms by his side for thirty seconds, nor could he walk nine straight steps, heel-to-toe with arms straight out. The defendant failed to perform a finger-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>to-nose test that requires a person to tilt his head back with his eyes shut and to touch his finger to his nose a number of times. The defendant also could not satisfactorily perform, to the officer\u2019s observation, a horizontal gaze nystagmus test. At this point, the defendant was placed under arrest and transported to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The defendant first argues that statements he made at the police station, after he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, should have been excluded from evidence under the derivative evidence doctrine. He claims his rights to due process and against self-incrimination pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The facts relative to this claim are as follows. At the scene of the stop, the defendant stated that he had consumed four beers at the Cactus Club between 6:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. This remark was made subsequent to Leduc\u2019s comments to the defendant that \u201cYou\u2019re going to jail, I think\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re cocked.\u201d During the administering of the sobriety tests, Leduc questioned the defendant about his activities earlier in the evening. The trial court suppressed the defendant\u2019s statements, finding that the officer\u2019s comments were the functional equivalent to a formal arrest and, therefore, Leduc\u2019s questions constituted custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Thereafter, the defendant was transported to the police station and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response to Leduc\u2019s continued questioning, the defendant stated that he had been drinking beer at the Cactus Club from about 6:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The trial court excluded all inculpatory statements made by the defendant prior to having his rights read to him at the police station. The defendant claims that the statements made after the <em>Miranda </em>warnings should also have been suppressed because of the taint from the illegal first \u201cconfession.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendant does not claim a violation of his federal constitutional rights; see <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985); but only of his constitutional rights to due process and against self-incrimination under our state constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He argues that we should not adopt the <em>Elstad </em>standard, but, rather, we should apply a \u201cbreak in the stream of events\u201d test on the issue of derivative evidence. Under the <em>Elstad </em>standard, an initial statement given voluntarily while in custody without <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not automatically require the exclusion of a statement made after <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given. If the subsequent statement is found to have been voluntarily made, it is admissible unless the initial statement was coerced. When the initial statement, given while a defendant is in custody without having received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, is coerced, however, the court must determine whether the coercion has carried over to the statement given after <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given by examining \u201cthe time that passes between confessions, the change in place of interrogations, and the change in the identity of the interrogators . . . .\u201d Id., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Under the \u201cbreak in the stream of events\u201d standard, confessions made after <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>where there has also been a prewarning confession are presumptively inadmissible unless it can be shown that due to the \u201cbreak in the stream of events\u201d the taint from the earlier prewarning confession has been removed from the subsequent postwarning confession. This test is employed under the federal constitution only when the <em>pre-Miranda </em>statement was coerced. It is used to determine whether the statement given after <em>Miranda </em>warnings should be excluded. See <em>Westover </em>v. <em>United States, </em>decided with <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 494-97, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Under <em>Elstad, </em>a second or subsequent statement will not be presumed to have been coerced merely because the defendant knew that \u201c \u2018the cat\u2019 was already \u2018out of the bag.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>21 Conn. App. 568, 570, 575 A.2d 702, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 808, 580 A.2d 65 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings have come to have an independent significance under our state constitution and are required under the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 447, 534 A.2d 219 (1987). Their primary purpose is to ensure that an accused is aware of the constitutional right to remain silent before making statements to the police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 41, 463 A.2d 573 (1983). The aim of <em>Miranda </em>was to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to choose between speech and silence. In the case before us, the defendant\u2019s initial statements, while part of a police custodial interrogation, are not claimed to have been obtained by coercive measures. The warnings required by article first, \u00a7 8, significantly enhance a person\u2019s opportunity to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision whether to speak or remain silent. Without such warnings, the defendant could not be made aware that he had an essentially free and unconstrained choice to speak or remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We conclude that the trial court properly did not apply the \u201cbreak in the stream of events\u201d test. Having determined that the initial statement was voluntary,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> although procured in violation of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, the trial court was justified in concluding that the <em>Miranda </em>violations did not taint the admissibility of his subsequent statements. \u201cAs long as all of the statements were voluntarily made, the fact that the police procured those statements in violation of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights does not create a presumption that the police acted coercively.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 444, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992), citing <em>State v. Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 167, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). Because the statements made before <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given were not the product of coercion, the ultimate test as to the statements made after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given must be whether they are the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by the defendant. We do not reject the principles addressed in <em>Elstad </em>under our state constitution, article first, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court incorrectly found that he had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Upon arrival at the police station, the defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and indicated that he understood them. He was then asked if he wanted to call an attorney and was told that he could use a telephone to make the call. The defendant stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>did not want to speak with a lawyer. He further indicated that he was willing to answer questions. In response to questions, the defendant said that he had been drinking beer at the Cactus Club from approximately 6:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\"><em>Miranda </em>warnings must be given to assure that an inculpatoiy statement is made as a result of an essentially free and unconstrained choice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 48, 554 A.2d 263 (1989). \u201cThe state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, including his right to remain silent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 449. \u201cWaiver must be \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Guess, </em>39 Conn. App. 224, 231, 665 A.2d 126, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 924, 666 A.2d 1187 (1995). While silence alone is not sufficient to establish waiver, no specific expression of the relinquishment of rights need be shown in the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 450. Waiver may be inferred from the questioned person\u2019s words, actions and course of conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Irving, </em>27 Conn. App. 279, 283, 606 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 907, 608 A.2d 694 (1992). \u201cThe issue of whether the defendant has voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his rights is not subject to an exact test but is an issue to be determined from the facts in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>34 Conn. App. 751, 760, 643 A.2d 289 (1994), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 233 Conn. 211, 658 A.2d 566 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">As a reviewing court, in considering the validity of the waiver, we, like the trial court, look to the totality of the surrounding circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 49. The usual deference given to the function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>of fact-finding by the trial court is qualified on questions of this nature by the necessity for a scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain whether such a factual finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 686, 613 A.2d 788 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>218 Conn. 239, 255, 588 A.2d 1066 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The defendant argues that the evidence in the record is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s decision, and that the evidence that was presented was not qualitatively substantial. He claims his inculpatory statements are central to this case because of the \u201cdearth of evidence against him.\u201d A scrupulous review of the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s fact-finding on this issue is supported by sufficient and substantive evidence. In addition to the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the record discloses that the defendant was a sixty-six year old man who spoke and understood the English language and had some familiarity with police procedure, having been convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor at some time in the past. The only evidence presented did not show that the defendant is intellectually impaired or lacking sufficient education to be able to understand what was occurring. At no time did the defendant indicate that he did not understand his rights as presented, nor did he request that those rights be explained to him. He did not attempt to exercise his right to remain silent or to contact an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The actions and words of the defendant, together with his course of conduct, are sufficient to allow the trial court to infer a waiver. On the basis of the totality of surrounding circumstances, the trial court correctly found that the defendant\u2019s statements were given pursuant to a valid waiver, and that the defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The defendant also claims that, as it applies to this case, \u00a7 14-227a (f)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague in violation of his constitutional right to due process pursuant to the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The facts relevant to this claim are as follows. While at the police station, the defendant was asked to submit to a breath test, and was advised of the consequences of refusing the test, which included suspension of his driver\u2019s license and the fact that his refusal may be admitted against him in a criminal prosecution pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>agreed, and the breath testing machine, known as the Intoximeter 3000, was prepared. The defendant was instructed to hold the breath tube, to form a seal around the end of it with his mouth and to blow into the tube for approximately ten seconds. The defendant refused to form a seal, blocked the tube with his tongue and blew air around the tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">After a hearing outside the presence of the jury, the trial court found that there had been compliance with \u00a7 14-227b (b) and allowed the state to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a breath test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The defendant bases his claim on the lack of a definition of the word \u201crefused\u201d in the challenged statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state claims that \u00a7 14-227a (f) does not give rise to a cognizable vagueness claim under a due process analysis because it is not a penal provision involving conduct that constitutes criminal activity, but rather a statutory method that permits a jury to consider and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>to draw inferences from a defendant\u2019s exercise of his option of refusing to submit to a chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">While we agree that this may not be a penal statute, we nevertheless review the defendant\u2019s vagueness claim. Our Supreme Court has described the void for vagueness doctrine as applying to \u201c \u2018a governing statute or regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. Jones, 215 Conn. 173, 179, 575 A.2d 216 (1990); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 459, 542 A.2d 686 (1988). The constitutionality of a statute\u2019s provision attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 57, 428 A.2d 322 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Due process requires that a statute give to a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and provide explicit standards for those who apply them in order to prevent the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 502, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u201cThe constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 459-60. Where first amendment freedoms are not implicated, as in this case, \u201ca claim that a statute is void for vagueness is determined by its applicability to the particular facts presented.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 144, 554 A.2d 713 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The legislature did not provide a definition for \u201crefused\u201d in \u00a7 14-227a (f). It is not necessary to define a word that carries an ordinary, commonly understood meaning, is commonly used and is defined in standard dictionaries. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewtan, </em>5 Conn. App. 79, 85, 497 A.2d 60 (1985). The word \u201crefuse\u201d is defined as \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>show or express unwillingness to do or comply with. . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">To surmount a vagueness challenge, a statute must afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 460. Under the facts presented here, the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 14-227a (f) is unconstitutionally vague must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">We construe the word \u201crefuse\u201d to have a sufficiently definite meaning that places an individual on adequate notice as to what conduct is prohibited. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>232 Conn. 345, 358-59, 655 A.2d 737 (1995). Consequently, the dictionary definition makes it clear that \u201crefusing\u201d to take a breath test may be accomplished by a failure to cooperate as well as by an expressed refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Thus, we conclude that \u00a7 14-227a (f) is not unconstitutionally vague under the United States constitution as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (1) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.
