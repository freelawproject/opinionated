The issue to be resolved is whether the right of subrogation afforded by General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-369 exists after the passage of Public Acts 1993, No. 93-297, which repealed \u00a7 38a-369.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) provides that the trial court will not enter a declaratory judgment \u201cunless all persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof.\u201d Without compliance with \u00a7 390 (d), the trial court lacks jurisdiction over the matter. <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, 225 </em>Conn. 305, 308, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993). There was no order of notice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Any interpretation of the legislation involved in this case will apply to all insurance carriers and injured persons who are situated similarly to the plaintiff and the defendant. An order of notice is required; see <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Raymark Corp., 215 </em>Conn. 224, 229, 575 A.2d 693 (1990); and we remand this case for further proceedings. <em>Mannweiler </em>v. <em>LaFlamme, </em>232 Conn. 27, 36, 653 A.2d 168 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
