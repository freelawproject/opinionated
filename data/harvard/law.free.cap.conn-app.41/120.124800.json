We conclude that inter-venor status should have been granted to each of the intervenors. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>remand the matter with direction to grant the requests to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We will not set out in this opinion the background circumstances alleged by the commissioner in his complaint in this action. The circumstances are essentially the same as those involved in <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Fairfield Resources Management, Inc., </em>41 Conn. App. 89, 674 A.2d 1335 (1996) (zoning case), which was argued before this court at the same time as the present appeal. This appeal, which arises out of the same quarry mining operation in Brookfield, involves conduct by the defendants allegedly in violation of a condition of a permit earlier issued by the commissioner to divert certain waters of the state. This appeal also involves other actions by the defendants taken without the required permits and resulting in a diversion of waters of the state, including the construction and maintenance of a dam across Limekiln Brook,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the excavation of the streambed of Limekiln Brook and the daily pumping of over 50,000 gallons of water from the sump pump at the mine site. Further allegations include conducting and maintaining a \u201cregulated activity,\u201d to wit, the operating of the mine, without a permit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the discharging of materials into the waters of the state at the mine site without a permit, and \u201ccausing pollution of the waters of the State.\u201d In bringing this action directly to the Superior Court in Hartford, the commissioner exercised one of the options available to him under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430 (d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>On January 12, 1994, the Brookfield zoning commission (zoning commission), which is the plaintiff in the companion case filed a notice of intervention in this action, purportedly as a matter of right pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that verified pleading, the zoning commission sets out at length the alleged operation and conduct of the defendants at the mine site without the required permits. It asserts that \u201cthe Zoning Commission of Brookfield is charged with the enforcement of state and local zoning regulations and statutes,\u201d and it maintains that the defendants continue to conduct their activities on these premises despite the earlier cease and desist order. It further pleads the statutory language, alleging that the natural resources removal activity, dam construction and water diversion constitute \u201cconduct which has, or is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the Town of Brookfield and the State of Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Thereafter, four separate notices of intervention were filed by Edward C. Huse, the Laurel Hill Association (association), Allen B. Blackman and Lloyd Willcox.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Each of these four notices sets out that the filer intervenes in these proceedings in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 22a-19 (a). Each filer was denied intervenor status by the court, <em>O\u2019Neill, J., </em>at a hearing on May 31, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The association filed its notice of intervention through Richard Gereg, its president. That notice alleges, inter alia, that the association is an organization with a membership in excess of 120 persons, whose families own and occupy property in the neighborhood of Laurel Hill Road in Brookfield, and that it was organized to protect residential property values in the Laurel Hill Road vicinity \u201cand to see to it that any and all governmental agencies which have jurisdiction will exercise their jurisdiction properly to ensure enforcement of laws, statutes and regulations enacted to protect and conserve the environment.\u201d Incorporating language from \u00a7 22a-19 (a), the notice alleges that the proceeding involves \u201cconduct which has or is reasonably likely to have the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On May 23, 1994, the defendants filed separate objections to the notice of intervention filed by the association, Blackman and Willcox. Each objection argued that \u201cthis case is not an \u2018administrative, licensing or other proceeding\u2019 . . . nor ... a review of any administrative, licensing or other proceeding. This case is an enforcement action brought by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection (\u2018DEP\u2019) in which the DEP has sought injunctive relief and forfeiture damages.\u201d Each objection states further that the intervenors\u2019 \u201cbasis for intervention is misplaced, and they should not be permitted to intervene in this case as a matter of right.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>On May 31, 1994, a hearing was held in the Hartford Superior Court before Judge O\u2019Neill, on the defendants\u2019 objections to intervention by the proposed intervenors. The case of <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>32 Conn. App. 340, 629 A.2d 447 (1993), and particularly footnote 9 of that opinion, appeared to control the court\u2019s decision sustaining the defendants\u2019 objection to the intervention of the four proposed intervenors. Early in that hearing, the court asked the intervenors\u2019 counsel: \u201cHow do you get around footnote 9\u201d of the Appellate Court\u2019s <em>Polymer </em>decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While agreeing that this was an environmental action as well as an \u201coriginal action,\u201d the trial court rejected the claim that the language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) was ambiguous and declined to examine its legislative history. In that context, the commissioner, in supporting intervention, argued in that court that the legislative history clearly demonstrated the intent to ensure citizen participation in environmental matters. In doing so, the commissioner pointed to that portion of the legislative history that demonstrated the legislature\u2019s intention to allow citizen intervention in environmental cases. In that regard, the legislative debate on this legislation indicated an intent to expand access to the courts in \u201calleged polluting activity.\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 739, remarks of Representative John F. Papandrea. The trial court opined that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u201chas given us two paths\u201d and referred to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 22a-19 (a). Section 22a-16 permits the maintaining of an independent action for obtaining relief against alleged unreasonable pollution. Section 22a-19 permits intervention \u201c[i]n any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law . . . .\u201d That broad language strongly suggests citizen intervention at both the judicial level as well as what may be generally denominated the \u201cagency\u201d level. The trial court stated that \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-19 had to be read together. The trial court stated that doing so \u201creinforced [his] view that one is for an action, which intervenors can certainly bring and one is for review of administrative proceedings.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cI have to follow the Connecticut Appellate Court,\u201d referring to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polymer. </em>The court thereupon sustained the defendants\u2019 objections to all four who had filed to intervene. The unsuccessful intervenors have appealed from the judgment denying \u00a7 22a-19 intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On appeal, the intervenors claim that they properly pleaded \u00a7 22a-19 (a), that they have the right to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>vene in this action under the clear authority of <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>204 Conn. 38, 526 A.2d 1329 (1987), and that the denial of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) intervention thwarts the legislative purpose of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA), General Statutes \u00a7 22a-l et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The commissioner raises two questions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in this appeal: whether the intervenors should be allowed to intervene in these cases under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) and whether the trial court improperly relied on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polymer </em>in denying intervention. We incorporate in this opinion all that we said in the companion zoning case about the legal viability of the Appellate Court\u2019s <em>Polymer </em>decision, including its availability as an advisory opinion. See <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Fairfield Resources Management, Inc., </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The intervenors argue that they have properly pleaded \u00a7 22a-19 (a) intervention. The defendants have not raised any question about that claim and it appears to us that the intervenors have properly pleaded \u00a7 22a-19 (a) intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We discuss the other claims of the intervenors together as they are interrelated to the consideration and resolution of whether they are entitled to intervene under \u00a7 22a-19 (a). The intervenors claim a right to intervene under the authority of <em>Connecticut Water Co., </em>appearing to premise that argument on the ground that in that case the Supreme Court \u201cruled\u201d that the enforcement action of the commissioner \u201cinvolved a judicial review of an action arising out of the particular jurisdiction of the commissioner.\u201d They maintain that the statute, which requires a liberal construction and has the broad purpose to \u201cgive private citizens a voice\u201d on environmental issues, would effectively be thwarted by denying intervention and thus proscribing citizen input. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Intervention, they maintain, \u201cis automatically permissible and mandatory in such Superior Court actions,\u201d and here they specifically refer to actions brought under \u00a7 22a-430 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Not only does the commissioner argue in support of intervention, but he stresses that the \u201cvery broad\u201d language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a), i.e., \u201cadministrative, licensing or other proceeding,\u201d which, in this case, the commissioner claims is not clear, also supports intervention. The commissioner argues that the language is very broad and that it \u201cindicates an intent to permit intervention in a wide variety of proceedings and fora.\u201d The commissioner further asserts that there is \u201c[n]othing in the statutory language [to indicate] that an entity may intervene only in an administrative appeal or a proceeding otherwise limited to an administrative record\u201d and that \u201c[i]f the legislature had intended to limit the application of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) to administrative appeals, it could easily have done so by using those words.\u201d The interve-nors argue that the language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) is clear and that it affords them the right to intervene under \u00a7 22a-19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The commissioner maintains that the language is not clear but that the legislative history, the statute\u2019s clear purpose, and the case law require that intervention be granted here. Specifically, he contends that \u201cthe words \u2018administrative\u2019 and \u2018licensing\u2019 cover the universe of agency proceedings\u201d and, if the words \u201cother proceeding\u201d are to be given meaning, they can refer only to court proceedings, such as the commissioner\u2019s and the zoning commission\u2019s enforcement actions in these cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He also claims that the legislative history of the EPA, of which \u00a7 22a-19 (a) is a part, \u201csupports the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>that the clear purpose of the statute was to give citizens direct access to the courts to enforce environmental laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The commissioner further invokes the tenet that remedial statutes such as the EPA \u201cshould be liberally construed to achieve their purpose.\u201d Rather than turning to the doctrine of ejusdem generis in determining the meaning of \u201cother proceeding\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in \u00a7 22a-19 (a), we are urged by the commissioner to employ, inter alia, the rule of statutory construction \u201cthat a statute should be construed as a whole where particular words or sections of the statute, considered separately, are lacking in precision of meaning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>189 Conn. 321, 326, 455 A.2d 1335 (1983); see <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 756, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendants, on the other hand, urge that the denial of intervention was proper. They argue that correct statutory interpretation of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) requires the conclusion that intervention \u201cis not mandated in this particular action.\u201d They argue that to decide the issues presented it is necessary to determine the meaning of the words \u201cor other proceeding\u201d in \u00a7 22a-19 (a), and they refer to other portions of the statutory scheme including General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-18. The defendants claim that it is clear that the legislature in using the words \u201cother proceeding\u201d in \u00a7 22a-19 (a) \u201cintended the other proceeding to mean a proceeding akin to an administrative or licensing proceeding and not a proceeding brought directly in court by the attorney general\u201d as was this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>We note that, in the context of this claim, the defendants refer to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polymer. </em>They state that \u201cin <em>[Polymer] </em>the Appellate Court ruled [in a case in which] the plaintiff entities brought an action alleging the [commissioner] violated [their] civil rights. This was not an appeal from an administrative hearing or a judicial review of such hearing.\u201d The defendants argue that the commissioner\u2019s complaint in the present action makes claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief that were not the subject of administrative hearings, and \u201cno administrative hearing was waived.\u201d Therefore, the defendants contend that the trial court acted properly in following the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polymer, </em>maintaining that there \u201cwas no indication in that case that it was limited specifically to a civil rights proceeding, but rather directly limited \u00a7 22a-19 (a) to those instances intended by the legislature, i.e., a case that evolved from a licensing, administrative or similar proceeding.\u201d The defendants argue not only that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in Polymer<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is not an advisory opinion but that it was not rendered \u201cmoot\u201d <em>by Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>227 Conn. 545, 630 A.2d 1304 (1993), and, even if the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Polymer </em>is not given \u201cprecedential authority,\u201d it should be recognized as \u201cthe highest form of persuasive authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Finally, the defendants dispute the claim of the inter-venors that <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>is clear authority for their right to intervene. In doing so, their argument is twofold: first, the issue of intervention was never a controversy in that case, and, second, <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>\u201cinvolved a judicial review of an action arising out of the particular jurisdiction of the commissioner in which a hearing could have been sought but for which no hearing was sought. See [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 22a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>432 and 22a-436 . . . .\u201d The present case, the defendants claim, \u201cinvolves \u00a7 22a-430 (d), which gives the commissioner the right to bring a <em>proceeding </em>separate and apart from any hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) They argue that \u201c[sjince there is no license, administrative or other similar procedure involved, there is no authority upon which to presume intervention under \u00a7 22a-19.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992). \u201cAs is true in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Verdon </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366, 446 A.2d 3 (1982); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981); <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 391, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). In <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Yankee Gas Services Co., </em>224 Conn. 675, 689, 620 A.2d 771 (1993), our Supreme Court stated: \u201cIn interpreting the language of a statute, we are guided by the premise that we must consider the statute as written and read it as a whole. <em>Orticelli </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>197 Conn. 9, 13-14, 495 A.2d 1023 (1985). [N]o part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . and no word in a statute is to be treated as superfluous. Insofar as it is possible, the entire enactment is to be harmonized, each part made operative. . . . <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 66, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). We approach this task mindful of the assumption that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. Id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In statutory construction, \u201c[o]ur task is to find the expressed intent of the legislature, \u2018that is, the intention of the legislative body, \u201cas found from the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>employed to make it manifest.\u201d \u2019. . . We seek the intent of the legislature \u2018not in what it meant to say, but in what it did say.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 186-87, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). \u201cIf that language is plain and unambiguous, we go no further. ... If, however, the statute is ambiguous, e.g., either opaque or susceptible to alternative conflicting interpretations, [the court] will seek guidance from \u2018extrinsic aids,\u2019 e.g., the legislative history.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 187. The axiom, however, that \u201cwhere the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, construction of the statute by reference to its history and purpose is unnecessary . . . only applies in full force . . . [w]here . . . the language of a statute is . . . <em>absolutely </em>clear on its face and where no ambiguity is raised in applying the statute in a particular case. . . . <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 554, 400 A.2d 712 (1978) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 692, 595 A.2d 313 (1991); see <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 225. It is basic that common sense must be used in statutory construction and that \u201c[a] statute should not be interpreted in any way to thwart its purpose ... [or so as to lead] to absurd consequences and bizarre results.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 666-67, 560 A.2d 975 (1989); <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 31, 357 A.2d 498 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Environmental statutes, such as our EPA, of which \u00a7 22a-19 (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is now a part, are considered remedial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>nature and are to be construed liberally to accomplish their purpose. <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 382, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993); <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>215 Conn. 82, 122, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990); <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 57, 441 A.2d 68 (1981); <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 487, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).

It is further found and declared that it is in the public interest to provide <em>all persons </em>with an adequate remedy to protect the air, water and other natural resources from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The opposition to intervention seems to be that the phrase \u201cother proceeding\u201d in \u00a7 22a-19 (a) means \u201ca proceeding akin to an administrative or licensing proceeding and not a proceeding brought directly in court by the attorney general\u201d and that that phrase limits \u00a7 22a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>19 \u201cto those instances intended by the legislature, i.e., a case that evolved from a licensing, administrative or similar proceeding.\u201d Therefore, the defendants argue that because the commissioner brought this case directly in the Superior Court under \u00a7 22a-430 (d) and, as such, it is a proceeding separate and apart from any hearing, and because there is no licensing, administrative or other similar proceeding involved, there is no authority on which to presume intervention under \u00a7 22a-19. We are not persuaded by these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We are mindful that the declaration of policy in \u00a7 22a-15 applies to \u201ceachperson,\u201d and indeed to \u201call persons,\u201d suggesting, at the very least, public input; and that the result contended for by the defendants would work a complete bar to intervention by the plaintiffs under \u00a7 22a-19 (a) in this case merely because \u00a7 22a-430 (d) was the vehicle used by the commissioner. The question arises whether the \u201cother proceeding\u201d language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) is ambiguous. There is ambiguity. The principle that \u201c[w]here the meaning of a statutory term is clear, it is said to be unambiguous and not subject to modification by construction\u201d is \u201csomewhat deceptive, for a term which, in isolation, appears to be clear, may be modified by its context.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 57, 392 A.2d 491 (1978). \u201cWhere the words of a statute fail to indicate clearly whether the provision applies in certain circumstances, it must be construed by this court .... <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 550, 436 A.2d 266 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 120. We believe that the words \u201cany . . . other proceeding\u201d in \u00a7 22a-19 (a) are ambiguous in the context of whether their meaning prohibits the plaintiffs from intervening in this action brought directly to the Superior Court by the attorney general under \u00a7 22a-430 (d). Under our approach to statutory construction, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>guided by the language of the statute, its purpose, its legislative history and the circumstances surrounding its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Turning to the legislative history of the 1971 EPA, of which the present \u00a7 22a-19 (a) was a part, we see that the purpose of the act is set out in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-15. That section provides: \u201cIt is hereby found and declared that there is a public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state of Connecticut and that <em>each person </em>is entitled to the protection, preservation and enhancement of the same. It is further found and declared that it is in the public interest to provide <em>all persons </em>with an adequate remedy to protect the air, water and other natural resources from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We note the all encompassing language of \u201ceach person\u201d and \u201call persons\u201d whom the legislature intended to include in its broad sweep. 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 737-44. It is, however, certain remarks on the floor of the legislature during the debate on its passage that illuminate our inquiry. Representative Papandrea, deputy majority leader, speaking in favor of passage of the act, said: \u201c[I]t expands the right of a person to have access to the courts when property which we might say belongs to all of the public is jeopardized by the alleged polluting activity. Presently a person, unless he can show a personal direct ownership or other interests in the land which he claims as being affected by the alleged activity does not have legal standing in the court of law. Consequently, some of the most beautiful aspects of our environment, some of those most vital not only to our survival, but to that of future generations are such that they do not lend themselves to a proprietary or a personal interest and this bill makes the guaranteeing and the preservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>and the protection of these rights available to the general public which they are not presently under our law.\u201d Id., p. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Another supporter of the proposed bill, Senator Roger W. Eddy, said, \u201cWhat we are attempting to do here, is beginning in our own way to let the citizens say that they have at stake, the right to live in clean air, clean water and a generally favorable environment.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1971 Sess., p. 1084. Another supporter said: \u201cAnd I do think this is a necessary bill because it may well prod many of our state agencies charged with the protection of the environment on a state level. It may well prod these agencies into more thorough and responsive carrying out of the legislative programs. I think this bill does show the concern of the legislature for the environmental crisis in this state . . . .\u201d 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., p. 745, remarks of Representative Francis Collins. It was recognized that the bill was \u201cgranting individual citizens some powerful weapons, the right to seek injunctions, the right to intervene in proceedings.\u201d 14 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1971 Sess., p. 1083, remarks of Senator Thomas Dowd. The intent to afford the opportunity to any citizen to participate in raising environmental issues, either by way of instituting actions as in \u00a7 22a-18 or by intervention in such matters as in \u00a7 22a-19 (a), is unmistakable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The claim has been made that intervention is quite appropriate here under the \u201cany . . . other proceeding\u201d language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We do not believe that, in resolving this issue, the rule of construction frequently referred to as ejusdem generis, in the fact pattern of this case, is any bar to such a conclusion. \u201cAccording to the rule of ejusdem generis, <em>unless a contrary intent appears, </em>where general terms are followed by specific in a statute, the general terms will be construed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>218 Conn. 273, 278, 588 A.2d 1376 (1991). However, \u201c[ejjusdem generis . . . like other canons of statutory construction [is] only an aid to the ascertainment of the true meaning of the [words of a] statute. It is neither final nor exclusive. To ascertain the meaning of the words of a statute, [those words] may be submitted to the test of all appropriate canons of statutory construction, of which . . . ejusdem gene-ris is only one. If, upon a consideration of the context and the objects sought to be attained and of the act as a whole, it adequately appears that the general words were not used in the restricted sense suggested by the rule, we must give effect to the conclusion afforded by the wider view in order that the will of the legislature shall not fail.\u201d <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Stockholms Enskilda Bank, </em>293 U.S. 84, 89, 55 S. Ct. 50, 79 L. Ed. 211 (1934). Here, a contrary legislative intent appears, and ejusdem gene-ris is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In determining that the present action instituted under \u00a7 22a-430 (d) is a \u201cproceeding\u201d that falls within the broad \u201cany . . . other proceeding\u201d language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a), we note several other matters that support our conclusion. There is nothing in the statute that suggests that intervention is limited to a situation where there is some administrative record. The portion of \u00a7 22a-430 (d) under which this action was brought was already law when \u00a7 22a-19 (a) was enacted. The legislature is presumed to act \u201cwith knowledge and understanding of existing relevant statutes, and with the intent to achieve a harmonious and consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 362, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 718, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). We glean nothing from the legislative history that suggests that the intervenors must be rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>gated to instituting their own action under \u00a7 22a-18<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> rather than seeking to intervene under \u00a7 22a-19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Further, it is a basic proposition of law that \u201c[a] statute should be construed so as to give effect to the legislative intent, while keeping in view the object of the statute.\u201d <em>Stephen Reney Memorial Fund </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>4 Conn. App. 111, 113, 492 A.2d 533 (1985); <em>State </em>v. Harris, 14 Conn. App. 244, 250, 540 A.2d 395 (1988). Our construction of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) does this. \u201cA statute should be construed so as to have meaning, so that the statute makes common sense, and so that there are no bizarre results.\u201d <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>7 Conn. App. 283, 285, 508 A.2d 804, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 807, 512 A.2d 230 (1986). Section 22a-19 (a) should be so viewed, for to say otherwise would defy common sense and mean that there would be no intervention at all in this case because it involved an action brought directly to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 22a-430 (d). Nothing has been brought to our attention, nor have we found anything, to suggest that the legislature had any intent to exclude an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-430 (d). This present action, which is brought under \u00a7 22a-430 (d), certainly raises environmental issues, and it was for the raising of such issues that \u00a7 22a-19 (a) was intended by the legislature. See <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 727, 734, 563 A.2d 1347 (1989); <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 248 n.2, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984). Our construction of the statute advances its remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court improperly denied intervenor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the requests to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\"> The commissioner\u2019s complaint in this action is in twelve counts and alleges the violation of a number of statutes, i.e., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-368 (b), 22a-403 (a), 22a-407, 22a-42a (c), 22a-430 and 22a-427, and \u00a7\u00a7 220-10 and 220-7 of the Brookfield town code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"> The injunctive relief was sought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-376 (a), 22a-44 (b), 22a-430 (d), 22a-6 (a) (3) and 22a-376 (a) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\"> The claimed orders for forfeiture of moneys involved General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-44 (b), 22a-438 and 22a-407.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> Limekiln Brook was apparently a stream that the intervenors indicate \u201cused to flow across the site\u201d of the mine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> This claimed activity is alleged to be in violation of state statute as well as the Brookfield town code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430 is entitled \u201cPermit for new discharge.
