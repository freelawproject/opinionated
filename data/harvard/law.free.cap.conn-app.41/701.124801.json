We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The defendant was initially charged, in two separate informations, with six counts. In the first information, based on an incident that occurred on November 1, 1992, the defendant was charged with reckless burning and risk of injury to children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6In the second information, based on an incident that occurred on August 4, 1993, the defendant was charged with attempted assault in the first degree, unlawful restraint in the first degree, reckless endangerment in the first degree and threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Regarding the first incident, the jury could have reasonably found the following facts. On November 1,1992, Lugine Kemp, her three children and the defendant were living together in a rented apartment. On that evening, Kemp and the defendant had an argument. The defendant went downstairs and Kemp stayed upstairs and went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>to bed. Kemp\u2019s six year old daughter later awoke her and said that the house was on fire. As she exited her bedroom, Kemp saw flames between the bedroom and the bathroom. She noticed that the items burning were a piece of paper on top of a T-shirt and a piece of plywood. Kemp left the house with her children. Once outside, she did not see the defendant. Kemp then went to a neighbor\u2019s house to call the police, who called the fire department. The firefighters did not find fire in the house. Kemp spent the night at her mother\u2019s house.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Detective Thomas Goodrow of the arson unit of the Hartford police department was called to the scene that evening. Outside, he found and obtained as evidence \u201cwhat appeared to be the remnants of at least two T-shirts on top of a piece of lauan boarding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When he went inside the apartment, Goodrow noticed a strong smell of smoke and a haze. On the basis of Goodrow\u2019s investigation, all natural and accidental causes for the fire were ruled out, and it was concluded that the fire \u201cwas unquestionably incendiary in nature, a deliberate act of arson, human\u201d that created \u201ca significant danger\u201d to the building and its occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Regarding the second incident, the jury could have reasonably found the following facts. On August 4,1993, Lawunna Smith left work at approximately 4:40 p.m. and proceeded to walk home across a vacant lot when she was approached by the defendant, who was a friend of hers. The defendant came up to Smith, moving as if he were going to put his arm around her, and poured what smelled like gasoline on Smith from a green soda bottle that he had in his hand. The gasoline fell onto Smith\u2019s chest and neck area, and she was afraid. As he poured the gasoline on Smith, the defendant asked her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>whether she had ever been burned or had ever seen a person get burned. Smith tried to get away but the defendant pulled and hit her and punched her in the stomach. He then produced a book of matches from his pants pocket and \u201ctook a single strike from the book of matches.\u201d Smith was frightened and crying, believing that the defendant was going to strike the match and throw it on her. She again tried to get away, but was unable to because \u201cevery step [she] would take he was right there.\u201d Smith tried to talk to the defendant, asking the reason for his behavior. The defendant then put away the matches and pulled out a paring knife, which he held to Smith\u2019s neck while he threatened to kill her. The defendant eventually put the knife away and Smith ran to her aunt\u2019s house nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Smith stayed at her aunt\u2019s house until she felt sure that the defendant was not around. On her way home, Smith stopped at the home of her friend, Michael Tig-gett. Smith was shaking when she arrived at Tiggett\u2019s house, and she told Tiggett what had occurred. At this point, the defendant was sitting across the street in front of Tiggett\u2019s house. Tiggett went outside and spoke to the defendant, who then left, but said he would be back.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Smith eventually went back to her aunt\u2019s house and called the police. Officer Michael Gaffney of the Hartford police department responded to the call and found Smith to be \u201ccovered with what appeared to be gasoline.\u201d Gaffney telephoned Goodrow of the arson unit and obtained Smith\u2019s clothing as evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Gaffney then went to pick up the defendant at his apartment. Goodrow accompanied Smith to the area where her encounter with the defendant had taken place. He found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>a green soda bottle on the ground that he collected as evidence. The result of the lab test on the bottle indicated evaporated gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The defendant first claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state impermissibly cross-examined him about his postarrest silence in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. Specifically, the defendant claims that his right to due process was violated under <em>Doyle </em>v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), when the prosecuting attorney questioned him about his postar-rest silence and when the state presented testimony in its case-in-chief that referred to the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. At trial, the defendant did not object to the introduction of this evidence and thus brings this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u2018only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 . . . The first two conditions are determinations of whether a defendant\u2019s claim will be reviewed, and the third condition involves a review of the claim itself.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>34 Conn. App. 261, 264, 641 A.2d 406, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 903, 644 A.2d 916 (1994). \u201cIn harmony with the objective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>Golding, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim may be disposed of \u2018by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 440, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Regarding the August 4, 1993 incident,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the state, as part of its case-in-chief, presented the testimony of Goodrow. According to Goodrow, after the defendant had been brought to the police station by Gaffney, Goodrow spoke with him in an interview room. After advising the defendant of his rights, the defendant refused to sign a waiver form.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Prior to Smith\u2019s coming in to identify the defendant, Goodrow went over the charges against the defendant, at which point the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>defendant stated that he \u201cwas there but . . . didn\u2019t throw the gasoline.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">During the cross-examination of the defendant, the state elicited information from the defendant regarding his statements to Goodrow. The defendant testified regarding his statement that Smith was his girlfriend,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>that Goodrow had advised him of his rights,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the defendant never told Goodrow that the fight he and Smith had was about money.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The testimony then turned to whether Goodrow had allowed the defendant to make a statement after he was advised of his rights<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s claim that he was not given an opportunity to tell his side of the story.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Following a lunch recess, the court pointed out that \u201c[although [defense counsel] did not interpose any objections, dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ing the luncheon recess the court pointed out to both counsel that the state\u2019s inquiries . . . into his things he didn\u2019t say to the police would not be viewed with favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\u201cThe state\u2019s use for impeachment purposes of a defendant\u2019s silence following receipt of Miranda<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>warnings violates due process. . . . Silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 because it may be nothing more than a defendant\u2019s exercise of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights. . . . Once the government assures a defendant through the issuance of <em>Miranda </em>warnings that his silence will not be used against him, it is fundamentally unfair for the state to break that promise by using his silence against him at trial. . . . Comments by the state on a defendant\u2019s silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not only constitutionally impermissible, but also inadmissible under the principles of evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 266-67. It is permissible, however, for the state to present such evidence to \u201cshow the investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 183-84, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u201cThe principles of <em>Doyle </em>do not apply where the record fails to indicate \u2018that the silence of a defendant has been preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>[198 Conn. 517, 524, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986)] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 267. The state argues that as to Goodrow\u2019s testimony, the record is inadequate to review this claim because the record does not adequately reflect that the defendant was ever asked to sign a waiver form. We disagree. Goodrow testified that he advised the defendant of his rights and the defendant refused to sign anything.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, as correctly pointed out by the defendant, the state, in questioning the defendant on cross-examination, specifically referred to Goodrow\u2019s having advised the defendant of his rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u201cThe first two conditions of <em>Golding are </em>met here. An adequate record for review exists because the record indicates that the defendant received <em>[Miranda] </em>warnings regarding the right to remain silent, and the defendant\u2019s claim is constitutional in nature because it alleges a violation of due process under <em>Doyle. </em>We must, therefore, consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 269. We conclude, however, that under the facts of this case, an alleged constitutional violation does not clearly exist and the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">With respect to Goodrow\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want to sign anything,\u201d we conclude that this does not constitute improper evidence of silence. Rather, such testimony was elicited, not for the purpose of impermissibly commenting on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda, </em>but rather to show \u201cthe investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 201 Corm. 183. As such, this testimony was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">With respect to the cross-examination of the defendant, we agree with the state that because the defendant did not remain silent in reliance on <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the questioning was proper. \u201c \u2018[T]he <em>Doyle . . </em>. rule has no application unless the defendant has remained silent and could be considered to have done so in reliance on the implied assurances of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crowder, </em>719 F.2d 166, 172 (6th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 974, 104 S. Ct. 2352, 80 L. Ed. 2d 825 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joly, </em>219 Conn. 234, 256-57 n.15, 593 A.2d 96 (1991). Regarding the state\u2019s inquiry of the defendant as to the fact that he never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>told Goodrow that he had fought with Smith about money, this question concerned the defendant\u2019s prior admission that he and Smith had argued. When asked why he did not give this information to Goodrow, he responded that he was not asked to and that he never got a chance to. The defendant repeatedly indicated that Goodrow would not listen to him when he attempted to speak. Because silence and gestures that are not the product of reliance on <em>Miranda </em>are not protected; <em>State </em>v. <em>Joly, </em>supra, 257; <em>State </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>25 Conn. App. 149, 593 A.2d 973, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 918, 597 A.2d 343 (1991); we conclude that the defendant has not shown that a constitutional violation clearly existed that deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new trial because he was deprived of an adequately instructed jury. Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court failed to relate the facts of the case to the law in its charge to the jury. The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved in the trial court, but claims that it is nonetheless reviewable under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instructions, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. . . . The test is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . We will reverse a conviction only if, in the context of the whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 509, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995). \u201cIn assessing whether a jury reasonably could have been misled by the court\u2019s instructions ... it is always proper to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>whether the issues in the case are complicated.\u201d Id., 514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In <em>State </em>v. Lemoine, supra, 233 Conn. 512, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201creview of or comment on the evidence is not constitutionally mandated where the trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, determines that such commentary is not necessary and that the jury would be properly instructed and not misled in its absence.\u201d In so holding, the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]t has long been established that [i]n properly instructing the jury it <em>may or may not </em>be necessary for the court to recall the attention of the jury to the evidence and to the facts which the State and the accused respectively claim to have established, or to comment upon the evidence or express an opinion as to its weight, or as to what verdict would be proper if the jury should find certain facts to have been proved. The charge should be so framed that the jury may clearly understand the matters which are submitted to them. : . . It is within the province, and may be within the duty, of the trial judge to not only call attention to the evidence adduced, but to state to the jury in the charge his own opinion of the nature, bearing and force of such evidence. . . . It is not necessarily error to omit <em>all </em>comment upon the bearing and weight of evidence; and generally the extent to which the court should discuss the evidence in submitting a case to the jury is, so long as in criminal cases the jury [is] not directed how to find [its] verdict, <em>within the discretion of the trial judge. . . . State </em>v. Long, 72 Conn. 39, 43, 43 A. 493 (1899).\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">As in <em>Lemoine, </em>the trial court in the present case, after the close of the evidence and final arguments of counsel, instructed the jury as to the law applicable to all of the charges against the defendant. The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>instructed the juiy as to the elements the state must prove as to each crime charged in the two informations in order to convict the defendant. The court specified in its instructions the victims to which the various charges against the defendant applied, and the juiy had the informations during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In <em>Lemoine, </em>although the defendant was charged with nine separate counts in the information, the Supreme Court noted that the evidence related to those charges was not complicated and the charges arose out of three separate and distinct incidents. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 515. In the present case, the defendant was charged, in one information, with reckless burning and risk of injury to children based on the allegation that the defendant started a fire in an apartment on November 1, 1992. In the other information, the defendant was charged with attempt to commit assault in the first degree, unlawful restraint in the first degree, reckless endangerment in the first degree and threatening, all based on the defendant\u2019s encounter with Smith on August 4, 1993. The two incidents were not similar. Moreover, as in <em>Lemoine, </em>the final arguments of counsel thoroughly reviewed the testimony elicited by the witnesses. We conclude, on the basis of the foregoing, that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions and no injustice to the defendant resulted by reason of the court\u2019s instructions.
