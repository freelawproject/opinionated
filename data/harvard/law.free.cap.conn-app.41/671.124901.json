On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly refused to enjoin the statewide grievance committee (committee) from pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ceeding in a matter in which the committee failed to comply with the temporal requirements set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g and Practice Book \u00a7 27J. We conclude that the trial court improperly denied the plaintiffs request to enjoin the committee from taking further action, and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">There is no dispute about the essential facts. The plaintiff, referred to anonymously in his verified complaint as John Doe,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Connecticut. On June 18, 1993, the grievance panel of the judicial district of New Haven, geographical area number six (local grievance panel), commenced grievance proceedings against the plaintiff by filing a complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>31,1993, the local grievance panel determined that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause that the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct. The local grievance panel filed its determination of no probable cause with the committee on September 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">On December 16, 1993, the committee informed the plaintiff that, contrary to the determination of the local grievance panel, there was sufficient probable cause to hold a hearing to determine whether the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct. The committee took no further action until February 8,1994, when it assigned the matter to a subcommittee and scheduled a March 9, 1994 hearing. As of February 8, 1994, more than 120 days had elapsed since the local grievance panel filed its determination of no probable cause. On March 9, 1994, the plaintiff appeared before the subcommittee and filed a motion to dismiss the grievance proceedings on jurisdictional grounds. The subcommittee denied the plaintiffs motion. Thereafter, on March 10, 1994, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the grievance proceedings with the committee based on the same jurisdictional grounds. The committee denied the plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The plaintiff commenced this action seeking to enjoin the committee from taking any further action on the underlying grievance complaint. The plaintiffs complaint alleges that the committee is without jurisdiction to take further action in this matter and its failure to render a decision within the statutory time period deprived the plaintiff of his due process rights. On October 25, 1994, the trial court rendered judgment denying the plaintiffs request for a permanent injunction. The plaintiff filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the committee\u2019s failure to comply with the timing require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ments of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (g), now \u00a7 51-90g (h),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 27J (i)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>requires dismissal of the underlying complaint alleging attorney misconduct. The plaintiff argues that the committee\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory timing requirements necessitates a dismissal of the complaint against the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We begin our analysis of the plaintiffs claim by recognizing that \u201cthe rules regulating attorney grievance procedures exist within the broader framework of the relationship between attorneys and the judiciary. \u2018 \u201cThe practice of law is ... a profession the main purpose of which is to aid in the doing of justice ....\u201d\u2019 <em>In re Application of Griffiths, </em>162 Conn. 249, 254-55, 294 A.2d 281 (1972), rev\u2019d and remanded, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S. Ct. 2851, 37 L. Ed. 2d 910 (1973), quoting <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>State Bar Examining Committee, </em>116 Conn. 409, 414, 165 A. 211 (1933). An attorney \u2018as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him.\u2019 <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 450, 91 A. 274 (1914). This \u2018unique position as officers and commissioners of the court . . . casts attorneys in a special relationship with the judiciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>and subjects them to its discipline.\u2019. . . <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 524, 461 A.2d 938 (1983).\u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee v. </em>Rozbicki, 211 Conn. 232, 237-38, 558 A.2d 986 (1989). \u201cThe regulation of attorney conduct is, therefore, within the court\u2019s inherent authority. Section 51-90g and the parallel Practice Book rules authorized the grievance committee to act as an arm of the court in fulfilling this responsibility.\u201d Id., 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The judiciary has exercised its inherent authority over attorneys by acquiescing to the statutory framework enacted by the legislature and promulgating concurrent rules. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-90 et seq.; Practice Book \u00a7 27F et seq. By acquiescing to these statutory procedures, the judiciary has limited the committee\u2019s jurisdiction to only those matters acted on within the time limitations outlined in \u00a7 51-90g. <em>State </em>v. James, 211 Conn. 555, 561, 560 A.2d 426 (1989); <em>Adams </em>v. Rubinow, 157 Conn. 150, 156, 251 A.2d 49 (1968).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court, therefore, will not require the committee to dismiss a complaint for failure to act in a timely manner unless such action is mandated by \u00a7 51-90g. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Section 51-90g (g) is the applicable statute outlining the time constraints for committee review of local panel determinations of probable cause and committee hearings on grievance complaints. That statute provides that the committee <em>\u201cshall render its decision not later than four months from the date the panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>the state-wide grievance committee. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We conclude that this language clearly and unambiguously mandates that the committee complete its action within four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201c[W]e approach the task relying on familiar principles of statutory construction in order to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>[225 Conn. 297, 303 n.7, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993)]. \u2018It is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation. . . . <em>Petco Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 315, 321, 649 A.2d 790 (1994). In order to determine the meaning of a statute, we must consider the statute as a whole when reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation. <em>Broadley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>229 Conn. 1, 6, 639 A.2d 502 (1994); <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987).\u2019. . . <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995). The task of determining whether a particular provision is mandatory or directory involves the same criteria, namely, the statute\u2019s language, the legislative history and the statutory context. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 129-31, 394 A.2d 731 (1978).\u201d <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 688-89, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996). \u201cWhere, as here, neither the context nor the legislative history indicates a contrary intent, \u2018 [t]he use of the word \u201cshall\u201d by the legislature connotes that the performance of the statutory requirements is mandatory rather than permissive.\u2019 <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>513 A.2d 43 (1986); see <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>174 Conn. 229, 233, 384 A.2d 384 (1978); 1A J. Sutherland, [Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1972)] \u00a7 <em>25.QA.\u201d Statewide Grievance Committee v. Rozbicki, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 240; see <em>also Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 232, our Supreme Court similarly held that the time constraints contained in \u00a7 51-90g (c)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were mandatory. The court held, however, that a subcommittee\u2019s failure to comply with the timing requirements of \u00a7 51-90g (c) was not a jurisdictional defect absent a showing of prejudice. The court based its decision on the language of \u00a7 51-90g (c) which, upon the failure of a subcommittee to complete its action on a complaint within the time constraints, allows the committee to \u201cinquire into the delay and determine the appropriate course of action.\u201d The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[s]uch a construction [requiring dismissal of the grievance complaint] would impermissibly render the final phrase of \u00a7 51-90g (c) a nullity. In implementing \u00a7 51-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>90g (c), the grievance committee has discretion to decide what remedy a particular delay warrants.\u201d Id., 243. The <em>Rozbicki </em>court concluded that, despite the existence of a violation of \u00a7 51-90g (c), that section did not require the complaint to be dismissed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We hold that \u00a7 51-90g (g) requires dismissal of the complaint against the plaintiff. Unlike the time limitations on subcommittee action contained in subsection (c), \u00a7 51-90g (g) contains no language authorizing the committee to \u201cinquire into the delay and determine the appropriate course of action.\u201d \u201c \u2018[W]here a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u2019 \u201d 2B J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 51.02, pp. 122-23, quoting <em>Western States Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gehringer, </em>203 Cal. App. 2d 793, 799, 22 Cal. Rptr. 144 (1962); see also <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 100-101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995). We find that the omission of language authorizing the committee to take discretionary action in the event of delay mandates a different conclusion from that found in <em>Rozbicki. </em>We hold that once the four month period outlined in \u00a7 51-90g (g) expired, the committee was without jurisdiction to take any further action on the complaint, including referring the complaint to a subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The committee argues that \u00a7 51-90g (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 27J (e) are the applicable timing provisions when the committee assigns a complaint to a subcommittee after the expiration of the 120 day period. The committee asks us to conclude that it retains jurisdiction to assign a matter to a subcommittee after the expiration of the 120 day period. Under this theory, the committee could simply refer the matter to a subcommittee in1 order to revive its case under the savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>provision in \u00a7 51-90g (c) and \u00a7 27J (e). This construction of the statute would lead to inconsistent results as the merits of an action enjoining the committee from taking further action on a grievance complaint would depend on whether the committee revived its grievance matter prior to the filing of the action. We must avoid such a construction of a statute that leads to bizarre and irrational results. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 92, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). We hold, therefore, that the committee was without jurisdiction to assign the complaint to a subcommittee after the expiration of the 120 day period outlined in \u00a7 51-90g (g) and \u00a7 27J (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Our resolution of this issue is further supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 51-90g. In 1986, the legislature amended \u00a7 51-90g to protect the rights of attorneys as well as to bolster public confidence in the grievance procedure. As stated in the House of Representatives debate: \u201c[I]t is extremely important at this point that the public know how the system works, that it have some assurance that the standards are going to be laid down and observed consistently ... by eliminating some of the abuses without itself becoming abusive to those whose professional integrity may be at stake.\u201d 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 23, 1985 Sess., p. 8561, remarks of Representative Richard Blumenthal. Public Acts 1986, No. 86-276, was enacted to expedite the grievance procedure by requiring that a subcommittee render its proposed decision within ninety days from the date the local grievance panel\u2019s determination of probable cause or no probable cause was filed with the committee, and by requiring the committee to dispose of the case within four months. 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 23, 1985 Sess., pp. 8529-30, remarks of Representative William A. Wollenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Public Act 86-276 also authorized the committee to inquire into delayed subcommittee action and to determine the appropriate course of action. No such authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>zation was given to the committee when it fails to render a decision within the statutory time period. In 1988, the legislature amended the statute further to provide that \u201c[t]he failure of the subcommittee to complete its action on a complaint within [the prescribed time periods] shall not be cause for dismissal of the complaint.\u201d Public Acts 1988, No. 88-152, \u00a7 6. The legislature did not amend \u00a7 51-90g (g) to include similar language.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We find that the legislative history of \u00a7 51-90g unequivocally supports a conclusion that the committee is without jurisdiction to take action on a complaint once the four month period expires. The legislature amended \u00a7 51-90g (c) twice to allow the committee to inquire into subcommittee delay without requiring dismissal of the complaint. The legislature is presumed to know the existing state of relevant law when it enacts a statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 201, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). Had the legislature intended to allow committee discretion after expiration of the four month period, it would have amended \u00a7 51-90g (g) as it amended \u00a7 51-90g (c). We find, therefore, that the legislature intended that committee delay beyond the four month period mandates dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Our conclusion is especially appropriate in a case such as this in which a local grievance panel found no probable cause that the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct. To hold otherwise would render the procedures outlined in \u00a7 51-90g and \u00a7 27J meaningless. We will not presume that the legislature enacted meaningless legislation or the judiciary promulgated useless rules. <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>209 Conn. 133, 141, 547 A.2d 543 (1988). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly refused to enjoin the committee from further action on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment enjoining the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ant from proceeding on the grievance against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\"> On April 13, 1994, the trial court granted the plaintiffs request to proceed in this matter anonymously as John Doe. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court ordered that the plaintiffs identity not be disclosed until the appeal period expired. The trial court also stated that it would schedule argument on the issue of whether the plaintiffs identity should be disclosed during the pendency of the appeal. The record does not reveal any further action by the trial court concerning the plaintiffs anonymity in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> The parties stipulate that the grievance proceeding relates to an incident alleged to have occurred on or about December 12,1990, that did not involve a client or clients\u2019 funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> A grievance proceeding against an attorney is commenced by filing a complaint with the statewide bar counsel.

Although I concur in the result reached by the majority, I disagree with several aspects of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">As the majority notes, the dispositive issue in this case is whether the failure of the statewide grievance committee (committee) to comply with the time limitations of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 51-90g (g), now \u00a7 51-90g (h), and Practice Book \u00a7 27J (i), requires dismissal of the underlying complaint alleging attorney misconduct. As in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 233-34, 558 A.2d 986 (1989), which governs this case, this issue \u201cconcerns the relationship between the judicial department\u2019s supervisory responsibility for the conduct of attorneys and the provisions of [statutory] . . . time constraints upon the adjudicatory processes of the Statewide Grievance Committee . . . with respect to complaints of attorney misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Our Supreme Court stated in <em>Rozbicki </em>that \u201c[requiring the grievance committee to dismiss a complaint whenever the review subcommittee has failed to act in a timely manner, with no discretion to pursue another course of action if appropriate, would frustrate the purposes of attorney grievance procedures and run counter to the special supervisory role of the courts in regulating attorney conduct. We will, therefore, require such action only if specifically so directed . . . .\u201d Id., 239. Within this framework, the court analyzed \u00a7 51-90g (c). Initially, the court concluded that the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 51-90g (c) \u201c \u2018connotes that the performance of the statutory requirements is mandatory rather than permissive.\u2019 \u201d Id., 240. The court, nevertheless, relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the savings clause in \u00a7 51-90g (c) to conclude that a delay by a subcommittee does not require dismissal. Id., 242-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Although the court also emphasized the broader context of the supervisory role of the judiciary in governing attorney conduct, our Supreme Court in <em>Rozbicki </em>based its decision primarily on the impact of the \u00a7 51-90g (c) savings clause. In the case before us, concerning the mandatory time limit of \u00a7 51-90g (g), the absence of a comparable savings clause together with the acquiescence of the judiciary in adopting the time limits in \u00a7 27J compels our result. When the committee is proceeding under \u00a7 51-90g (g), neither the statute nor the rule of practice authorizes discretionary action in the event of delay beyond the time limit. By adopting the statutory language in the rule of practice, the judiciary has bound the committee to the statutory standard, without allowing discretion as it carries out its supervisory role over attorney conduct. This court is bound by the analysis in the <em>Rozbicki </em>decision to reach that result. To this extent, I concur in the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Because the required result of this case, however, undermines the vital role of judicial supervision of attorney conduct, I disagree with the majority when it attempts to explain and justify the result in terms of reason, common sense and consistency with legislative history or purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The result clearly does not fulfill all the important purposes indicated in the legislative history. The legislative history certainly contains language appropriately indicating that the supervisory process should not be abusive to attorneys. The legislature, however, was also concerned about dealing with the problem of attorney misconduct consistently and fairly in order to eliminate some of the abuses produced by that misconduct and to bolster public confidence in the grievance process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>It is apparent that the purpose of expediting the process was at least as much for the benefit of the public as for those facing charges of misconduct. The result that we are compelled to reach in this case seriously diminishes any benefit to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\">In this case, a two month delay by the committee in proceeding with a misconduct complaint against an attorney, whose anonymity is ensured and who has demonstrated no prejudice, results in dismissal of the complaint, effectively depriving the trial court of jurisdiction and the public of appropriate judicial supervision of attorneys. By virtue of the committee\u2019s dereliction, the detrimental impact on public confidence in the judiciary\u2019s authority to supervise attorney misconduct is palpable. The inherent supervisory authority of the judiciary on which our Supreme Court framed its analysis of \u00a7 51-90g (c) in <em>Rozbicki </em>should not be so easily subverted. See id., 237-39. By acquiescing in the language of \u00a7 51-90g (g), the judicial branch has contributed to limiting its own authority. We cannot, however, avoid being controlled by the conclusion in <em>Rozbicki </em>that the time limits in \u00a7 51-90g are mandatory. Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">I disagree also with the majority\u2019s statement that this conclusion is \u201cespecially appropriate in a case such as this in which a local grievance panel found no probable cause that the plaintiff was guilty of misconduct.\u201d Because of the trial court\u2019s order requiring confidentiality, we do not know the identity of the attorney involved, the nature of the complaint, the reasons for the action of the local grievance panel or the reasons for the action and delay by the committee. It is not appropriate, on the record before us, to speculate as to the rationale or validity of either probable cause determination. I disagree, therefore, with the majority\u2019s implicit approval of the local grievance panel\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Finally, the majority\u2019s attempt to justify this result in terms of consistency, logic, or common sense must fail. The majority concludes that it would be a bizarre result to allow a committee to revive a case by submitting it to a subcommittee after its 120 days to act has elapsed. Under the result that this court reaches today, however, the committee can refer every case to a subcommittee at the outset, thereby assuring itself of the discretionary authority of \u00a7 51-90g (c) to act later. This also leads to an incongruous and absurd result. When the committee promptly refers the matter to a subcommittee, it assures itself of not being strictly bound by the 120 day requirement. If the subcommittee delays, the committee is empowered with discretion to \u201cinquire into the delay and determine the appropriate course of action.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (c). On the other hand, as in the present case, if the subcommittee referral does not take place within 120 days, the very same committee has no such discretion and becomes powerless to act on a grievance complaint. In that respect, the present result is neither reasonable nor sensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
