We agree with her claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that the trial court violated her right to due process by prematurely terminating the hearing and, therefore, we reverse the judgment, except as to the decree of dissolution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We glean the following history from the transcript, the trial court file, the record and the plaintiffs brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff obtained a decree of legal separation in 1993. The parties agreed on custody of the minor child, child support, alimony, a division of property and maintenance of health insurance by the defendant for the plaintiff. In 1994, the defendant petitioned<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a decree dissolving the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The court held a hearing on the petition on November 7, 1994. At the close of proceedings on that day, the court declared the marriage dissolved and further decreed that \u201call orders entered by the court remain in full force and effect subject to review and modification on November 21, 1994 . . . .\u201d On November 21, 1994, the court conducted a further hearing to consider additional financial and other information bearing on the issue of whether the financial status of the parties was substantially different from that at the time of the legal separation. At that hearing, the trial court determined that the plaintiff had the burden of going forward and the ultimate burden of proof on her claim that the financial status of the parties had changed substantially from the time of the separation decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>During the plaintiffs wide ranging cross-examination of the defendant, she touched on many areas. Her last question was: \u201c[N]ow have you ever taken your son to an \u2018R\u2019 rated movie?\u201d At that point, the court abruptly ended the questioning<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the court ruled that there had been no substantial financial change since the legal separation, counsel for the plaintiff indicated that she had not had an opportunity to prove that there had been such a change.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then entered the same financial, custody and visitation orders as had been entered at the time of the separation decree. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>In a similar case where a party petitioned to convert a legal separation decree to a dissolution decree, this court stated that \u201calthough we hold that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s petition converting the parties\u2019 legal separation into a dissolution of marriage, the trial court\u2019s incorporation of the prior orders entered in the decree of legal separation into the decree of dissolution of marriage without a finding that the orders were \u2018fair and equitable\u2019 at the time of the dissolution was improper.\u201d <em>Mignosa </em>v. <em>Mignosa, </em>25 Conn. App. 210, 216, 594 A.2d 15 (1991). The plaintiff correctly pointed out that the question of whether the separation decree orders were still fair and equitable was properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In order to determine whether such orders were fair and equitable, the parties were entitled to an opportunity to present evidence in a hearing. \u201cThe fact that the agreement was presumably found fair and equitable at the time of the legal separation does not excuse the failure of the court to make such a determination in the light of the situation of the parties at the time of dissolution and to afford an opportunity for a hearing on the issues involved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 215-16. \u201cA fundamental premise of due process is that a court cannot adjudicate any matter unless the parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the issues involved . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>233 Conn. 198, 205, 658 A.2d 559 (1995). \u201cGenerally, when the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion depends on issues of fact which are disputed, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>32 Conn. App. 465, 475, 629 A.2d 1160 (1993). \u201cIt is a fundamental tenet of due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>States constitution and article first, \u00a7 10, of the Connecticut constitution that persons whose property rights will be affected by a court\u2019s decision are entitled to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. . . . Where a party is not afforded an opportunity to subject the factual determinations underlying the trial court\u2019s decision to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing, an order cannot be sustained.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>31 Conn. App. 761, 770, 627 A.2d 452 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The court may have been annoyed by the plaintiffs counsel and her insistence on conducting a rather slow moving cross-examination that often did not deal directly with the matters at issue. We also appreciate the court\u2019s irritation when counsel repeated questions to which objections had been sustained. The plaintiff, nevertheless, had a due process right to be heard. The trial court had the power to control the plaintiffs cross-examination by confining the questions to relevant matters. In addition, the court had the power to sanction counsel if the court\u2019s instructions were disobeyed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court, however, did not have the right to terminate the hearing before the plaintiff had a fair opportunity to present evidence on the contested issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The judgment is reversed except as to the decree of dissolution and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> The plaintiff does not challenge the dissolution of the marriage and specifically requested that the decree of the dissolution remain in force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\"> The pro se defendant did not file a brief but, with permission of the court, was allowed to present oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\"> The defendant filed the petition pro se. Although the petition did not contain a prayer for relief, the plaintiff agreed on the record that the petition should be treated as requesting a dissolution of the marriage. The court and the parties thereafter treated it as such and we will do likewise. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court should not have proceeded on the petition flies in the face of her agreement and her request that the dissolution decree not be disturbed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> Before the defendant could answer the question, the court stated: \u201cOh, my God. Now that\u2019s enough. You are so far out of line what you\u2019re trying to prove here that I\u2019m not going to sit here and listen to anything more.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> After the court stopped the questions, the plaintiffs counsel stated the child\u2019s age, ten, and her claim that \u201ccustody and visitation, and all that, the matters are before the court as to whether this is fair and equitable.\u201d The court responded: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s before the court. The court finds that the financial status of the parties is not substantially different, and the orders entered at the time of the dissolution, at the time of the separation shall remain the orders of the court as of this dissolution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> After the court ruled, the following coEoquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u201cMrs. Pearl [Plaintiffs Counsel]: Your Honor please, I have not had\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">\u201cThe Court: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">\u201cMrs. Pearl: \u2014 an opportunity \u2014 my chent is on social security disabihty. That is a substantial change.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mrs. Pearl, anything that has happened here today has been through your own doing. You have deEberately strayed from the path you tried to put before the court, you put extraneous matters before the corut, you have delayed, and I\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">\u201cMrs. Pearl: Your Honor, I was here on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, you have wandered much too far off your course. This hearing is terminated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b264-15\"> The plaintiff raises several issues that we do not review. The eight issues that concern matters of alimony, support, custody and visitation, and insurance are urdikely to arise in the same fashion in the new trial, and, therefore, we wiE not discuss them. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly placed on her the burden of going forward and the burden of proof was not raised at trial. We decline to review this unpreserved claim.

App. 788, 800-801, 658 A.2d 114, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 915, 660 A.2d 356 (1995); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cordisco, </em>37 Conn.
