J.</author>\n<p id=\"adz-dedup-0\">The defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the denial of their motion to discharge a mechanic\u2019s lien and lis pendens. The plaintiff asserts in his supplemental brief that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal because it was filed after the expiration of the seven day appeal period specified by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-35c and 52-325c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree and, therefore, dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The record contains procedural facts necessary for our conclusion. On July 20, 1994, the defendants filed a motion for discharge of a mechanic\u2019s hen and lis pendens. On October 6,1994, the trial court denied that motion. On October 12, 1994, the defendants filed a \u201cmotion to reconsider and to clarify order denying defendants\u2019 motion to discharge mechanic\u2019s hen and lis pendens.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 2,1994, the trial court rendered an order granting that motion, but denying the relief requested therein.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 8, 1994, the defendants filed this appeal from (1) the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>order denying the defendants\u2019 motion for discharge of mechanic\u2019s lien and lis pendens, and (2) the trial court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue, but denying the relief requested therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The statutes governing the timeliness of the defendants\u2019 appeal are \u00a7\u00a7 49-35c<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 52-325c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>of these two statutes reveals that their language, from subsection (a) through subsection (c), is virtually identical. Pursuant to subsection (a), orders on motions to discharge or reduce mechanic\u2019s liens are deemed to be final judgments for the purpose of appeal. Subsection (b) provides that no appeal shall be taken from such order except within seven days thereof. Subsection (c) authorizes the court to set a bond with surety in order to stay the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Our Supreme Court considered the effect of statutory appeal periods on an appellate court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993). The disposi-tive issue in <em>Ambroise </em>was whether an appeal from the denial of a prejudgment remedy may be taken after the expiration of the seven day appeal period specified by General Statutes \u00a7 52-278L The court concluded that \u201cthe proper analysis of a statutory time limitation on the right to appeal devolves into a question of statutory construction: did the legislature, in imposing the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>limitation, intend to impose a subject matter jurisdictional requirement on the right to appeal?\u201d Id., 764. The court reviewed the language, historical background and purpose of \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>and concluded that the legislature did so intend. Id., 765-67. Because the appeal was not taken within the time allowed by statute, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id., 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Informed by the <em>Ambroise </em>analysis, this court has previously concluded that the seven day appeal period embodied in \u00a7 52-325c is mandatoiy and that a failure to appeal within that appeal peiiod deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Srager </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>36 Conn. App. 469, 651 A.2d 752 (1994). \u201cThe purpose of a notice of lis pendens . . . supports a conclusion that the legislature intended to make the seven day appeal period jurisdictional. That purpose is to ensure \u2018that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim cannot be defeated by a prejudgment transfer of the property.\u2019 <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 479, 457 A.2d 290, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983). ... The manifest purpose of the seven day appeal period following the discharge of a notice of lis pendens is to inform the parties within a very brief period of time whether that order is final or will be challenged.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Srager </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>supra, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201cIn <em>Ambroise, </em>the court also stated that [t]he literal reading of \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>(b) is buttressed, moreover, by reference to \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>(c), which reverses the ordinary rules regarding automatic stays on appeal by mandating that the order is not stayed by an appeal unless the party appealing posts a sufficient surety bond. . . . Likewise, a literal reading of the seven day appeal period in \u00a7 52-325c (b) is buttressed by the stay provisions set forth in that statute. Subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 52-325c require the appellant to post a bond if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>stay is granted beyond the seven day appeal period.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 471, quoting <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Because the language that establishes the seven day appeal period in \u00a7 49-35c (b) is clear and virtually the same as the language of \u00a7 52-325c (b), we conclude that its seven day appeal period is also mandatory and that a failure to appeal within that period likewise strips this court of subject matter jurisdiction. Our literal reading of the seven day appeal period set forth in \u00a7 49-35c (b) is also buttressed by reference to the stay provisions set forth in that statute because subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 49-35c likewise require the appellant to post a bond if a stay is granted beyond the seven day period. Furthermore, the plain language of \u00a7 49-35c (a) and (b) manifests the legislative intent that the seven day limit apply to orders entered pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-35b.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Meadow Lakes Realty Co., </em>235 Conn. 663, 668, 668 A.2d 712 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In the present case, the defendants did not file an appeal within seven days of the October 6, 1994 order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>denying their motion for discharge of a mechanic\u2019s lien and lis pendens. The defendants argue, however, that as a result of the trial court\u2019s granting of their motion to reargue,* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the order of October 6, 1994, was nullified. The defendants contend, therefore, that the November 2, 1994 order granting the motion to reargue, but denying the relief requested therein, reinstated the October 6, 1994 order and that the seven day appeal period commences November 2, 1994. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4009,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> if a party files a motion that would render the judgment or decision ineffective, then the period of time for filing an appeal shall commence from the issuance of notice of the decision or judgment on that motion. Practice Book \u00a7 4009, however, does not confer jurisdiction on the appellate courts of this state. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>supra, 226 Conn. 761. The jurisdiction of appellate courts is defined by statute. Id., 760-61. Because it is the statute that controls jurisdiction, which cannot be waived; see <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, 225 </em>Conn. 305, 308, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993); we conclude that compliance with the clear and emphatic language of \u00a7\u00a7 49-35c (b) and 52-325c (b) is a requisite for us to entertain this appeal. The defendants\u2019 failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>to take an appeal within seven days of the October 6, 1994 order deprives this court of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The defendants argue that because they filed this appeal within seven days of the November 2,1994 order granting their motion to reargue, but denying the relief requested therein, this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal, even if Practice Book \u00a7 4009 does not govern. This argument, however, must fail because the original order of October 6, 1994, was not nullified by the trial court\u2019s subsequent denial of relief requested in the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue. The original order was not augmented, diminished, altered or vitiated in any way and remained as the appealable event.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 106, 616 A.2d 798 (1992),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> supports our reasoning in reaching this conclusion. In that case, the plaintiff appealed from a judgment of the trial court dismissing its zoning appeal from a decision of the defendant zoning board of appeals. The trial court initially rendered a judgment, accompanied by a memorandum of decision, dismissing the plaintiffs appeal. Id., 109. Thereafter, we granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, and the Supreme Court transferred the case to its docket. The trial court subsequently opened its judgment of dismissal sua sponte and, by a corrected memorandum of decision, rendered a new judgment sustaining the plaintiffs appeal. Despite the fact that the judgment from which the plaintiff filed its appeal had been opened and a new judgment favorable to the plaintiff had been substituted in its place, the plaintiff did not withdraw its appeal from the first opened judgment. Id., 110. In deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>that appeal, our Supreme Court concluded that the first opened judgment was moot because the second memorandum of decision and the judgment rendered in accordance therewith, completely displaced the first memorandum of decision and judgment and, therefore, dismissed that appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In the present case, the situation is reversed; the trial court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue, but denying the relief requested therein, did nothing to displace the trial court\u2019s original October 6, 1994 order. There is nothing in the record here that supports the defendants\u2019 assertion that the trial court nullified its original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 claims on appeal all relate to the merits of the underlying order of October 6, 1994, rather than to whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the relief sought by the defendants in the motion to reargue. See <em>Tiber Holding Corp. </em>v. Greenberg, 36 Conn. App. 670, 672, 652 A.2d 1063 (1995). The time for complaining about the merits had expired by legislative fiat. If the legislature had wanted to grant appellate jurisdiction beyond seven days from the date of a denial of a motion to discharge a mechanic\u2019s lien or a lis pendens, it would have provided a legislative extension such as that provided by Practice Book \u00a7 4009.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The defendants\u2019 remaining assertion that the plaintiff waived any claim it may have regarding subject matter jurisdiction is equally unavailing because \u201c[s]ubject matter jurisdiction, unlike jurisdiction of the person, cannot be created through consent or waiver.\u201d <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 429-30, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> The defendants in this appeal are <em>Dorm E. </em>Smith and Maiy Ellen Quirk, joint owners of the property on which the work forming the basis of the lien was performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> We, suasponte, raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and ordered the parties to file simultaneous supplemental briefs addressing the following issue: \u201cWhether there is subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal where the statutory time period for filing the appeal prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-35c (b) and 52-325c (b) had run by the time the appeal was taken, but where a motion to \u2018reconsider and to clarify order denying defendants\u2019 motion to discharge mechanic\u2019s lien and lis pendens\u2019 was filed before the appeal period had run.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-35c and 52-325c; Practice Book \u00a7 4009; <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>30 Conn.
