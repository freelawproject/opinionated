App. 531, 662 A.2d 150, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 906, 665 A.2d 903 (1995). The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial by the court, of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and robbery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-136 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 53a-133.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. Coleman, supra, 38 Conn. App. 531, we addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that the destruction of a sex crime kit had deprived the defendant of his right to due process of law under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. In deciding the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss following discovery of the destruction of the evidence, the trial court had applied the bad faith test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to dismiss, however, our Supreme Court decided that the <em>Asherman</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>balancing test must be used in cases involving a claim of violation of due process because of the loss or destruction of physical evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>232 Conn. 707, 657 A.2d 585 (1995). We remanded the case to the trial court to reconsider the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 536. On remand, the trial court determined that the defendant\u2019s due process rights had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">On the basis of the proceedings on remand, the defendant now claims that the trial court (1) improperly violated his right to due process of law by refusing to permit him to introduce evidence in an evidentiary hearing and improperly applied the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree. Because we disagree, we also address the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>(2) denied him a one day continuance, (3) refused to remove the shackles and to state any reason for the use of the shackles, (4) deprived him of due process by convicting him of burglary in the second degree, (5) concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction of burglary in the first degree, (6) violated his right not to be placed in double jeopardy, (7) concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction of unlawful restraint in the first degree, (8) deprived him of due process when it vindictively sentenced him to 110 years in prison, and (9) violated his right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>State </em>v. Coleman, supra, 38 Conn. App. 533-34, we set forth the following facts. \u201cOn August 12, 1986, the defendant was arraigned on seven charges stemming from a burglary, robbery and repeated sexual assaults that occurred in the early morning of March 4, 1986. An agreement was reached in which the defendant pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the charges, as well as to charges from eight other files. Prior to sentencing, the defendant sought to withdraw all of his pleas. The trial court allowed the defendant to withdraw his plea on one count from another file, but denied his motion to withdraw his pleas in this case. The defendant was sentenced to thirty-five years in prison on all charges from all nine files.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant to withdraw his plea. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>17 Conn. App. 307, 552 A.2d 442 (1989). Subsequently, the defendant filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal court claiming that his plea canvass was defective. The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut vacated the defendant\u2019s pleas and remanded the matter for trial. After that decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>on February 19,1992, the New Haven police department destroyed several pieces of evidence from the case. The destruction of that evidence was carried out pursuant to a court order dated June 6, 1990. A sex crime kit, which was not included on the list was erroneously destroyed. The kit contained physical evidence pertinent to the sexual assault. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit subsequently affirmed the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cAfter pleading not guilty to all counts, the defendant elected to be tried by the court. The defendant requested that the sex crime kit be made available for [deoxyribonucleic acid] DNA testing. When the state revealed that the kit had been erroneously destroyed, the defendant moved to suppress any test results and information regarding the testing of items in the kit, and to dismiss the charges on the basis of the state\u2019s destruction of potentially exculpatory physical evidence. The motions were denied. The trial court found the defendant guilty on seven of the eight counts as charged. On the other count, the court found the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of burglary in the second degree. The defendant received an effective sentence of 110 years in prison.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 533-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The trial court found the following additional facts. The victim resided alone in a New Haven apartment. During the early morning of March 4, 1986, she was asleep with her glasses on and wearing a nightgown. Between 3:30 and 4 a.m., the defendant used a sharp cutting tool to remove a pane of glass from one of the victim\u2019s bedroom windows and entered her apartment. The victim awoke with the defendant straddling her. The defendant held his hand over the victim\u2019s mouth and told her not to move if she did not want to get hurt. The defendant told her to take off her glasses and she did so. The defendant forced her to commit fellatio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>as he stood next to her bed and also forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant then demanded the victim\u2019s money. She had cashed her paycheck the previous day and had separated the money into envelopes, each marked for the purpose of paying various bills. The defendant ordered the victim to take the money from the envelopes and she did so. The victim estimated that she had between $500 and $600. The defendant went through the envelopes and moved them about on the bed. The defendant asked the victim if she had any jewels or furs, and she replied in the negative. The defendant also asked her if she had a car, and she replied that she had a Datsun; he said he did not want the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The defendant then ordered the victim to get on her hands and knees on the bed, and he engaged in anal intercourse. He also forced her to engage again in fellatio. Before leaving, the defendant forced the victim onto her stomach and tied her up with shoelaces that he had brought with him. The defendant cut the victim\u2019s telephone wires inside the apartment and left through a window and down a fire escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">After waiting a short time to be certain that the defendant was gone, the victim freed herself. After discovering that her telephone wires had been cut, she called the police from a neighbor\u2019s telephone. When the police arrived they took the victim to the police station where she gave a statement. The police then took the victim to a hospital for a physical examination. The police later identified the defendant through a partial palm print that he had left on one of the envelopes in the apartment that had contained the victim\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The defendant claims that the trial court violated his right to due process by refusing to hold an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>hearing with respect to the balancing test adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 707. In our earlier decision in this case, we \u201cremanded for further proceedings to reconsider the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss by applying the appropriate balancing test in light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra [707].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 536. The defendant argues that by refusing to consider his proffered evidence the trial court did not afford him an opportunity to address adequately the factors of the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test. The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly applied the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cInquiry into whether particular procedures are constitutionally mandated in a given instance requires adherence to the principle that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). There is no per se rule that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever a liberty interest may be affected. Due process ... is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. . . . <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 675, 97 S. Ct. 1401, 51 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1977). Rather, the [s]pecific dictates of due process generally require consideration of three distinct factors: [f]irst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the [state\u2019s] interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u201cWhen determining what procedures are constitutionally required, we must bear in mind that [t]he essence of due process is the requirement that a person in jeopardy of a serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and [an] opportunity to meet it. . . . Id., 348-49.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>235 Conn. 487, 492-93, 668 A.2d 360 (1995). In other words, due process requires \u201cnotice and proceedings . . . adequate to safeguard the right for which the constitutional protection is invoked.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>218 Conn. 778, 785, 591 A.2d 399 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Our Supreme Court stated in <em>Morales </em>that to decide whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial by reason of the state\u2019s failure to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence \u201cthe trial court must employ the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test, weighing the reasons for the unavailability of the evidence against the degree of prejudice to the accused. More specifically, the trial court must balance the totality of the circumstances surrounding the missing evidence, including the following factors: \u2018the materiality of the missing evidence, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of it by witnesses or the jury, the reason for its nonavailability to the defense and the prejudice to the defendant caused by the unavailability of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 726-27, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 724, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985). We must analyze, therefore, whether the proceedings on remand were adequate to safeguard against the violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights by the state\u2019s destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In this case, the defendant argues that, because <em>Morales </em>was decided while his appeal to this court was pending, not all of the information that is relevant to the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test had been presented when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the trial court initially considered, pursuant to the bad faith test, whether the state\u2019s destruction of evidence violated his due process rights. At the hearing on remand, the defendant proffered the following evidence in support of his motion to dismiss. The defendant first proffered the transcript of the testimony from another trial given by Carl Ladd, a geneticist from the state forensics laboratory who is an expert in deoxyribonu-cleic acid (DNA). Ladd\u2019s testimony was that in 1993 he had been able to perform DNA tests on samples from a sex crime kit taken in 1986. The defendant also proffered for judicial notice records from the defendant\u2019s federal habeas case to establish the chronology of the entry of certain orders. The defendant finally proffered the testimony of Thomas Farver, the trial attorney in this case, to clarify whether Farver knew that the evidence was not available when he filed a motion for a DNA test. The trial court refused to consider the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence and proceeded on the basis of the evidence that had been presented at trial and in the first hearing on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The defendant further argues that the trial court improperly applied the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test by (1) requiring proof of the evidentiary value of the <em>particular </em>evidence that was destroyed rather than evaluating the <em>type </em>of evidence that was destroyed, (2) determining that there was no likelihood that the evidence was mistakenly interpreted, and (3) determining whether there was bad faith rather than considering the reasons for the unavailability of the evidence. We are unpersuaded. The trial court neither improperly applied the <em>Asher-man </em>balancing test nor violated the defendant\u2019s due process right to an adequate proceeding by refusing to allow the defendant to introduce his proffered evidence in a full evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The trial court concluded that \u201cthe missing evidence is not material, that the analysis of the missing evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>. . . was not wrongly interpreted, and there is no prejudice caused to the defendant by the unavailability of said evidence. The defendant\u2019s due process rights have not been violated.\u201d In reviewing the trial court\u2019s application of the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test, we are guided by our previous decisions and those of our Supreme Court. Because the question of the defendant\u2019s due process right to have the state preserve potentially exculpatory evidence is a mixed determination of fact and law that requires the application of legal principles, our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>39 Conn. App. 617, 623, 667 A.2d 68 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The crucial question in addressing the materiality of the potentially exculpatoiy evidence is whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In cases such as this, a critical issue has been whether scientific tests could have been effectively performed on the destroyed evidence and produced useful evidence. Id., 624; citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 726; <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>18 Conn. App. 223, 234-35, 557 A.2d 1271, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 809, 564 A.2d 1072 (1989). In this case, the trial court noted, and our review of the record confirms, that \u201c[t]here was no evidence offered upon which it would be determined whether it could have been scientifically possible for the defendant to conduct tests of the anal smear or anal swab for DNA matter. It is nothing but speculation to think that the specific smear or swab in this case could have been tested for DNA matter.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant argues that his failure to show the value of the specific piece of destroyed evidence is not fatal to his claim. The defendant points out that he attempted to introduce evidence through the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of Ladd that scientifically useful evidence has been obtained from the <em>type </em>of evidence at issue. The defendant refers to Ladd\u2019s testimony in a separate trial that in 1993 he had been able to perform DNA tests on samples from a sex crime kit that had been taken in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 726, our Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he defendant offered no evidence nor made any offer of proof that the amounts of blood on the key ring and the hair were sufficient, if properly tested, to establish blood type.\u201d Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 624, we noted that \u201c[e]ven if we assume that the perpetrator wiped his penis on the victim\u2019s jacket after he assaulted her, we are left to speculate as to whether the jacket became stained, whether the stain would have indicated semen or some other substance, whether the substance would have been uncontaminated and sufficient in amount to conduct scientific testing, and whether the testing would have been effective to demonstrate that the defendant could not have been the perpetrator.\u201d These decisions make it clear that, in analyzing the materiality of the destroyed evidence, the trial court properly focused on the specific evidence at issue. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 234\u201435. We conclude that because the proffered testimony of Ladd had no bearing on whether scientific tests could have been effectively performed on the destroyed evidence and produced useful evidence in this case, the trial court did not improperly refuse to consider the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Another critical factor in examining the materiality of the destroyed evidence pursuant to the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test \u201cis the defendant\u2019s lack of interest in the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>[224 Conn. 347, 365, 618 A.2d 513 (1993)]; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 327, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978). \u2018The fact that a defendant failed to request the evidence goes to the issue of materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ality and whether the defendant deemed it significant.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 712 n.7.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 625. The defendant sought to demonstrate his interest in the evidence by offering Farver\u2019s testimony and records from the defendant\u2019s federal habeas case to establish the chronology of the entry of certain orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The defendant\u2019s proffered evidence would demonstrate that on December 30, 1991, the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut vacated the defendant\u2019s pleas and remanded the matter for trial. On May 8, 1992, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decision of the District Court. The defendant intended to elicit from Farver the date of his appointment to this case, the date he filed an appearance, that on June 8, 1993, he filed a motion for disclosure of evidence and to compel DNA testing, and that he learned of the destruction of the evidence on June 11, 1993. Because the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence would show that he did not consider the evidence material enough to request it prior to June 8, 1993, the trial court did not deny the defendant\u2019s due process right to an adequate proceeding by refusing to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly applied the second <em>Asherman </em>factor. The defendant posits that because the trial court improperly considered the evidence as tested rather than untested, it misinterpreted the missing evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Asher-man, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 724. The trial court noted that the anal swab and smear samples from the sex crime kit had been tested and spermatozoa and seminal acid phosphatase found. The samples demonstrated, therefore, that some kind of sexual activity had occurred. The samples had not, however, been tested for DNA. The defendant has offered nothing to indicate that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the evidence or lack of evidence. In this respect, it weighs heavily against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the defendant that his case was tried to the court as opposed to a jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The defendant argues finally that the trial court improperly limited its analysis of the third factor of the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test to a consideration of the issue of bad faith and refused to consider the defendant\u2019s assertion that the state intentionally destroyed the evidence. The defendant ignores, however, that at the original hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the court considered the circumstances surrounding the destruction of the evidence. The court found that although the New Haven police department incorrectly thought that the June 6, 1990 destruction order included the sex crime kit, it was reasonable for the police to have believed that the kit was included.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the hearing on remand, the trial court held: \u201cAs the court has already found, the police did not act in bad faith.\u201d We conclude that the trial court properly \u201c \u2018focused on the motives behind the destruction of the evidence\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 626, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 231; in balancing the third <em>Asherman </em>factor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly applied the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test. In addition, the defendant was given an opportunity to be heard on his motion to dismiss and to make an offer of proof with respect to supporting his claim pursuant to our remand. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 497. The defendant offered no such supporting evidence, and we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the defendant to introduce his proffered evidence before denying his motion to dismiss. We must now address the defendant\u2019s remaining claims from his original appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his request for a one day continuance to obtain the testimony of an alibi witness. On the last day of trial, the defendant told his counsel that a woman with whom he had lived in 1986 would testify that they were together during the early morning hours of March 4, 1986. The defendant\u2019s counsel informed the court of the defendant\u2019s assertion that a potential alibi witness existed and requested a one day continuance. The trial court denied the request, noting the age of the case and that the request was nothing more than a \u201cdilatory\u201d tactic by the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for a continuance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Prutting, </em>40 Conn. App. 151, 168-69, 669 A.2d 1228, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 922, 674 A.2d 1328 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The defendant next claims that he was deprived of his right to a fair trial<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because the trial court refused, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>over the defendant\u2019s objections, to unshackle him on the first and fourth days of his trial. \u201c \u2018The negative connotations of restraints . . . are without significance unless the fact of the restraints comes to the attention of the jury.\u2019 \u201d Id., 167, quoting <em>State v. Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 508, 594 A.2d 906 (1991). Because the defendant was tried by the court, we conclude that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by being shackled during his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The defendant next claims that his conviction of burglary in the second degree violated his constitutional right to notice. U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. In count one of its long form information, the state charged the defendant with first degree burglary, alleging that on March 4, 1986, prior to 4 a.m., the defendant entered or remained unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime therein while armed with a dangerous instrument. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (1). The trial court dismissed count one, but on the state\u2019s request considered a \u201clesser included offense\u201d and convicted the defendant of burglary in the second degree.

A defendant has adequate notice \u201c[if] the state\u2019s pleadings . . . informed the defendant of the charge against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 168, 422 A.2d 299 (1979).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ballas, </em>180 Conn. 662, 664, 433 A.2d 989 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 154, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). The defendant argues that he did not have adequate notice of the charge of burglary in the second degree because it is not a lesser included offense of burglary in the first degree. The state contends that because the information alleged that the crime occurred prior to 4 a.m., the defendant was notified that the crime occurred at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cThere are [separate] tests comparing one crime with another to determine if one is a lesser included offense of the other or if the two are separate crimes. See <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L.

The defendant asserts that burglary in the second degree requires proof that the offense occurred at night while burglary in the first degree does not. Moreover, the defendant asserts, burglary in the first degree requires proof that the defendant was armed with a dangerous instrument while burglary in the second degree does not. We do not undertake a comparison of the elements of one crime to another when the notice requirement of due process is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Instead, \u201cwe must determine whether it was possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>supra, [201 Conn. 385].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcon, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 264-65. While the crime of burglary in the first degree did not require the state to allege that the defendant committed the crime at night, it is clear that the state did allege that fact in the information by stating that the crime occurred on March 4, 1986, prior to 4 a.m. We conclude, therefore, that it was not possible for the defendant to commit burglary in the first degree, in the manner described in the information, without first having committed burglary in the second degree. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Under these circumstances, the defendant cannot complain that he was not aware of the state\u2019s nighttime burglary theory. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 156. \u201c \u2018As the state\u2019s pleadings here informed the defendant of the charge against him with sufficient precision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise . . . they have performed their constitutional duty.\u2019 \u201d Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>205 Conn. 456, 465-66, 534 A.2d 230 (1987) (defendant\u2019s waiver of right to jury trial for burglary in first degree constituted waiver for burglary in second degree charged in substitute information \u201cbecause a defendant is deemed to be on notice that a charge of the more serious offense encompasses the lesser offenses\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>187 Conn. 216, 219, 445 A.2d 585 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The defendant next claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of burglary in the first degree. Burglary in the first degree as charged in this case requires proof that the defendant entered or unlawfully remained in a building with the intent to commit a crime therein and, in the course of committing that offense, he intentionally, knowingly or recklessly inflicted bodily injury on another person.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant argues that his conviction should be vacated because there is no evidence that he inflicted \u201cbodily injury\u201d on the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Neither \u00a7 53a-101 (a) nor Connecticut case law defines \u201cbodily injury.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990), nevertheless, we find support for concluding that a sexual assault causes bodily injury. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>supra, 603, our Supreme Court held that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that the defendant could use deadly physical force if necessary to repel a forcible sexual assault. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 a person is justified in using deadly physical force if the person reasonably believes that another person was (1) using or about to use deadly physical force or (2) inflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>or about to inflict great bodily harm. Our Supreme Court concluded that the common law provided that a person could justifiably use deadly force in self-defense of sodomy and rape because those offenses cause great bodily harm, and that \u00a7 53a-19 codified the common law rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>supra, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The injuries caused by sexual assaults \u201coften far exceed physical injuries in duration and in their impact 'on the victim\u2019s life.1 \u201cShort of homicide, [sexual assault] is the \u2018ultimate violation of self.\u2019 It is also a violent crime because it normally involves force, or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. [Sexual assault] is very often accompanied by physical injury to the [victim] <em>and can also inflict mental and psychological damage.\u201d Coker </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 597-98, 97 S.

We conclude that the defendant inflicted bodily injury on the victim by forcing the victim to engage in anal intercourse.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The trial court sentenced the defendant to twenty years for his conviction of burglary in the first degree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The trial court also sentenced the defendant to ten years for his conviction of burglary in the second degree, which was to run concurrent with his sentences on all other counts.

First, the charges must arise out of the same act or transaction. Second, it must be determined whether the charged crimes are the same offense. Multiple punishments are forbidden only if both conditions are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 49; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 571-72, 638 A.2d 578 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In determining whether the crimes arose out of the same act or transaction, we refer to the language of the information. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>34 Conn.

Because the information charges the defendant with two counts of burglary by performing acts at the same place at the same time, \u201cbut fails to state the nature of the alleged acts with sufficient particularity to determine whether they are in fact the same act or transaction, we construe the ambiguity in favor of the defendant and conclude that the charges arise out of the same act or transaction for double jeopardy purposes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>178 Conn. 422, 425, 423 A.2d 114 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>[14 Conn. App. 10, 17, 539 A.2d 1005, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 891, 109 S.

In order to convict the defendant of burglary in the first degree, the state had to prove that the defendant \u201cinflict[ed] or attempted] to inflict bodily injury\u201d on another person.

Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 801, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cwhen a greater penalty is imposed after trial than was imposed after a prior guilty plea, the increase in sentence is not more likely than not attributable to the vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201c[e]ven when the same judge imposes both sentences, the relevant sentencing information available to the judge after the plea will usually be considerably less than that available after a trial.\u201d Id. In other words, \u201cin the course of the proof at trial the judge may gather a fuller appreciation of the nature and extent of the crimes charged. The defendant\u2019s conduct during trial may give the judge insights into his moral character and suitability for rehabilitation. . . . Finally, after trial, the factors that may have indicated leniency as consideration for the guilty plea are no longer present.\u201d Id. The <em>Pearce </em>presumption, therefore, does not apply to the defendant\u2019s situation in this case under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Nevertheless, the defendant claims that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption, or at least a modified form of the presumption, should be recognized under the Connecticut constitution. The defendant argues that we should examine the circumstances of each case to determine whether the presumption should apply, and that the 110 year sentence imposed in this case raises a presumption of vindictiveness. The defendant further argues that it is not unreasonable to require a judge imposing a higher sentence to state on the record the reasons for the higher sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">For support, the defendant relies on case law from other jurisdictions. First, the defendant points out that in <em>San Roman </em>v. <em>State, </em>815 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991), the Court of Appeals of Texas reversed the defendant\u2019s seventy-five year sentence because the defendant had twice before been sentenced to only fifty years. In <em>San Roman, </em>however, the defendant had first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>been sentenced following a jury trial and then pursuant to a plea agreement. Id., 787. The requirements articulated in <em>Pearce </em>that the trial court state on the record the reasons for the increased sentence, therefore, applied in <em>San Roman </em>only because the defendant received a greater sentence after his second trial than he did after his first trial. Id., 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The defendant next points to <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>628 A.2d 1009, 1013-14 (D.C. 1993), in which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals stated that \u201ca case by case determination is required to determine whether the presumption of vindictiveness is appropriate. The determination rests on an evaluation of whether there is concern about \u2018institutional interests that might occasion higher sentences by a judge desirous of discouraging what he [or she] regards as mer-itless appeals.\u2019 <em>Texas </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>[supra, 475 U.S. 138-39] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) We note that that case was \u201cthe exact opposite of <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 794 . . . since the trial preceded the plea.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 1014. The <em>Johnson </em>court, therefore, considered different institutional concerns than those before us in this appeal. We conclude that the defendant has not provided us with any support for his claim that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption should apply to this case under the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Moreover, our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 109, persuades us that the Connecticut constitution does not require the <em>Pearce </em>presumption to apply to the situation in this case. In <em>Taylor, </em>the court held that the presumption did not apply where a sentencing court imposed a greater sentence after a habeas court found that the defendant\u2019s \u201crights had been prejudiced by the imposition of an effective sentence greater than that agreed to, and ordered the court to vacate the sentences and either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>impose an effective sentence [in accordance with the agreement], or allow the defendant to withdraw his pleas.\u201d Id., 112.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The court stated that there was no realistic motive for vindictive sentencing in the sentencing court\u2019s action. Id., 117. In addition, the court stated: \u201cWe decline to expand upon the doctrine established in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>[supra, 395 U.S. 711].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 113 n.9. Because the defendant has failed to provide any authority, and we have not located any, that institutional interests dictate that we should presume a trial court acted vindictively where a defendant is tried and given a greater sentence than the defendant received following an earlier defective plea canvass, we decline so to conclude under the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u201cWhere the <em>Pearce </em>presumption does not apply, the defendant must prove that vindictiveness actually occurred in the resentencing procedure, in order to obtain relief.\u201d Id., 117. The defendant argues that \u201cthe tremendous increase in the sentence, and the fact that it is so disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases . . . demonstrate actual vindictiveness.\u201d We conclude, however, that the defendant must show more than that the trial court increased his sentence in order to demonstrate actual vindictiveness. \u201c \u2018[T]he evil the <em>[Pearce] </em>Court sought to prevent\u2019 was not the imposition of \u2018enlarged sentences after a new trial\u2019 but \u2018vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.\u2019 <em>[Texas </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>supra, 475 U.S. 138]. See also <em>Chaffin </em>v. <em>Stynch-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>combe, 412 U.S. 17, 25 [93 S. Ct. 1977, 36 L. Ed. 2d 714] (1973) (the <em>Pearce </em>presumption was not designed to prevent the imposition of an increased sentence on retrial \u2018for some valid reason associated with the need for flexibility and discretion in the sentencing process,\u2019 but was \u2018premised on the apparent need to guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process\u2019).\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The defendant claims finally that he was given a disproportionate sentence in violation of his right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and his right to due process under article first, \u00a7 \u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The defendant argues that he has a right to have this court compare his sentence to the sentences of other prisoners with multiple sexual assault convictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The United States Supreme Court has clearly stated that the sort of proportionality review that the defendant seeks is not required by the federal constitution. <em>Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>465 U.S. 37, 43-44, 104 S. Ct. 871, 79 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1984). The defendant\u2019s claim based on the Connecticut constitution has also been addressed. \u201cIt is well established that when the sentence imposed is within the limits fixed by statute for the offenses charged, an appellate claim that the sentence is excessive is nothing more than an appeal for clemency and a request that this court exercise discretionary authority it did not possess. <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 127, 445 A.2d 304 (1982). ...
