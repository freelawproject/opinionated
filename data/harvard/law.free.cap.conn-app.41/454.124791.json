The defendant appeared without counsel. At the trial, the state presented one witness, Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>necticut State Trooper Warren Hyatt, the officer who had weighed the defendant\u2019s truck. Hyatt had been a truck enforcement officer for ten years prior to March 14, 1994. The defendant presented no evidence or witnesses nor did he cross-examine Hyatt. The defendant was found guilty on both counts and ordered to pay $11,784 in fines, court costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The trial court could reasonably have found the following facts. In March, 1994, the defendant was the registered owner of a 1988 International dump truck. On March 14 of that year, Hyatt observed the defendant\u2019s truck near exit 43 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. The truck was loaded with gravel or fill. Hyatt noticed the truck because its load was \u201cvery high\u201d and its \u201ctag-axle\u201d was raised, making it a three axle vehicle rather than a four-axle vehicle. According to Hyatt a tag-axle is an axle that can be raised or lowered with an air gauge and a lever. A truck\u2019s maximum allowable load is greater when the tag-axle is down. Conversely, when a truck\u2019s tag-axle is up, its maximum allowable weight decreases. Realizing that the truck would be \u201cextremely heavy,\u201d Hyatt pulled the vehicle over, spoke with the driver, and escorted both driver and truck to a nearby weigh station.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">At the station, Hyatt weighed the truck and two of its axles. The gross weight of the truck was 81,900 pounds, more than 28,000 pounds over the legal limit of 53,800 pounds. The axle weight was 58,240 pounds, more than 22,000 pounds over the legal limit of 36,000 pounds. Because the vehicle was more than 25 percent overweight, Hyatt ordered the driver to off-load the truck and told him that it was \u201cgrounded.\u201d The driver parked the truck outside the station and stated that he would contact the defendant. Hyatt then issued the defendant a ticket charging him with two counts of operating an overweight commercial motor vehicle in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-267a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, Hyatt wrote the ticket for the maximum amount that could be assessed against the defendant for each violation, which he had calculated pursuant to the statutory formula.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 14-267a (f) (2). He then gave the ticket to the defendant\u2019s driver who gave it to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The issues presented by the defendant are being raised for the first time on appeal. Those two issues are that the trial court improperly failed (1) to apprise the defendant of his right to trial by jury and (2) to ascertain whether the defendant knowingly waived his right to counsel. Review of these claims is sought under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On his jury trial claim, the defendant also invokes General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tice Book \u00a7 839, and on his waiver of the right to counsel claim he also refers to Practice Book \u00a7 961.* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201c[A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant to the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gol</em>ding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The state first argues that the defendant does not have a constitutional right to a jury trial because the trial of a defendant under \u00a7 14-267a is not a criminal prosecution. It also argues that even if \u00a7 14-267a were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>considered criminal, that alone would not entitle the defendant to a jury trial because the constitutional guarantee of the right to a jury trial does not apply to \u201call criminal prosecutions,\u201d noting that \u201cso-called petty offenses may be tried without a jury.\u201d The state claims that the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to apply \u00a7 54-82b and, in any event, operating an overweight commercial motor vehicle is not a \u201ccriminal action\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 54-82b. Next, the state claims that the trial court was not required to advise the defendant of his right to retain private counsel or to obtain an express waiver of that right before allowing the defendant to proceed pro se because the defendant has no sixth amendment right to counsel in an action for sanctions under \u00a7 14-267a, which is not a criminal prosecution. In addition, the state claims that under the sixth amendment, advisement and waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel is not required where there is no possibility that the defendant will be imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly failed to advise him of his constitutional right to a jury trial. Under <em>Golding, </em>the defendant here has the burden of demonstrating, inter alia, that this \u201calleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived [him] of a fair trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. In this case the defendant has not sustained the burden of showing that he had a constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The sixth amendment to the United States constitution, which is made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment, guarantees the right to a jury trial. That amendment provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crimes shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>have been committed . . . .\u201d See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 153-58, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To prevail on his claim that he had a constitutional right to a jury trial for his trial under \u00a7 14-267a, the defendant must, therefore, show that his trial was a criminal prosecution as that term is used in the federal constitution. This is so because \u201cthe protections provided by the Sixth Amendment are available only in \u2018criminal prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 248, 100 S. Ct. 2636, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Determining whether a particular statute is criminal or civil in nature is a matter of statutory construction and a two level inquiry is utilized. Id., 248-49. Thus, the first question is whether \u00a7 14-267a is intended to be, or by its nature necessarily is, criminal and punitive, or civil and remedial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 362, 104 S. Ct. 1099, 79 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1984). In <em>Ward, </em>the court said that \u201c[f]irst, we have set out to determine whether Congress, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly, a preference for one label or the other [civil or criminal]. . . . Second, where Congress has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect to negate that intention.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 248-49. Where the legislative intent to establish the penalty is civil and remedial, that intent will govern unless \u201cthe clearest proof\u201d demonstrates that the sanction is punitive in purpose and effect. Id.; <em>In re Garay, </em>89 N.J. 104, 112, 444 A.2d 1107 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The second level of inquiry is to determine whether the civil remedial mechanism of the statute \u201cprovided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>for sanctions so punitive as to \u2018transfer[m]\u2019 what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 249, quoting <em>Rex Trailer Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 148, 184, 76 S. Ct. 219, 100 L. Ed. 149 (1956).This is done by addressing the seven considerations listed in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S. Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963), which are: \u201cWhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">In the present case, the legislature\u2019s intent that the sanction in the statute is civil may be implicit or explicit. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>supra, 465 U.S. 362, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 248. There is no express label attached to \u00a7 14-267a or a statement in it that can be said to constitute an express declaration of intent. An examination of the predecessor of \u00a7 14-267a, however, \u201c \u2018is worth a volume of logic,\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>New York Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Eisner, </em>256 U.S. 345, 349, [41 S. Ct. 506, 65 L. Ed. 963 (1921)]\u201d as the <em>Kennedy </em>court noted in its analysis. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Martinez-Mendoza, </em>supra, 372 U.S. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In 1921, the General Assembly enacted \u201cAn Act concerning Motor Vehicles,\u201d which was in Chapter 400 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the 1921 Public Acts and \u00a7 32 of which was entitled \u201cOperation of over-weight motor vehicle.\u201d Public Acts 1921, c. 400, \u00a7 32. That section provided the following for its violation: \u201cAny person who shall violate the provision of this section shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than one year or both, and upon any conviction for such violation the commissioner may in his discretion demand of the owner of such motor vehicle a bond with sufficient surety to the state in the sum of not less than five hundred dollars, which bond shall be forfeited to the state upon a second conviction for the violation of the provision of this section.\u201d In 1927, the 1921 statute was amended to apply to \u201cany commercial motor vehicle.\u201d Public Acts 1927, c. 311, \u00a7 2. The penalty provision of the 1921 act remained the same but immediately after that penalty language the 1927 act provided the following: \u201cThe commissioner [of motor vehicles] may revoke the registration of any commercial motor vehicle so operated and may refuse to issue registration for such motor vehicle during such time as he may deem reasonable.\u201d Public Acts 1927, c. 311, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In 1953, however, the legislature made a significant determination looking to the decriminalization of this statute when it eliminated the imprisonment provision and, by its 1953 amendment, articulated a sliding scale of the fine proportionate to the severity of the overweight. General Statutes (1953 Sup.) \u00a7 1027c; Public Acts 1953, c. 434, \u00a7 2. A later indication of the legislative intent further to decriminalize \u00a7 14-267a is found with the 1969 enactment of the Penal Code in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-27 under which the violation of \u00a7 14-267a became a \u201cmotor vehicle violation.\u201d Under \u00a7 53a-27 (a), \u201c[a]n offense for which the only sentence authorized is a fine, is a violation unless expressly designated an infraction.\u201d Section 14-267a is not \u201cexpressly designated an infraction.\u201d Moreover, under another section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of the 1969 Penal Code, now General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a motor vehicle violation is not a crime as that term \u201ccomprises felonies or misdemeanors.\u201d A motor vehicle violation under \u00a7 53a-24 (a) is not even an \u201coffense,\u201d which is defined as \u201cany crime or violation which constitutes a breach of any law of this state . . . for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment or to a fine, or both, may be imposed, <em>except </em>one that defines a motor vehicle violation or is deemed to be an infraction. . . . Every offense which is not a \u2018crime\u2019 is a \u2018violation\u2019. Conviction of a violation shall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a criminal offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Not only does this language of \u00a7 53a-24 (a) further justify considering \u00a7 14-267a as intended to be civil and not criminal by its legal status as that of a \u201cmotor vehicle violation,\u201d but also the last sentence of this subsection explicitly negates the intent that any criminality be attached to a conviction of a violation of \u00a7 14-267a. The 1971 comment by the commission to revise the criminal statutes concerning \u00a7 14-267a<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> lends additional support to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>claim of the state that \u00a7\u00a7 53a-24 and 53a-27 further show the legislative intent to decriminalize \u00a7 14-267a. It is clear from what we have said that the legislative intent in \u00a7 14-267a is definitely civilly oriented with its penalty being civil. This statute, therefore, is intended by the legislature to be civil not criminal for constitutional purposes. This brings us to the second level of inquiry and that is a consideration of the <em>Kennedy </em>factors where, given the legislative intent demonstrative of their establishment of a civil penalty, \u201cwhether the statutory scheme of [\u00a7 14-267a is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Initially, we note that the statutory sanction in \u00a7 14-267a does not involve an affirmative disability or restraint under <em>Kennedy. </em>The civil penalty itself does not provide a restraint. There is the possibility that where there has been a conviction under \u00a7 14-267a, \u201cthe commissioner [of motor vehicles] may revoke the registration, for a period of thirty days, of any commercial motor vehicle so operated and may refuse to issue a registration for such motor vehicle during such further time as the commissioner deems reasonable. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-267a (f) (3). This power is de minimis in the constitutional context, as such brief period of revocation lies within the administrative ken and not the judicial. Significantly, however, on this \u201caffirmative disability or restraint\u201d factor is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201c[c]onviction of a violation [which \u00a7 14-267a is] shall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on conviction of a criminal offense.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24 (a). Next, it can reasonably be said that the penalty here is remedial and civil when the purpose of such legislation is considered. \u201cThe legislative intent of the statute ... is to prevent the destruction of public highways in the state from overloaded vehicles.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Salone, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 482, 486, 174 A.2d 803 (1961). \u201cThe act is a police regulation to maintain and keep from destruction the public highways of the community.\u201d Id., 489; see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>409 Pa. 521, 525, 187 A.2d 267 (1963). The legislative history reveals the legislators\u2019 concern that axle overweights on vehicles would cause rapid deterioration of highway structure and damage to our highways. 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1984 Sess., pp. 6270-82. It has been recognized that civil penalties also can compensate society at large for the harm it has suffered at the hands of violators and compensate the government for the cost of enforcing the applicable law. <em>Kimmelman </em>v. <em>Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 N.J. 123, 130, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987); C. Diver, \u201cThe Assessment and Mitigation of Civil Money Penalties by Federal Administrative Agencies,\u201d 79 Colum. L. Rev. 1436, 1468-69 (1979). This statute accomplishes that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We next consider whether the sanction is something that historically has been considered punishment. Monetary penalties have been regarded as civil, not criminal, penalties. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 256 (Blackman, J., concurring). One court has noted that this is so because, although the payment of a fine is \u201csurely \u2018punishment\u2019 of a sort, historically payment of money has been viewed as serving nonpunitive purposes. \u201d <em>State by Humphrey </em>v. <em>Alpine Air Products, 500 </em>N.W.2d 788, 792 (Minn. 1993), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Another <em>Kennedy </em>factor is the matter of whether the sanction comes into play only upon a finding of scienter. Scienter is not required under \u00a7 14-267a. The decision whether to require it is a question of legislative intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Salone, </em>supra, 22 Conn. Sup. 487; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>178 Conn. 145, 149, 422 A.2d 294 (1979). This factor also militates in favor of the noncriminal intent underlying \u00a7 14-267a.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Given the evident broad remedial purpose of the statute, we cannot say that it would impermissibly promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence. It can be argued that the civil penalty provision of \u00a7 14-267a, when effectively enforced, deters oveiweighting motor vehicles by either carelessness or design. Deterrence alone does not make the sanctions criminal, as even deterrence may be a proper purpose of a civil penalty. <em>United States </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>403 F. Sup. 1151, 1162 (D. Conn. 1975). More to the point, although the penalty is assessed against the owners of the overweight vehicle, its principal purpose is compensatory and remedial, as stated; albeit deterrence is involved in overall advancing of that purpose. Long ago the United States Supreme Court acknowledged the power of the state in \u201cits ordinary police power to conserve the highways in the interest of the public and to prescribe such reasonable regulations for their use as may be wise to prevent injury and damage to them.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Duby, </em>274 U.S. 135, 143, 47 S. Ct. 548, 71 L. Ed. 966 (1927). In <em>Morris, </em>Chief Justice Taft also wrote: \u201c \u2018With the increase in number and size of the vehicles used upon a highway, both the danger and the wear and tear grow. To exclude unnecessary vehicles \u2014 particularly the large ones commonly used by carriers for hire \u2014 promotes both safety and economy. State regulation of that character is valid even as applied to interstate commerce, in the absence of legislation by Congress which deals specifically with the subject.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Id., 144. Placing the well crafted sanction mechanism of \u00a7 14-267a, with its historically evolving decriminalization intent and remedial purpose in context of the <em>Kennedy </em>factors, demonstrates that it does not promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">With regard to whether the behavior to which the statute applies is already a crime, we point out that this statute with its sanction governs conduct that is not already a crime. This is the only statute that proscribes the conduct in question. Under the circumstances, this <em>Kennedy </em>factor supports the civil character of \u00a7 14-267a.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Next we go on to that factor in <em>Kennedy </em>that asks whether there is an alternative purpose to which the sanction may rationally be connected. This is a factor that must be \u201ccarefully restricted.\u201d <em>Atlas Roofing Co. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Commission, </em>518 F.2d 990, 1010 (5th Cir. 1975). <em>Atlas Roofing Co., </em>in that regard, appropriately states that \u201c[ujnless caution is exercised, it puts the judiciary <em>squarely </em>in the middle of choices as to the kinds of remedies open and those most likely to achieve the legislative aim.\u201d Id. Given the overriding purpose of \u00a7 14-267a, it is arguable that the civil penalty has an effect akin to deterrence, but, we submit, this effect is an unavoidable by-product of the legislative purpose. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>supra, 403 F. Sup. 1163. By this statute, our legislature intended to regulate reasonably the problem caused by overweight vehicles. Such regulation was its decision to make and resulted in the remedial civil penalty structure. The legislature is better able than the courts to decide and enact into law the best methods to attain its purposes. As one court said on this <em>Kennedy </em>factor, \u201c[t]he Court cannot substitute its own judgment for the informed choice of the [legislature] by interpreting this by-product to be the primary purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>statute.\u201d Id. This factor alone may minimally affect the civil character of the sanction, but certainly does not seriously do so in a balanced consideration of all the <em>Kennedy </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Finally, the court, under <em>Kennedy, </em>is to examine whether the sanction appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned. We believe that, given the basic remedial purpose of \u00a7 14-267a and its structure, the civil sanction prescribed by it does not result in the excessive fines. Earlier we have discussed the focus of its attempt to prevent the deterioration of our highways from overweight vehicles and to make highways safe for the public. This, of course, involves a compensatory component in the graduated fine structure of \u00a7 14-267a. Enforcing this statute involves the expenditure of moneys by the state including the purchase and maintenance of stationary and portable scales, the staff to operate the scales and the costs of investigation and litigation to implement the overweight vehicle statutory scheme. The remedial civil mechanism in the fine structure of \u00a7 14-267a, on balance, permissibly implements the statutory purpose. The elimination of the fixed fine of $500 by the legislature in 1953 and its replacement with a scale of graduated fines advances that legislative purpose. Persons who own or operate vehicles amenable to greater overweight potential are chargeable with the knowledge of the graduated fine structure. The graduated scale of fines is not irrational or unreasonable, keeping in mind the object to be accomplished and the importance and magnitude of the public interest sought to be protected. The fine in the present case was fixed and based on the statute and is not excessive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>We conclude that the statutory scheme was not so punitive in either purpose or effect as to negate that legislative intention. Therefore, the trial of the defendant under \u00a7 14-267a was not a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d as that term is used in the sixth amendment of the federal constitution. The defendant is, therefore, not entitled to a jury trial under the federal constitution as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Next, we examine the defendant\u2019s claims under General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b and Practice Book \u00a7 839.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He advances these as bases for his right to trial by jury claim as well as for his claims that the trial court should have apprised him of his jury trial right and his right to counsel and determined whether he made a valid waiver of those rights.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The state has several responses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>to these claims, which we discuss in two parts. First, the state maintains, as to the defendant\u2019s jury trial claim under \u00a7 14-267a, that he is not entitled to a trial by jury because that statute is not a \u201ccriminal action\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 54-82b, that the trial court did not commit plain error in not applying \u00a7 54-82b,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that the trial court\u2019s failure to apply an ambiguous statute is not plain error. Second, as to the trial court\u2019s claimed failure to advise the defendant of his right to counsel and obtaining a valid waiver of that claimed right before proceeding, the state makes two responses. One, the defendant has no sixth amendment right to counsel and, two, under the sixth amendment, advisement and waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel is not required where there is no possibility that the defendant will be imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In discussing the \u00a7 54-82b issue, as well as that under Practice Book \u00a7 839, the defendant refers to the rights of a \u201ccriminal defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have already determined in part I of this opinion that this defendant, charged with and found guilty of \u00a7 14-267a, was not a defendant in a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d and was, therefore, not a criminal defendant. In any event, the state, at great length in its brief, argues that for \u00a7 54-82b to apply, \u00a7 14-267a must be a \u201ccriminal action\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 54-82b. It maintains that for the defendant to prevail on his \u00a7 54-82b claim, the term \u201ccriminal action\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>in that statute \u201cmust be read to include violations not punishable by imprisonment and not payable to the centralized infractions bureau.\u201d In addition, the state, acknowledging that it is \u201cplain error\u201d for a court not to apply \u201ca clearly relevant statute to the case before it\u201d; <em>State </em>v. Hinckley, 198 Conn. 77, 88, 502 A.2d 388 (1985); maintains that \u00a7 54-82b was not applicable to this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">As we have already determined, \u00a7 14-267a is a civil and thus a noncriminal statute, prosecution under which was not a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, and it did not involve the charging of a \u201ccrime\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 53a-24 (a) of our penal code. Under \u00a7 53a-24 (a) a \u201ccrime comprises felonies and misdemeanors.\u201d The meaning of the term \u201cviolation\u201d is illuminated by the 1971 commission comment to \u00a7 53a-24. See footnote 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c[w]e do not mechanistically apply penal code definitions to a statute but interpret the language in a manner that implements the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>228 Conn. 758, 763, 638 A.2d 601 (1994). Moreover, we have not overlooked those cases that indicate that \u201cwhat may or may not be a criminal offense for purposes of a particular statutory categorization is not necessarily determinative of whether it is a criminal offense for [other] purposes\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kluttz, </em>9 Conn. App. 686, 699, 521 A.2d 178 (1987); in the fine only statutory context of \u00a7 14-267a as we have analyzed it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 763; <em>State </em>v. <em>Guckian, </em>226 Conn. 191, 198, 627 A.2d 407 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kluttz, </em>supra, 698-700. We, therefore, see no reason, nor has any been offered to us, why this \u201cconcept of violation,\u201d which is \u201ca new category of noncriminal offense,\u201d is to be construed as other than that in our assessing \u00a7 14-267a vis-a-vis \u00a7 54-82b. This is especially so where, as we have earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>pointed out, the demonstrated legislative history and purpose do not fairly suggest otherwise, and the mischief sought to be proscribed by \u00a7 14-267a is apparent. See <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 647, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>145 Conn. 355, 358, 143 A.2d 154 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We also believe that, given our earlier determination that \u00a7 14-267a is not a criminal statute, it cannot be the basis of a \u201ccriminal action\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 54-82b, acknowledging that \u201ccriminal action\u201d is not defined in that statute. Black defines the term \u201ccriminal action\u201d as meaning a \u201c[proceeding by which person charged with a crime is brought to trial, and either found not guilty or guilty and sentenced. ...\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Our view of the terms \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d and \u201ccriminal action\u201d is in harmony with the demonstrated legislative purpose of \u00a7 14-267a and does not impinge on any of the defendant\u2019s claimed constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Other provisions of \u00a7 54-82b (a) do not avail the defendant\u2019s claim. We draw attention to that language of \u00a7 54-82b (a) that provides: \u201cThere is no right to trial by jury in criminal actions where the maximum penalty is a fine of one hundred ninety-nine dollars <em>or </em>in any matter involving violations payable through the centralized infractions bureau where the maximum penalty is a fine of five hundred dollars or less.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Our previous conclusion that this \u00a7 14-267a action was not a \u201ccriminal action\u201d disposes of the defendant\u2019s claims. We detect nothing that suggests that \u201ccriminal action\u201d in \u00a7 54-82b (a) does not mean the same as \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d under the sixth amendment to the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">We agree with the state that to accept the defendant\u2019s claim would involve an extension of the jury trial right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>not intended by the legislature.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For us to accept his claim, we would have to read \u201ccriminal action\u201d in \u00a7 54-82b (a) to include violations not punishable by incarceration but punishable by a fine paid to the centralized infractions bureau. We find no such indication that the legislature intended the term \u201ccriminal action\u201d in \u00a7 54-82b to include \u201cviolations\u201d not punishable by incarceration but punishable by a fine paid to the centralized infractions bureau, nor does the defendant advance any such analysis. It is not our function to interpret this statute so as to constitute an expansion of the jury trial right that the legislature did not intend in \u00a7 54-82b. In conclusion, on this branch of the matter, the defendant was not entitled to a jury trial under \u00a7 54-82b and the trial court was not required to tell him of such a \u201cright\u201d in this case. He, therefore, had no sixth amendment right to counsel and the trial court was not required to advise him that he did. Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of a valid waiver as claimed by the defendant. Practice Book \u00a7 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We agree with the state that under the sixth amendment neither the claimed advisement nor the waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel is required where there is, as in this case, no possibility that the defendant will be imprisoned. Here, the state argues that even if \u00a7 14-267a were considered criminal, the sixth amendment does not require that the defendant be advised of his right to counsel or that he must expressly waive that right before proceeding pro se. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 37, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cabsent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>whether classified as petty, misdemeanor or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at his trial.\u201d Under our analysis, the trial court did not have to reach either the advisement issue or the waiver issue because operating an overweight motor vehicle under \u00a7 14-267a was not one of the criminal classifications set out in <em>Argersinger </em>and it was not a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d or a \u201ccriminal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In considering this aspect of the case, it is crucial to note the posture as well as the stage of this matter in which it comes to us. The defendant has been found guilty of the violation of \u00a714-267a and a fine has been imposed in accordance with that statute. Section 14-267a is not a \u201ccrime\u201d nor is it a nonpetty offense that would afford the entitlement of a jury trial. It is a \u201cmotor vehicle violation.\u201d The question of indigency was not raised in the trial court. We are mindful that imprisonment of a person for the nonpayment of a fine,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> solely because of his indigency, would violate his rights of due process and equal protection. See <em>Bearden </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983); <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Short, </em>401 U.S. 395, 91 S. Ct. 668, 28 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1971); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Schoonfield, </em>399 U.S. 508, 90 S. Ct. 2232, 26 L. Ed. 2d 773 (1970); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 90 S. Ct. 2018, 26 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1970). We are not, however, on this record, dealing with an indigent or a person who is imprisoned. More to the point, we are not dealing with a defendant fined pursuant to a criminal statute. In this context, a state cannot convert a fine imposed under a fine only statute into a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot immediately pay the fine in full. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mem </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>minger, </em>121 Misc. 2d 953, 954-55, 469 N.Y.S.2d 323 (1983), citing <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Short, </em>supra, 395. <em>Tate </em>made it clear that the holding in that case \u201cdoes not suggest any constitutional infirmity in imprisonment of a defendant with the means to pay a fine who refuses or neglects to do so.\u201d <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Short, </em>supra, 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In the case before us, the judgment of guilty by the trial court resulted in the imposition of the fine. A fine was the only sanction permitted to be imposed by the court under \u00a7 14-267a for its violation, and it was from that judgment that this appeal was taken. Imprisonment was not provided for under \u00a7 14-267a. What may occur in any subsequent proceeding is not the subject of this present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-267a provides in relevant part: \u201cWeight restrictions for vehicles, trailers or other objects.
