The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury, and (2) denied his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the morning of August 8, 1992, the defendant, armed with a gun and accompanied by an accomplice, robbed a branch of the Connecticut National Bank located in Fairfield. Following the robbery, the two perpetrators sped off in a small white Datsun automobile, with the defendant seated on the passenger side. Shortly thereafter, the police, after responding to a dispatch regarding the bank robbery, located the described vehicle and pursued it until it stopped in the middle of the street. The defendant, who was then in the driver\u2019s seat, was the only person in the automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After being stopped, the defendant fled on foot. The police chased and eventually apprehended the defendant. During the chase, the defendant pointed a gun at one of the police officers. After the police captured the defendant, they performed a search of the defendant\u2019s person and found a pair oflatex gloves in his pocket. A subsequent search of the vehicle disclosed a screwdriver and revealed that the steering column had been tampered with, making it apparent that it was a stolen vehicle. An envelope found in the car tested positive for the chemical used in dye packs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the robbery, one of the perpetrators had taken a packet of money containing dye. The police later determined that the car from which the defendant had fled, was a stolen vehicle valued at $ 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">At the close of evidence, and after the defendant had rested, he requested, through counsel, to be permitted to change his plea to guilty to the charge of larceny in the third degree. Over the state\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the defendant to plead guilty to the larceny of the motor vehicle. After accepting the plea, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>court gave an initial instruction to the jury as follows: \u201cDuring the course of the last recess, I have accepted a plea of guilty to the third count of the information, charging larceny of the automobile. I do that in accordance with the evidence that I have heard, and upon the request of the accused, who elected to change his plea with the advice of counsel. And, suffice it to say, at this point, that I have conducted the canvass and I am satisfied that the plea is intelligently and legally entered, and, therefore, would not be any longer your concern. It is mine. So that the only thing remaining for you are the first and second counts of this complaint. And they, the state has elected to charge this accused with a two count information, now that the third count is gone, and there will be a new [information] just indicating the two counts, and they charged robbery in the first degree, and I will explain that to you, what that offense is, when the time comes, and then the second count they have charged larceny in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">During final instructions, the court stated: \u201cLet me explain to you, as well, that the fact that he has pleaded guilty to the other charge is independent and distinctive from the first two. You wouldn\u2019t convict him of the third, because you felt he committed the first two. You wouldn\u2019t convict of the first or second, because he has pleaded guilty to the third. I told you that is what happened, to remove it from your consideration as unnecessary at this juncture. But you will consider the proof concerning that taking, and concerning the possession, and what occurred as proof in connection with the robbery in the first degree and larceny that you heard here before you. So it\u2019s not as though any part of that is barred from your consideration.\u201d At no time did the defendant object to either instruction, nor did he request a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The defendant argues that the initial instruction was improper because his guilty plea was not in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>was incriminating and was not harmless, in that it denied him the right to a fair trial. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">It is obvious from the record before us that the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the charge involving the larceny of the automobile was a defense strategy designed to obtain an acquittal of the bank robbery and larceny charges. Without admitting guilt to the stolen car charge, he could not explain being in the car, the chase, and his flight and apprehension as part of the \u201cbad day\u201d defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The crux of his counsel\u2019s final argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ment can be summed up by one statement made by defense counsel in closing argument. \u201cTalk about having a bad day, not only does he steal a car from a thief, he steals a car from a thief who just used it in a bank robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We agree that evidence of a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea may be improper to establish that the crime was committed; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 198, 187 A.2d 442 (1962); but here, the defendant\u2019s own plea to one count of a three count information, accepted after the jury had heard all the evidence, made the trial court\u2019s initial instruction proper to remove that one count from their consideration. We cannot discern that the defendant was irreparably prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s announcement of the guilty plea. The trial court expressed proper cautionary instructions. \u201cThe jury [is] presumed to follow the court\u2019s directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>175 Conn. 155, 160, 397 A.2d 89 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He claims that the plea was entered without a full understanding of the nature of the charge, that he did not understand that the charge required that he knew or believed that the car probably was stolen, and that other procedural defects in the plea litany existed. We have reviewed the record and observe that following the defense\u2019s case the defendant asked to plead guilty to theft of the automobile and explained that he had entered and driven a car, knowing it to be stolen. During the plea canvass, the defendant stated: \u201cI pleaded guilty because I know I\u2019m guilty. It was a stolen car.\u201d He presented evidence during the trial sufficient to demonstrate that he actually stole the car. He thereafter entered his plea of guilty and now complains that there is nothing in the record to indicate that he understood that the charge required that he knew or believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the car probably was stolen. We reject this claim and construe it to be made as a result of a trial strategy that did not produce a desired result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The record is also clear that the defendant was aware of his right against self-incrimination, and exercised that right to remain silent by choosing not to testify. Under the particular circumstances of this case, where the defendant has already exercised his right to a jury trial, his right to confront witnesses and his right against self-incrimination, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his plea, and that the plea was not knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\"> There is no explanation in the trial court record or in the briefs as to when or where the defendant ceased being the passenger in the vehicle and became the driver and sole occupant of the automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> During the trial, one of the bank employees testified that a dye pack is a packet of money containing a dye that explodes when removed from the bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> Counsel for the defendant argued during closing arguments: \u201cWhy did this defendant just plead guilty to possession of that car? One of two things, he either took it from Mr. Maran, who owned the vehicle, which David Sierras says is not the case, or he stole it while it was running in the middle of PT Bamum, in which case he is not entitled to either. And talk about having a bad day, let\u2019s assume for sake of argument that he did come out of the building, which evidence seems to indicate that he did, and he bought some drugs and walks out, there is a car motor running, well, you know, like I just found the mother lode. He is getting out of here, he is going to take the car. The motor is running, the ignition is punched, he knows it\u2019s stolen. He is gone. Of course, I\u2019m sure he had tire full spectrum of emotions because he thought he had made his score, and within a hundred yards he finds out there is all kinds of cops.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\u201cWhy is this important? It\u2019s important to you not because the state says ah, yes, this was the car used in the bank robbery, the most significant piece of evidence, I think, is that what [the] state objected to in your presence, which subsequently was admitted before you. What is the first thing that this defendant says when the police pull him out of the \u2014 or he walks out of the attic or fell through the ceiling, I don\u2019t know how he got out of the attic, something along these lines of \u2018All these cops for a stolen car? I was going to take [the car] on a joy ride.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">\u201cThe significance to this is that unless we are dealing with a person who is so alert to what the elements of the crime have to be, and how they are connected and so forth and so on, it would seem that his statement to the police officer is the natural statement. I think this is significant, because one learns you can steal from a thief, if you believe that story, it\u2019s a violation of law which would not be related to, in any respect, the bank robbery that occurred in Fairfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">\u201cTalk about having a bad day, not only does he steal a car from a thief, he steals a car from a thief who just used it in a bank robbery. Does that mean he was at the bank robbery? I believe that is the leap of faith and the inference being asked of you by the state, and in fact in order to \u2014 in order to \u2014 convict this defendant, that is the leap of faith you are going to have to make. That is the leap of faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-14\"> Defense counsel stated, prior to sentencing: \u201cThe impact and the interplay between the larceny three which it was concluded at least during the trial, it was a strategic move has been looked upon as something not very good strategy in view of the ultimate conclusion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b725-15\"> Having \u201clived\u201d his rights during the trial, the defendant cannot be viewed as being unaware of those rights. A plea itself, under these circumstances, acts as the waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
