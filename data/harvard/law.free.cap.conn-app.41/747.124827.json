Kundrath, appeals from the judgment in favor of the plaintiff rendered after a court trial. The plaintiff has filed a cross appeal. This action for breach of contract was commenced against Michael Kundrath and his mother, Theresa Kundrath, a resident of the plaintiff Southport Manor Convalescent Center, Inc. No judgment was rendered as to the defendant Theresa Kundrath. As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether there is an appealable final judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In determining what is a final judgment for purposes of appellate review, we rely on the standard articulated in <em>State </em>v. Curcio, 191 Conn. 27, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). <em>In re Elizabeth H., </em>40 Conn. App. 216, 218, 669 A.2d 1246 (1996). The partial judgment rendered neither terminated a separate and distinct proceeding nor so concluded the rights of the parties that further proceedings could not affect them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31. We conclude that no final judgment was rendered because a judgment against Theresa Kundrath could impact the nature and the amount of the liability of the defendant Michael Kundrath. See <em>T. P. Brewer Construction Co. </em>v. <em>F &amp; G Associates, </em>34 Conn. App. 714, 643 A.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The lack of final judgment is a threshold question that implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of this court. <em>Schick </em>v. <em>Windsor Airmotive Division/Barnes Group, </em>31 Conn. App. 819, 822, 627 A.2d 478 (1993). If there is no final judgment, we cannot reach the merits of the appeal. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-197a and 52-263; Practice Book \u00a7 4000; <em>Harrall-Michaelowski Associ</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>ates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shippee, </em>40 Conn.
