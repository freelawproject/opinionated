The state appeals the defendant\u2019s acquittal by the trial court of the persistent felony offender charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court on both the appeal and the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The defendant first claims that the state violated his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, by failing to advise him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to his presentence interview. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>He claims that any statements he made at that time were involuntary and, therefore, inadmissible at his sentencing hearing. He claims that this renders the entire sentencing phase of his trial void as a matter of law. He asks that a new sentencing hearing be held. Because this claim is first raised on appeal, the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">A constitutional claim not raised at trial may, under certain exceptional circumstances, be reviewed on appeal. Id. \u201c[A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d Id. In the present case, we focus on whether the appellant has provided an adequate record for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u201cThe defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d Id., 240. In order to determine whether the record is adequate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>review, we must consider the specific claim raised, and whether the record provided is adequate for meaningful review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The defendant claims that he was not advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), prior to the presentence interview, in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An individual is entitled to be advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to any \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d in order to protect his privilege against self-incrimination and to ensure that all confessions used against him are knowingly and voluntarily made. Id. Therefore, we must determine whether a custodial interrogation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The definition of custody is not the same for every purpose. The United States Supreme Court has stated, for example, that \u201ccustody for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>has been more narrowly circumscribed\u201d than, for instance, custody for purposes of federal habeas corpus. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 430, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 79 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1983). \u201cAlthough the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is in custody for purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>[Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977)]. <em>State v. Pittman, </em>[209 Conn. 596, 608, 553 A.2d 155 (1989)], quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983). A person is in custody only if a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Hoeplinger, </em>[206 Conn. 278, 286-87, 537 A.2d 1010 (1988)]. We must look at the totality of the circumstances of the questioning in order to determine whether a reasonable person would have construed those circumstances as placing him in a custody situation. Id., 287.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, 225 </em>Conn. 55, 76, 621 A.2d 728 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u201c[T]he <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against <em>coercive </em>police practices . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980). However, \u201cthe definition of interrogation [for purposes of Miranda] can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 301-302. Interrogation must also \u201creflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d Id., 300. \u201c \u2018[W]e must decide whether a [given curtailment of freedom of action] exerts upon a detained person pressures that sufficiently impair his free exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to require that he be warned of his constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>860 F.2d 15, 23 (2d Cir. 1988), quoting <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 437, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">It is undisputed that the defendant in this case was incarcerated at the time of the presentence interview. \u201cAlthough one who is imprisoned has in one obvious way been deprived of his freedom . . . the mere fact of imprisonment does not mean that all of a prisoner\u2019s conversations are official interrogations that must be preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Rather, [fidelity to the doctrine announced in <em>Miranda </em>requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>supra, 860 F.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u201cCustodial arrest is said to convey to the suspect a message that he has no choice but to submit to the officers\u2019 will and to confess. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[supra, 384 U.S. 456-57], . . . Moreover, custodial arrest thrusts an individual into \u2018an unfamiliar atmosphere\u2019 or \u2018an interrogation environment . . . created for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner.\u2019 Id., [457], Many of the psychological ploys discussed in <em>Miranda </em>capitalize on the suspect\u2019s unfamiliarity with the officers and the environment. . . . Finally, the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation derives in large measure from an interrogator's insinuations that the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained. Id., [468], Since [the defendant] was not physically restrained and could have left the office, any compulsion he might have felt from the possibility that terminating the meeting would have led to revocation of probation was not comparable to the pressure on a suspect who is painfully aware that he literally cannot escape a persistent custodial interrogator.\u201d <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 465 U.S. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u201c[A] number of circuits have concluded that the fact of incarceration does not of itself make a prisoner\u2019s statements involuntary. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>779 F.2d 970, 972-73 (4th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 830, 107 S. Ct. 114, 93 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1986); <em>Flittie </em>v. <em>Solem, </em>751 F.2d 967, 974 (8th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1025, 106 S. Ct. 1223, 89 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1986); <em>Cervantes </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>589 F.2d 424, 427 (9th Cir. 1978).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>supra, 860 F.2d 23. In <em>Willoughby, </em>the Second Circuit stated: \u201c[The defendant\u2019s] conversation with [the informant] was voluntary and thus did not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Though [the defendant] was indeed a prisoner, not free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to leave [the prison], there was nothing in the circumstances that suggested any measure of compulsion above and beyond that confinement.\u201d Id., 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Similarly, in <em>Flittie </em>v. <em>Solem, </em>supra, 751 F.2d 974, the Eighth Circuit held that an inmate\u2019s recorded statements to an informant during a prison visit were not involuntary. The court stated: \u201cWhile Flittie may have been constrained within the penitentiary walls, he was not forced to remain in the visitors\u2019 room with [the informant]. Thus the imprisonment did not produce a coerced statement.\u201d Id., 974 n.11. The fact that he was free to terminate the conversation \u201cat his pleasure\u201d was a factor in determining whether the statements were coerced. Id., 974-75. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>supra, 860 F.2d 24, the court stated: \u201cThough [the defendant] was not free to leave [the prison], he was free to cut off a conversation with a visitor . . . .\u201d Therefore, despite the fact that the statements were secretly recorded, the statements did not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In the present case, the only information in the record as to whether the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>at the time of the presentence interview is that the defendant was incarcerated. The record is totally silent as to the circumstances under which the presentence interview was conducted. We can not determine from the record before us whether <em>any </em>questioning occurred, let alone any questioning likely to \u201celicit an incriminating response\u201d or to make the defendant feel coerced, and therefore constituting an interrogation. For all this court can tell from the record, the defendant may not have been asked a single question at the presentence interview and may have been informed that he could leave at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">We conclude that the fact of incarceration alone is not sufficient to establish that a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d occurred. The defendant has failed to provide an ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>quate record for this court to determine the issue sought to be raised under <em>Golding, </em>and has therefore failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Golding. </em>The defendant is not entitled to review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court should not have admitted the testimony of Officer Gerald Antunes of the New Haven police department. The defendant claims that the testimony was inadmissible because it did not quality either as a prior consistent statement or as a business record, and did not satisfy the best evidence rule. We need not consider those issues, however, because we conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the admission of the testimony at issue was harmful to him. He, therefore, cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). The question is whether the claimed erroneous action of the trial court is likely to have affected the result of the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>199 Conn. 14, 25, 505 A.2d 690 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>196 Conn. 115, 119, 491 A.2d 1067 (1985). <em>State v. Torrice, </em>20 Conn. App. 75, 91, 564 A.2d 330, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 809, 568 A.2d 794 (1989). . . . [0]ur inquiry focuses on the impact of the improperly introduced evidence on the jurors\u2019 perceptions and understanding of the other evidence presented in the case, rather than an analysis of the sufficiency of the remaining evidence to uphold the conviction in the absence of the admission of the [allegedly improperly admitted] evidence .... See <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>215 Conn. 148, 152-53, 575 A.2d 206 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>v. <em>Merritt, </em>36 Conn. App. 76, 92, 647 A.2d 1021 (1994), appeal dismissed, 233 Conn. 302, 659 A.2d 706 (1995) (certification improvidently granted). Erroneously admitted evidence is not grounds for reversal if the court \u201ccannot conclude . . . that the jury\u2019s perceptions of the other evidence presented in this case . . . were so affected by the improperly admitted testimony . . . that it is likely that the result of the trial would have been different in the absence of [that evidence].\u201d Id., 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The defendant claims that the admission of Antunes\u2019 testimony \u201charmed the defendant both by the admission of facts that were not established by any other evidence, and by adding credibility to [the victim\u2019s] testimony.\u201d He also claims that the admission of the statements regarding a search for the perpetrator was harmful because the court \u201cspecifically found that these facts were relevant to the issues of flight and consciousness of guilt, which the state discussed in its closing argument, and on which the court instructed the jury at the close of evidence.\u201d The defendant claims that this testimony was the only evidence of consciousness of guilt presented. We find that even if the admission of this testimony was erroneous, we cannot say that it is likely to have affected the result of the trial or that it was probably harmful to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The following facts are relevant to this issue. At trial, Antunes testified to his duty as keeper of the records for the police department and to the type of record that is made when a complaint is received. He also testified that a complaint was received from the alleged victim in this matter at 12:24 a.m. on the evening of the alleged robbery. On the basis of the police dispatch cards, Antunes testified as to the complaint received from the victim and the response of the police department to the complaint. He also testified that the complainant reported a robbery at Wintergreen and Famham Ave<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>nues at approximately 12:24 a.m. on the date in question. He further testified that three officers were dispatched to the area approximately one-half hour later. Antunes also testified that the officers reported at approximately 4:07 a.m. that they were \u201cgoing to this particular search\u201d for the alleged perpetrator, who was not named, in the area of Rockville Circle. Antunes testified that the search lasted until approximately 4:23 a.m., and that it was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The defendant claims that Antunes\u2019 testimony \u201cbolstered\u201d the victim\u2019s testimony that he reported a robbery on the date in question. It is obvious, however, even without the testimony that the victim reported that a robbery had occurred because, had no report been made, there would be no case before this court. Therefore, even if the testimony was erroneously admitted, we cannot say that Antunes\u2019 testimony that the victim reported a robbery on the date in question \u201cprobably impacted the jurors\u2019 perceptions and understanding of the other evidence presented by the state\u201d or that it was \u201cprobably harmful\u201d to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The defendant next claims that if Antunes\u2019 testimony had not been admitted, the only admitted evidence directly linking the defendant to the crimes charged would have been the victim\u2019s testimony. Antunes, however, did not identify the defendant as the perpetrator in his testimony. His testimony, therefore did not directly link the defendant to the crimes charged, and the victim\u2019s testimony remains the only testimony directly linking the defendant to the crimes. Therefore, we cannot say that Antunes\u2019 testimony \u201cprobably impacted the jurors\u2019 perceptions and understanding of the other evidence presented by the state\u201d relating to whether the defendant was the perpetrator, or that it was \u201cprobably harmful\u201d to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The defendant also claims that Antunes\u2019 testimony was the sole source of information that police searched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>for the defendant at Rock View Circle and failed to find him. Antunes did not testify, however, that the police searched for <em>the defendant </em>on the morning of November 4, 1991. He testified only that the police conducted a search of the area in question some time after the alleged incident, and that the search was not successful. The defendant was not identified as the object of the search. We cannot say that Antunes\u2019 testimony in this regard \u201cprobably impacted the jurors\u2019 perceptions and understanding of the other evidence presented by the state\u201d or that it was \u201cprobably harmful\u201d to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The defendant further claims that the testimony relating to an unsuccessful search was harmful to the defendant because the court specifically found the facts relating to an unsuccessful search relevant to issues of flight and consciousness of guilt, which the state discussed in its closing argument and on which the court instructed the jury at the close of evidence. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, however, the testimony of Antunes regarding the unsuccessful search was not the only evidence of the defendant\u2019s flight and consciousness of guilt. The victim testified that after the robbery on the date in question, \u201c[The defendant] vanished. He was gone .... Yes, he ran. He vanished.\u201d When subsequently asked whether he ever saw the defendant again after the date in question, the victim testified: \u201cI saw him a couple times, but he was ducking. He knows my car. He knows the car anyway. He was ducking. I saw him in West Haven and I saw him in New Haven a couple times.\u201d In light of this testimony regarding flight and consciousness of guilt, Antunes\u2019 is not the sole testimony regarding these issues. Further, the search did not occur until some time after the alleged robbery. Therefore, the fact that no perpetrator was found at that time does not appear to be critical to the issues of flight and consciousness of guilt. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>cannot say that Antunes\u2019 testimony in this regard \u201cprobably impacted the jurors\u2019 perceptions and understanding of the other evidence presented by the state\u201d or that it \u201cprobably harmed\u201d the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The defendant also argues that the record reflects that the jury actually considered Antunes\u2019 testimony in reaching its verdict. In his brief, the defendant claims that \u201c[d]uring its deliberations, the jury specifically asked to see the police report filed by J. Douglas. The court responded to the jury that \u2018[tjhere was a reference to a report by Lieutenant Antunes, but that was not introduced as a full exhibit.\u2019 This exchange between the jury and the court indicates that the officer\u2019s testimony likely played a key role in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request made it clear to the jury that the police report was not an exhibit, and the police report was not provided to the jury. Thus, the jury was correctly advised as to the proper status of the police report, and the record provides no indication that the jury subsequently improperly considered either the report in question or any testimony relating to it. Further, the only information provided by Antunes\u2019 testimony was that previously discussed, with respect to which we cannot say that the testimony \u201cprobably impacted the jurors\u2019 perceptions and understanding of the other evidence presented by the state\u201d or that it \u201cprobably harmed\u201d the defendant. We cannot say that in the absence of any of the challenged evidence, it is likely that the result of the trial would have been different. Therefore, the defendant cannot prevail on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">In its cross appeal, the state raises the issue of whether the persistent felony offender provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u00a7 53a-40 (d) requires that commission of the second offense occur after conviction and sentencing on the first offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The defendant was convicted of attempted kidnapping in the second degree and sexual assault in the first degree. As the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision: \u201cEach charge emanated from a separate incident committed against different victims on different dates and was the subject of a separate information. However, the defendant pleaded guilty to the two charges at the same time. Subsequently . . . the defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of six years for each of these offenses at the same disposition proceeding.\u201d On the basis of those convictions, the defendant was charged with being a persistent felony offender. The trial court found the defendant not guilty of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (d) provides: \u201cA persistent felony offender is a person who (1) stands convicted of a felony other than a class D felony, and (2) has been, <em>at separate times </em>prior to the commission of the present felony, <em>twice convicted </em>of a felony other than a class D felony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the persistent felony offender statute, on its face, requires that the defendant have been convicted of the predicate offenses <em>at separate times. </em>The state argues that \u201cit appears the [Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes] in adopting the \u2018at separate times\u2019 language, merely intended to follow the New York and Model Penal Code requirement that the first and second offense stem from separate transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u201cAs is true in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Verdon </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366, 446 A.2d 3 (1982). \u201c[W]ell defined principles of statutory interpretation . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>require us to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ...

I agree with parts I and II of the majority decision. I disagree, however, with part III, in which the majority holds that the persistent felony offender provision of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (d) requires that the convictions of prior felonies must have occurred at separate times from each other even when the convictions arose out of entirely distinct incidents that occurred at separate times.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">It is important to emphasize what is involved in this case. As the trial court indicated: \u201cEach [prior conviction] emanated from a separate incident committed against different victims on different dates and was the subject of a separate information.\u201d By virtue of the fortuities of the scheduling process, the defendant pleaded guilty to the two crimes on the same day and received concurrent sentences. My analysis of \u00a7 53a-40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(d) leads me to conclude that persistent felony offender status arises when the first two felonies were committed at separate times, that is, arose out of separate incidents. This position is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the statutoiy language, and is supported by the reasoning of our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>168 Conn. 395, 408-409, 363 A.2d 33, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 855, 96 S.

That axiom applies in full force, however, only \u201c[w]here . . . the language of a statute is . . . <em>absolutely </em>clear\u201d on its face and where no ambiguity is raised in applying the statute in a particular case. . . . <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 554, 400 A.2d 712 (1978) ....\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 225, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">I disagree with the majority \u2014 but agree with the trial court \u2014 that the language of \u00a7 53a-40 (d) is ambiguous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>I note initially that the language of the statute can be read in a variety of ways. A literal reading appears to require the conviction of two felonies (\u201ctwice convicted\u201d) at more than one time (\u201cat separate times\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Could the legislature have intended a minimum of four prior convictions before persistent felony status attached? Aside from that literal reading, it is unclear whether the language \u201cat separate times\u201d creates a time differential between the two prior convictions or merely a time differential between the present conviction and both prior convictions. Common sense and logic suggest that the legislature would have anticipated that, under normal circumstances, prior convictions involving separate incidents would occur on separate dates. On the basis of that premise, the legislature logically adopted the present language to cover such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Moreover, this is a situation in which \u201capplication of the statute . . . reveals a latent ambiguity in seemingly unambiguous language\u201d; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 227; because it creates \u201cunworkable results.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 744, 613 A.2d 804 (1992). Our Supreme Court stated that \u201ceven if a statute is considered clear on its face if a literal interpretation of that statute would lead to unworkable results, resort to other aids to determine legislative intent is appropriate.\u201d Id., 744. The result reached by the majority in the present case is clearly unworkable. Persistent felony offender status would hinge on the fortuities and uncertainties of the criminal plea and sentencing process \u2014 not to mention being subject to potential manipulations by participants in the process. A defendant who was convicted on different days of two offenses that arose out of a single incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>could be charged as a persistent felony offender. On the other hand, a defendant in the present situation could not be so charged. I cannot believe that the legislature contemplated such an unpredictable and absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The majority cites a Maryland Court of Appeals decision, <em>Lett </em>v. <em>State, </em>51 Md. App. 668, 677-80, 445 A.2d 1050 (1982), in support of its conclusion that \u00a7 53a-40 (d) is unambiguous and has a plain meaning. That case is distinguishable, however, because the Maryland court applied a different standard of statutory construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That court was bound by an earlier Maryland decision in which it was held that, even though the persistent felony offender statute before it was \u201c \u2018neither sensible nor reasonable and manifestly leads to an absurdity,\u2019 \u201d the court was \u201c \u2018not at liberty to depart from\u2019 \u201d a strict construction of the statute. Id., 678. Under the strict rules of statutory construction in Maryland, therefore, it could not render a common sense interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Fortunately, we are not so constrained. The law of our state permits us to look further in order to ascertain the legislative meaning where unartful statutory language creates an inherent ambiguity. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 744; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 227. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Preuss, </em>436 Mich. 714, 461 N.W.2d 703 (1990), the Supreme Court of Michigan was also not so constrained. In interpreting Michigan\u2019s fourth time habitual offender statute, Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 769.12, the court \u201crecogniz[ed] the well-established principle that a literal reading of a statute may be modified if that reading leads to a clear or manifest contradiction of the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>purpose of the act, or if necessary to correct an absurd and unjust result . . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Preuss, </em>supra, 721. After examining the statute\u2019s legislative history, purpose and cases from other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court concluded: \u201cThe statute requires only that the fourth offense be preceded by three convictions of felony offenses, and that each of those three predicate felonies arise from separate criminal incidents.\u201d Id., 717.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">I now undertake a similar examination of \u00a7 53a-40 (d). Unfortunately, the legislative history provides minimal illumination. Whereas the trial court found support in the legislative history to formulate a theory that the statute has a rehabilitative purpose, I conclude that the legislative history suggests a <em>punitive </em>purpose for the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the legislative history is essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>inconclusive, however, we must turn to other methods of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In ascertaining the legislative puipose, my analysis differs from that of the majority and the trial court concerning the puipose of the statute and the degree of strictness with which the statute should be read. First, our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>supra, 168 Conn. 395, while not directly on point, is analogous to the present situation. In that case, which involved a prior statute, General Statutes (Rev. to 1969) \u00a7 54-121, our Supreme Court rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that because he was given concurrent sentences on two convictions, one in 1966 and one in 1968, he could not be found to have been twice sentenced. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>supra, 408-409. The court held that they clearly were \u201cseparate judgments\u201d and \u201cseparate terms of imprisonment\u201d because, even if one could be modified, the defendant still would have to serve the entirety of the other. Id., 407-408. That reasoning, whereby the court rejected the idea that third offenders must have two separate chances to reform, is highly persuasive here. Id., 407-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Second, both the majority and the trial court rely on the rule of lenity in order to bolster their interpretations. The rule of lenity seems oddly out of place in this situation, however, in view of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 506, in which the court made it clear that General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-40 (a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is designed to provide increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>punishment. The court stated that \u201cit is clear that the purpose of this statute is to provide increased punishment for those who have committed dangerous felonies and have been deemed dangerous to society, regardless of the date of conviction and imprisonment.\u201d Id., 523. The court, therefore, rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that because \u00a7 53a-40 is a penal statute, any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity, preferring instead to apply the \u201cpresumption that the legislature intends to accomplish a reasonable and rational result rather than a \u2018 \u201cdifficult and possibly bizarre\u201d \u2019 one.\u201d Id., 524, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 558, 522 A.2d 753 (1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><em>Clemons </em>and <em>Dolphin </em>lead me to conclude that neither the rule of lenity nor any claimed rehabilitative purpose can serve as an appropriate basis for an interpretation of \u00a7 53a-40 (d). Without support for the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>court\u2019s theory that rehabilitation is the primary purpose of this statute, there is no basis whatever on which to conclude that the first two convictions must be rendered on separate occasions. It would be anomalous to have one person found guilty of being a persistent felony offender because he committed two felonies in separate incidents and was convicted on separate occasions, while another person, who also committed two felonies in separate incidents, not be considered a persistent felony offender because, by mere happenstance, he was convicted of both felonies on one occasion. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The only sensible way of reading the statute is to interpret it as requiring that the first two convictions arise out of separate criminal incidents, as they did here. That interpretation fulfills the punitive purpose that appears in the legislative history and that was underscored by our Supreme Court in <em>Dolphin. </em>\u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Guckian, </em>226 Conn. 191, 201, 627 A.2d 407 (1993), quoting <em>Warkentin </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>223 Conn. 14, 20, 610 A.2d 1287 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of acquittal on the persistent felony count and remand for a new trial on that count alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">For all the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\"> The trial court stated that \u201cmost jurisdictions that have determined the issue of chronology of convictions have resorted to statutory construction, the legislative history of the statute and the case law of other jurisdictions with other similar provisions. . . .
