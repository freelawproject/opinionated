The case has been tried, and the jury, upon the direction of the court, has found a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $380.92. The defendant appeals from the judgment and from an order denying his motion for a new trial on the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>The defendant admits the making and delivery of the contract, and the fact that he had received the shipments \u00a1mentioned in the complaint, but denies that he is unwilling to complete the contract on his' part, and that the plaintiff has performed the conditions on its part. The defendant then sets up a separate defense, to the effect that the plaintiff had made certain representations as to! the quality of. the flour to be delivered, and that the flour actually delivered under the several shipping orders had failed to come up to the representations, and that the defendant had become convinced that the j remainder of the flour would be of the same quality, and that he had, thereupon, refused to complete the contract. The defendant also sets up an alleged counterclaim, based on the alleged failure of the plaintiff to furnish flour of the required quality, making it incumbent upon the defendant to purchase 220 barrels of flour of other dealers, at an advanced price.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The learned trial court, on motion, dismissed the counterclaim, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and a like disposition was made of the so-called defense, and we are- persuaded that in this the court performed its duty. The alleged representations of the plaintiff\u2019s agent inj selling the flour could not be construed as warranties; they amountecj only to the expression of an opinion that the flour \u201cwould be \u00e1s good 'as any made,\u201d and that the flour which defendant had been using would not \u201cbe in it\u201d with the flour which he would receive under his arider, the mere verbiage of a salesman, not intended to be considered seriously as a guaranty of quality, for it afforded no reasonable standard of comparison. The case at bar seems to be within the rule asserted in Cahen v. Platt, 69 N. Y. 348, 25 Am. Rep. 203, and we find no reason for disturbing the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The judgment and order appealed from shpuld be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
