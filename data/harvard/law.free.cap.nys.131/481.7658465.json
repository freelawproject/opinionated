Brennan parted with no money, for defendant. refused to accept a $5 bill tendered in payihent. There is no claim that false weights were used, and the conviction must rest, if at all, on the contention that. defendant had injured or defrauded Brennan in some way, by delivering less than the quantity of the article as, represented. As Brennan gave no money or other consideration of any kind to plaintiff, never retained' possession of the turkey, and the sale never was actually, consummated, he never was injured or defrauded in any way. The evidence discloses no more, at most,. than an attempt to commit the crime charged, and falls far short of justifying the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The judgment of conviction must be reversed, and the defendant discharged. All, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
