The father of the infant appeals from so much of the order as permits the grandparents to visit the child and directs her to be taken to their residence for a period of at least six days in each and every month, and the grandparents appeal from so much of the order as awards the custody to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">On the return of the writ, the learned justice sitting at Special Term disposed of the matter solely upon affidavits presented by the respec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tive parties. These affidavits are so conflicting that it is utterh' impossible to determine whether the father is a proper person to have the custody of the infant, or whether it will be for her interest 1:o be placed in the custody of the grandparents. In view of the conflict in the affidavits, I think the proper disposition to make of this appeal is to reverse the order appealed from, without costs to either party, and send the matter to a referee, to take proof and report the same, together with his opinion thereon, to the Special Term of this court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
