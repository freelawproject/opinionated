It is manifest that the facts_ and circumstances attending such an accident, and upon which the liability or freedom from liability on the part of the defendants depend, can be better inquired into at or near the vicinity of the accident than at a place remote therefrom. Moreover, the action being against a municipal corporation, it is evident that it would not be consistent with the public interests to require its officers and employ\u00e9s to abandon their duties and attend a trial.in New York county.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to each appellant, and motion granted, with $10 costs to appellant railway company. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
