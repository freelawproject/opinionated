The notice of appeal specifies that the appeal is taken from the order, in so far as it denies the motion for a bill of particulars giving the particular dates, day, month, and year, when it is claimed a demand for the return of the chattels was made, and, if the demand was in writing, a copy thereof, and also an itemized statement of the damages claimed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-22\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is alleged in the amended complaint that after the delivery of the chattels, and prior to the commencement of the action, the plaintiff duly demanded of the defendant the return thereof \u201con re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>peated occasions between the 10th day of May, 1909, and the 10th day of September, 1910, and specifically on or about May 10, May 20, May 24, May 25, and the early part of June, 1910, and also on or about September 1, 1910.\u201d We are of opinion that the defendant is not entitled to have the date of the demand more definitely specified in a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff only seeks to recover the value of the chattels, and not damages for the retention thereof, and therefore the defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars of the items of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The defendant is a corporation, and it puts in issue the allegations of the complaint with respect to the demand, and claims to be without knowledge concerning the same. In these circumstances, we are of opini\u00f3n that the defendant was entitled to have the bill of particulars show whether or not the demand for a return of the chattels was in writing, and, if so, to have a copy thereof set forth in the bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The order should therefore be modified, by insertir\u00edg a provision requiring the plaintiff to state in his bill of particulars whether or not the demand was in writing, and, if so, to set forth a copy thereof, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
