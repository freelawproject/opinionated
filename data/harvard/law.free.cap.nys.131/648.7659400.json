The trial then proceeded, and at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case a motion was made to dismiss the complaint, which was denied, and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\">Defendants\u2019 counsel then introduced testimony on behalf of the defendants as executors, and at the conclusion of the case renewed his motion to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that no cause of action had been made out against the defendants as executors. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked leave to withdraw the election made at the opening of the case, and to be allowed to proceed against the defendants individually, which application was granted against defendants\u2019 objection and exception; the defendants claiming surprise, and that by plaintiff\u2019s election at the beginning of the trial defendants had lost the right to move to amend the answer, so as to set up certain additional defenses to an action against the defendants individually. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Permitting plaintiff to withdraw her election and to revive the action against the defendants individually, after the conclusion of tile trial against the defendants as executors, was an irregularity, prejudicial to the defendants, and constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The judgment should be reversed,, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.
