The respondent urges that this order should be affirmed, upon the ground that the plaintiffs do not seek this examination in good faith, and that the real purpose is to obtain a cross-examination of the defendant before trial, respecting his affirmative defense and counterclaim, in which it is alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-17\">\u201cThat the pretended statement of account * * * referred to in the-complaint is fictitious, false, and fraudulent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">Defendant\u2019s fear is not well founded. The order for the examination provides for the taking of defendant\u2019s testimony as a witness ini behalf of the plaintiffs concerning the matters set forth in the annexed affidavit. The affidavit is confined to the affirmative matters, necessary to sustain the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action. In no event under this order could the examination be extended, so as to compel the cross-examination of the defendant regarding his affirmative defense and counterclaim. The order for the examination is in conformity with the provisions of the Code and numerous decisions made by this, court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and' - disbursements, and the order for the examination reinstated, the date of said examination to be fixed upon the settlement of the order to be entered hereon. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
