This table, known as a \u201cconveyer,\u201d was 105 feet long, a trifle over 4 feet in width, and 34 inches in height. At intervals of about 4 feet there were rollers 18 inches in length, and extending crosswise \u00f3f the table, and operated by cogwheels; some of the witnesses testifying that these were fully protected, while the plaintiff and his witnesses testify that they were exposed at the ends. This table extended away .from the mill out into the yard, and the duty of the plaintiff was to go to a build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ing about 75 or 80 feet from where he was injured, get his cleats, and go to the \u201cbuggy,\u201d at a distance of about 30 feet from the place where he was injured, and nail them upon the ends of the boards mounted upon this \u201cbuggy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> His place of employment was the lumber yard of the defendant, and his duties had no relation whatever to the machine (the table with rollers) which concededly worked the injuries, and the learned trial court properly held that the plaintiff had no standing under the provisions of th.e labor law, except as the leaving of the cogwheels unguarded might have a bearing upon the question of the reasonable safety of the place afforded him for his work. The theory upon which the case was tried, and upon which it was given to the jury, was that at the particular point of the accident there was a mixture of oil and sawdust, causing a slippery condition of the floor, which had not been observed by the plaintiff during his 9 or 10 days employment there, though being familiar to some of the other witnesses, and that the plaintiff, having been instructed by his foreman to place the cleats under this table and to take them from thence to the point where they were to be used, had, in obeying this instruction, stepped upon this slippery place and slipped, throwing him into the unguarded cogwheel, producing the injuries. The learned trial court in its charge to the jury said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cA very important question here * * * relates to the directions which the plaintiff says were given by Mr. Augustine, the foreman, to the young man to carry the cleats from the place where they were found, and put them under the table, and then take them from there to the place where they were to be nailed onto the boards. He says those were the instructions which were given to him. On the other hand, Mr. Augustine says that he gave him no such instructions; that he was told to take them directly over to where the buggies were. * * * That is an important question in the case, for this reason: If such direction was not given, if you shall take the story of Mr. Augustine in preference to the story of the plaintiff, * * * and you shall say no such direction was given to put those cleats under the runway, and that the placing of them there was the voluntary act of the plaintiff himself, that defeats his cause of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Again the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u201cSo you see, gentlemen, it is quite important to give consideration to every question in this case, not only the question of direction, but the question of conditions which were there, the question of the direction of the work given by the foreman, and the claim that a part of the direction in connection with the work was the putting of the cleats under the table at this particular place, where, as the plaintiff says, he was exposed unwarrantably, and in violation of the master\u2019s duty, to accident and injury, even while he was exercising due care on his part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is true that this charge was not excepted to on the part of either party, but the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of his motion to dismiss the complaint fairly raises the issue, as well as the order denying the motion for a new trial on the usual grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">[\u20183] The respondent, evidently recognizing the weakness of the case upon the theory thus presented, urges upon this appeal that the proximate cause of the accident was, not the alleged direction of the defendant\u2019s foreman, but the slippery condition of the floor at the point of the accident; but it is very certain that, if the plaintiff had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>nearer to the table than was necessary in merely performing the services for which he was employed in the natural why, the slippery floor would have been of no moment in the case. Thje accident could not have happened. The undisputed evidence of both parties is that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to go anywhere near to this table, either in getting the cleats supplied by the defendant, or in nailing them to the boards upon the buggies. Indeed, the evidence is, on behalf of both parties, that the plaintiff, in following out the alleged instructions of his foreman, would require much more time than in merely going to and from the building where the \u00a1cleats were kept and the buggies, and the only possible relation of thej slippery floor to the accident which befell the plaintiff was due to the fact that the plaintiff had placed, or was placing, these cleats under the table. In other words, the crucial fact in the case, upon the theory on which it was given to the jury, was whether the foreman hadj given an order that the cleats should be placed under-this table. Unless such an order had been given, there was no possible reason for the plaintiff to be where he was at the time of tire accident. He \u00a1could not have been there in the discharge of his work, and the master owed him no duty to see that the floor at this point was in a safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It being clear, then, that the verdict must rest upon the alleged order of the foreman, let us consider for \u00e1 moment the duties of the defendant, under the common law, for ncj question of the employer\u2019s liability law is here involved. What ajre the duties of the master? He is bound to furnish a reasonably safe place in which his servant is to perform his work, he is bound to furnish him with reasonably safe tools and appliances, and he is bojund to exercise reasonable care in the selection and employment of tjhose who are to participate in the work. No one has suggested that the defendant had failed in the discharge of its duty in the selection of fellow servants of the plaintiff. No one questions the competency of Mr. Augustine as foreman of the establishment. There is evidjence undisputed that the defendant had supplied the plaintiff with the cleats and the nails and hammers necessary to perform his work, which was of the simplest character, requiring practically no instructions. The place provided by the defendant for the plaintiff to work \\Vas the millyard, and the performance of this work, in so far as the nlaster was concerned, required merely that the plaintiff should go to the warehouse and get his cleats, return with them to the buggies, and nail them on; and this did not, as we read the record, require him |to go nearer than- 30 feet to the point where the accident occurred.| Clearly the master could delegate to a competent foreman the details of the work which was being carried on in that lumber yard. Having provided a competent foreman, proper tools and appliances, and a place which was safe for the performance of the duties required of him, the master was not bound to anticipate that the foreman would issue an order inconsistent with the efficiency and economy of the work, and which would expose the plaintiff to the danger which \u00a1 he has encountered. The duty of the master was complete when he \u00a1had used reasonable care in the selection of fellow servants. He was not bound to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>up such servant and see to it that he did not issue unreasonable orders. That was one of the risks which the contract of employment implies, and the risk cannot be shifted to the employer without an act of the Legislature, and no such act is here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The rule is well settled, in common-law actions, that the master is not responsible for the negligent performance of some detail of the workpntrusted to the servant, whatever may have been the grade of the servant who executes such detail. If it is the work of the servant, and he volunteers to perform it, and the master is not at fault in furnishing proper materials, there is no breach of duty on the part of the latter. Kimmer v. Weber, 151 N. Y. 417, 422, 423, 45 N. E. 860, 56 Am. St. Rep. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">In the case now before us, the general place for the plaintiff to perform his work was the millyard, and his duties required him to go to a warehouse, procure his materials, and nail the cleats upon boards upon the buggies; and all of these,d\u00faties could be discharged in the most economical way, without the plaintiff being anywhere near the machine which injured him. This machine or table was 105 feet long, and the rollers, requiring oil, were a little over 4 feet apart, and there is no evidence that there was any other place along the whole length of this table where there was any oil, or any danger to be apprehended, and there is no evidence that the defendant\u2019s foreman designated this particular spot for piling these cleats, assuming him to have given an order in the premises. The plaintiff admits that he was free to place his cleats at any point under this table of 105 feet in length, and to say that a master, having fulfilled all of his obligations in reference to employes and their tools and appliances, is bound to see to it, not only that the foreman does not give foolish orders, but that the servant, in obeying these orders, does not himself make a poor selection of a place within \u00e1 range of 105 feet, where no other defect is suggested, is entirely unreasonable, and therefore not the law of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
