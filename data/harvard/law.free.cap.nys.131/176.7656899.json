The relief sought is an accounting and the payment of any sum which may be found due. The complaint also contains specific allegations to the effect that on August 31, 1905, there was in said defendant\u2019s hands the sum of $684.81, which he neglected to turn over to his successor in office or to account for, and that on various specified occasions between August 7, 1905, and January 22, 1906, he improperly disbursed the funds of said corporation. The amounts which it is claimed he thus disbursed are also specified. After service of the summons and complaint, and before issue joined, the county judge of Queens county, at the instance of said defendant, granted an order requiring plaintiff to appear and be examined before trial. Upon the return of this order before a justice of this court sitting at Special Term an application was made to vacate the same upon the ground that it was improperly granted. From an order denying such application, and from the order requiring plaintiff to be examined, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">A motion to examine a party to an action before issue joined, for the purpose of framing a pleading, will be denied when the moving papers show that the party seeking the examination already has sufficient knowledge to enable him to plead.

Moses Sons &amp; Co., 120 App. Div. 144, 104 N. Y. Supp. 796.
