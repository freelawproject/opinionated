That question only, on the subject of liability, was submitted, and met with defendant\u2019s exception. There was no such issue, for the complaint and bill of particulars limited the alleged negligence to failure to furnish a safe place to work, and that single issue the court eliminated in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">Further discussion of questions suggested on the appeal is not at this time necessary.

All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
