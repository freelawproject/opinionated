This court has repeatedly held that in an action for an accounting the only examination to which the plaintiff is entitled before trial is as to such facts as are material and necessary to be proved to entitle him to an interlocutory judgment. He may not have an accounting until he has first established that he is entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
