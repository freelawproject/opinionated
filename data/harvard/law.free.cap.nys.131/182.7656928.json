If the master was not negligent for failing to provide a safe place to work, the superintendent was under no obligation to inspect and see whether it was safe. The degree of care required of a superintendent is no higher than that required of the master. It possibly may be that this case does not fall within the doctrine of Citrone v. O\u2019Rourke Contracting Co., 188 N. Y. 339, 80 N. E. 1092, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 340; hut plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to avoid a possible exception, conceded that it did. AVhen he conceded that, he conceded away his ease, and plaintiff should have been nonsuited. It is impossible to tell under what rule the jury acted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
