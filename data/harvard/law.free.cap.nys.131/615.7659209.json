The defense was that through the failure of the lessor \u201cto deliver complete possession by December 1st, as above provided,\u201d the plant and machinery could not be installed until a date in January. The heat and elevator service were not furnished for the purpose of the installation, and the only question is whether the lease required it. It should be assumed that these facilities were necessary for installation, as the court excluded all evidence in that regard. The lease was of the fourth and fifth floors for man-ufacturing purposes, and the machinery was to be installed in the fifth loft, and it may be that the elevators were necessary to raise them to their location, and it may not be beyond reasonable inference that in December some degree of warmth would be demanded by workmen. In any case the defendants would show that elevator and heat were needed. Hence the inquiry is whether, if it be assumed that heat and elevator were needed for installation, the least stipulated to provide the same for the purposes of installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The respondent regards \u2018subdivision 20 as a mere license; but it seems rather to be one of the inducements to the defendants to make the lease, and an essential part of ih Hence whatever of the -facilities covered by the lease would be reasonably necessary in contemplation of the parties to install the plant the lessor should have had ready by December 1st. But the trial court precluded all inquiry tending to show what unfurnished was needed, <em>and </em>this court is disabled thereby from due consideration, unless it shall decide that the lease by subdivision 20 covenanted for the readiness of the building <em>\\\u00bf </em>without the facilities for its use for the installation. But by what means should the machinery be raised to the fifth floor? The re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>spondent suggests the stairs; but nothing shows their adequacy, and use of them for lifting to place heavy machinery is not customary. It would be well to have the action retried, and facts admitted to the record that present the defendants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Hence the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
