This feature of the case distinguishes it from Gorsch v. Niagara Fire Insurance Company, 68 Misc. Rep. 344, 123 N. Y. Supp. 877. The jury having found upon sufficient evidence that the defendant had knowledge of this circumstance, it follows that in delivering the policy to the plaintiff the defendant waived the condition and estopped itself from setting up a defense based upon it. Forward v. Continental Insurance Company, 142 N. Y. 382, 37 N. E. 615, 25 L. R. A. 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-18\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
