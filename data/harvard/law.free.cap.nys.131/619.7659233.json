A further defense, not relied upon at the trial, was that the defendant\u2019s husband procured an extension of his time to pay each installment of $200, by agreeing to defer the payment of all installments after February 25, 1911, for one month, without plaintiff\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The pleadings admitted, by nondenial, the due issue of the body execution, the arrest thereunder, and the discharge of the defendant\u2019s husband by reason of the extension of his'time to pay the judgment by and with the consent of the plaintiff. There was no proof or allegation that the execution was ever vacated or set aside. The nonpayment of the installments sued for was admitted, and the payment of $2,700 thereunder was proved. At the close of the trial, defendant admitted that there was only a question of law. The court ruled that the admissions in the pleadings precluded any consideration of what Mr. Sully\u2019s personal privileges might have been if he had not waived them, and directed a verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The admission, by nondenial, of the due issue of the body execution, and of the arrest thereunder, was not qualified by the allegation of new matter of the alleged unlawfulness of such arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Assuming that it was the personal privilege of the defendant\u2019s husband to have had the order of arrest vacated, and to have then forthwith returned to Washington, he and she, on the contrary, preferred that he should be enabled to do business here free from arrest or execution under and pursuant to the joint extension agreement to pay the judgment of $17,380.16 in installments of $500 down and $200 a month thereafter. Such an extension was a waiver of any personal privilege of defendant\u2019s husband to avoid the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Moreover, he cannot transfer his personal privilege to his wife, nor can she act as his champion, while he retains all the benefits of the extension agreement.
