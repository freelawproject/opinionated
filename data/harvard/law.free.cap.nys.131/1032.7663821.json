A photograph of the awning is in the record, and it appears to have been the sort of awning to be seen in the city of New York in front of theaters, shops, hotels, churches, and frequently in front of private residences. The complaint was framed on the th\u00e9ory both of nuisance and negligence; but, during the trial, the plaintiff elected to try the case on the theory of nuisance, and the case wjas submitted to the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff in case they found that the accident happened as testified to by her, that the awning over \"the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>walk was in fact a nuisance, and that the city\u201d had notice of it, express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> It is unnecessary to determine whether the awning, if unauthorized, was a nuisance, for the city had not created and did not maintain it. The liability of the city for failure to remove obstructions in the street depends upon its negligence. It is plain that the city could have authorized the maintenance of this structure (section 50, Greater New York Charter [Laws 1901, c. 466]; Hoey v. Gilroy, 129 N. Y. 132, 29 N. E. 85), and it cannot be held liable on the theory of authorization by acquiescence, even if mere acquiescence were otherwise sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> If the awning were dangerous to pedestrians using the sidewalk, the city might be held liable for negligence in failing to cause its removal. Hume v. Mayor, 74 N. Y. 264. Awnings like the one involved in this suit serve a convenient and useful purpose. We know that they are in common use in this city, and so far as appears by this record no accident has heretofore resulted therefrom. The municipality is not obliged to remove every obstacle from the sidewalk but only those from which danger may reasonably be apprehended. Dubois v. City of Kingston, 102 N. Y. 219, 6 N. E. 273, 55 Am. Rep. 804. We think that the plaintiff failed to establish liability on either theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
