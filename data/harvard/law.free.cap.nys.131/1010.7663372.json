The second part, however, may be available to defendant, for prior paragraphs of the present answer set up the remarriage of plaintiff to Charles Werner \u201ca few weeks\u201d after the rendition of the judgment of divorce, and it may be that the amount concededly paid by defendant for alimony was sufficient to pay all the alimony which had accrued up to the time of the remarriage, which, if defendant can establish the state of the law in Illinois to be as claimed, might constitute a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We are not now called upon to determine whether the view of that law, which is sought to be pleaded, is correct. Assuming that he can establish this defense, it would have a material bearing upon the force to be given to the Illinois judgment; for, as was said in Suydam v. Barker, 18 N. Y. 468, 75 Am. Dec. 254, no greater effect is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>given to the judgment of any state than belonged to it in the state where it was rendered. i</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application \u00a1 for leave to serve an amended answer granted, upon payment by defendant of the taxable costs and $10 motion costs. All concur. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
