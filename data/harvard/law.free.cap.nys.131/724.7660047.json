The notice may be paraphrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-17\">\u201cI was on May 25, 1607, injured [nature and place of injury stated] by your negligence. You were so negligent in the following respects: (1) You did not provide a reasonably safe place to work. (2) You did not provide competent foreman or superintendent and fellow workmen. (3) You did not provide and enforce proper rules for my safety. (4) You\" permitted blasts without notice or proper protection. (5) You failed properly to guard me from such blasts. (6) You negligently conducted your work at the place. By .reason of <em>all </em>of which a blast was shot off, and I was hit by a rock\u201d from the' same and injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-18\">The above is equivalent to a statement that at a given date and place, where plaintiff was working, a rock hit the plaintiff, and that it so hit him by reason of defendant\u2019s negligence in omitting to do a master\u2019s duty in several particulars enumerated; way or works at a stated place defective, by reason of a rock thrown in blasting by enumerated omissions of the master\u2019s duty, and resulting injury at a given date. Such is the notice in substance. I deem it sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It was the master\u2019s duty, in the exercise of ordinary care, to do those things reasonably demandable to prevent rocks blasted from falling on the plaintiff, inasmuch as the place where the servant worked would be thereby rendered defective. The rock did fall on the plaintiff. Hence the place became thereby defective. The rock fell, so causing the defective place, because the master omitted several of his du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>ties. Hence the master was negligent. Such,\u00a1read in a legal view, is the notice. This court is not nicely considering the master\u2019s liability, but passing with suitable liberality upon a notice of the servant\u2019s claimed grounds of such liability, and while the matter could be stated mor\u00e9 clearly and explicitly, yet the facts, as pljaintiff asserts them, are told in language which, although general, carries a notification of the accusation against the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The complaint amphf covers the case as stated in the notice, and the plaintiff should have been allowed to introduce evidence to prove his cause of action as alleged. But, as rhis was denied him, he stated what he would prove. This he was nqt legally entitled to do, and the court discouraged, rather than approved, such course. The cause of injury of which he tendered proof is not covered by the notice of claim; for in its general scope it was an offer to prove injury by reason of the negligence of one exercising superintendence, of which there is no suggestion in the notice. It is true that\u2018the acts of the superintendent as stated in the offer would \u00a1be some evidence, competent, but maybe not sufficient, evidence of incompetency; but the whole tenor of the offer does not indicate that such issue was presented. However, I regard the offer of proqf as immaterial. The plaintiff had been advised that the court would, not admit \u201cany proof.\u201d The offer did not affect the defendant\u2019s right^, and could not, and it is just that the plaintiff should have'equal standing, and be permitted upon a new trial to introduce evidence in accord with the notice and complaint. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The judgment and order should be reversed, ^nd a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
