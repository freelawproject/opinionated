It granted to plaintiff the use of the park land upon which \u201cstand the premises owned by her.\u201d In view of the evidence, which was not disputed, that at that time there were buildings upon the park lands which were her property, the word \u201cpremises,\u201d though somewhat inapt, may be construed as meaning buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The subject of the agreement was therefore land, and it is not disputed that plaintiff was in the actual possession thereof up to April 6, 1903. In this-respect this case is distinguishable from Becher v. City of New York, 102 App. Div. 269, 92 N. Y. Supp. 460. It is true that there is no evidence that the park board authorized the execution of the instrument. Laws of 1897, c. 378, as amended Laws of 1901, c. 466, \u00a7 616. But when offered in evidence it was received without objection. Non constat but if objection had been made to its competency all the necessary prerequisites to its execution might have been proved. The evidence clearly establishes that on the 6th of April, 1903, the defendant Peters, with a gang of laborers acting under the direction of the defendant Eustis, went upon the premises, broke down the door of one of the buildings, tore out the windows, tore out the sides of another building in which plaintiff with her children was then living, tore off the roof, and made it impossible for her to occupy the same. We think that these acts constituted a forcible entry within the meaning of the statute. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2233; 19 Cyc. 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Although originally proceedings under the statute for forcible entry and detainer were in their nature criminal, the violation of such statute is now sufficient basis for a civil action for damages. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1669; Wood v. Phillips, 43 N. Y. 152, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The defendants contend that, although the agreement with plaintiff was for .a definite term which had not expired, a contract of such a character \u201cmust be construed as made subject to what we term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the governmental or legislative power\u201d of the authorities having control of the subject-matter thereof for the public use, and that in a proper case such agreement may be terminated in the interests of the public. N. Y. Mail &amp; Newspaper Transportation Co. v. Shea, 30 App. Div. 266, 51 N. Y. Supp. 563; Gushee v. City of New York, 42 App. Div. 37, 58 N. Y. Supp. 967; Gredinger v. Higgins, 139 App. Div. 606, 124 N. Y. Supp. 22. But, if the acts of defendants constituted a forcible entry, it is a matter of no consequence that the term of occupation specified in such instrument had been lawfully terminated. Plaintiff was still in occupation of the premises, and defendants were not justified in forcibly ejecting her therefrom.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201cThe party so using force and acquiring possession may have the superior title or may have the better right to the present possession; but the policy of the law in this class of cases is to prevent disturbances of the public peace, to forbid any person righting himself in a case of that kind by his own hand and by violence.\u201d Iron M. &amp; H. R. R. v. Johnson, 119 U. S. 608, 7 Sup. Ct. 339, 30 L. Ed. 504.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Moreover, defendants could not terminate an agreement of this character unless the determination so to do was made in good faith and in furtherance of the public interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Upon the trial of this action the jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff, and in addition thereto, without objection from any of the parties, found specially upon the following questions of fact stated in writing (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1187), namely: (1) Did the defendants in doing the acts set forth in the complaint act in good faith ? (2) Did the defendants in doing such acts act capriciously ? (3) What is the damage which resulted to the plaintiff from the destruction and loss of buildings and personal property ? The trial court-further instructed the jury that the acts referred to consisted \u201ciri going upon the premises on the 6th day of April and causing these buildings to be destroyed, torn down.\u201d The jury answered the first question in the negative and the second in the affirmative, and fixed the damages at $4,000. By stipulation the question of the amount of damages is eliminated from the case. The evidence fully sustains the findings of the jury upon the remaining questions. But, even if plaintiff\u2019s right of possession had been lawfully terminated, defendants\u2019 method of regaining possession was clearly unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The judgment and order denying a motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
