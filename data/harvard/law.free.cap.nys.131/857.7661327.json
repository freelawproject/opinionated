The-prayer for relief is that the notes be declared good and valid instruments, and that a sufficient amount of the property of the decedent be set aside to meet and pay said notes as they respectively mature. j</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The plaintiff finds itself in a peculiar position to which the Code remedies for determining and enforcing claims against a decedent\u2019s estate are apparently inapplicable. The remedies provided by the Code of Civil Procedure for the enforcement of aj claim are threefold. First. The claimant may accept the offer of the executor or administrator, if made, to refer the claim to a referee (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2718), but this is of no avail to the plaintiff, since no offer has been made by the administrator. Second. The claimant may within six months after the rejection of the claim file a written consent with the surrogate that the claim be heard and determined by him upon tne settlement of the account of the executor or administrator, and, if a similar consent is filed by the executor or administrator, the surrogate acquires jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1822, 2743. This remedy, however, is unavailing in the present case for lack of a consent by the administrator. Third. The claimant may commence an action against the executor or administrator for the recovery of the claim. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1822. Clark v. Scovill, 191 N. Y. 8, 83 N. E. 659. The last-mentioned remedy, which is the only one open to a claimant except with the consent of the executor or admjjnistrator, can scarcely be deemed adequate under the circumstances disclosed in the present case. Section 1822 provides that an action upon a disputed claim must be begun \"within six months after the dispute or rejection, or, if no part of the debt is then due, within six months after a part thereof becomes due.\u201d This clearly recognizes, as is undoubtedly the law, that an unmatured debt is entitled to the same protection and remedies as one which has matured before the death of the debtor, and section 2745 requires the surrogate in certain cases to I require a fund to be set aside to meet unmatured claims. Under section 1822 the plaintiff cannot presently commence an action at law, because no part of the debt is due, or will be due until December 15, 1914, three years from the present time. Whether he could or must sue upon all the notes within six months after the first one becomes due may be a matter of some doubt. See Cornes v. Wilkin, 79 N. Y. 129. That, however, is not important to consider now. It is sufficient for present purposes that an action at law must at all events be postponed for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">As was pointed out in Clark v. Scovill, supra, it was the purpose of the Legislature in adopting those sections of the Code of Civil Procedure which deal with the adjustment of claims against decedents\u2019 estates to provide a method whereby, if the p\u00e1rties so desired, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>estate might be wound up speedily and inexpensively, but, where one party or the other shows an indisposition to avail of these provisions, it is the right of a claimant to ask for reasonable protection and security. The position of a claimant who holds a disputed unmatured claim upon which he cannot for a considerably period of time commence an action at law is peculiarly unfortunate. He cannot, in this county, compel the filing of an inventory (Matter of Huntington, 39 Misc. Rep. 477, 80 N. Y. Supp. 220), and therefore cannot proceed for the removal of the administrator for failure to file an inventory (Matter of Moulton\u2019s Estate, 10 N. Y. Supp. 718).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He cannot compel an accounting in the Surrogate\u2019s Court (Matter of Whitehead, 38 App. Div. 319, 56 N. Y. Supp. 989), and therefore, of course, cannot proceed against an executor or administrator for failure to file an account. He may be cited to attend upon an accounting (section 2728, Code Civ. Proc.), and the decree of distribution would apparently be conclusive upon him (section 2743), but he could gain nothing by such appearance. The surrogate would have no jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the claim without the consent of the executor or administrator. Sections 1822, 2743. The decree cannot provide that he be paid because the surrogate is required to direct distribution among the creditors whose claims are admitted or established and the next of kin (section 2743); nor can the surrogate require a fund to be set aside to meet the claim because his power in that regard is limited to an admitted debt of the decedent not yet due, or one upon which an action is pending, between the claimant and the executor or administrator (section 2745). Unless, therefore, the holder of an unmatured, disputed claim may maintain an action similar to the present, he may be obliged to stand idly by, and see the estate squandered, wasted, or distributed without the power to do one single thing for his own protection, relying only upon the possibility that, when his debt does mature, the executor or administrator may be personally capable of paying it. It is common knowledge, fortified by many cases in the books, that such reliance often proves to be unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-3\">We think that under the circumstances a proper case is made out for the interposition of equity. The jurisdiction of courts of equity over executors and administrators has long been recognized, and while such courts are indisposed to assume jurisdiction unnecessarily, as where full relief can be obtained in the Surrogate\u2019s Court, the right to intervene still exists and will be exercised in cases like the present, wherein the statutory limitations upon the power of the Surrogate\u2019s Court are inadequate to protect a claimant. In such cases the statutory remedies are not deemed exclusive. A sufficient precedent for the present action is to be found in Ludington v. Thompson, 153 N. Y. 499, 47 N. E. 903. In that case a creditor of an insolvent corporation held eight promissory notes of the corporation maturing at future dates. His claim was rejected by the receiver, and he sued, as does the present plaintiff, for the purpose of establishing his status as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>a creditor and his interest in the assets of the corporation. The court in sustaining his right to sue said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-3\">\u201cIt is important to notice the real nature of the action. It is in form an action upon the notes, and judgment has been rendered thereon against the defendant in his representative character. In fact, it is an action to ascertain and establish the status of the plaintiff as a creditor of the corporation, and as such entitled to share in the distribution of its assets in the hands of the receiver. * * * The action, we repeat, is npt in a proper sense an action brought on obligations evidenced by the notes, the plaintiff was a creditor and by reason thereof entitled to tribution of the estate of the corporation.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but to ascertain whether share in the dis-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">After pointing out that the assets of an insolvent corporation are a trust fund in the hands of the receiver for the benefit of the creditors and stockholders, the court further said: !</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">\u201cIt was not a trust fund for the then ascertained creditors, but for all who should, establish their status as creditors in the clue course of the administration of the trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The Special Term was of opinion, as the respondent now argues, that the case above cited is not analogous to the present because the estate of a decedent in the hands of his execulor or administrator is not a trust fund for the benefit-of his creditors, This view .is erronepus. It has often been held that an executor or administrator is a trustee, and is in that capacity subject to the jurisdiction 'of a court of equity. In Wager v. Wager, 89 N. Y. 161, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\">' \u201cAn executor Is always a trustee of the personal property of the estate; and can be called upon to account therefor in a court of equity, even though no express trust be created by the will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">'In Babcock v. Booth, 2 Hill, 184, 186, 38 Am, Dec. 578, it was held that an administrator could sue to set aside fraudulent transfers, which his intestate could not himself have avoided; the reason being that the administrator stood in the position of a trustee for the creditors.' Upon this point the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-11\">\u201cIn Dox v. Backenstose, <em>12 </em>Wend. 543, it was remarked by Savage, Oh. J., that under our present statute executors and administrators have a new character, and stand in a different relation from what they formerly did to creditors of the deceased persons with whose estates they are entrusted. They are not now the mere representatives of their testator or intestate. They are constituted trustees, and the property in their halnds is a fund to be disposed of in the best manner for the benefit of the creditors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">To the same effect is City of New York v. U. S. Trust Co., 35 Misc. Rep. 639, 72 N. Y. Supp. 121, affirmed 78 App Div. 366, 79 N. Y. Supp. 1010, 178 N. Y. 551, 70 N. E. 1097, wherein the court upheld an action in equity to reach a decedent\u2019s property, although no precise provision of the Code could be found under which the action could be maintained. The decision was placed upon the express ground that the assets of the estate constituted a trust fund \u00a1upon which in equity the creditor had a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">We are therefore of the opinion that the complaint states a sufficient cause of action, and that the motion-for judgment upon the pleadings should have been granted. The order appealed from is therefore re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>versed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted with $10 costs, with leave to defendant, however, to withdraw his demurrer and to serve an answer within 20 days on payment of costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-4\"> Reported, in full in the New York Supplement; reported as a memorandum decision without opinion in 57 Hun, 589.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
