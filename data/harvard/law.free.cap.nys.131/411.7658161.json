It appears that on the 7th of December, 1907, the defendants, at Colorado Springs, Col., gave the plaintiffs\u2019 agent an order for merchandise of the value of $366.45. While a memorandum of the order was made by the agent, and transmitted to the plaintiffs, it was not signed by the defendants. On March 4, 1908, the defendants wrote the plaintiffs, acknowledging that they \u201cplaced an order for a few skirts December 7th,\u201d and requesting the plaintiffs to delay shipping. On the 1st of April, 1908, the defendants again wrote the plaintiffs, stating, \u201cWe will let you know when to ship goods bought.\u201d On the 6th of May, 1908, the plaintiffs shipped the goods and mailed an invoice. On the 19th of May, 1908, the defendants wrote the plaintiffs, acknowledging the receipt of a letter of May 13th, which does not appear in the record, and saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201cIn reply will state our reasons for not receiving the package. When we-countermanded the order placed with you, we can assure you it was not from choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is impossible to tell from the letters relied upon, or from anything to which they refer, what the terms of the sale were. At most, the letters contain an admission that the defendants had ordered certain goods, without disclosing the kind, quantity, or purchase price. The letters contain no reference either to the memorandum made by the salesman at the time of receiving the order, or to the invoice-mailed by the plaintiffs on May 6th. While it is quite true that the evidence necessary to satisfy the statute need not all be comprised in a single writing, it still is equally true that verbal evidence cannot be resorted to, in order to supply any of the essential terms of the contract which the writing or writings relied upon omit. Wilson v. Lewiston Mill Co., 150 N. Y. 314, 44 N. E. 959, 55 Am. St. Rep. 680; Brauer v. Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 178 N. Y. 339, 70 N. E. 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Without the testimony of the salesman who took the order, it would be absolutely impossible to tell a single element of the terms of sale. At most, we have a memorandum, signed by the defendants, admitting that they had given some sort of an order; but that is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The order of the Appellate Term and the judgment of the City Court should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
