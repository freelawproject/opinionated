Laws 1909, c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 200-204) to recover damages for personal injuries. There can be no doubt that at the close of the evidence the defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the complaint for a failure of proof. The court, however, went further, and dismissed the complaint upon the merits; and this it had no authority to do upon the case as it was then presented. There was simply a failure of proof, not an impossibility of proof, which might entitle the plaintiff upon a new trial to recover. The discussion of the case by the court in dismissing the complaint clearly shows that, with sufficient evidence in support of the allegations of the complaint, a case would be presented for the jury, and so long as there is such a condition it is not proper for the court to dismiss upon the merits. That is the equivalent of saying that there could be no recovery as a matter of law under the facts alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The judgment appealed from should be modified, by striking out the words \u201cupon the merits,\u201d and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Judgment of the Municipal Court modified, by striking out the words \u201cupon the merits,\" and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
