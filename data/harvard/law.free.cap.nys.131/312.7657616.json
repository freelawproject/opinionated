The petition was denied upon the ground that it was not made to appear that the appellant had preserved the money intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> An attorney with money in his hands belonging to his client has an absolute right to a summary determination by the court of the existence and amount of his lien (section 475, Judiciary Law [Consol. Laws 1909, c. 30] ; Matter of King, 168 N. Y. 53, 60 N. E. 1054), and it is not incumbent upon him to show that he had preserved the money intact. It is enough if he is ready, able, and willing to account to the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The question as to whether the appellant has a general as well as a special lien upon the money is to be determined upon the hearing at Special Term, and not by this court in the first instance. The answer admits that the appellant has a lien upon the money, and the only controversy is as to the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the proceeding remitted to the Special Term, with directions to proceed to a hearing and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">JENKS, P. J., and CARR and WOODWARD, JJ., concur. THOMAS, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
