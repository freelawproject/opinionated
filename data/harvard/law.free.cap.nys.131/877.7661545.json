The proceeding was brought under section <em>70 </em>of the election law. The papers on which the applicant sought the writ of peremptory mandamus show that the applicant, when he registered for the election which was held in 1910, unintentionally placed his mark in the enrollment blank, furnished to him pursuant to law, in the circle assigned to the Democratic party, when in fact he intended to place said mark in the circle assigned to the Republican party. He attributes this mistake on his part to the fact that the voting booth in the place of registry was \u201cvery dark.\u201d The board of elections, acting upon the enrollment blank as it came to them, enrolled the relator as a member of the Democratic party. If any mistake was made, it was undeniably that of the relator himself. Section <em>70 </em>of the election law confers power of summary proceeding upon the specified courts only in case of erroneous action on the part of the public officials therein specified. It does not give any power to the courts to correct mistakes made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>elector himself. People ex rel. Smith v. York, 34 Misc. Rep. 120, 68 N. Y. Supp. 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\">. There is no provision in the election law which in any way authorizes any change of enrollment actually made by | the elector in the city of New York-and certain other counties. Such provision, however, is made in article 4 of the election law in relation to enrollment in various towns of the state, as will be seen by ijeference to section 94 of said act. Prom the fact that such provision is made in relation to the correction of enrollment in certain towns in I an article of the statute which expressly excepts any county embraced in the Greater New York, a strong implication arises that it was not the intention of the-Legislature that enrollment once made on the Ret of an elector could subsequently be changed by the courts, or the election officers within the territory expressly excepted from the provisions of said article.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The order of the County Court should be reversed, and the motion, for a writ of peremptory mandamus denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
