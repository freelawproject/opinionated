The case presented an issue of fact, which should-have been submitted to the jury, and should not have been decided by the court as a matter of law. The learned trial court charged the-jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">\u201cAs a matter of law, if that train was stopped, and started again under the-circumstances as detailed by the plaintiff in this action, then that was a wrongful act upon the part of the defendant corporation.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">At the close of the charge the court, in response to a request to, charge submitted by the counsel for the plaintiff, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-17\">\u201cI have charged fully upon that point, that if this accident happened under the circumstances as detailed by the plaintiff in this case, then that was a wrongful act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-18\">To both of these statements in the charge the defendant\u2019s counsel duly excepted. We think that this charge was equivalent to a statement that the circumstances detailed by the plaintiff constituted, as a. matter of law, negligence on the part of the defendant. The circum-, stances detailed by the plaintiff were not of such a character as to-do more than raise an issue of fact as to whether-or not the defendant was negligent. This issue the learned -trial court should not have-assumed to determine as a matter of law. The charge was calculated \u2022 to impress the jury with the idea that their verdict was to be dependent upon their finding as to the credibility of the plaintiff. In this respect the charge tendered to the jury an erroneous issue. Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>verdict should not have been made dependent merely upon the credibility of the plaintiff; but from a review of all the evidence in the case it was the duty of the jury to determine as a matter of fact whether the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff free from contributory negligence.

Supp. 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
