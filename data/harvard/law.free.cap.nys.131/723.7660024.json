The action is brought to recover damages for personal injuries. The allegation, which is the sole basis of the cause of action, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-18\">\u201cThat the plaintiff was caused to be struck by the said projectile by reason of the negligence and carelessness of this defendant, and without any contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">These are the only words in the complaint upon which the defendant\u2019s liability is predicated. The pleader does not show the omitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>act that should have been done by the defendant, or the culpable act that was done by it. A plaintiff, charging a defendant with negligence from which damages result, should apprise thel defendant in his pleading of the facts upon which' the charge of negligence is based. Pagnillo v. Mack Paving &amp; Construction Co., 142 App. Div. 491, 127 N. Y. Supp. 72. In that case the complaint alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate suffered mortal injuries, \u201ccaused solely by the negligence of the defendant and of the person then and there intrusted by it, and then and there exercising superintendence for ijt,\u201d etc. In holding that it was not sufficient to merely allege that the injuries were \u201ccaused solely by the negligence of the defendant,\u201d the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cWhat was the omitted act that should have Keen done, or the culpable act that was done? Does it relate to place, appliance, tool, rule, instruction, or order ? The complaint is silent. In this state I discover no authority sustaining a pleading hare of facts. Upon examination it will be found that in the decision, invoked by the appellant there is some fact stated, either an omission or an act, upon which negligence was predicated and charged, it may be, by a general allegation of negligence, as to such act or omission, allowing evidence of details associated with such a|t or omission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">It follows, from this most recent decision', and other authorities, that, having set forth in his complaint \u201cthat the plaintiff was caused to be struck by the said projectile by reason of the negligence and carelessness of this defendant,\u201d without setting forth any facts to sustain that conclusion, the plaintiff has failed to plead a cause of action. j</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, with leave to plaintiff to amend the complaint within six days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court] below.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">SEABURY, J., concurs.
