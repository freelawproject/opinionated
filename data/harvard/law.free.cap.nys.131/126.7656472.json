He did not obtain original consents from persons within the limits required, but refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>red to and relied upon the consents given for the business to Frey-gang, whereby the latter obtained a license upon his application, in March, 1910, expiring October 1, 1910. In his application Freygang stated that there were no buildings occupied exclusively for dwellings within the limited area. The petitioner seeks to revoke the license Upon the ground that his house was such a dwelling and that the answer was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The petitioner\u2019s house is a tenement house, and was used exclusively for a dwelling house, although petitioner, in his contract for a telephone, requests the company \u201cto establish at his Bus. * * * a telephone station,\u201d and on the contract appears: \u201cMatter for Telephone Directory. Auletta P. Contr., 8 Sterll\u2019g Av. Yonkers.\u201d The petitioner states that there had not been for several years a business sign on his house, and at first he said that he never had one there. Several witnesses testified that there was no sign there indicating a business at the time of the application, and several that there was such sign. It is quite clear that it was used exclusively for dwelling purposes within the reasonable use of such expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the license revoked, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">JENKS, P.
