The portion of tire amended answer demurred to contains 11 paragraphs, alleging facts which would tend to show a constructive eviction and which the pleader sets up as a separate defense to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It has been frequently held that a clause in a lease of the character herein described survives dispossess proceedings. Bayliss v. Ingram, 84 App. Div. 360, 82 N. Y. Supp. 891, affirmed 181 N. Y. 518, 73 N. E. 1119; Anzolone v. Paskusz, 96 App. Div. 188, 89 N. Y. Supp. 203. A cause of action existing in favor of a landlord and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>against a tenant under a clause in a lease of this kind, after dispossession of the tenant by summary proceedings, is one of damages for breach of the covenant in the lease, and not for rent (Slater v. Von Chorus, 120 App. Div. 16, 104 N. Y. Supp. 996); the measure of damages, of course, being fixed by the amount of rent, if any, reserved in the lease. It will be observed that the amended answer does not aver, in terms, that the defendant was dispossessed by summary proceedings, but states, after reciting the alleged facts claimed to constitute a constructive eviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">\u201cThat defendant was compelled to abandon and discontinue possession of the premises, and on February 7, 1910, the defendant did remove from the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Paragraph 6 of the complaint is therefore admitted, by not being denied, in the alleged separate defense set up in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> In determining the sufficiency of a separate defense upon a demurrer thereto, a material allegation, contained in the complaint and not denied in the separate defense, must be considered as admitted. Eeles v. Dumary, 84 App. Div. 105, 82 N. Y. Supp. 531. Tested by this rule, the allegations set up in the alleged separate defense of the amended answer in the case at bar do not constitute a defense. The defendant was compelled to abandon the premises by a warrant of dispossess issued in a summary proceeding for nonpayment of rent, and not by reason of a constructive eviction, and there can be no constructive eviction of demised premises, unless accompanied by a voluntary abandonment thereof. Boreel v. Lawton, 90 N. Y. 293, 43 Am. Rep. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The defense of constructive eviction could have been interposed in the summary proceedings taken by the landlord. This apparently was not done, or, if it was done, it was not sustained. . The judgment in those proceedings, therefore, is res ad judicata in an action for damages for a breach of the covenant set forth in the lease in question. The demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, and demurrer sustained, with costs in this court and in the court below, with leave to defendant to amend the answer within six days, upon payment of such costs. All concur.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
