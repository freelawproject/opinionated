The plaintiff .was employed by the defendant as selling agent for certain vacuum dyeing machines, manufactured by the defendant, under an agreement pursuant to which he was to receive $150 commission for each large machine sold for $1,475, and $100 commission for each small machine sold for $950. In his affidavit to obtain the warrant of attachment, he states that he sold, and the defendant was paid for, 68 machines, upon which he \u201cwas duly entitled as commissions under said contract to the sum of $10,150\u201d; that he became entitled under the contract to the further sum of $332.37 for expenses, making a total of $10,482.37, and that there was paid to him \u201cupon said amount, only the sum of $8,100.\u201d It is impossible for the court to determine, unless the plaintiff\u2019s conclusion be accepted, that he is entitled to anything in excess of the sum already paid him. The failure to state the number of large and the number of small machines sold was doubtless an oversight; but it was a fatal omission, as facts must be stated from which the court can judicially determine the amount due, and the conclusions of the party moving for the attachment canndt be accepted as proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
