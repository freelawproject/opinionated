Hedges, on his farm at Wainscott, Suffolk county, Long Island, when he claims to have been injured through the negligence of the defendant in not providing him with a safe and proper truck on which to do his work, and allowing his son, the codefendant Arthui Hedges, who was a reckless and unskillful driver, to drive said truck, which he did so negligently, while it was unsecurely loaded, that plaintiff was thrown therefrom and run over thereby. Upon defendant\u2019s application to change the place of trial, it appeared that son\u00e9 10 persons who reside in Suffolk county will be necessary witnesses for the defense; their names and residences being given, as well as the facts to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>each will testify. As against this plaintiff\u2019s attorney submits an affidavit that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-4\">\u201cThe witnesses necessary to be called in this case will be the physicians who treated the plaintiff at the Bellevue Hospital and the defendants. Plaintiff does not expect to call any other witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">While it is stated that plaintiff is \u201cin poor circumstances,\u201d it does not appear that he will be unable to travel to Suffolk county for the trial; nor does he show how many physicians he proposes to call, nor that he cannot procure their attendance in that county. The cause of action arose in Suffolk county, where the greater number of witnesses reside, and where a speedy trial can be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the application to change the place of trial granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
