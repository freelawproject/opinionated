'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-26\">\u201cI hereby guarantee the payment of. all bills as they may come due \u25a0 for goods that my brother, Meyer Edelman, may buy of Benjamin Griffen of this city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-27\">\u201cThis guaranty shall not exceed in amount the sum <em>of $500 of unpaid hills tohich he may huy during one year from date. </em>When Meyer Edelman shall owe Benjamin Griffen the sum of $500, I am to be notified, and I will then notify Benjamin Griffen if I am willing to increase the guaranty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-28\">\u201cA. A. Edelman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>It is undisputed that on February 8, 1909, the defendant paid the plaintiff on account of said guaranty the sum of $150.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> We are not impressed by the argument in support of the contention that the memorandum is insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds, and that the contract is unenforceable for want of mutuality. However, the appellant does call attention to two serious errors in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There can be no doubt that the defendant\u2019s guaranty was limited to the sum of $500 for goods purchased within one year from its date. Of course, the guaranty was continuous, in the sense that it was not limited to the first bill of goods ordered. It was, however, limited in time to goods purchased within one year, and in amount to the sum of $500. The payment by the defendant of the sum of $150-81 on account of his guaranty reduced his obligation thereunder pro tanto.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> We would be able to modify the judgment, and to affirm it for the balance of the recovery, were it not for a defect in the proof as to the amount and value of the goods purchased by the said Meyer Edelman. The latter, who was not on speaking terms with the defendant, was called as a witness by the plaintiff, and was permitted, over objection and exception, to state that he had purchased $531.77 worth of merchandise from the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that that was the sum unpaid after deducting the payment of $150.81, made by the defendant. The witness was then permitted to state, over proper objection and exception, that he then owed the plaintiff the sum of $531.77 for goods purchased, and that testimony constitutes all of the proof in the case on the amount of purchases made by Meyer Edelman, except certain signed slips, which were evidently delivered to the plaintiff by him or some of his employ\u00e9s, whenever goods were obtained. But those slips fail to show the qua\u00f1tity or purchase price of the goods. A guarantor is at least entitled to insist that the amount of his principal\u2019s indebtedness be established by competent evidence, and that was not done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Wherefore the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
