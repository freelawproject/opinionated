Action on a promissory note for $300. Defense by indorser that there was no sufficient notice of protest. Plaintiff claims there were two written notices of protest, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-18\">\u201cNew York, May 15, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-19\">\u201cMr. I. Bjurstrom, 2650 Broadway, City\u2014Dear Sir: We beg to inform you that the note \u00f3f Carl A. ICarlson for $300, due to-day at our office, indorsed by you, has not been paid. Mr. ICarlson was here, and said he could not take up th\"e note until the 29th inst. We would therefore ask you to send us a check in settlement by return mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-20\">\u201cYours truly, H. Herrmann Lumber Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-21\">\u201cNew York, May 29, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-22\">\u201cMr. I. Bjurstrom, 2650 Broadway, City\u2014Dear Sir: The note of Mr. ICarlson for $300, due May 15th and indorsed by you, has not yet been paid, and unless you take it up at once we will place the matter in the hands of our attorney for collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-23\">\u201cYours truly, H. Herrmann Lumber Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s testimony tended to show that the respondent indorser was present at the making of the note, and that the letter of May 15th was duly mailed. Plaintiff\u2019s carbon copy thereof was put in evidence. Presentment and demand and refusal of payment were proved. About two days later the respondent was called up, arid asked what he intended to do about the note. He answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cEverything will be all right. I will be down to your office Monday or Tuesday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Respondent indorser, in answer to a leading question, does not remember receiving the letter of May 15th. After his memory had been refreshed by reading his affidavit denying notice of protest, he finally said, in answer to another leading question, that the first notification he had that the note was unpaid was when he received the letter of May 29th. Questions tending to show that he had promised to call at plaintiff\u2019s office in regard to the payment of the note, also that he had refused to pay it, were excluded, the former over exception. The trial justice dismissed the complaint, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201cAsstiming that the letter of May 15th was in fact mailed and received by the defendant, * * * the notice contained in that letter is not a sufficient notice to hold the indorser. * * * The letter of May 29, 1911, 14 days afterwards, was not timely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The trial justice held the letter of May 15th ineffectual, because Karlson \u201cwas entitled to have the date of the note given him, and for what period it was made\u201d; also \u201cthe name of the payee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Defendant\u2019s inability to recollect whether he received written notice of protest does <em>not </em>overcome the positive proof that such notice was written and mailed. Hastings v. Brooklyn Life Ins. Co., 138 N. Y. 473, 476-478, 34 N. E. 289; Kupferberg v. Horowitz, 52 Misc. Rep. 488, 489, 102 N. Y. Supp. 502; McAndrew v. Radway, 34 N. Y. 511, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Inartificial language, accompanied by an omission to give the date of the making of the note, the day of its maturity, and the nanTe of the payee, does not invalidate a notice of protest. Youngs v. Lee, 12 N. Y. 551, 554. The negotiable instruments law says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">\u201cSec. 166. When Notice Sufficient. A written notice need not be signed and an insufficient written notice may be supplemented and validated by verbal communication. A misdescription of the instrument does not vitiate the notice unless the party to whom the notice is given is in fact misled thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">\u201cSec. 167. Form of Notice. The notice may be in writing or merely oral and may be given in any terms which sufficiently identify the instrument, and indicate that it has been dishonored by nonacceptance or nonpayment. It may in all cases be given by delivering it personally or through the mails.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">Moreover, the exclusion of. all paroi proof of respondent\u2019s promises or declarations in regard to the nonpayment of the note may have excluded proof of a verbal notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
