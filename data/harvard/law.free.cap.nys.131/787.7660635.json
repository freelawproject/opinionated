Adams, hereby acknowledge my indebtedness to Marguerite Gilbert, for services rendered by her, for which I promise to pay her the sum of Thirty thousand dollars; and in the event of my death I hereby authorize and direct the payment of the same out of the funds of my estate. Dated. Jan. 23, 1907. [Signed] Isabella V. Adams.\u2019 That, although duly demanded from the defendant, no part of the same has been paid, and there is due and owing on the said instrument or promissory note the whole amount thereof, with interest from May 19, 1908.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">The record shows that a jury was impaneled, and then proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-18\">\u201cThe defendant, the maker of the note sued on, was present at the trial. The court proceeded to take the evidence of the respective parties. After each side had rested, the following motion was made: \u2018Mr. Zaring: I move-to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that it appears on the face of this instrument that it was not payable until after death. The Court; Then, you mean on the ground that the facts stated in the complaint do not constitute a cause of. action? * * * I have given some thought to the construction of this instrument, and I am impelled to the conclusion that it is. not a demand note. My conclusion is based entirely upon the terms of the-note itself without reference to the testimony taken,\u2019 \u201d and dismissed the-complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-19\">From the judgment entered thereon this appeal is taken; the record disclosing none of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>In Hegeman v. Moon, 131 N. Y. 462, 30 N E. 487, Peckham, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">\u201cA written statement that a certain amount of \u00a1 money is due a payee therein named, followed by the signature of the maker of the statement, implies that the money is due from the maker, and j is an indebtedness from him to the person to whom the money is thus acknowledged to be due. Kimball v. Huntington, 10 Wend. 675 [25 Am. Dec. 590]. The acknowledgment of the indebtedness, and that it is due, implies a promise to pay it on de: mand. It is a promissory note within the statute.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">In that case the instrument directed the maker\u2019s executors to pay a specified sum one year after her death. The cqurt proceeded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">, \u201cThe time when the money is to be payable is, however, altered by the direction given to her executor to pay it one year from her death. If there were no limitation, an acknowledgment that the debt was due would imply that it was payable at once or on demand. The direction is, however, in the nature of a promise and expresses a time of'payment, and therefore excludes the presumption that it is payable immediately, which would otherwise arise from the use of the word \u2018due.\u2019 Being a promissory note, it imports a consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">In Carnwright v. Gray, 127 N. Y. 92, 27 N. E. 835, 12 L. R. A. 845, 24 Am. St. Rep. 424, the instrument sued on was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-9\">\u201cThirty days after death I promise to pay to Cornelius Carnwright $1500 with interest.\u201d |</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Plaintiff gave no evidence of the transaction out of which the in-, strument arose, and none of the actual consideration thereof, but, having offered testimony tending to prove the genuineness of the maker\u2019s signature, put the note in evidence, and rested \u00a1his case. After citing the statute in regard to promissory notes and a number of cases, Brown, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-11\">\u201cNo authority is cited in the courts of this state or of England holding that a nonnegotiable note is not within the terms df the law cited, and we are of the opinion that the language of our statute includes a note payable to a person without words of negotiability. The instrument sued upon being, therefore, a promissory note within the statute of this state, it follows that it imports a consideration. * * * A promissory note is defined to be a written engagement by one person to pay absolutely and unconditionally to another person therein named, or to the bearer, a certain sum of money at a specified time or on demand. Story on Prom. Notes, \u00a7 1; Coolidge v. Ruggles, 15 Mass. 387.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">The negotiable instruments law (chapter 38, Consol. Laws 1909; chapter 43, Laws 1909) provides: j</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-16\">\u201cSec. 26. An instrument is payable on demand: \u2022* * * (2) in which no time for payment is expressed.\u201d' f</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-17\">\u201cSec. 29. The instrument need not follow the language of this chapter but any terms are sufficient which clearly indicate an intention to conform to the requirements hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">I am of the opinion that the instrument at bar is a promissory note, payable upon demand; that the words, \u201cand in the event of my death I hereby authorize and direct the payment of the same out of the funds of my estate,\u201d are surplusage, and in no degree affect the preceding statement, \u201cI promise to pay her the sum of thirty thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>dollars,\u201d and therefore the time of payment was not postponed until the death of the maker of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The paper, while a promissory note, was nonnegotiable. This suit is between the maker and the payee, and all the defenses are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The dismissal of the complaint solely upon the ground stated was error and the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs and disbursements to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
