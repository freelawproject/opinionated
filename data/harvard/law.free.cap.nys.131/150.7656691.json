The sole question presented on the former appeal (141 App. Div. 852, 126 N. Y. Supp. 884), was whether deceased was a member in good standing at the time of his death. The same question is presented on this appeal, but the contention is without merit. Article 5, \u00a7 1, of defendant\u2019s constitution, provides that, in case of a member\u2019s death after having been such member for six months, the Society will pay $200. Section 3 provides, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cIf in the society\u2019s treasury there is found not more than $500.00 (five hundred dollars), then the departed member\u2019s or member\u2019s wife\u2019s nearest relatives will receive no mortuary benefit, but will not be left without assistance. Every member of the society will be obliged to pay $1.00 in case of death of a member and 50 cents in case of death of a member\u2019s wife. The sum collected will be paid to whom it belongs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The constitution is a part of the contract between a member and the Society, and this section makes the payment of a mortuary benefit conditional and not absolute, and it was incumbent upon the plaintiff before she was entitled to a judgment to establish that at the time of her husband\u2019s death, or at least when the mortuary benefit became payable, that there was in defendant\u2019s treasury more than $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The only, evidence upon this vital question is the admission that \u201cat the time of the death of Jonas Wajczeliunas the beneficiary\u2019s husband, there was $500 in the defendant society\u2019s treasury, out of which $200 were put up in lieu of a bond, by the treasurer, Peter Brezitis.\u201d This admission must be taken as a whole, and does not establish the condition precedent, for two reasons: First, it admits only $500; and, second, states that $200 of this amount is money of its treasurer, deposited by him in lieu of the bond required by section 3 of article 12 of the constitution.- The plain intention and meaning of section 3 of article 5 is that more than $500 of the defendant\u2019s money, applicable to the payment of its liabilities, shall be in its treasury at the time of the decease of a member (or when the benefit is payable), to give his beneficiary the right to a death benefit of $200, and it must receive that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
