The action is upon a credit insurance bond or policy. The plaintiff seeks to recover two losses occasioned by the bankruptcy of one Annie Scheinberg, who owed plaintiff $4,990.82, and by the failure of the Sanders Manufacturing Company, which owed plaintiff $195.30. The controversy is as to the Scheinberg loss, and the question presented is whether or not that loss is covered by the terms of the bond or policy. On July 20, 1907, defendant issued a bond or policy to plaintiff to run until September 19, 1907. On September 27, 1907, defendant issued a renewal policy to run from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>September 20, 1907, to September 20, 1908. On October 21, 1907, Annie Scheinberg was adjudged a bankrupt. The first policy above mentioned limited defendant\u2019s liability solely by what is termed \u201cexperience\u201d which confined the insurance to indebtedness incurred by \u201cold\u201d customers of plaintiff. The second policy (upon which this action is brought) was designed to extend the insurance, so as to cover indebtedness incurred by \u201cnew\u201d customers as well as \u201cold.\u201d Of course, the test of \u201cexperience\u201d would be inapplicable to \u201cnew\u201d customers, and consequently the new policy established a different standard whereby to determine the risk which defendant assumed. Attached to the policy and made a part of it is a schedule, called \u201cA,\u201d indicating the risk which the defendant assumed. This schedule contained a list, of letters and figures indicating the ratings published by a specified mercantile agency. These ratings ran from Aa-Al to G-3J4, and to the list was appended the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cCustomers of the indemnified possessing one of the capital and credit ratings as specified in the above schedule shall be covered for an amount not exceeding the sum set opposite such customer\u2019s rating thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Then followed the definition of \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d customers, under which Annie Scheinberg would be classed as an \u201cold\u201d customer. As to such customers the policy provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">\u201cTT\u2014Subject to the terms and conditions of the attached bond and this rider, old customers of the indemnified possessing a capital <em>and </em>credit rating other than as specified in the above schedule, or who are rated entirely blank as to both capital <em>and </em>credit, or whose names are not printed in the designated mercantile agency book, shall be covered for goods shipped during the term of the attached bond, for an amount not exceeding the highest indebtedness such customer owed to the indemnified at one time, for goods shipped by the indemnified to such customer within 18 months prior to shipping the first item of the goods wholly or partly included in the account upon which the loss was incurred, not exceeding, however, the amount paid upon such highest indebtedness during said period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Annie Scheinberg\u2019s rating by the designated mercantile agency, during the period covered by the policy, was \u201c-4.\u201d This the trial court has found to be both a capital and credit rating, but that finding was clearly inadvertent, as appears by reference to a \u201cKey to Ratings\u201d read in evidence, from which it appears that such a rating as was given to Annie Scheinberg relates to credit only, and not to capital. Annie Scheinberg, therefore, during the period covered by the policy, was an \u201cold\u201d customer having a rating not included in the list of ratings included in Schedule A, and was rated only as to credit, and not as to capital. An indebtedness from her is not, therefore, covered by the letter of the contract, which limits defendant\u2019s liability as to old customers to those who (1) possess a rating embraced in Schedule A; or, failing that, (2) possess a capital <em>and </em>credit rating other than those contained in the list; or (3) are rated entirely blank as to both capital and credit; or (4) whose names are not printed in the designated mercantile agency book. It will be seen that none of these classes embraces a customer, like Annie Scheinberg, wiiose name was printed in the agency book, and who had a rating therein as to credit, but not as to capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The respondent urges, in support of the judgment, that any ambiguity in the terms of the contract must be resolved most favorably to the insured. Such is no doubt the accepted rule (Rickerson v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 149 N. Y. 307, 43 N. E. 856); but there is no room for its application here, since the language of the contract is entirely unambiguous. It is also urged the word \u201cor\u201d should be substituted for \u201cand\u201d in the description of persons whose debts are insured against, hereinbefore designated \u201c(2),\u201d so that the policy will be read so as to cover indebtedness owing from old customers possessing \u201ca capital <em>or </em>credit rating other than\u201d one of those contained in the list of ratings included in Schedule A. There are undoubtedly cases in which the courts, in order to carry into effect the evident intention of the parties, will substitute \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand,\u201d or vice versa; but there must be something in the context or elsewhere to clearly indicate what the intention of the parties was. Otherwise, to make such a change would be to make a new contract for the parties. We find nothing in the context, or in any other circumstances, to suggest that the parties intended to make any other contract than that which is indicated by the language which they used. That language clearly excludes the indebtedness of Annie Scheinberg from the protection of the policy, and, in so far as the judgment appealed from rests upon a claim for indemnity against her indebtedness, it is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The policy provides only for the payment of losses exceeding what is termed an \u201cinitial\u201d loss of $750. Since Annie Scheinberg\u2019s indebtedness, as we consider, is not covered by the policy, there remains only the claim upon the indebtedness of the Sanders Manufacturing Company, which is much less than the stipulated initial loss. It cannot, therefore, be recovered. This result necessitates a reversal of the judgment, and, as the essential facts cannot be changed upon a new trial, the complaint will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs to the appellant in this court and the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
