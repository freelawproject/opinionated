The defendant does not question the employment, and the evidence clearly establishes that the plaintiff did produce a party with whom the defendant entered into a contract for the exchange of properties ; but the learned trial court dismissed the complaint upon the merits, upon the theory that the plaintiff had failed to establish that Stephen Maguire was the attorney in fact of Annie Maguire in making the contract for the exchange of properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">We are of the opinion that the learned trial court erred in this determination. The defendant himself elected to accept the responsibility of entering into a contract with the person produced by the plaintiff, and in the absence of fraud, which is not alleged, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff had done all that his employment required of him. If the defendant was not satisfied with the party produced, he might, in good faith, have refused to&gt; contract; but, having decided to enter into a contract, he relieved the plaintiff of responsibility, and the latter is entitled to his compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
