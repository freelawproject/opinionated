Lyons v. Mulvihill, 128 N. Y. Supp. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It was, however, evidently the intent of the plaintiff to appeal from the judgment, and bring up for review the said order. This may be done. See section 311, Municipal Court Act. And the notice of appeal in this case may be so regarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The return from the judgment is not properly before this court, as it has not been settled and allowed by the trial justice, as required by section 318 of the Municipal Court act. It is only in cases of appealable orders that the settlement before the trial justice is not necessary. Guttenbergh v. Genovese, 131 N. Y. Supp. 612. And an order not appealable can only be reviewed upon an appeal from a judgment. The return must be sent back for settlement and allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Return remitted to the lower court, for settlement and allowance by the trial justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
