The civil service commission had put the position in the competitive class. The relator was a veteran. Application was made by the state commissioner to put these 60 agents in the noncompetitive class. This was refused by the civil service commission. The state commissioner now asserts that the position cannot be lawfully put in the competitive class, because an examination therefor is not practicable. For many years an examination has been had and special agents selected from a list furnished by the civil service commission. It is not suggested that this system has failed to provide competent and proper special agents. The appellant upon this appeal relies upon the case of People ex rel. Sweet v. Lyman, 157 N. Y. 368, 52 N. E. 132, as holding that an examination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>a special agent was impracticable, and therefore that the civil service commission was not authorized to put that office in the competitive class.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">As the law stood at that time, the preference given to honorably discharged soldiers and sailors in the civil service of the state was made not to apply \u201cto the position of private Secretary, or deputy of an official, or department, or to any other person holding a strictly confidential position.\u201d Laws 1896, c. 821, \u00a71.1 The same Legislature which passed that law provided for the appointment of these special agents of the excise department, and declared in the statute that they should be deemed confidential agents of the commissioner. Laws 1896, c. 112, \u00a7 10. That special provision of the statute was one of the grounds upon which the decision in Sweet v. Lyman proceeded. But since that time the civil service law has been ife-enacted, so that now a veteran\u2019s' right is not made to depend upon tlje question whether the position is a confidential one. Consol. Laws, 1909, c. <em>7. </em>Furthermore, under the excise law, as it stood in 1883, \u2022thejse special agents were given powers as representatives of the commissioner of excise. For instance, upon making affidavit before the district attorney of a county, the district attorney was required to prosecmte for penalties under section <em>37 </em>of chapter 112 of the Laws of 1896. They were thus left to decide whether it was proper that actions should be brought. This power has been taken away from them, and now they are simply to act under the direction of the state commissioner of excise. In view of these changes in the law, we do not deem the decision referred to as controlling upon this question, and under the decision of People ex rel. Merritt v. ICraft, 130 N. Y. Supp. 363, decijled at the May term of this court, we think that the determination of the civil service commission cannot be held to be so palpably erroneous as to authorize our interference therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The order should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
