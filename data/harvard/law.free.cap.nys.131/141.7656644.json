An appeal must be from . a judgment or order. Even the undertaking on appeal recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-21\">\u201cWhereas, on the twenty-first day of July, 1910, a decision was made and entered in the above-entitled action denying a motion of the defendants to open the default on the judgment heretofore entered, * * * and the said defendants feeling aggrieved thereby, and having appealed therefrom,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">The reasoning of the court in Starr v. Silverman, 25 Misc. Rep. 784, 55 N. Y. Supp. 611, is applicable to the present situation, and justifies a dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-23\">Upon the merits we are of the opinion that the defendants have failed to show any substantial reason for opening the default. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>plaintiff appears to have been entirely reasonable in granting extensions of time. The amended complaint, a copy of which must have been served with the moving papers (Stern v. Knapp, 52 N. Y. Super. Ct. 14), was regularly in the hands of the defendants, for the order provided that \u201csaid motion be granted and that the proposed amended complaint, filed herein, supersede the complaint already filed in this action,\u201d so that the suggestion of the fiefendants that they have never been served with the complaint in this action is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u25a0 [2] The rule is, where the amendment of a complaint is made by order of the court, that the order should direct that the proposed pleading should be served, or should stand as the new pleading in the case, and the party will be confined to the pleading proposed by his motion papers. 1 Rumsey\u2019s Practice, 367, and authority there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The rule requiring a copy of the proposed pleadings to be . served with the motion papers, supplemented by the order that the proposed amended complaint supersede the original complaint, is certainly sufficient service, and, the defendants not having shown any sufficient reason for granting a motion to open a default, the decision of the court below is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The appeal should be dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
