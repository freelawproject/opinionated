The note was payable at the Nassau Bank, of this city, was discounted by the plaintiff, and at maturity, not having been paid by the maker, was taken up by the' plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-17\">It is conclusively established by the evidence that the note was indorsed by defendant at the request of plaintiff, without consideration, and solely for the accommodation of the plaintiff. It further appears that the original note, of which the not\u00e9 in suit was a renewal, was given for a pre-existing debt. In order to constitute consideration for such a note, the holder must show that he has parted with something; that he has given up the original debt, or the right to sue upon it. \u201cThe taking of the debtor\u2019s note raises no presumption that it is in payment of the debt, and there was here no circumstance or suggestion that the plaintiff extended the time of payment, or did any other act which would have precluded him from surrendering the note and resorting to the original indebtedness.\u201d Roseman v. Mahony, 86 App. Div. 377, 83 N. Y. Supp. 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-18\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
