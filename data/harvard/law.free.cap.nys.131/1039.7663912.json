The defendant produced the affidavit of Walker stating that he would not testify as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-16\">To authorize the granting of a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, it must reasonably appear that such evidence would change the result of the former trial. It must be assumed that Walker would testify as stated in his affidavit. This being so, his evidence would not change the result of the former trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">The order must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-18\">BETTS, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
