Judgment for defendant, and plaintiff appeals. Reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b921-12\">The plaintiff appeals from an order <em>at </em>the Supreme Court, made at the Oswego Special Term and entered in the office of the clerk of the county of Madison, August 21, 1911, canceling and vacating a judgment for \u00a7324.77 entered in said clerk\u2019s office December 2, 1910, in favor of the plaintiff, and directing that the issues be brought to trial and tried in the manner prescribed for the trials of actions at law, \u201cand that neither party shall be prejudiced in reference thereto by reason of any of the prior proceedings herein.\u201d The action in which the order was made was commenced in September, 1909, to recover $225, the value of 30 steel rails, alleged to have been wrongfully taken and detained.by the defendant. The rails were a portion of a shipment of rails, of the value of $7,493.67, which had been delivered by its agent to the Otselic Valley Railroad Company. Upon the stipulation of His-cock, Doheny, Williams &amp; Cowie, attorneys of record for the defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the issues were brought to trial before Mr. Justice Coman, without a jury, June 1, 1910. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the hearing was adjourned to June 30, 1910. During the adjournment the attorneys for the parties had several conversations with reference to the action and the claim of the defendant for the rails, which had been delivered by its agent without collecting the value thereof, according to the terms of the sale. It appears by the affidavit upon which the order was granted that in the course of these conversations a suggestion' was made by the attorney for the plaintiff that the various questions in dispute between the parties to the action should be adjusted and settled and compromised, by permitting the plaintiff to take judgment for the amount claimed in the complaint, with costs, and that a claim should be filed with the plaintiff for the sum of $7,493.63, \u201cupon which there would ultimately be paid the dividend, which the general creditors of that company would receive; * * * that the advantages of this course to the parties, and the respective objections which suggested themselves to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and deponent, were talked over on different occasions, and as a result thereof deponent consented to such a disposition of the case and of said claimthat findings of fact and conclusions of law were prepared by the attorney for the plaintiff, submitted to deponent, and approved by him, after which the judgment in question was entered. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>also stated in the affidavit that this arrangement was made by the deponent without the knowledge or approval of the defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b922-3\">Argued before SMITH, P.

Denton v. Noyes, 6 Johns. 296, 5 Am. Dec. 237; Gaillard v. Smart, 6 Cow. 385; Palen v. Starr, 7 Hun, 422; Cox v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 63 N. Y. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We are also of the opinion that there is rio force-in the contention that a claim of the defendant for rails alleged to have been wrongfully delivered to the Otselic Valley Railroad Company was released or compromised by the arrangement or agreement of the attorneys. It is not alleged in the answer that the rails in Question were wrongfully delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s company, or because of a mutual mistake. No fact is stated in the moving papers from which the inference arises that the defendant had a right to retake the rails or recover possession of them. So far as appears, the 'defendant simply had a claim for the value of the rails delivered, and we can see nothing upon which to found the contention that it is barred, released, or invalidated by the judgment obtained by the plaintiff, or by any act done or consented to by the defendant\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion toj vacate the judgment denied, with $10 costs. All concur,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
