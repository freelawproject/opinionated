The petition referred to Belding as claiming the land prior to his occupancy, and stated that he, Flynn, had not \u201c recognized Belding as landlord since 'the- Supreme Court of the'United States decided the title to be in the United States.\u201d The plaintiffs, also, presented their petition to- the commission and claimed the right to purchase this lot from the government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">' The commission adjudged, December 8, 1877,-that Flynn was entitled to purchase the lot; and, subsequently, May 21, 1881, the United States issued a patent to him, based upon the judgment rendered by the commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">By deed of July 21, 18,84, Flynn (bis wife uniting with him), made a quitclaim deed of the premises to the appellant McDonald, -the recited consideration being $8500 cash in hand paid-to the' grantors-. This deed was duly acknowledged by Flynn August 2, 1884, and by Mrs. Flynn July, 28, 1884, and was filed for record in the proper office August 2, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">The present-suit'Was brought by Belding and wife, December 19, 1884, mor\u00e9Than seven'years after the adjudication - by the Hot Springs Commission in favor of Flynn, and more than three years after Flynn received the patent from the United States. It proceeds upon the ground that the commission committed an error of law in awarding the right to purchase this lot to Flynn rather than to them. The bill charged that Flynn <em>\u201c </em>has recently executed to the defendant Michael McDonald, without consideration, and for the purpose-of defrauding plaintiffs, a fraudulent- deed of conveyance purporting \u2022 foconvey said lot to him for eight thousand five hundred dollars, when, in fact, nothing, was paid by him for it; that defendant knew at the time of the.making of said.deed, and of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>pretended purchase of the tenancy of the said Flynn as aforesaid, and of the rights of the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">The relief asked was an accounting with reference to rents, and a decree adjudging the deed to McDonald' to be fraudulent and void, and declaring the lot to be held in trust for plaintiffs, or for plaintiff George Belding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">Flynn, in his answer, met all the material allegations of the bill. He alleged that the plaintiffs never sought to disturb the award of the commission until the bringing of this suit, \u201c up to which time plaintiffs, and especially plaintiff.George Belding had asserted and insisted that the said award and all other awards of the qommission were right and ought not to be disturbed; that, on the 21st day of July, 1884, this defendant, believing he had a clear title to said lot, sold it to the defendant McDonald as aforesaid, and executed to him a quitclaim deed therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">McDonald, in his answer, said: \u201cHe knows nothing of the lease alleged to have been executed between plaintiffs and his co-def\u00e9ndant Frank Flynn, nor of the alleged relation of landlord and tenant between them, nor of the alleged proceedings before said commissioners, but that if said relation ever did exist it was dissolved in June, 1876, by the United States, through their receiver taking possession of said land under paramount title; that defendant Flynn had then valuable improvements upon said lot, which he could not lawfully remove, and to avoid losing them filed a petition before said commissioners setting forth that fact and praying them to' award the preference right to purchase it from the Unite^l States; that he supported said petition by evidence, and that said commissioners awarded said right to him, and that he after-wards purchased said lot from the United States, and on the 21st day of May, 1881, obtained a patent for it, a copy of which is annexed hereto and made part of this answer as Exhibit A; that on the 21st day of July,-1884, this defendant, finding the title to said lot to be in said defendant Flynn and knowing nothing whatever of plaintiff\u2019s alleged claim to it, bought it. from him for the sum of eighty-five hundred dollars ($8500) in cash, and obtained from him a quitclaim deed thereto; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>never heard of any claim of plaintiffs until he made said purchase and paid said money; that plaintiffs never until since said purchase sued for said lot or put any claim of record; that said deed and sale to this defendant were not made without consideration 'nor to defraud plaintiffs, but are made in good faith.\u201d The defendant annexed to and- made part of his-answer a copy of the deed to him from Flynn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">By an interlocutory decree it was declared that the Commission by error and mistake of law, awarded to Flynn the right to purchase the lot in question, and that the title, interest, and estate of the several defendants should be transferred to and-vested in the plaintiffs. The cause was thereupon referred to a special master for report as to rents,, taxes and improvements. By the final decree, the relief asked by the bill was given.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-6\"><em>Mr. John McGlure </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-7\"><em>Mr. B.

It denies notice of the claim of the plaintiff until after payment of the purchase-money, but does not deny notice until after the making of the deed to defendant. This \u25a0 defect is necessarily fatal. <em>Byers </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>12 Arkansas, 218, <em>286; Miller </em>v. <em>Fraley, </em>21 Arkansas, 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-9\">The case of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fraley, </em>23 Arkansas, 738, is not against us. The deed in that case was not a quitclaim deed. The court said: \u201c The deed in question is in the usual form of. an absolute conveyance in fee, <em>with a special warranty against: a/rwy claim made or suffered ly the </em>vendor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-10\">If such a warranty had been made in this case, of course it would have been broken. The question as to a quitclaim deed did not .arise in that case and was not passed upon. The exact point was raised in <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>50 Arkansas, 322, and was then decided as it has been decided by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>court. In speaking of a quitclaim deed in that case, the court said : \u201c It was at least sufficient to have put appellants on inquiry, which, if they had prosecuted with ordinary diligence, would, doubtless, have led to actual notice of the facts as shown by the evidence in this case ; but they prosecuted no inquiry, and it follows that they are not <em>Iona-fide </em>purchasers without notice.\u201d This covers the whole ground. The rent of the house on the ground was not the sole criterion of the value of the rents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-4\">We submit that the evidence fully sustains the finding of the master and the decree of the court below.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b518-5\">Mr. Justice Harlan,</author>\n<p id=\"ASZ\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">According to the evidence in the cause, McDonald paid in cash the full consideration recited in the deed from Flynn,. without actual notice of any claim to the property by the plaintiffs, or either of them. Did he have such constructive notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as deprived 'him of the right to be regarded as a <em>tona fide </em>purchaser for value ? . It is said that in Ai\u2019kansas no one can be deemed an innocent purchaser if he holds under a quitclaim deed. In that State, \u201ca quitclaim deed is a substantive mode of conveyance, and is as effectual to convey all the right, title, interest, claim and estate of the' grantor as a deed with full covenants, although the grantee has no possession of or prior interest in the. land,\u201d and it is not necessary that a vendee hqjd \u201c under a deed with general covenants of warranty to entitle him to protection as an innocent purchaser; \u201d although, where \u201c a person bargains for and takes a mere quitclaim deed, or deed without warranty, it is a circumstance, if unexplained, to show that he had notice of imperfections in the vendor\u2019s title, and only purchased such interest as the vendor might have in the property.\u201d <em>Bagley </em>v. Fletcher, 44 Arkansas, 153, 160; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fraley, </em>23 Arkansas, 735, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Summers, </em>50 Arkansas, 322, 327, 328, the court, after referring to the fact that a deed recited a consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>eration of only five dollars .for real estate which, had cost six .thousand dollars,.said: \u201cAdd to this fact that the conveyance executed was a quitclaim deed, and the conclusion that Mrs. Saunders did not acquire a good and valid title, in the absence of an explanation, would be irresistible. It was, at least, sufficient to have put appellants on inquiry, which, if they had prosecuted with ordinary diligence, would, doubtless, have led to actual notice of the facts as shown by the evidence in this case. But they prosecuted no inquiry; and it follows that they are not <em>bona fide </em>purchasers without notice.\u201d .In the same case it was said that a person purchasing an interest in lands \u201c takes with constructive notice of whatever appears in the conveyances constituting his chain of title; \u201d and that if .anything appeared in such conveyances, sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry, it was his duty to make the inquiry, and he would be charged by the law with' the actual notice he would have received if he had made it. These <em>&amp; sen </em>fall far short of sustaining the broad contention - of the plaintiffs in respect to quitclaim deeds. On the contrary, they show that, in Arkansas, one <em>ma/y </em>become entitled to protection as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value, although holding under a deed of that kind. Applying the principles of those cases to the present case, we are of opinion that McDonald is entitled to protection as an- innocent purchaser. The deed that he accepted was not drawn as a quitclaim deed pursuant to any specific direction-given by him. So far as the evidence discloses, the amount paid by him was the full value of the property. - If he had, before purchasing, instituted\u2019 an inquiry as to the title, so far as it was shown by the record of deeds, he would not have found any title of record in the plaintiffs. But he would have found that Flynn held under a patent from the United States based upon a claim established in favor of the patentee, under the acts of Congress relatitig to the Hot Springs reservation. It is true that if he had caused the proceedings of the Hot Springs Commission to be examined he would have seen that Belding contested, with Flynn, before that tribunal, the right to purchase' the lot here in dispute. But he would, also, have learned that Flynn\u2019s right was reoog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>nized by the Commission, and, from the records of the courts, state and Federal, he would have learned that more than seven years had then elapsed without legal proceedings, upon the part of the plaintiffs, questioning the correctness or validity of the judgment by that tribunal in favor of Flynn. He might well have supposed that Belding had acquiesced in that judgment. Under all the circumstances, it cannot be held that McDonald, although taking a quitclaim deed, was chargeable, when he purchased, with notice of any existing claim to \u25a0the property upon the part of the plaintiffs, or of either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">It is contended that the answer of McDonald does not support the defence of being an innocent purchaser, in that, while denying notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim at the time of the payment of the purchase money, it- did not deny that he had such notice at the time of the deli-very of the deed to him. This position is supposed to be sustained by <em>Byers </em>v. McDonald, 12 Arkansas, 218, 286, <em>and </em>Miller v. Fraley, 21 Arkansas, 22. In the first of those cases, the court, observing that the protection of a <em>bona fide </em>purchase is necessary only when the plaintiff has a prior equity which cannot be barred or avoided except by the union of the legal title with an equity arising from the payment of the money and receiving a conveyance without notice, and with a clear conscience, said: \u201c Notice must be denied previous to and down to the time of paying the money and the delivery of the deed.\u201d In. the other case, the language of the court was: <em>\u201c </em>The answer of Greenwood &amp; Co. should have positively denied notice of the fraud down- to the time of paying the consideration and receiving the deed.\u201d The general rule announced in those cases applies where the payment of the consideration and the acceptance of a deed by the purchaser occur at different times. In such cases, the denial of notice,- in order to support a claim to protection as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, must relate both to the time when the deed is delivered, and to that when the consideration was paid. But, where it appears upon the face of the answer that the purchase for a certain price and the delivery of the deed were at the same time, and as parts of one transaction, the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>notice until the defendant had made the purchase is equivalent to a denial of notice at the delivery of the deed. McDonald\u2019s answer denies every circumstance s\u00e9t forth in the bill from which notice could be inferred. He expressly alleges in his answer that he never heard of any claim of the plaintiffs until he had made the purchase and paid in cash the sum of $8500 for the property. And in his deposition he distinctly states that he first knew of the' plaintiffs\u2019 claim when he received notice of this suit. His evidence is \u2018not contradicted by anything in the record. This is a substantial compliance with the rule announced in the cases last cited.</p>\n<p id=\"AiBW\">It is proper to say that ,the present case is unlike <em>Rector </em>v. <em>Gibbon, </em>111 U. S. 276. That case did not present any.question in respect to the rights of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value from the person to whom the- Hot ..Springs Commission accorded the right to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\"><em>The decree is reversed, with directions to dismiss the </em>bill.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
