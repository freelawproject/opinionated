Smith, and since said award, said defendant has purchased said lot from the United States and received a patent therefor, and on-account of said misconstrue-' tion of the law as applied to the facts before said commission the right to purchase said lot, which in law, equity and good conscience should have been awarded to plaintiffs, was by said misconstruction of the law illegally and wrongfully awarded to defendant George H.

The question of those titles was before this court in <em>The Hot Springs Cases, </em>92 U. S. 698; <em>Rector </em>v. <em>Gibbon, </em>111 U. S. 276; and <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Rector, </em>137 U. S. 179. I contend <em>Rector </em>v. <em>Gibbon </em>does not furnish a rule of decision for these cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">At the threshold, I am willing to admit, if the court had. the power to decide anything in the Rector-Gibbon case at all, it is' decided correctly. While I admit the case was decided correctly, I do not assent to the proposition that this or any other court could divest title out of one in whose favor the award was made, and vest it' in another, even if the decision of thn commission was wrong. That case turned on the construction of a lease, and it no more follows that one lease is to be construed like another, than that one contract means what another does.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axv\">The lease in the Rector-Gibbon case stipulates that at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>end of the term the lessor should have the right to take the improvements by paying two-thirds of their first cost; that if the lessor should not pay this amount at the end of the term, the lease should be extended on the same conditions, until he should make the payments, giving ninety days\u2019 notice of his intention to terminate the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">The proof was, that Rector gave the notice, that he was ready and willing to pay, but he c\u00f3uld never get the lessees to give or name the amount. /</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">The leases, in the cases at bar, declare that they may \u201c be renewed, from year to year, until the title to the Hot Springs quarter section is settled, . . . and that all buildings and \u00a1improvements that may be erected' on said lots by the lessees, may be removed therefrom by the lessees, at any time within thirty days after the expiration of the .same.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">In the Rector-Gibbon case, the improvement became the property of the lessor by the election a-nd 'be terms of the contract. In the cases at bar,' the buildings were to remain the property of the lessees without any stipulation for purchase by the lessor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-9\">In the Rector-Gibbon case, the court found that Rector was the pwner of the improvement and gave him the lot. In the cases at bar, the court finds, as did the commission, that the buildings belong, not to the lessor, but to the lessees. In one case, the'right to purchase the lot falls' to him who was the rightful owner of the improvement, and in the cases at bar, the person who is found to be the owner of the improvement is declared to be a trustee for one who did not make or own. the improvement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-10\">In the one case the lease created a contract whereby the lessee undertook to build a house for the lessor, while in the case now under consideration the. contract was that the lessee might build a house for himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-11\">The questions discussed in the Rector-Gibbon case were as to the nature of the grant cont\u00e1ined in the act of 1877; to whom it \u2022'was made, and whether the decisions ox the commissioners were final.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-12\">Four of the judges of this court were of the'opinion th\u00ed ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the award of the commissioners was final, expressing no opinion as to the nature of the -grant., and five were of the opinion that it was not, and that, for errors of law, its decisions might be reviewed. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-5\">Congress, during the pendency of the bill, now known as the act of 1877, refused to allow an amendment to be made to the bill, granting the courts jurisdiction to review the awards of the commissioners; and after the awards were made, it was again appealed to, to allow the courts to review the awards, and it again refused. Congress was asked to amend the act of 1877, during its pendency, to make. it. mean what the court, in <em>Rector </em>v. <em>Gibbon </em>said it meant, and it refused to allow the words the court placed in the act of 1877 to become a part of it, because it changed the grant from the persons on whom they intended to bestow the bounty, and conferred it on persons who had asserted title, instead of those who had made improvements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">I am not influenced to indulge in this line of argument, from the fact that the personel of the court has changed since the decision ip the Rector-Gib bon case, for I shall not indulge in argument that I would not have indulged in, if the personel of the court had remained the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">I am not here to make a wanton attack on the Rector-Gibbon case, nor to disturb matters set at rest by that decision, but to protect the interests of clients,-by calling,; in a respectful manner, the attention Of the court to some-matters that were not called to its attention before, with a feeling of confidence, if they had been, the decision might have been different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-8\">The fact that neither Rector nor Gibbon could acquire title under the act of 1877, and that no claimant' at Hot Springs acquired title under the act of 1877, does not seem to have been called to the attention of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">The fact that Congress, by the act entitled, \u201cAn act for the establishment of titles in Hot Springs, and for other purpose's,\u201d approved June 16, 1880, by direct enactment, authorized these appellants to purchase the lots in controversy, seems to have been overlooked in the Rector-Gibbon case. The first section of the act to which I allude is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cThat any person, his heirs or legal representatives, in whose favor the commissioners appointed under the acts of Congress of 1877 and 1878, relative to the Hot Springs of Arkansas, have adjudicated, shall have' the sole right to enter and pay for the amount of land the commissioners may have adjudged him entitled to purchase, within eighteen months next after the expiration of the notice required ... at 40 per centum of the assessed value of said lands as placed thereon by said commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-5\">All titles at Hot Springs are based on the act of June 16., 1880, and not on the act of 1877. \u2022 The difference between these acts is, that under the act of-1880, the right to purchase the lot comes, by a declaration of Congress, and that the persons in whose favor the commissioners have adjudicated shall have the sole right to purchase, while under the other the right to purchase comes from the award of the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-6\">It is true that the commissioners have adjudicated that certain persons should have the right to purchase the lots in controversy, but it is also true that, after that adjudication, Congress took the whole question, of awards under consideration, and by a direct and express enactment declared the appellants should have the sole right to purchase. The question now is, not whether the court can review the awards of the commissioners, but whether it can review and set aside the award of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b171-7\">If the language of the opinion in the Hector-Gibbon case be read in the light of the facts disclosed by the record, it furnishes no rule of decision for the cases now before the court. But if you take an isolated sentence like this: \u201c Whatever the lessees and those under them did, by way of improvements on the leased premises, inured to the lessor\u2019s benefit as absolutely and effectually as though done by himself,\u201d and apply it to a case where the improvements, under the lease, were to remain the property of the lessees, you establish a rule of decision that violates the obligation of the contract and takes the property of one man away from him and gives it to another. You turn the act of 1877 into an act of confiscation, instead of that of preemption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>, If the leases, in the cases now under consideration, had a similar provisiomto that exhibited in the Hector-Gibbon case, there, are many expressions of opinion to be found that would apply to the cases at bar, but there is no such lease. I have a right to assume, and shall assume, that the court intended its language to be confined to the case made by the record, and was not attempting to fix a rule of decision in cases not before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-4\">It is said in the opinion that, \u201c lessees under a claimant or occupant\u2019holding the property for him and bound by their stipulation to surrender it on the termination of their lease, stand in no position to claim an adverse and paramount right to purchase. Their possession is his possession.\u201d If this sentence \u25a0 be taken as an interpretation of the act, without reference to the facts disclosed by the record, in which the language was used, the appellees could draw some comfort from it; but confine it to a case where the lease gave the improvements to the lessor, and where the right to purchase the lot followed the ownership of the improvements, it furnishes no rule of decision in a case where one claims the lot and where it is adjudged the improvements do not belong, to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-5\">When the court makes use of- the expression, \u201c holding the property for him,\u201d the word property is used in its broad sense, covering the improvements as well as the. lot. It is not\u2019 used in its narrower sense and confined to the lot itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-6\">After the 24th of April, 1876, there was no such thing as holding the property for the old claimant, unless the old claimant was the legal or equitable owner of the improvements on the lot. The relation of landlord and tenant was on \u25a0that day dissolved by the terms' of the contract. The title to the property on that day was in the United States, and it soon thereafter took possession by its receiverand to say that the old tenants of Gaines \u201cheld possession for him,\u201d while they were attorning to and paying rent to the United States, is to extend the relation of landlord and tenant beyond the confines of known law. Nor is it true, as a proposition of law, that a former tenant could not acquire title from the new landlord. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Before the 24th of April, 1876, there were two estates; the fee and the leasehold. On that day the fee was declared to be in the United States. On the leasehold were improvements Avhich the lessees, under their lease,-had the right to remove, but being fixtures they could not- be removed without the assent of the new landlord. If the buildings on the lots had belonged to the lessor, and the old tenant remained in them, I concede that after the passage of the act of 1877, the commissioners should have treated the occupant in the light of one holding over. Not because the relation of landlord and tenant existed during that period, but becatise the right to purchase the lots was aAvarded to the former, owner of the improvement. The right to the lot, as well as the improvement, had been lost. Congress granted the improvement to the- former owner, regardless of past relations. ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-5\">In the case where the improvement belonged to the lessor, it conferred on him the right to purchase the ground on which the improvement had been made. But if the improvement belonged to another -than the lessor, the right to purchase went to him who owned it on the, 24th of April, 1876. The right to purchase flows from and is bottomed on an improvement. No improvement, no lot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-6\">The contention of the appellee is, that the possession which the appellant had, of his own house, -was the possession of the appellees; that that possession was under a lease from him, and that whatever a donor should eleet to present, of right, must go to the landlord. The bald, naked claim is, that, having accepted a lease the term of which expired, the new landlord could not make a present- to his- old tenant, or give him a right to purchase the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-7\">The appellee could not avail himself of an' improvement made by another unless he was the \u00d3Avner of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b173-8\">To give the lots in controversy to Gaines is to give them to one.who, the court finds, as a matter of fact, never made any improvement thereon. To give them to Gaines under such a finding, is to disregard the letter and spirit of the statute. To give them to Gaines, is to take from appellants that which the Congress of the United States, by a solemn act, declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>they should have. \u2022 To give them to Gaines, is to say that the courts and not Congress have the sole right to dispose of the public domain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-4\">. It is apparent, from the language of the act of 1877, that Congress intended that the adjudications of the commissioners should be final, and that this intent is made manifest from following the form of statutes that this court, for more than a quarter of a century, had declared created a board belonging to the. political department of the government, and whose adjudications could not be reviewed by the courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-5\"><em>Mr. Thomas B.

S. 139, \u201cthat nothing was developed in answer or testimony to disturb the conclusions of law heretofore reached by this court.\u201d The argument for appellants has been elaborate and exhaustive, but does not convince us that these cases can be taken out of the rule laid down in <em>Rector </em>v. <em>Gibbon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The estoppel which prevents a tenant who has acquired possession as such from claiming titlp adversely to his landlord, does not depend on the validity of his landlord\u2019s title. And the assertion in the bills that the right to remove the buildings put upon' the lots by the tenants was abandoned, and the fact that, while appellees made improvements upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the land claimed by them, they were not shown to have made such on the specific lots, do not affect the operation of the estoppel. Belding\u2019s heirs claimed under a paper title, and if there, had been no 'tenants, the improvements made by themselves would have given them the \u201c possessory right of occupation of the tract within the meaning of the act of Congress; and the tenants cannot be allowed to object that the improvements which they made, and which, strictly speaking, they abandoned by their conduct in the premises, gave them rights superior to their landlord,</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The decision of this court in -92 U. S. 698 was rendered April 24, 1876, and the receiver was appointed and took possession of the property, for the United States in June of that year. The act of March 3, 1877, <em>\u201c </em>in relation to the Hot Springs reservation in the State o(f Arkansas,\u201d. (19 Stat. 377,) creating the commission, provided that \u201c no claim shall be considered which has accrued since the twenty-fourth day of April, eighteen hundred and seventy-six,\u201d and referred to claims to the land, or parts thereof, then existing, and not to independent claims acquired thereafter. But there is no merit in the suggestion that George, Henry, and Albert Belding could not lawfully assign their interest in the Belding claim to Gaines after that date, for the language of the act relates to claims that had then accrued, and not to the subsequent acquisition of claims so \u2022situated. It may be that after the titl\u00e9 was adjudged ,to be in the United States the tenants could not remove the buildings; but the commissioners found that the buildings belonged to them, and the decrees here <em>gave </em>the value of them to appellants. No appeal was prayed by appellees' in this regard and no question arises in respect of it. Inasmuch as the tenants set up claims to the lots in hostility to the leases, they cannot complain of decrees in \u25a0 their favor for the value, and whether under some of the leases the buildings were to become the property of the lessor, while in other cases they might have remained the property of the lessees, does not control the principle upon which <em>Rector </em>v. <em>Gibbon </em>rests. As to the contention that the act of Congress of June 16, 1880, (21 Stat. 288,) was not given due weight because not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>referred to in the opinion in <em>Rector </em>v. Gibbon, it is to be observed that that suit was brought July 12, 1880, argued here March 19, 1884, and decided April 7, 1884. It is not, therefore, to be. assumed that the act of 1880 was overlooked at that time, but that the court was of opinion that it did not affect the questions under consideration; and in that view we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\"We are not satisfied; however; with the directions to the master in the interlocutory decrees, in respect of the accounting, and with the results thereupon finally adjudged. While, by reason of the original leases, appellants must be decreed to hold the several parcels in controversy in trust for appellees, and to surrender possession thereof, yet it is to be borne in mind that they were not knavish or fraudulent possessors, and that they claimed title, in moral good faith, under the awards of the commission. The evidence disclosed that a large number of lot's were awarded to appellees ; that Gaines expressed himself as contented with the awards, stating that they were just and equitable; and that no steps in further litigation were taken, on appellees\u2019 behalf, until after the announcement of the decision of this court in <em>Rector </em>v. Gibbon, which was on April 7, 1884, when (in May following) these bills were filed. In the meantime appellants had paid the government, and obtained patents, under the awards in their favor, and had remained in possession upon the belief that their title was good, seeking no other location, making no other arrangements, and acting in expenditure as if these lots were their own. While this acquiescence on appellees\u2019 part has not taken away their right of action to recover the property, we think it operates upon the right to' equitable relief, in the matter of permitting a recovery, by way of accounting, which they have themselves applied for to a court of equity, for the period of time from the date of the awards to the date of the filing of these bills. Appellees permitted appellants to go on in the exercise of ownership over the property, not only unmolested and without question, but with affirmative encouragement to them to do so, and, under the peculiar circumstances which characterize these cases, we do not feel compelled to award a measure of relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u25a0which, in our judgment, would operate harshly and oppres-. siv\u00e9ly upon appellants, even though specific' prejudice, because of appellees\u2019 laches, may not be clearly made out upon these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In seeking equity, appellees must do equity, and as a result has been reached which gives the awards of the commission a direction contrary to that which app\u00e9ll\u00e9es had accepted as substantially equitable, we think equity requires that they should not be treated as occupying the same position as if they had maintained with vigor and promptness the rights which they found on April 7, 1884, they could assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In No. 227, <em>Goode </em>v. Gaines, considerable stress is laid by counsel upon evidence which it is urged makes out an estoppel against appellees as to the title, but we agree with the Circuit Court that it falls short of doing so, and this case must be disposed of in the same way as the others.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">We are of opinion that the accounting between the parties should be stated both as to debit and credit from the 23d of May, 1884, with the exception of the credit for the amounts paid to the government for the lots, of which payments we regard appellees as getting the entire benefit, and that no increased rent should be allowed on account of the improvements, as appellees are only to be held to their value as of the date of the decrees. In other words, appellants should be charged with rental value from the date of the filing of the bills to the rendition of the decrees, with interest, and should be credited with taxes, etc., paid .after -the date of the filing of the bills, with interest, and also with the amounts paid the government for the different parcels,, with interest from the dates of payment, as well as with the value of the improvements, in each instance, at the time of the rendition of the decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\n<em>The decrees are severally reversed, and the causes remanded to the Circuit Court,with a direction for -further proceedings in conformity with this opinion, the costs in this court to ~be equally divided.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
