It charged fraud, misappropriation of money and mismanagement on the part of O.; that he had vilified and traduced them, for which they reserved their right of action, and it prayed (1) for a receiver; (2) that the $15,000 capital so contributed should be paid into court; (3) for an injunction restraining \u00d3. from using the partnership name, etc.; (4) for a dissolution. The cause was referred to a master to take proof and report. The master found that there had been violations of the partnership agreement by the plaintiffs in not paying up their contributions to the capital at the times agreed upon and by O. in various ways set forth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>but that these had been condoned in November, 1884, the plaintiffs paying up their capital in full; that the partnership.therefore was to be regarded-as continuing uninterruptedly from July 1, 1884, to February 2, 1885, when 0. was called to answer wi the state court the suit of his co-partners for its dissolution, from which time it was to be regarded as dissolved; and that the plaintiffs had incurred expenses on behalf of the firm amounting to $2538.52. On the- coming in of this report, it appearing that R. had assigned all his interest in the suit to S., the. court decreed that S. for himself, and as subrogee of R., recover from O. $10,000, with interest; that in other respects the report be confirmed; and \u201c that the complainants\u2019 bill of complaint be dismissed without prejudice to their right in some other form of action, as they may be advised, to prosecute the matter of defamation of character set forth in the bill of complaint.\u201d <em>'Held,</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-5\">(1) That equity has jurisdiction, where a person has been induced, by fraudulent representations, to enter into a partnership, to rescind the contract at his instance, and put an end to it <em>ab initio ;</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-7\">(2) That if the case, upon the evidence, did not entitle complainants to a return of their capital, and to be placed in the same situation, as far as practicable, as if they had never entered into the partnership, but did authorize the ordinary decree for a dissolution and accounting, relief could be awarded in the latter aspect, even though the bill were not framed with precision, in the alternative, for a cancellation or for a dissolution and accounting; and that if 'the-specific prayer were insufficient, such a decree could be main-1 tained under the prayer for general relief, since it would be conformable to the case made by the bill ;</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b601-9\">(3) That the Circuit Court did not err in rendering a decree at variance with the conclusions of the master <em>(Kimberly </em>v. <em>Arms, </em>129 U.

It was further averred that on' October Y, 1884; defendant, in violation of the contract of copartnership, \u201c (and with malice, without caus\u00e9, probable or otherwise, and in bad faith, for which orators reserve - their action for dam-' ages,) \u201d after said contracts had been made in good faith for the firm and before any partnership assets or capital had been used, wrote to various parties in Italy that all contracts made for the firm should enure to hxs private benefit, and he would not recognize(his firm therein; that Oteri had- refused to make. or cause to be made, as the general manager of the affairs of the firm, monthly trial balances \u00e1s agreed upon; notwithstanding complainants\u2019 demand; that defendant had vilified and traduced their character and injured their -credit and business reputation, and refused to carry out contracts for the firm, made with his knowledge and consent; that he held in his hands complainants\u2019 money amounting to $10,000, and refused to return the same, although duly demanded; and that \u201cthey are entitled to be refunded their said capital with legal interest from the 24th day of June, 1884.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">The bill further alleged that, apart from the acts of the defendant in refusing various consignments made to the firm under their contracts in Europe, -they were not aware until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>a short time since of his fraudulent act in declining and refusing to carry on the contract of copartnership. Complainants further set up misconduct as to a cargo, in respect of which defendant declined.to attend to the interests of the firm, and involved complainants-in loss and damage to the consignors in a large sum, as they were obliged to protect \u25a0the consignment and save themselves from further loss, the proceeds being paid over to Oteri for the benefit of the consignor. Complainants charged that they were ignorant as to the partnership affairs; that defendant declined to give any knowledge of or concerning the same; that defendant had converted the funds of complainants to his own use, and had not held the same to the credit of the partnership ; and that the capital should be deemed to be. taken as a part of the assets of the partnership liable to the claims of the creditors thereof, if any existed, or be refunded to complainants with interest, if there were no creditors. Complainants then prayed as follows: \u201c1.

This report dealt only with the questions relating to the partnership, those arising in reference to damages for defamation of character having been reserved. He found that some time after the formation of the partnership, Oteri, Scalzo, Di- Christina, and their bookkeeper, Terni, went to Europe in the- business interests of the firm; and that the charge made in the cash book of the firm of $2538.32 for the expenses of the trip, which complainants contended was an overcharge, was correct and should be allowed : that at the time of the departure for Europe, Scalzo had paid into the capital $2000, and Eandazzo and Di Christina $2500: \u201c 3.

If the specific prayer were insufficient, such a decree could be maintained under the prayer for general relief,, since it would be conformable to the case made by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">It is argued that the Circuit Court erred in the rendition of a decree at variance with the conclusions of the master, because the reference was by consent, and the report amounted to a determination by the parties\u2019 own tribunal, -which could not be disregarded at the mere discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In <em>Kimberly </em>v. <em>Arms, </em>129 U.

Its findings, like those of an independent tribunal, are'to be taken as presumptively correct, subject, indeed, to be reviewed under the reservation contained in the consent and -order of the -court, when ..there has been manifest error in'-the consideration given to the evidence, or'fn the application of the law, but not otherwise.\u201d But here the case was referred to the master <em>\u201c </em>to pass upon the accounts herein and to report thereon,\u201d and while the master considered the- whole case, apparently without objection, we do hot regard the rule laid down in <em>Kimberly </em>v. <em>Arms </em>as applicable. The question whether the' partnership should be \u2022 held void from its inception was ' not submitted, <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>127 Mass. 167, nor whether oh other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>grounds the whole capital should be returned. If the decree had been in accordance with the conclusions of the; master, such concurrent action would indeed have been of wellnigh controlling' effect. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Neal, 144 </em>U. S. 585. But there was no' such concurrence. The Circuit Court decreed the return of complainants\u2019 capital less two-thirds of the amount expended on the European trip in the interest of the partnership, and the decree was evidently based upon the view that defendant had been guilty of such fraud or misconduct or violation of partnership obligations as justified the relief accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">The evidence tended to show that proper books of account Avere not kept, and that monthly trial balances were not furnished, and there is some evidence that towards the last defendant refused complainants access to the books and papers of the firm, but' this' is denied,, and the controversy seems to relate to a letter-book.. By the partnership articles, Oteri was' to have exclusive control and direction of the company\u2019s affairs. He was not himself conversant with the keeping of books, and Terni, who had the confidence of all parties, was entrusted Avith the duty of doing so, and it is a fair inference that Oteri. did not question the right, of his partners to examine the books' and papers, but only demanded a receipt from them- for whatever book or paper they wished to take aAvay for examination. It is also objected that Oteri -did not furnisi. his quota to the capital. He was, however, confessedly responsible, and, as the manager, all the firm\u2019s money belonged in his possession, and the record indicates that he raised large amounts upon his own collaterals for - the benefit of the business. His accounts cover the entire capital, the proper proportion being credited to each partner. Whether he' technically deposited Avith himself $5000 is not especially material. At all events, we find no adequate support to the conclusion that the complainants suffered -any loss by reason of the alleged -dereliction of duty in these regards, and w\u00e9 \u25a0 do not think that of themtselves they furnish sufficient ground for decreeing that complainants are entitled to the return of their capital, within the principle \u00f3f th.e rule which has sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>been applied in suck cases. The real gist of the controversy, in this view,'lies in the conduct of Oteri after his return from Sicily. It appeared that early in October, 1884, he wrote to European correspondents that the business would be continued in his name;' that he had dissolved the partnership ; that he had decided to withdraw; that -he was awaiting the arri-' val of Scalzo in order to withdraw; and as reasons for these announcements assigned having learned that one of his partners did not have a good reputation, and-that the capital had not been paid in in full, as was indeed the fact. But it also appeared that the firm continued to do business, and that on the 14th of November, 1884, letters were written that the'capital had been paid in; that-the business would go on under-the firm name ; and that all had been arranged, etc. These letters were- written by Terni, the bookkeeper, and by Di Christina, one of the partners, and perhaps by others, for Oteri, who, 'as we understand, could neither read nor write Italian. Exactly when the balance of capital to be paid by Scalzo and Bandazzo and Di Christina was made up is not clear, but Bandazzo testifies that he paid in the balance of his share in Novemberj and Scalzo seems to have done so at about that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">,. Without discussing the evidence in detail, we think the master was correct in holding that the, preponderance of evidence was to the effect that Oteri\u2019s action early in October, in regard to continuing the business in his own name, was condoned, and the difficulties between the partners adjusted for the time being. And whatever business had been transacted in his individual name was treated as if there had been no interruption. -It may be that complainants were ignorant of Oteri\u2019s action in sending the October letters, but they can hardly be permitted to say that they did not know how the business was being conducted, particularly in view of the fact that Di Christina was employed in the business and allowed by the contract two' per cent as extra compensation for services. Scalzo resided in St. Louis, and Bandazzo was. unable to read or write; but, nevertheless, through their own observations, and certainly through Di Christina,'they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ought to have had knowledge of what was going on. It is said that' Di Christina was young and not of strong mind and easily influenced, hut there is no issue of that kind made in the pleadings, and we are not satisfied with that excuse for ignorance. Upon the whole' record, we regard the case as one for an accounting rather than necessarily for <em>a </em>return of capital. No fraudulent representations as inducements to the formation of the partnership are alleged to. have been made, and whatever objectionable features may have characterized Oteri\u2019s conduct and management, a scheme to defraud his copartners is not shown to have existed. In the absence of satisfactory [proof that losses were occasioned by his misconduct or .that the want of success which attended the business is traceable to that cause,- complainants should-not be reinstated at his expense in the same position as if they had not entered upon an enterprise which turned out tQ.be unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\"We cannot, however, accept the correctness of the exhibits attached to the answer as so far made out as to justify us in ordering a decree to \u2022 be entered in accordance therewith. The books consisted of the originals and a new set made from the originals, which seemed in themselves to be practically unintelligible, and the results set forth in the exhibits were arrived at by a friend of the partners, assisted by an accountant.' But the new books were made up, the balances struck, and the statements prepared upon the basis of explanations made by Oteri, and we are unwilling to proceed upon these results in the absence of a specific disposition of them by the Circuit Court. Amounts are charged against Soalzo, and Eandazzo and Di- Christina, the receipt of' which they deny, and which appear to require further investigation as to- their accuracy; and.so' as to the indebtedness of one Zuecas, for which, it is contended on'one side and denied on the other, that 'Oteri'ought to be held responsible under the circumstances. We think the item of $2538.32 was properly allowed, and that it needs no. further, consideration. We find in the record tha\u00a1t a motion was made for an order on Oteri to pay the cash on hand into court, but we are not informed whether such an' order was entered and complied with. No reason is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>perceived why this should not have been done, nor, indeed, why Soalzo and Randazzo and Di Christina should not have received the amounts which Oteri conceded belonged to them. In a further accounting the question of interest on this money; if it has remained in Oteri\u2019s hands, will present itself for adjustment. <em>Gridley </em>v. Conner, 2 La. Ann. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We are of opinion that the partnership continued until February 2, 1885, when, it is agreed, complainants filed a bill for dissolution in the state court, (which we assume has been disposed of,) and should be dissolved'as of that dat\u00e9;- and that an accounting should be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\n<em>The decree is reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opi/nion.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
