Taylor, for an improvement in trunks. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\">The patent included several devices used in the manufacture of trunks. First, a yielding roller to be applied to the outside of the trunk; second, in spring catches to hold the trunk shut; third, in a brace of peculiar construction applied to the outside of the trunk for the purpose of holding up the lid; and, fourth, in a spring, arm for supporting the tray when turned up.. In' the specification the patentee made the following statement with-regard to the spring catch, -which was the only feature of the. invention claimed to have been. infringed in this suit</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-12\">\u201c Instead of providing the top of- the trunk with the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>straps for fastening it down, I attach to its front two spring catches, I, and to the top two tangs or .plates, J, which lock into and are held by the catches. Each catch consists of a metal socket, <em>e, </em>provided with a hinged latch or hook,/<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and with a flat spring, <em>g, </em>which bears against the lower end of the latch, and keeps its upper end pressed inward against the socket. The upper end of the latch or hook is provided with a prong, <em>i, </em>which extends through into the socket as shown in Fig. 4, the upper side of the prong being bevelled off, as shown. The tangs on the top or lid are provided with bevelled ends and with holes, or openings, as shown. When the top is pressed down, the tangs slide down into the sockets and the prongs, <em>i, </em>of the latches lock through them, in the. manner shown in Fig. 4, so as to hold the top or lid down securely. In order to unlock latches it is only necessary to turn back the upper ends of the hooks or latches so as to draw the prongs out of the tangs. After the latches, are turned back a certain distance the springs hold them in position, as shown in Fig. 1 and in dotted lines in Fig. 4, so. that it is only necessary to attend\u2019 to one of them at a time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">The only claim which was alleged to have been infringed was the third, which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">\u201c 3. The spring catches, I, constructed and applied to the front of the body, .as described, in combination with the tongues or hasps, J, on the top, when arranged to operate as set forth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">The answer denied the validity of the patent and infringement of the same\u2019. After the testimony had been taken, the plaintiff entered with the Commissioner of Patents a disclaimer of all the claims of the patent except the one in suit, .and upon the hearing upon pleadings and proofs the court adjudged- the patent to be valid, and that the defendants had infringed, and referred the case-to, a master to ascertain and report to the court the number of trunk fasteners' made, used and sold by d\u00e9fendants, and the profits which they had received and which had accrued to them since December 12, 1874, from -their infringement, together with all damages. in excess of such profits sustained by plaintiff and his assignor since that date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Subsequent to the entry of the interlocutory decree, which was opened for that purpose, and pending proceedings before the master, the defendants by leave of the court amended their, answer by alleging that the title to the patent was in the assignee in bankruptcy of one Poinier, who assigned the patent to the plaintiff subsequent to his adjudication in bankruptcy. The bill was also amended by averring that the assignee never accepted, title to the patent, but neglected and refused to assert any claim thereto, and that he is now estopped from claiming any title or exercising any dominion over such patent, or the invention thereby secured; and is also barred by. the provisions of the bankruptcy act requiring suit to be brought within two years after the accruing of any cause of action. In his report, made under the order of the court, the master found that the testimony left no doubt that \u201cat the date of the granting of the patent to Taylor the only known device for accomplishing the results produced by the trunk fastener was the ordinary trunk strap used in conjunction with the simple dowel pin. It seems, therefore, that the profits for which the defendants must account to complainant under the decree of this case are to be found by arriving at the cost of making and applying the strap and dowels and deducting therefrom the cost of making and applying the infringing trunk fastener manufactured and sold by the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqP\">Figuring upon this basis, the master found that the sum of $11,455.03 had been saved by the defendants by the.manufacture and use of 2500 gross of fasteners admitted to have been made and used by them, over what it would have cost them to have made and applied the straps and dowels necessary and-proper to have been used for the same purpose in lieu of such infringing fasteners. No computation was made of damages for _,the reason that the testimony showed that the profits allowed by him largely exceeded any actual damage sustained by the plaintiff. Exceptions were filed by both parties to this report, and a final decfeo was entered sustaining the exceptions filed by the defendants to the master\u2019s report, vacating and setting aside such report, arid decreeing nominal damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>for the infringement. 21 Fed.

Under the sweeping language of the Bankrupt Act, all the bankrupt\u2019s property, of every specids, whether scheduled,, or not, passed to the assignee. <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Vasse, </em>1 Pet. 193; <em>Milnor </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>16 Pet. 221; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, 17 </em>How. 315; <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>99 U.

J. Eq. 211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-8\">There can be no doubt that this patent right (and all rights under it) vested completely and absolutely in the assignee in bankruptcy. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>3 Story, 364; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Helmbold, </em>26 N.

St. 74; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>101 U. S. 403. This suit, therefore, stands as if Henry W. Poinier, notwithstanding his bankruptcy, brought suit on the patent, seeking to recover on what he had assigned to his creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-9\">It is claimed, however, that an assignee has the discretion to reject onerous or <em>unprofitable </em>assets and that in such case they revert.to the bankrupt; and a line of cases, resting upon* a. line of English cases, is relied upon as supporting this, conten- \u2019 tion. We submit that this principle is subject to the following limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-10\"><em>First. </em>It is of course true that the assignee may fail to reduce specific property to his possession, and in. that case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>party having possession will have his possessory title, which will be protected against the assaults of any mere trespasser. This is necessarily confined to corporeal property. It can have no application to a patent right. That passes at once by the assignment and requires, and can have, nq act qf reducing it tc possessiqn. There can be no .adverse possession. Infringers may perhaps, to the extent of their infringement, hold a <em>quasi </em>adverse possession. This may, unless timely action is brought, protect them in the enjoyment of the fruits of their acts. But there is and can be no adverse possession of the right. It is not a \u201c thing in possession.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY\"><em>Secondly. </em>There are some things which, when assigned, impose upon the assignee who accepts the assignments the obligations of a covenantor, obligations which are enforceable, not against the' property only by way of lien, but against the assignee personally, as against' a promisor. The common instance of this is a lease.. The assignee of a lease, by reason of privity of estate,, becomes <em>personally </em>bound by its covenants. Hence it is held that an assignment in bankruptcy does not operate to vest this kind of property in the assignee, but that it vests only upon his express acceptance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\">Subject to these two modifications, all property of the bankrupt, not exempted by staiute, vests absolutely in the assignee. It is not sound that the assignee may say to the bankrupt, This thing, I think, is not worth much and I will .let you keep it. The law vests it in the assignee without regard to value. The only case in which such a transaction can have any effect is where possessory rights accrue as a consequence. ' The supposed exception as to \u201cunprofitable\u201d property rests wholly upon English authority. It does not, therefore, exist except so far as it. is recognized by English adjudications. A m\u00bfre <em>dictum </em>or use of a word where Ike actual question is not involved cannot extend it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">\u25a0 No claim is made that the patent was ever reassigned to Pqihier. He did not schedule it. The assignee never knew of its -existence. \"The principle of our bankrupt law' was: (1) To divest-the bankrupt of all his property-not exempt, and make it over absolutely to his creditors for the payment of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>debts; (2) To leave to the bankrupt all he might thereafter earn, and give him release from his old debts upon compliance with proper conditions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">The property transferred to the assignee he does not get back unless his debts are paid in full: . An assignee may be discharged, or an assignee may die, but the trust remains while there is property unadministered and debts remain unpaid. \u201cNo principle,\u201d says Judge Story, \u201cis more firmly established than that a trust will never fail for want of a trustee.\u201d ' ' \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">Hence we find that when long after estates in bankruptcy have apparently been closed assets are found to exist, the court will appoint a new trustee to take charge of and administer them. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 How. 315.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-7\">II. The patent is void on its face, for that it covers several distinct inventions, and this defect\u2019cannot be cured by disclaimer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-8\">The Taylor patent of 1872 covers four entirely distinct inventions, in no way connected in design and consideration. The patent is therefore void.\u2019 <em>Evans </em>v. Eaton, 3 Wheat. 506; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Mason, 447; <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>2 Mason, 112; <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>1 Story, 273. The decision of the department, as well as of the, courts, has been uniform that such diverse inventions cannot be united in one patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-9\">This patent was held, void by the court below for this reason. <em>Sessions </em>v. <em>Romadka, </em>21 Fed. Rep. 124; but the court held that the defect was. within the remedial reach of a disclaimer. .Thereupon, on the 30th of July, 1884, John-TI. Sessions, the complainant, filed a disclaimer of the first, second and fourth claims. All infringement had ceased a year before this disclaimer was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-10\">It is true that if this patent could be saved by ,a disclaimer it saved the suit. But did it save damages which accrued before it was filed ? Perhaps it did so far as they accrued to the party who files the disclaimer. But could it possibly save' damages which accrued to the former owner, Poinier? He has not disclaimed. While he held the patent- it was void. What claim for damages .could he transfer to plaintiff in 1878 ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>If he transferred none,- how can any subsequent act of Sessions create them <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXi\">III. The allowance of nominal damages only was correct. The. burden of proof to show the defendants\u2019 profits is wholly on the complainant. <em>Garretson </em>v. Clark, 15 Blatchford, 70; <em>S. C. </em>on appeal, 111 U. S. <em>120; Dobson </em>v. <em>Hartford Carpet Co., </em>114 U. S. 444; <em>Goulds\u2019 Man'g Co. </em>v. <em>Cowing, </em>12 Blatchford, 243; <em>S. C. </em>14 Blatchford, 315; <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Musgrove, </em>14 Blatchford, 541. Unless he furnishes the requisite evidence on every essential point, he can have nominal damages only. <em>Rude </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>130 U. S. 152. The mode adopted by the master furnished a false test.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">And further, so far as the. damages before the assignment by Poinier are concerned, the right to recover them never passed out of him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">IY. Section 4900 of the Revised Statutes provides that \u201c it shall be the duty of all patentees, and their assigns . . . vending any patented article ... to give sufficient notice to the public that the same is patented, either by fixing thereon the word \u2018 patented,\u2019- together with the day and year the patent was granted, or when <em>from the character of the article this cannot be done, </em>by fixing to it or to the package wherein one or more of them is enclosed, a label containing the like notice, and in any suit for infringement by the party failing so to- mark, no damages shall be recovered by the plaintiff, except on proof that the \u2022 defendant was duly notified of the infringement and continued after such notice to make, use or vend the article so patented.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">\u2022 The complainant in this case was a large manufacturer and vendor of the 'patented article in question. Two specimens \u25a0offered in evidence were sworn to by him as embodying the patent and to be of his manufacture. 'It was obvious to the court \u2022 from their inspection that it could not be truthfully said of them that \u201cfrom the, character of the article\u2019\u2019.the affixing of the word \u201c patented \u201d with the date of the patent \u201c could not be done.\u201d \u25a0 The complainant claimed in general terms that he had notified defendants by letter, but made no sufficient proof to that effect. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The statute is that no damages shall be recovered by the' plaintiff \u201c except on <em>proof </em>that the defendant <em>was duty notified of the \u25a0 infringement </em>and continued, <em>after such notice </em>to make, use or vend the article so patented.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAb\">Here is a notice to be given which is expected to be acted upon, and the non-action' will involve substantial pecuniary consequences. We submit that such a notice must be given in writing; also, that a complainant who would rely upon it, in place of complying with the statute duty of marking his goods, Should allege it and make satisfactory proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-6\">It is no answer to say that the defendants \u201cdoubtless\u201d knew of the Taylor patent. That is not \u201c being notified of \u2018 the infringement.\u201d The rights enjoyed by complainant are great. They levy tribute on the whole country. They are a, privilege. <em>-But they are purely statutory. </em>Compliance with the statute is the condition precedent to their enjoyment. As the benefits conferred are great, it is but due that compliance with that condition should be insisted on. At hest complainant would be entitled to damages only after notice given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYa\">Y. This was a mere claim for a tort to third persons. It passed to the assignee by the assignment. The assignee had to assert it by suit within two- years after his appointment. When it passed back to the bankrupt by reason of the refusal of the assignee to take .it, assuming such to be the case, it passed subject to the statute of limitations governing the assignee, and had to be asserted within the two years, which was not done. \u2019 '</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-5\">No. 163,028, issued April 10, 1875, to Anthony V..Eomadka, stated by Mm to have \u201c.for its object a certain improvement upon the fastener patented to me, December 23, 1873,\u201d by letters patent Not.145,817, of that date.\" \u25a0 [Eerorter.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aeo\">Mr. Justice Brown,</author>\n<p id=\"ADI\">after stating the case, delivered the Opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">1.-- Defendants attack-' the \u2018title of\u2019 the plaintiff to this patent upon the ground that Poinier, who bought the patent of Taylor in 1872, and subsequently, in 1878, sold it to Sessions,. had,, prior to such sale, and in September, 1876, been duly adjudicated a bankrupt in the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey, and an assignee appointed, in whom, it is claimed, the legal title to the patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>vested. It seems, however, that Poinier did not include this patent in his schedule of assets, upon the ground, as he said, of its being unproductive property and of no value. Indeed, all that he seems to have done with the patent was to make a lot of trunk fasteners in 1872, which proved to be failures, and which appear to have been the cause of his insolvency. He made no others for the three years before he went into bankruptcy. On May 15, 1877, he received his discharge, and on November 27 of the same year his assignee was .discharged. On June 12, 1878, thirteen months softer Poinier had received his discharge, and six months after his assignee had been discharged, Sessions bought a shop right of Poinier, for vrhich he paid him $500, and in the same year purchased the patent itself, for which he paid him $1000'additional. Mr. Shepard, who acted as the agent of the plaintiff in making this purchase, testifies that he went to Newark on the morning of June 6, 1878,'and inquired for Henry W. Poinier. \u201cI was informed that one Mr. Miller was his assignee, and\u00b0that I could learn of his affairs by seeing him. I then went to the office of Mr. Miller and found him there, introduced myself, and told him that I had come to see him about a patent for a trunk fastener which was owned by Henry W. Poinier, and under which said. Poinier had been making trunk fasteners; .and I asked Mr. Miller if he would sell me said patent, or give me a shop right thereunder, as the assignee of Mr. Poinier. Mr. Miller replied that, he could not do so; that the estate was all settled up; he had made his return to the court, and. had been discharged as assignee, and he had no power to do anything in the matter. I asked him what I could do, and he said the only thing was to go to Mr. Poinier; that Poinier was the only one who could give me any title. ... I learned that Mr. Poinier was in Rochester.\u201d While the assignee does not recollect the conversation, there is nothing to disprove Mr. Sessions\u2019s version of it; nor is it strange that Miller did not recollect it, as he acted as assignee in some six or seven hundred eases, and could hardly be expected to remember all- the transactions connected with them. It is undisputed that Shepard went to Newark to find Poinier, and subsequently went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Rochester and found him there. The first assignment from Poinier was executed August 16, 1878, and conveyed only the. title to the patent itself; but a second assignment, bearing date September 24, included also. all rights of action for infringement from the datp that Poinier himself, acquired the title to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">While, under the provisions .of the bankrupt law, the title to this patent undoubtedly passed to the assignee in' bankruptcy of Poinier, it passed subject to an election on his part\" not to accept it, if, in his opinion, it was worthless, or would prove to be burdensome and unprofitable. And he was entitled to a reasonable time to elect whether he would accept it or not. <em>American File Co. </em>v. Garrett, 110 U. S. 288, 295; <em>Sparhawk </em>v. <em>Yerkes, </em>142 U. S. 1; <em>Amory </em>v. Lawrence, 3 Cliff. 523, 535.</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">In this case the assignee had taken a year to wind up the estate, and-had given no sign of his wish to assume this property, if indeed he knew of its existence.. On being asked with reference to it by the proposed purchaser, he replied that the estate was all settled up, that he had no power to do anything in the .matter, .and that Poinier was the only one who could give a title. A plainer election not to accept can hardly be .imagined. Granting that up to that time he had known nothing about the patent, it was his duty to inquire into the-matter if he had any thought of accepting it,-and not to jmislead the plaintiff\u2019s agent by referring him t\u00a9 the bankrupt as the proper person -to' apply to. Under the circumstances, plaintiff could do nothing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but purchase of -Poinier. Bearing ' in mind that no claim to this property is now made by the assignee, but that his alleged title to it is set u!p by a third, person, who confessedly has no \u00a1interest i\u00fa it himself, it is entirely clear that the defendants ought not to prevail as against a purchaser who bought it of the bankrupt after the assignee had disclaimed any interest .in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Had the existence of this patent been concealed by \u2019\u25a0the bankrupt, or the assignee \u2022 had discovered it subsequently \u2014 after his discharge \u2014 and desired to take possession of it for the benefit of the estate, it is possible the bankruptcy court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>might reopen the case and vacate the discharge for that purpose. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 How. 315. But it does not lie in the mouth of an alleged infringer to set up the right of the assignee as against a title from the bankrupt acquired with the consent of such' assignee. -</p>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">It is quite evident from the facts stated that this patent, which seems to have been the cause of Poinier\u2019s insolvency, was thought to be of little or no value, that the assignee so regarded it, and that its real value was only discovered when the plaintiff had brought to bear upon- the manufacture of the device his own skill and enterprise. - '</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">2.- Defendants are charged with infringing the' third claim of the Taylor patent, which was for a spring fastener, modifications of which are now in almost universal use, as a substitute for the old-fashioned strap and buckle.' Upon the hearing in the court below, it was- claimed the patent was invalid by reason of the joinder of distinct inventions in the same patent \u2014 inventions, which, though applicable to the same article, viz.: a trunk, do not co-operate in the use of such article. The court below was evidently inclined to this opinion, but permitted the plaintiff to enter a disclaimer of all the claims but the one in suit. Whether these different devices were properly embodied in the same patent or not, we think this was a proper case for a disclaimer under section 4917. \u25a0 While the language, of this section provides for disclaimers \u201c whenever, through inadvertence, accident or mistake, and -without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, a patentee has claimed more than that of which he was the original, or first inventor or discoverer,\u201d it allows the'patentee to \u201cmake disclaimer of such parts of the-thing patented as he shall not choose to claim or hold by virtue of the patent or assignment, stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent.\u201d We think this section' broad enough'to cover disclaimers made'to avoid the effect of having included in the patent more devices than, could properly .be made the subject of a single patent. The power to disclaim is a beneficial one, and ought not to be denied except where it is resorted to for a fraudulent and deceptive purpose. In <em>Tuck </em>v. <em>Bramhill, </em>6 Blatchford, 95, a disclaimer was allowed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Mr. Justice Blatchford .where two, or more inventions were covered by a single claim. In <em>Hailes </em>v. <em>Albany Stove Co., </em>123 U. S. 582, 587, it was said by Mr.' Justice Bradley to be \u201c usually and properly employed for the surrender of a separate claim in a patent, or some other distinct and separable matter, which can be- exscinded without mutilating pr changing what is left standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">-The only difficulty connected with the question of the disclaimer in this case arises from the final sentence \u2019 of section 4917, that \u201cno such disclaimer shall affect any action pending at the time of its being filed, except so far as may relate to. the question of unreasonable neglect or delay in filing it.\u201d There is an unfortunate choice of language here which has rendered this sentence very ambiguous-and difficult ofconstruction^It was held by Mr. Justice Story in <em>Reed v. Cutter, </em>1 Story, 590, 600, that, if the disclaimer were filed during the pendency of the suit, the plaiptiff would not be entitled to the-benefit, thereof in that suit \u2014 a ruling which had also been made in <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>1 Story, 273, 294. It was held in <em>Tuck </em>v. <em>Bramhill, </em>6 Blatchford, 95, that the provision meant that a suit pending when a disclaimer is filed is not to be affected by such filing so as to prevent the plaintiff from recovering in it, unless it appears that the plaintiff unreasonably \u2018 neglected or delayed to file the disclaimer. And such was also the ruling of Mr. Justice Nelson in <em>Guyon </em>v. <em>Serrell, </em>1 Blatchford, 244; and in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Wiles, </em>2 Blatchford, 194, 198. \" Ve think that section 4917 ought to be read in connection with section 4922, providing that' the patentee may maintain a suit at. law or in equity for the infringement of any part of the thing patented, notwithstanding .the specifications may embrace'more than that of which the patentee was the first inventor or discoverer; but in every such case in which a judgment or decree shall be. rendered for the plaintiff nq costs shall be recovered, unless thp- proper -disclaimer has been entered at the Patent Office before the commencement' of the suit. -This- was practically the construction- given to corresponding. sections of the act of 1837 by .this court in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>21 Wall. 112; and of the Revised Statutes in <em>Dunbar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>v. Myers, 94 U. S. 187, 193. Under section 4922 the effect of delaying a disclaimer until after.the commencement of the suit goes only to the recovery of costs. We adhere to that construction. Congress, having in the Revised Statutes adopted the language used in the act of 1837, must be considered to have adopted also .the construction given by. this court to this sentence, and made it a part of the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">3. The essential feature of the Taylor patent consists of a plate attached to the body of the trunk, which contains a socket and hinged catch, and a double acting spring whose function is to hold the catch either open or shut, and a tang fastened to the lid, which, as the lid is closed, drops into the socket holding the catch, which, when closed, holds the lid firmly in place. It also acts-as a dowel to keep the cover from racking.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Of the alleged anticipating devices the patent to Gaylord of 1861 is a trunk lock, not, as in this case, a fastener, designed to .supplement the lock, and differing from the old-fashioned and well-known trunk lock principally in discarding the hinged hasp and using a rigid tang attached to the cover, which, sinks into the socket in the body of the trunk prepared to receive it, and is there self-locked, but is unlocked only with an ordi\u00f1ary key. It was not designed at all to supersede the buckle and strap, but was only a substitute for, and an improvement upon, the ordinary lock. In short, it is a modification of the spring lock previously used upon trunks.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The Roulstone patent of 1866 is for an improvement in travelling bags, and shows'a spring-locking device for securing the two parts.of the bag firmly together. It has no features in common with the trunk. fastener of Taylor, and is not; adapted to hold the lid of a trunk firmly to the body. It has no means for holding the catch out of engagement when, desired, and is Avholly u'nlike the modern trunk fastener.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The patent to Semple of 1868 covers an angle plate upon the trunk cover, provided at the end side Avith a dowel in combination with a small plate upon the box, provided with a loop into which the dowel enters, and. at the front side with'a hasp and staple to be used with a padlock. \u2019 The object was to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>fasten and hold together the box and the cover of the trunk, but the means provided for accomplishing this are so different from those employed by Taylor that they can hardly be compared. \u2022 Besides the device is evidently of no utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The patent to Cutter of 1868 was also for an improvement in trunk locks, especially adapted for security against an unauthorized opening of the trunk, and operated only by an independent and detachable key. It appears to be self-locking and does not differ materially from the ordinary spring lock. It is not a trunk' fastener, as distinguished from a lock, and is not designed' to be used as a substitute for the strap and buckle.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The patent to Locke of 1811 consists of straps made of hoop iron, steel or brass, or other metals which yield readily, their upper ends resting loosely in caps or escutcheons, so as to have a slight degree of lateral. play, the lower ends being formed dovetailed and adapted to engage with catches attached to the body of the trunk. The lower end of the strap rides over the lugs of the catches until the cover is fully closed, when the inclines of the strap and the lugs coincide, and the straps then drop into place and remain locked. This device is undoubtedly a fastener, as distinguished from a lock, -but it lacks the rigid tang, the hinged catch, the spring\u2014in shortfall the essential features of the Taylor invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u2022 The Hillebrand patent is also for a trunk lock, and, like the others, is operated by an independent key, and also lacks the features of the Taylor patent..</p>\n<p id=\"AyV\">The Ransom patent is for a trunk fastener, consisting of two parts, one of which is attached to the. body of the trunk and the other to the lid. It does not, however, contain the socket open at the top and designed to receive a rigid tang, nor does it contain the other mechanism of the Taylor patent. While intended to accomplish the same purpose, the means used are so different that it is far from being an anticipation</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">There are none of- these patents which contain the peculiar combination of the\" Taylor device, none which, had Taylor known of them.,, would 'have suggested his own invention. While his device-is-somewhat crude, as compared-With the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>proved styles of trunk fasteners now in use, it contains the underlying principle of all of them. In short, we find no difficulty in holding that there is patentable novelty in the Taylor fastener, and that it is not anticipated by any of the devices put in evidence. If there were any. doubt of this, in view' of the fact that Taylor seems to -have been the first to invent a practical trunk fastener to take the .place of the old-fashioned strap and buckle, and that, improved' upon, as it undoubtedly has been, it has completely taken the place of the earlier devices, we should be inclined to resolve this doubt in iavpr of the-patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">4. The \u2019question of infringement is not so easy, as, the Eomadka patent, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the' defendants manufacture, approximates inore closely to the ordinary form of the spring lock than does the Taylor patent. The difference between the two patents, however, is more in their outward appearance than in their substantial features. Both resemble the spring lock in having a rigid tang with a notch in it \u25a0 to receive a catch actuated by a spring, and in being self-locking if the catch be closed when the tang enters the socket; both differ from it in the fact that the device may be unlocked without the aid of a key by a simple motion of the.finger, and hence is not designed to protect against unauthorized opening. The essential features' of each are the same. Both have a rigid tang attached to the cover of the trunk \u2014in the Taylor patent, with a hole in it, and in the- Eomadka patent with a notch to receive the-catch; both have a socket attached to the body of the trunk containing a hinged catch actuated by a - spring which fits into the hole or.notch in the tang. In the Taylor patent the catch is held open and shut by a flat spring, and operates .at right angles to the plane of the trunk; in the Eomadka device the catch is held by a \"wire spring, and is moved sideways or parallel'with the plane of the trunk by a slight projection at the side of the socket. Both are identical in principle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>'operation and design, though the trunk fasteners now in ordinary use resemble the Taylor more than the Bomadka patent. In view of the fact that Taylor was a pioneer in, the art of making a practical metallic trunk fastener, and invented a principle which has gone into almost universal use in this country, we think he is entitled to a liberal construction of his claim, and that the Bomadk\u00e1 device, containing as it does all the elements of his combination, should be held an infringement, though there are superficial dissimilarities in their construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">5.. It only remains to consider the question of damages. Before the invention of these fasteners, straps and buckles were universally used to hold the lid of the trunk fast to the body, in aid of the lock, and dowels appear to have been in common use to prevent a lateral movement of the lid. Trunks with straps to support the lock were considered imperfect and unserviceable, and the dowels had become a recognized necessity, except where strength and durability were of no consequence. In this connection the master allowed the difference between the cost of trunk fasteners and the straps, buckles and dowels previously in use for the same purpose, and the court overruled the measure of damages thus adopted, and entered a decree for nominal damages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u2018 It seems the defendants did not manufacture these fastenebs for sale, but did manufacture them for use on the trunks made and sold by them. Obviously their profits upon the entire trunk would not be a proper measure, of damages, since the fasteners were only an inconsiderable- part of the trunk, and profits upon the entire article are only allowable where such article is wholly the invention of the paten \u00a1tee, or where its entire value is properly and legally attributable to the patented feature. <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>16 How. 480; <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>14 Wall. 620; <em>Littlefield </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>21 Wall. 205; <em>Garretson </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>111 U. S. 120. This court has, however, repeatedly held that, in estimating damages in the absence of a royalty, it is proper to consider the'savings of the defendant in the use of the patented device over what was known and in general use for the same, purpose anterior to the date of the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>patent. Thus, in <em>Mowry </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>14 Wall. 620, 649, it was said by Mr. Justice Strong, that \u201cit is the additional advantage the defendant derived from the process \u2014 advantage beyond what he had without it \u2014 for which he must account.\u201d In that case the master reported the difference between the cost of certain car wheels and the price for which they were sold as the profits realized by the defendant, thus charging him the profit obtained from the entire wheel, instead of that resulting from the use of. the patentee\u2019s invention in a part of the manufacture. It was held not to be a legitimate \"construction of the -findings that the benefit which the defendant derived from the use of the complainant\u2019s invention was equal to the aggregate of profits he obtained from the manufacture and sale of the wheels as entireties, after they had been completed; but that the question to be determined was -\u2014\u25a0 what advantage did the defendant derive from using the complainant\u2019s invention over what he had' in using other processes then open to the public and adequate to enable him to obtain an equally beneficial result? The same principle was applied in the case of the <em>Cawood </em>Patent, 94 U. S. 695, 710, in which the defendant made use of an infringing swage block for the purpose of reforming the ends of railroad rails which had\u00b0become exfoliated by wear, and it' was held that the gain in mending these rails by the use of the plaintiff\u2019s device, compared with the cost of mending on the common anvil, and the saving in fuel and labor, were the proper measure of damages. <em>\u201c </em>They had the choice of repairing them on the common anvil or on the complainant\u2019s machine. By selecting the latter, they saved a large part of what they must have expended in the use of the former.\"\u2019 To that extent they had a positive advantage, growing out of their invasion of complainant\u2019s patent.\u201d The subject is also fully considered in the case of <em>Tilghman </em>v. Proctor, 125 U. S. 136, in which it w\u00e1s held that, the plaintiff-may, instead of damages, recover the amount of gains and profits the defendants have made by the use of his invention, over what they would have had in using other means then open to the public and adequate to enable them to obtain an equally beneficial result. The patent in this case was for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>process of manufacturing fat acids and glycerine from fatty bodies by the action of water at a high temperature and pressure. In his report of damages the master found that the complainant derived no profit from the invention otherwise than by granting licenses to others to use the same, but that the defendant had\u2019 derived large profits and savings by the use of the plaintiff\u2019s patented process, which plaintiff sought to recover in the suit. It was held by this court that, when a bill in equity is filed by the owner against the infringers of a patent, the \u25a0 plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of gains and profits the defendant has made by the use of his invention, not those he might reasonably have made, but those which he did make, or, in other words, the fruits of the advantage which he derived from the use of that invention over what he would have had in using other means.then open to the public and adequate to enable him to obtain an equally beneficial result.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">An analogous rule was applied in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Railroad </em>Company, 18 Blatchford, 181, 185, wherein the patent was for an improvement in locomotive lamps, which enabled the burning of kerosene instead of lard oil in locomotive head lights. The defendant used a number of the patented lamps on its locomotives, and it was held that its profits were the' difference between the cost of the kerosene which it burned and the lard oil which it would have had to burn in lieu thereof but for the use of the- plaintiff\u2019s lamps.' \u201c The statute,\u201d said Mr. Justice Blatchford, (Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4921,) \u201cexpressly gives to the plaintiff, on a recovery in a suit in equity for an infringement, <em>\u2018 </em>the profits \u2019 to be accounted for by the' defendant. . . . The defendant .made its election when it infringed and subjected itself to a suit iii equity, and the plaintiff is entitled to the result of the choice ho made of suing in \u25a0 equity and not at law. The plaintiff made his inventions for the purpose of enabling any one using'them to successfully burn kerosene oil in lamps for locomotive head lights, and to obtain the full advantage of its great light-producing capacity. The defendant used them for that purpose and with that result, and must pay the profits or . savings made thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>We see no reason why this measure of damages should not be applied to this case. , The only argument to the contrary is that the instances in which this court has applied this rule are confined to those wherein the defendant has made use of the- complainant\u2019s invention in the operation and conduct of his business, and that it ought not to be extended to cases in which the defendant manufactures- and sells the devices.' Without questioning at this time the soundness of this contention,-we think this case\u2019 falls within the former rather thap within the;latter category. The defendant does,not ma%tu-/ facture and sell trunk fasteners as\" such, but he does make and use them in' the business df manufacturing trunks, and the difference between such use of them and the use of the old-fashioned strap and buckle- represents his profits. If the de: fendant manufactured and sold trunk fasteners to be attached to trunks by his vendees, it might be justly claimed that he did not use them; but -if he manufactures them solely to be attached to trunks made and sbld by himself, it is none the less a use of them than if he had used the trunk to which they, were -attached for his.own-purposes. If, to put an analogous case, a person made a business of manufacturing and selling steam engines to which he attached a patented lubricator, it could hardly .be.claimed that he was a manufacturer and seller of lubricators, but he would clearly be liable as a user of \u25a0them.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In such case it makes no difference whether his general business has been conducted at a profit or loss,. or whether-he has derived an .additional profit from the sale of trunks equipped with this'device over those not so equipped, although the presumption would be, from the saving made by him in the use of this device, that an additional profit upon the sale of the -trunks was made,' unless it were shown that the use of-this device in some way resulted in- a diminution of profits upon the entire manufacture \u2022 As was said in the <em>Cawood Patent, 94 </em>U. S. 695, 710: \u201cIf their general business was unprofitable, it was the less so in consequence of their' use of the plaintiff\u2019s property. They gained,- therefore, to the extent that they saved themselves from loss. In settling an account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>between a patentee and an infringer of the patent the question is, not what profits the latter has made, .in his business, or from his manner of conducting it, but what advantage has he derived from his use of the patented invention.\u201d See also <em>Tilghman </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>125 U. S. 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The master apparently computed the profits received by the defendants from the infringement upon the basis of the interlocutory decree referring the case to him to ascertain and report the number of fasteners made .and used by the defendants, and the gains, profits and advantages they received from the infringement, .etc.; and as, in the view we have taken of this case, there was nothing inequitable in this measure of damages, we see no reason for disturbing the report ,of the master in that particular. '</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">6. Further objection is made to -a recovery of profits in this case upon the ground of a non-compliance with the requirements of Rev. Stat. sec. 4900, in failing \u201cto give sufficient notice to the public that the - same \u201d (that is, the article) \u201c is patented, either by affixing thereon the word <em>\u2018 </em>patented,\u2019 together with the day and year the patent was granted, or when, from the character of the article, this cannot be done, by fixing to- it, or to the package wherein one or more of them is enclosed, a label containing the like notice; and in any suit for infringement, by the party failing so to mark, no damages shall be recovered by the plaintiff, except on proof that the defendant, was duly notified of. the ^infringement, and continued, after such notice, to make, use or vend the article so patented.\u201d The averment of the bill in this connection is. \u201c that great numbers of trunk catches, containing and embodying the said invention . . . have been manufactured by your orator and the previous owners of said letters patent, which said catches- were marked with the word \u00a3 patent \u2019 and-with the year and day of the month of the date of said letters patent; that the public generally Rave' acknowledged the validity of said letters patent and have generally acquiesced in the right aforesaid of your orator.\u201d' It appears that the plaintiff did stamp .upon the larger sizes.the fact and the date of the patent, but that he fail\u00e9d to affix such stamp to' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>smaller sizes, on account of the difficulty of marking them in such way that the mark would be legible when the catches were japanned or tinned. It is not altogether clear that the , stamp could not have been made upon the ' smaller sizes, but, in a doubtful case, something must be left tcTthe judgment of the patentee, who appears in this case to have complied with the'alternative provision of the act, in affixing a label to the packages in which the fasteners were shipped and sold. He testified in this connection that, with thte two small sizes, it was impracticable to cast the stamp upon the castings; but that he always marked the packages <em>\u201c </em>patented.\u201d The fact that this device was patented could hardly have escaped the notice of Romadka, since the earliest fasteners made under the patent, which were manufactured and' sold by Poinier, were duly stamped, and Romadka had dealt with him, bought bags of him, and said to Sessions that he could have bought the patent for a low price. Although there is an averment in the answer that the defendants have no knowledge or information save from said bill of complaint, whether the catches were marked with the word \u201c patented,\u201d etc., and therefore deny the same, there is no denial of their knowledge that the Taylor device was patented; and in view of the fact that all letters patent are recorded, with their specifications, in the Patent Office, a record which is notice to all the world, it is not an unreasonable requirement that the .defendant, who relies upon a want of knowledge upon his part of the actual existence of the patent, should aver the same in his answer, that the' plaintiff may be duly advised ,of the defence. <em>Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Goodyear, </em>9 Wall. 788, 801; <em>Allen </em>v. Deacon, 10 Sawyer, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">7. A further point is made that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for any profits accrued prior to September 12, 1876, when Poinier was adjudicated a bankrupt, that any. right of action which he then possessed passed to his assignee and, so long as it remained in his hands, became subject to the statutory limitation of two years within which, by Rev. Stat. sec. 5057, the assignee is'bound to institute suit. It is insisted that if he abandoned the claims against third parties for infringe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ment he abandoned them subject to. the limitation of two years within which he was himself obliged to bring suit, and that Poinier himself, and the plaintiff, his assignee, took them subject to that limitation. In this connection the defendant relies upon the case of <em>Kenyon </em>v. Wrisley, 147 Mass. 476. In this case the assignee abandoned to the bankrupt the right to sue upon a promissory note which he considered worthless, and the plaintiff brought suit upon the same nine years after the adjudication and assignment. It w'as held, that the plaintiff bad no right to recover; but the decision was placed upon the express ground that the assignee did' not elect to abandon the claim, and did not consent to a suit upon it' by the plaintiff, until after his right of action was.barred .by the statute: and it was held that, as the right of suit upon the note was barred while in the hands of the \u00bf\u2018ssignee, it was not revived by the election of the assignee to abandon it1 to the plaintiff. In <em>Gifford </em>v. Helms, 98 U. S. 248, and in <em>Wisner </em>v. Brown, 122 U. S. 214, it was held by this court that, purchasers of property from an assignee in bankruptcy could not maintain a suit in equity against third persons claiming adverse interests in such property, if, at the time of the purch\u00e1se from the assignee, his right of action was, under the bankruptcy act, barred by the lapse of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In <em>Greene </em>v. Taylor, 132 U. S. 415, 443, the court went a step further, and held that if,.at the time of the purchase from the assignee, the statute' had begun .to run against the claim or right in the hands of such assignee, the purchaser took the right subject to the statutory limitation; and to the consequence that when sufficient additional time should have run against it in the hands of the purchaser to make up the entire two years, the claim or right would be wholly barred. \u201cNo initiation of a new period of limitation, under any .statute, b\u00f3gins to run in favor of the purchaser at the time of his purchase, whether the two years wholly elapsed, or only a part thereof elapsed, while the claim was owned by the assignee.\u201d. We are of opinion, however, that this, rule does not apply where the assignee, before the expiration of the statutory time, elects to abandon the property to the bankrupt. In sucfi. case the abandonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>relates back to the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, and the title stands as if no assignment had been made. Such abandonment is not so much a transfer of an existing interest in the assignee as an election on his part to treat the \u25a0assignment as having never included that claim. We do not find it necessary to express- an opinion whether the same rule would apply if, as held in <em>Kenyon </em>v. Wrisley, the statutory limitation were a bar to an action by the assignee when the abandonment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Jn the case under consideration, Poinier was adjudicated a bankrupt September 12, 1876, the assignee was appointed October 17, 1876, and the abandonment took place, according to the testimony of Mr. Shepard, early in June, 1878, less than two years from the time the cause of. action accrued to the assignee. As Poinier recovered the right to sue infringers by abandonment from the assignee before that right had become barred by the statute in his hands, we think he should be considered as receiving it unaffected by the statute, and that he and the plaintiff, his assignee, were entitled to bring this suit as if the assignment had n~t been made..</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">May 16, 1892, judgment was entered that the decree of the court below be</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Reversed, and the ease remanded with directions for further proceedings, in conformity with the opinion of this court, with, authority, however, to the Circuit Cowrt, if in its opinion la/io and justice shall so require, to modify the total amount of damages as found by the master.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
