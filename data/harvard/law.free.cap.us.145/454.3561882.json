Smart and others, partners, and creditors in the sum of $600 .of Solomon Brown, a merchant of Baltimore; and prayed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>court to adjudicate Brown jah insolvent debtor, to appoint a trustee, and to decree, fraudulent and void a conveyance made by him, being insolvent, on November 30,1887, of all his property, including his stock of goods in his store in Baltimore, and all his debts, accounts and choses in action, to Isaac Eiehberg of Alexandria, in the State of Virginia, preferring certain of .his creditors, citizens of other States, whose debts were for money lent at various times from December 29,1886, to September 30, 1887, under contracts made and to be performed in those States, and who were preferred in consideration of their agreement, expressed in the conveyance, to accept the provisions thereof in full satisfaction of their debts, and to acquit and discharge him of any payt of those debts- remaining unsatisfied out of the proceeds of the property conveyed. The petition prayed for a subpoena to Brown, to Eiehberg- and to each of the preferred creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">Brown alone was served with a subpoena, and appeared, and admitted the facts alleged in the petition and above stated; but denied that the conveyance created an unlawful preference, because all the creditors preferred therein resided out of the State of Maryland, and were creditors on contracts made and to be performed out of the State, and had agreed to accept the provisions of the conveyance in full satisfaction of their debts; and also denied that the court had any jurisdiction to decide upon the validity and effect of the conveyance, and especially because-the court had acquired no jurisdiction of the trustee or of the creditors named therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The court overruled\" both defences, and entered an order adjudicating Brown \u2022 to be an insolvent,' declaring void the conveyance by him to Eiehberg, and appointing a trustee to take -possession of all his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">Brown appealed to'the Court of Appeals of Maryland, which affirmed the. order. 69 Maryland, 320. Brown then sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-8\"><em>Mr. Charles Marshall </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-9\">If the Insolvent Law of Maryland,-as expounded by the Court of Appeals of that State, warrants the judgment' in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>this case, declaring the deed of trust from Brown to Eichberg to be void, neither Eichberg the trustee nor the foreign credi -tors secured by the deed being .parties, and it not being possible to make them parties to this suit, it- is submitted that it comes in collision to that extent with the Constitution of the United States, l\u00e9th Amendment, section 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-4\">. The court will also observe that the' insolvent law itself, section 21, contains a provision that when a deed is made by any person belonging to any of the classes mentioned in section 11, when insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency \u201c the same shall be <em>prima facie </em>intended to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of the person by whom the same is made, and the burden of proof shall rest upon him and the grantee to explain the same, and show the <em>bonafldes </em>thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-5\">Now, this section evidently contemplates, that the grantee' shall have an opportunity to be heard, in defence of his rights, - and yet the law contains no provision for notice to him of any kind, and if it did, it is not pretended that he, if a citizen of another State, could be legally required to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the insolvent court of Maryland.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-6\">Net, by the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case, that law warrants t.he insolvent court in pronouncing upon the rights of the grantee in his absence, and in the absence of power to make him a party to the proceeding in insolvency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-7\">If the law is void as thus expounded, because repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, any judgment enforcing such a law is void as to all parties affected by it, including the plaintiff \u25a0 in error in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">It is respectfully submitted that the insolvent law of Maryland, so far as it is held to warrant such a judgment as that complained of here, attempts to do what no State can do.' In the language of this court in <em>Cook </em>v. Moffatt, 5 How. 295, the State of Maryland has attempted to \u201c inflict her bankrupt laws on.contracts and persons not within her limits,\u201d and to do that, has by her law, as expounded by the Court of Appeals, made provision for adjudicating upon the rights of persons who neither are nor can .be brought within her jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tion. As expounded by the Court of Appeals, the law is an attempt on the.part of the State to exercise powers that be long to Congress only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-4\"><em>Mr. M. R. Walter </em>and <em>Mr. Oharles 'A. Boston </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b479-5\">Mr. Justice Gray,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ8\">after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AzW\">The principles which underlie this case are clearly estab-. lished by the decisions of this court. So long as there is no national bankrupt act, each State-has full authority to pass insolvent laws binding persons and-property within its jurisdiction, provided it does' not impair the obligation of existing contracts; but a State cannot by such \u00e1 law discharge one of its. own citizens from Ms contracts with citizens of other. States, though' made after the passage of the law, unless they voluntarily become parties to-the proceedings in insolvency. <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Crowninshield, </em>4 Wheat. 122; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>12 Wheat. 213; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>1 Wall. 223; <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>4 Wall. 409. Yet each State, so long as it does not impair the obligation of any contract, has the power by general laws to reg\u00falate the conveyance and disposition of all property, personal or real; within its limits and jurisdiction. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Union Bank, 5 </em>Pet. 518, 526; <em>Crapo </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>16 Wall. 610, 630; <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>128 U. S. 489, 498; <em>Walworth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>129 U. S. 355; <em>Geilinger </em>v. <em>Philippi, </em>133 U. S. 246, 257; <em>Pullman\u2019s Car Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, 141 </em>U. S. 18, 22. In <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>above cited, the law upon this subject was well summed up by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the court,.as follows: \u201c The objection to the extraterritorial operation of a. state insolvent law is that it cannot, like the bankrupt law passed by Congress under its constitutional grant of power, release all debtors from the obligation of the debt. ' The authority .to deal with the property of the debtor within the State, so far as it does not impair the obligation of contracts, is conceded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>A provision of the insolvent law of a State, that all conveyances, by way of preference, of any property within its borders, made\u2019 by a citizen of the State, being insolvent, and within four, months before the commencement of proceedings in insolvency, shall be void, is a usu\u00e1l and a valid exercise of the power of the State over property within its jurisdiction,' as to all such conveyances made after the passage of the law, whether to its own citizens or to citizens of other States.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u25a0 But even if it should be held, that such a law could not invalidate such a conveyance so far as citizens of other States are concerned, it is clearly valid so far as it makes the conveyance an act of insolvency, sufficient to support an adjudication of insolvency, and the appointment of a trustee or assignee to take and distribute among creditors any property which may lawfully come to his possession. The State might enact that conveyances preferring particular creditors, if made in good fai should be valid.so far as concerned them, and yet provide ihat, so far as the debtor was concerned, the preference showed such a disregard of the\u2019 rights of other creditors as would justify adjudging the debtor to be insolvent, and appointing a trustee or assignee to take possession of and distribute any property not included in the conveyance.-</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In the case before us the only plaintiff in error 'is the insolvent himself. The position taken by him in the court below, but not argued in this court, that the obligation of a contract with, him has been unconstitutionally impaired, is clearly untenable, because the statute of the State was in existence when the contract was made, and the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeals was not a law, within the meaning of the provision of the Constitution which declares that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. <em>New Orleans Waterworks v. Louisiana Co., </em>125 U. S. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The only provision of the Constitution of the United States, now relied on by the plaintiff in error, is the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbids any State to deprive any person of property without due process of law. But the. plaintiff in error has been deprived of no right by the judgment below. There is no doubt of .the validity of that, judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ment, so far as it adjudged him to be an insolvent and appointed an assignee to take possession of his property; and in any view . he has no title or right in the property which was the subject of the conveyance in trust. If that conveyance was valid, the property belongs to the trustee for the benefit of the creditors named therein. If it was invalid, the property vested in the assignee in insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\">\"Whether the judgment below was ineffectual as against the trustee or the creditors named in the conveyance, either for want of notice or because the conveyance to them could not be set .aside, or whether, on the other hand, that judgment was valid against them, because rendered' in a proceeding <em>m rem </em>of which they were bound to take notice, is a question which could be presented by them onty, and they are not parties to this writ of 'error. The plaintiff in error cannot invoke the judgment of this court upon the rights of persons pnder whom he does not claim. <em>Long </em>v. Converse, 91 U. S. 105; <em>Ludeling </em>v. <em>Chaffe, </em>143 U. S. 301, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\n<em>Judgment, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
