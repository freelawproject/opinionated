The proceedings were summary, to recover the possession of land, before a circuit court commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sioner in tlie county of Kent, under How. Stat. \u00a7 8295. The following facts were found by the circuit judge, and no exception is taken thereto: In April, 1880, the plaintiff owned and leased to the defendant for one year the premises in question at an annual rental of $35. At the end of the year the lease was verbally renewed for an indefinite period, but for more than one year, the rent received to be paid annually. Under this agreement the defendant remained in possession over two years, during which time he erected buildings upon the premises, in which he lived and carried on his business, with the knowledge and permission of the plaintiff. In August, 1883, about $95 rent had become due to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff, by h\u00ed\u00e9 agent, orally demanded payment thereof of defendant, and the defendant refused to pay, and thereupon the plaintiff gave the defendant the following notice to quit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201c <em>To James Fairs:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Sir- \u2014 You will please take notice that I have elected to terminate the lease of the premises that you now occupy and hold under me, and you are hereby notified to quit and deliver up the quiet and peaceable possession of said premises to me within fourteen days after service on you of this notice. Said premises .being described as Lot number seven (7) Boynton &amp; Judd\u2019s addition, situated in the township of Grand Rapids, in the county of Kent, State of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Charles B. Judd,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">Per B. C. Girdler,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">Agent and Attorney for Charles B. Judd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The defendant, on being served with this notice, refused to give up possession of the premises, and fifteen days thereafter the complainant instituted the proceedings had in this case. Possession was awarded the plaintiff by the commissioner, and on the trial of the appeal the circuit judge awarded to him the writ of restitution, holding, as a question of law upon the facts stated, that the notice given was sufficient to terminate the tenancy. This finding of law was excepted to by defendant\u2019s counsel, and raises the only question to be considered upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Ve think the finding of the circuit judge was correct. The legislation in this State has greatly changed the common-law requirement of the notice to quit to be given by the landlords to tenants of leased premises before restitution can be had. Under the rulings of this Court heretofore made, the defendant was a tenant from year to year, and had he kept up his rent, would have been entitled to a notice to quit, as such, from the landlord, ending with the year. But the defendant failed to pay his rent. The circuit judge finds, as one of the facts in the case, that the defendant not only owed, but that there was due to the plaintiff rent to the amount of $95 (it being the rent for over two years), when the notice to quit was served. The record further shows that the plaintiff asked defendant to pay this rent, and he refused so to do, and thereupon the plaintiff gave the foregoing notice to quit. The verbal demand of payment and the notice to quit were sufficient, and brought the plaintiff\u2019s case within the provisions of How. Stat. \u00a7 8295, subd. 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These views are sustained by the following decisions of this Court. <em>Morrill v. Mackman </em>24 Mich. 279; <em>McSloy v.
