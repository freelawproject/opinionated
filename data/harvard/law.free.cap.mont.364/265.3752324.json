We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b62 On March 15, 2011, Bollman was convicted of his fifth DUI offense, a felony, after a jury trial. He was sentenced to serve a 13-month commitment with the Department of Corrections (DOC), followed by a 4-year suspended commitment to the DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Bollman\u2019s Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">\u00b63 Columbia Falls Police Officer Craig McConnell (Officer McConnell) was on patrol in the early morning hours of August 6, 2010, when he noticed Bollman\u2019s white minivan drift out of its lane, into the center turn lane, then back into its lane of traffic. Officer McConnell followed the vehicle and observed continued drifting behavior. Bollman made a wide left turn without signaling, then slowed as if to pull over, but continued driving slowly. Officer McConnell activated his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop. \u00b64 Officer McConnell testified that, upon contacting Bollman, he could smell the \u2018Very strong\u201d odor of alcohol, Bollman\u2019s speech was \u201cmumbled and just kind of garbled,\u201d Bollman\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and watery, and Bollman\u2019s movements to get his registration and insurance information were slow and he fumbled around to retrieve the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">\u00b65 Officer McConnell testified that he asked Bollman how much he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>had to drink, and Bollman said \u201cway too much to be driving.\u201d At some point, Bollman asked Officer McConnell to give him a break and take him home. Officer McConnell did not give Bollman a break, but rather asked Bollman to exit his vehicle. Bollman\u2019s movements were slow, he used the door for support, and was unsteady on his feet. Once Bollman was out of his vehicle, Officer McConnell asked him to perform standardized field sobriety tests, or SFSTs. Officer McConnell\u2019s vehicle had videotaping capabilities but no videotape, thus Bollman\u2019s SFSTs were not recorded. However, Officer McConnell documented Bollman\u2019s performance and testified that Bollman exhibited 6 out of 6 indicators on the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, 3 out of 4 indicators on the one-leg stand test; and 8 out of 8 indicators on the walk-and-turn test. Based on his training and experience, Officer McConnell determined Bollman was intoxicated and placed him under arrest for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b66 At the police station, which did have videotaping capabilities, Officer McConnell again asked Bollman to perform the SFSTs. Bollman said \u2018This is the part where I\u2019m supposed to ask for a lawyer, right? ... \u2018Cause I\u2019m screwed.\u201d When asked if he had any injuries or physical issues, Bollman stated he had rheumatoid arthritis, and takes Prilosec and Ibuprofen. Bollman refused to perform the SFSTs. Officer McConnell then read the implied consent advisory form to Bollman before asking him to take a breathalyzer test. Bollman refused to take a breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b67 Bollman disputes much of Officer McConnell\u2019s testimony. Bollman testified that he was drifting while driving because he was fiddling with his Walkman, which was on the passenger side visor. He testified his eyes were bloodshot and glassy because he worked all day in the wind at a bark plant, and that Officer McConnell could not have smelled alcohol because he (Bollman) spilled diesel fuel on himself before he left work. He testified he was mumbling because he was nervous and his teeth were \u201call bad.\u201dHe testified that he fumbled with his paperwork because his glove box was \u2018full of junk.\u201d He testified that he was slow and unsteady because he was stiff and sore from working all day, and was suffering from arthritis. He testified that he did not say he drank too much to be driving, but rather said \u2018ho matter how much you have one beer is too much to be driving.\u201d He testified that he could not perform the one-leg stand test because of his arthritis, so he told Officer McConnell to \u2018just take me to jail.\u201dBollman denied performing the HGN test or walk-and-turn test. Bollman testified that he did not tell Officer McConnell he was \u201cscrewed\u201d but rather said Tm not going to get screwed, I just want a lawyer.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Finally, he testified that he did not trust breathalyzer machines, so he refused the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Expert Testimony on the HGN Test</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b68 Prior to trial, the State gave notice that it intended to call Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Tim Proctor (Trooper Proctor) to testify as an expert regarding the correlation between alcohol consumption and nystagmus in the human eye, i.e. the scientific basis of the HGN test. Bollman objected to Trooper Proctor being designated as an expert, and also filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of the administration and results of the HGN test unless the State produced a qualified expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b69 On the first day of Bollman\u2019s trial, the District Court held a hearing to determine whether Trooper Proctor was qualified to testify as an expert witness. The jury was not present for the hearing. Trooper Proctor testified, and was cross-examined by Bollman\u2019s trial counsel. After the hearing, the District Court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">[a]s an initial starting point this witness is not required to be a medical professional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">Trooper Proctor's qualifications include an associate\u2019s degree in criminal justice with introductory courses in both anatomy and biology. He attended the law enforcement academy with 40 hours of basic HGN testing. He re-certifies yearly and has done so for the last four to five years. He's completed an advanced traffic course, which is required of all patrolmen, at the State Law Enforcement Academy. He has completed an Advanced Roadside Impaired Drivers course, which is a two-day course. He has successfully completed the drug recognition course, which included a two-day 16-hour ability to administer HGN, and then 1.5 weeks, or one-and-a-half weeks of classroom in which there was four hours-four hours taught as to the scientific basis for HGN by a doctor of ophthalmology^<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] is what was testified to. He then would-had a field certification, three days in Arizona, which included HGN, and a final exam of four to six hours. When he completed that course he then took the Prosecution of Drunk Drivers course, which also had a four-hour HGN component taught by the doctor of ophthalmology,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] which both of these four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>hours went to the scientific basis of HGN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">He's further testified that he has the ability to explain and will explain the concept and scientific basis of nystagmus and the correlation to alcohol consumption and nystagmus, to include natural nystagmus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">Finally, he's been previously qualified in Flathead County Justice Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">Considering those findings, a review of the existing case law, and at least the credentials of the people that have been approved to do this, the Court does find that Trooper Proctor is qualified to testify to the result of the test that was given to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2M\">\u00b610 Trooper Proctor testified at trial to the same qualifications. The District Court then found him \u201cqualified\u201d as an expert regarding the scientific basis of the HGN test. He then testified about what horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) is, how the HGN test is administered, the correlation between alcohol and HGN, and the correlation between exhibiting 4 or more (of 6) indicators on the HGN test and the subject\u2019s approximate blood alcohol content. Trooper Proctor did point out that the result of the HGN test is not, itself alone, an indicator that a person is intoxicated. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">the determination for a person's impairment level should be based on the totality of the circumstances. There should be a reason that we're asking that person to submit to standardized field sobriety tests, something that we've seen that's aroused our suspicion. And it's -the standardized field sobriety tests are a battery of three tests, not any one of which is a stand-alone test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Bollman\u2019s Motion for Mistrial</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u00b611 Prior to the trial, the State filed a motion in limine to prohibit Bollman and defense counsel from referring to the charge in this case as a felony, or referencing the possible penalty for felony DUI. Bollman did not oppose the State\u2019s motion. Bollman filed a motion in limine pursuant to M. R. Evid. 404(b) to exclude \u201cthe mention or testimony regarding other offenses, wrongs or acts besides those charged.\u201d The State did not oppose Bollman\u2019s motion. Both motions were granted. \u00b612 During the course of Officer McConnell\u2019s testimony, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">Q. [by prosecutor]: Okay. You also testified that you weren\u2019t sure if you had transported the Defendant to the Detention Center or if another officer had done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">A. [Officer McConnell]: Usually with felony DUIs -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">[Defense Counsel]: May we approach, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The Court: You may.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b613 After a discussion at the bench, the prosecutor continued with a new line of questioning. Once Officer McConnell finished testifying, and outside the presence of the jury, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOm\">The Court: With regards to his comment, which I don't think was solicited by the State, it was something that the officer testified to, you can make whatever motions you wish, or you can request an instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">I guess my feeling is is to stop and give them some type of a cautionary instruction on why not to consider this as a felony is like asking them not to think about pink elephants, it's the first thing that goes into the jury room. Sometimes I think whatever's left unsaid, if it's just glossed over, becomes-but it's up to you guys to do whatever. They were precluded from raising that issue, and they certainly did raise it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">[Defense Counsel]: Right. And I think, you know, we would ask the Court-obviously I don't have access to anything right now-to do some kind of limiting instruction or-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">The Court: Let me ask you a question, Ms. Nolan. What do you have for witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">[Defense Counsel]: We just have Mr. Bollman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">The Court: And you anticipate him to be how long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">[Defense Counsel]: Just for my direct exam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">The Court: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">[Defense Counsel]: Half an hour, if even.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\">The Court: We will do it today and then we will rest for tonight and come back in the morning for cross-examination, and at that time if you have motions to file or whatever you think would be an adequate remedy I'll entertain it then. But I would suggest that the officer's testimony wouldwras not that this case was-he said something that when we transport a felony, if memory serves me correct. Again, I don't know, it's up to you people what you wish. And then we will let the State respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">\u00b614 After the exchange, the jury was brought back and the State rested its case. Bollman took the stand in his own defense. The defense rested its case after Bollman\u2019s testimony. Once the jury was excused for the evening, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">The Court: With regards to the reference to the felony DUI, it would seem that this was not testimony that was elicited by the State, it was something that just was-eame out with Officer McConnell. And what I would be more interested in anything is if you feel an instruction to be given, which should be given such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>as although there might be speculation that there are prior or other offenses these are not to be considered, something along those lines. But we'll see you in the morning with whatever you have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">[Defense Counsel]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Shortly thereafter, court ended for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b615 The next day, after the jury instructions were settled, the District Court allowed either party to make any motions they wished to make. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">I believe yesterday that Officer McConnell did mention the word felony, violating the State's own motion in limine that said that it wasn't supposed to mention the word felony. Even though it wasn't elicited by the State I think the prejudicial effect is still the same, and for those reasons we'd request we be granted a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b616 The State responded, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">The statement from Officer McConnell was not elicited on a direct question from Ms. Von Jentzen. I think as Your Honor could tell she was surprised by the answer. He did not get the full answer out, as soon as he said the word felony it was shut off and we went to side-bar. Ms. Von Jentzen then came over and moved to a totally different topic. We don't think that that mention is enough to cause a mistrial in this case, we think that if the Defense had wanted they could have given a limiting instruction, they decided not to, and that would have been the remedy, not a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\u00b617 The District Court did not rule on Bollman\u2019s motion at that time. Once the case was submitted to the jury, the District Court denied Bollman\u2019s motion finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">[T]he Court's, I guess, feeling is that the comment was not solicited by the State, it was something that was done inadvertently, or without plan or design by the State. The mere mention of the word felony is not sufficiently prejudicial that I think that it would cause this Court to grant a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">I think the Defense had an opportunity to do a curative instruction if they so desired. I agree with the Defense that that would just reinforce it, but I think that was the proper remedy if a remedy at all was proper, and the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">\u00b618 Bollman was convicted and filed this timely appeal. Bollman raises two issues on appeal, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">\u00b619 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it found Trooper Proctor was qualified to testify as an expert about the correlation between alcohol consumption and horizontal gaze </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>nystagmus (HGN)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b620 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Bollman\u2019s motion for mistrial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b621 We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b622 We review the district court\u2019s determination regarding the qualification and competency of an expert witness for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Harris, </em>2008 MT 213, \u00b6 6, 344 Mont. 208, 186 P.3d 1263. The trial court has <em>\u201cgreat </em>latitude\u201din ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, \u00b6 30, 315 Mont. 480, 68 P.3d 848 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b623 We also review the denial of a motion for mistrial based upon the admission of inadmissible evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gerstner, </em>2009 MT 303, \u00b6 16, 353 Mont. 86, 219 P.3d 866. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employing conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">\u00b624 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it found Trooper Proctor was qualified to testify as an expert about the correlation between alcohol consumption and horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">\u00b625 Bollman argues that Trooper Proctor did not possess the necessary qualifications to testify as an expert on the scientific basis of the HGN test; Tsjpecifically, his training beyond basic training was not specialized or specific enough.\u201d The State argues that there is no list of required credentials, and Trooper Proctor\u2019s credentials are similar to those we have previously held sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">\u00b626  Before the results of the HGN test are admissible, the State must present expert testimony to explain the correlation between alcohol consumption and the presence of nystagmus, i.e. the scientific basis of the HGN test. <em>Hulse v. State, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6\u00b6 69-72, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75; <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 33, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">\u00b627 We have established no \u201cessential requirements\u201dthe witness must possess to testify as an expert on HGN. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 10. We have specifically rejected the requirement that the proposed expert must be a medical professional. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 27. It is clear that basic training on SFSTs is not sufficient to qualify the .officer as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>expert on the scientific basis of the HGN. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71-72. We have also found that basic SFST training, plus a bachelor\u2019s degree in medical technology and work as a lab technician at the Montana State Hospital, did not qualify an officer as an expert on the scientific basis of the HGN test. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b628  We have found the following qualifications, in various combinations, significant: years as a law enforcement officer; relevant college degrees and/or course work; DUI and impairment training, including administration and evaluation of SFSTs; certification as a SFST instructor; certification as a drug recognition expert (DRE); specialized training in eye anatomy and the science behind HGN; study in these areas; and previous qualification as an expert in the underlying scientific basis for the HGN test. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 28. We described the officer\u2019s training and education in <em>Crawford </em>as \u201cextensive.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b629 Trooper Proctor\u2019s credentials are similar to those in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Crawford. </em>Trooper Proctor\u2019s qualifications include: 1) an associate\u2019s degree in criminal justice with introductory courses in both anatomy and biology; 2) basic training at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy on SFSTs; 3) yearly recertification in SFSTs; 4) completing the Advanced Traffic Enforcement Academy; 5) completing a 2-day Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement course, which includes written and practical evaluations of SFST administration; 6) certification as a DRE; 7) completing 8 classroom hours dedicated specifically to the science behind the HGN test, taught by a doctor of optometry; 8) 3.5 years as a Montana Highway Patrol Trooper, including over 100 DUI arrests; 9) continued personal study on the science of HGN; and 10) prior qualification as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b630  Based on these qualifications, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Trooper Proctor was qualified under M. R. Evid. 702 to testify as an expert on the scientific basis of the HGN test.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b631 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Bollman\u2019s motion for mistrial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b632 Bollman argues the District Court should have granted his motion for mistrial after Officer McConnell referenced \u2018felony DUIs\u201d during questioning by the State because the reference was prejudicial and contributed to his conviction. The State argues that the single, unsolicited remark did not prejudice Bollman or render his trial unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u00b633 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for mistrial must be based on whether the defendant has been denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 75, 315 Mont. 452, 69 P.3d 1162. Where there is a reasonable possibility that inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction, a mistrial is appropriate. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 75; <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 82, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363. In determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to a conviction, we consider the strength of the evidence against the defendant, the prejudicial effect of the testimony, and whether a cautionary instruction could cure any prejudice. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 75; <em>Giddings, </em>\u00b6 82; <em>State v. Partin, </em>287 Mont. 12, 18, 951 P.2d 1002, 1005-06 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b634  After reviewing the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude there is no reasonable possibility that Officer McConnell\u2019s statement contributed to Bollman\u2019s conviction. We note that the statement was not solicited by the State, but appears to be an inadvertent remark by Officer McConnell. However, it is undisputed that Officer McConnell\u2019s statement was inadmissible in light of the District Court\u2019s ruling on the State\u2019s motion in limine. We therefore begin by analyzing the strength of the evidence against Bollman. Unlike <em>Partin, </em>in which an officer\u2019s inadmissible statement was \u201cthe only link between Partin and the offense[,]\u201d 287 Mont. at 18, 951 P.2d at 1006, here, disregarding Officer McConnell\u2019s statement about \u201cfelony DUIs,\u2019\u2019there was ample evidence against Bollman including his driving behavior, his performance on the SFSTs, and his own statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b635 We next consider whether the statement was prejudicial. The standard for establishing prejudice is whether a substantial right was denied. <em>State v. Brush, </em>228 Mont. 247, 250-51, 741 P.2d 1333, 1335 (1987). Bollman argues the statement was evidence of his prior DUI convictions. While it is true that felony DUI requires at least 3 prior DUI convictions (see \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA), Officer McConnell did not inform the jury of any of Bollman\u2019s criminal history. The statement cannot reasonably be seen as evidence of Bollman\u2019s criminal history or prior bad acts. The statement was not \u201cdrawn out by the county attorney\u201d nor was the information graphic or detailed. <em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 251, 741 P.2d at 1335. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude any prejudice resulting from the statement was very minor, if it was prejudicial at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b636 Finally, we consider whether a cautionary instruction could have cured any possible prejudice. Bollman argues that any cautionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>instruction would only reinforce the inadmissible testimony, and that the District Court agreed with Bollman\u2019s decision not to seek a cautionary instruction. We have specifically rejected the argument Bollman now makes. <em>Brush, </em>228 Mont. at 251-52, 741 P.2d at 1335-36. Additionally, no matter what the District Court thought of Bollman\u2019s decision, the fact remains that Bollman opted not to seek a cautionary instruction. We will not hold the District Court in error for failing to give a cautionary instruction. <em>In re Marriage of Caras, </em>2012 MT 25, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 32, 270 P.3d 48 (we will not hold a district court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b637 After reviewing the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude there is no reasonable possibility that Officer McConnell\u2019s statement contributed to Bollman\u2019s conviction. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Bollman\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b638 For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> Dr. Citek is actually of doctor of optometry</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> Again, Dr. Citek is a doctor of optometry, not ophthalmology.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
