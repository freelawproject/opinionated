We affirm and address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b62 <em>I. Did the District Court err by holding that the Appellants engage in the \u2018'practice of medicine\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 partnership agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">\u00b63 <em>II. Did the District Court err by concluding there were no issues of material fact in determining the parties\u2019 intention regarding the term \u201cpractice of medicine?\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">\u00b64 The Clinic is a Montana general limited liability partnership comprised of medical professionals. Appellants Thomas J. Krajacich, Mark Johnson, and Rennae Johnson are three licensed clinical psychologists who were former partners in the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u00b65 The Clinic has been operating in Great Falls since 1916, and its partners have worked under various partnership agreements. In August 2004, the Clinic partners, including Appellants, signed a \u2018Restated Partnership Agreement\u201d (Agreement), effective August 25, 2004. Central to this dispute are Articles 6.1 and 6.2(b) of the Agreement. Article 6.1 provides that a partner who separates from the partnership in compliance with the Agreement\u2019s terms will receive his or her \u2018Partnership Interest,\u201d inclusive of operational profits and capital contributions. However, this payment is subject to a reduction pursuant to Article 6.2(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">6.2 Exceptions for Certain Separations. For Separations and circumstances described below, the payment made to a Partner for the Partner\u2019s Partnership Interest will not include payment for the Partner\u2019s interest in the Montana Care, Great Falls Surgery Center, and Accounts Receivable accounts and the Partner forfeits and waives any interest in these accounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">(b) Competing After Withdrawal or Retirement. If a Partner\u2019s Separation is pursuant to an Event of Separation ... and at anytime during the period of three years following his or her Separation the Partner enters into or engages in the <em>practice of medicine </em>in the county in which he or she primarily practiced while a Partner or in any contiguous county thereof, ... the separating Partner shall forfeit all interest whatsoever in the Montana Care, Great Falls Surgery Center, and Accounts Receivable accounts and shall receive no payment whatsoever for his or her interests in said accounts. [Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b66 The psychologists separated from the Clinic in August 2010 and thereafter filed a declaratory judgment action when the Clinic refused to pay them their full partnership interest payments. They filed a motion for summary judgment which admitted they were \u201cpracticing psychologists in Cascade County,\u201d but argued that \u201cArticle 6.2 of the Agreement places no restriction on any partners practicing psychology anywhere after they separate from the Clinic, but only places a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>restriction on partners who engage in the \u2018practice of medicine.\u2019 \u2019\u2019The Clinic answered and likewise moved for summary judgment, arguing the psychologists were \u201cpracticing in Cascade County the specialty practiced while partners\u201d and that Article 6.2(b) of the Agreement applied to them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b67 After a hearing, the District Court granted the Clinic\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, concluding that Article 6.2(b) of the Agreement, which reduced their partnership interest payment, was applicable to the psychologists. The psychologists appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b68 \u2018We review a district court\u2019s rulings on summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56.\u201d <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, </em>LLP, 2009 MT 426, \u00b6 19, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230 <em>(citing Paull v. Park Co., </em>2009 MT 321, \u00b6 17, 352 Mont. 465, 218 P.3d 1198). \u2018Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, Inc. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283 (citations omitted). A material fact is one that concerns the elements of the cause of action or defenses at issue to an extent that requires resolution of the issue by a trier of fact. <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr. Monk, Inc., </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111 (citation omitted). \u2018The district court\u2019s conclusion that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Hinderman v. Krivor, </em>2010 MT 230, \u00b6 13, 358 Mont. 111, 244 P.3d 306 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b69 <em>I. Did the District Court err by holding that the Appellants engage in the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d as used in the parties\u2019 partnership agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\u00b610 The District Court determined that the language of the subject provision was not ambiguous and there was no indication the parties intended the term \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d to have any meaning other than its common and ordinary usage, which includes the practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>psychology. Alternatively, the court reasoned that even if the term \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d was considered under a technical, statutory definition, the term nonetheless included non-physician psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"AhN\">\u00b611 Appellants argue that the District Court erred because they are not engaged in the \u201cpractice of medicine.\u201d They argue that \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is a technical term and offer a lengthy statutory analysis to establish that the term applies only to licensed physicians. However, we conclude that the intention of the Agreement is clear by its own terms, which does not incorporate statutory definitions, and that reference to statute is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b612  A partnership agreement is \u201can agreement, written or oral, among the partners concerning the partnership.\u201dSection 35-10-102(6), MCA. \u2018Montana law provides that when a partnership agreement exists, it controls the rights and duties of partners.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>1998 MT 303, \u00b6 50, 292 Mont. 97, 971 P.2d 767; <em>accord </em>\u00a735-10-106(1), MCA (except for limitations not applicable here, \u201ca partnership agreement governs relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership\u201d). \u201cA partnership agreement is essentially a contract between the partners and, therefore, is to be interpreted and applied in accordance with principles of contract law.\u201d <em>Bolinger, </em>\u00b6 54 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b613 The interpretation and construction of a contract is a question of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 30 (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018A contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 30 (quoting \u00a728-3-301, MCA). When a contract is in writing, the parties\u2019 intentions are to be determined from the writing alone, if possible. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing \u00a728-3-303, MCA); <em>State ex rel. Mont. Dept. of Transp. v. Asbeck, </em>2003 MT 337, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 431, 80 P.3d 1272 (citation omitted) (\u2018in interpreting a written contract, the intention of the parties is ascertained \u2018first and foremost\u2019 from the writing alone\u201d). \u201c\u2018The whole of a contract is to be taken together so as to give effect to every part if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richards v. JTL Group, Inc., </em>2009 MT 173, \u00b6 14, 350 Mont. 516, 212 P.3d 264 (quoting \u00a7 28-3-202, MCA). \u2018It is [a] well-established principle of contractual construction that in interpreting a written instrument, the court will not isolate certain phrases of the instrument to garner the intent of the parties, but will grasp the instrument by its four corners and in the light of the entire instrument, ascertain the paramount and guiding intent of the parties. Mere isolated tracts, clauses and words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>will not be allowed to prevail over the general language utilized in the instrument.\u201d <em>Rumph v. Dale Edwards, Inc., </em>183 Mont. 359, 368, 600 P.2d 163, 168 (1979) (citations omitted); <em>accord Sandtana, Inc. v. Wallin Ranch Co., </em>2003 MT 329, \u00b6 26, 318 Mont. 369, 80 P.3d 1224 (citations omitted). \u2018Particular clauses of a contract are subordinate to its general intent.\u201d Section 28-3-307, MCA. Moreover, contract terms that are inconsistent with the general nature of the contract or the primary intention of the parties are to be rejected. Section 28-3-503, MCA; <em>Rumph, </em>183 Mont. at 369, 600 P.2d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b614 Article 1.4 of the Agreement states that \u201c[t]he business of the Partnership will be to (i) <em>provide professional medical services and services ancillary thereto-, </em>(ii) conduct all business and financial activities related or incidental to the foregoing; and (iii) conduct any other legal business or financial activities approved by the Partnership.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Article 1.7 defines \u2018Partner\u201d as \u201ca person who has been admitted as a partner in the Partnership as provided in this Agreement, who has agreed in writing to be bound by this Agreement, and with respect to whom an Event of Separation has not occurred.\u201d Thus, \u201cpartner\u201d is defined as a person, not a physician, and notably, \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is not defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b615  Article 5.5 states that Ta]ll fees or funds resulting from or received by a Partner as payment for the <em>performance of professional services or professional activities </em>by such Partner shall accrue and belong to the Partnership.\u201d(Emphasis added.) Article 8.4 specifies that \u2018It] his Agreement shall be <em>binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties </em>hereto,... and shall supersede and revoke any prior agreements establishing the Partnership and involving any or all of the parties to this Agreement. ... The following parties execute the foregoing Restated Partnership Agreement on the date appearing opposite his or her name <em>intending to be bound </em>by this Restated Partnership Agreement ....\u201d (Emphases added.) Clearly, the Agreement does not differentiate between partners based upon their profession, and by signing the Agreement, the psychologists intended to be bound to the Agreement\u2019s terms as partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b616 Appellants argue under Article 1.4, which states that the business of the Partnership is to \u201cprovide professional medical services and services ancillary thereto,\u201d that \u201cphysicians were to provide \u2018professional medical services,\u2019 whereas, the Psychologists would provide \u2018services ancillary thereto.\u2019 \u2019\u2019However, this proffered division of labor is of the Appellants\u2019 own making. We agree with the District Court that the Agreement itself makes no such distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>physicians and psychologists. We are bound to interpret an instrument by its terms or substance without inserting or omitting language. Section 1-4-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b617 Appellants contend that the District Court \u201cwas required to interpret the meaning of \u2018practice of medicine\u2019 in its technical sense because that phrase has been specifically defined in \u00a737-3-102(8), MCA.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) However, we reiterate the well-established interpretational principle that \u201cwords of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense rather than according to their strict legal meaning unless used by the parties in a technical sense or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.\u201d Section 28-3-501, MCA; <em>Dollar Plus Stores, Inc. v. R-Montana Assocs., L.P., </em>2009 MT 164, \u00b6 17, 350 Mont. 476, 209 P.3d 216; <em>SVKV, L.L.C. v. Harding, </em>2006 MT 297, \u00b6 42, 334 Mont. 395, 148 P.3d 584; <em>see also Arcadia Fin., Ltd. v. Prestige Toyota, </em>1999 MT 273, \u00b6 20, 296 Mont. 494, 989 P.2d 831. The term \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is only used in Article 6.2(b) of the Agreement, without any indication that the parties intended to give the term a technical meaning. During the hearing, the District Court asked, \u201cwhere is an indication on the face of this contract that the parties intended a technical, legal meaning of the term \u2018practice of medicine\u2019 as opposed to the popular meaning of the term?\u201d Counsel answered that the statutes served that purpose, but conceded: \u2018Well, there\u2019s nothing in there, from my review, 50 times or whatever it is, except they use the phrase \u2018practice of medicine.\u2019... There isn\u2019t anything more than that.\u201d <em>SeeAsbeck, </em>\u00b6 19 (\u2018There is no reason for the courts to narrow the language of the [agreement] by application of a statutory definition when the parties chose not to do so themselves.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A97\">\u00b618  The Agreement discusses the medical purposes of the Partnership broadly and generally, as \u201cprovid[ing] professional medical services and services ancillary thereto\u201d and the \u201cperformance of professional services or professional activities.\u201d No exclusions or distinctions among the professions are made by the Agreement. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>have previously consulted dictionaries to determine the common use and meaning of terms. <em>Dollar Plus Stores, </em>Inc., \u00b6 20; <em>Myers v. Dee, </em>2011 MT 244, \u00b6 22, 362 Mont. 178, 261 P.3d 1054 (citations omitted). Generally, \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he treatment of injuries as well as the discovery of the cause and nature of disease, and the administration of remedies, or the prescribing of treatment therefor.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1055 (5th ed., West 1979). In turn, \u201ctreatment\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] broad term covering all the steps taken to effect a cure of an injury or disease; including examination and diagnosis as well as application of remedies.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1346. The ordinary and common usage of the term \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is thus broad enough to include the practice of psychology. \u00b619 Appellants appear to argue that the District Court erred in holding the Agreement language was not ambiguous. Before the District Court and on appeal, Appellants have asserted that the Agreement unambiguously excludes psychologists from the \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d but argue the Clinic created an ambiguity by offering the opposite interpretation. However, \u201c \u2018a conclusion of ambiguity is not compelled by the fact that the parties to a document, or their attorneys, have or suggest opposing interpretations of a contract, or even disagree as to whether the contract is reasonably open to just one interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States, Coops., Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851 (quoting Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>vol. 11 \u00a730:4, at 51-54 (4th ed., West 1999) (footnotes omitted)). \u2018Whether an ambiguity exists in a contract is a matter of law. An ambiguity\u2019s existence must be determined on an objective basis <em>.\u2019\u2019Richards, </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted). An ambiguity exists when the contract language, taken as a whole, could reasonably be given two different meanings. <em>Richards, </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted). We agree with the District Court that the language of the Agreement is unambiguous. \u201cWhere the language of a contract is unambiguousfi.e., reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation-the duty of the court is to apply the language as written.\u201d <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 32 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b620 Appellants argue that they did not have equal power to amend the term \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d in the Agreement since there were far more Partners who were physicians than psychologists, and offer the proposition that \u201c[n]o party to a contract has a duty to question, challenge or object to the language in an agreement which someone else drafted and which is beneficial to the non-drafter.\u201d Appellants cite no specific authority for this proposition, except to distinguish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>District Court\u2019s citation to <em>Mungas. </em>M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f) requires a party to cite to relevant authority in support of the party\u2019s appellate argument, <em>Frank v. Collins, </em>2011 MT 315, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 110, 266 P.3d 1271 (citation omitted), and we decline to consider this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b621  After considering the Agreement as a whole, giving effect to every part, and \u201cascertain[ing] the paramount and guiding intent of the parties\u201d from \u201cthe entire instrument,\u201d <em>Rumph, </em>183 Mont. at 368, 600 P.2d at 168, we conclude the District Court correctly held that Article 6.2(b) applies to the psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b622 <em>II. Did the District Court err by concluding there were no issues of material fact in determining the parties\u2019 intention regarding the term \u201cpractice of medicine?\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b623 Alternatively, Appellants contend that the grant of summary judgment to the Clinic is improper because genuine issues of material fact remain about the intention of the parties regarding the term \u201cpractice of medicine.\u201d Appellants filed affidavits referencing comments made by certain Clinic professionals that psychologists did not practice medicine and therefore Article 6.2(b) was inapplicable to them. The Clinic offered affidavits from a number of physicians stating their intention was to include the psychologists within the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"Akc\">\u00b624  \u201c \u2018A material fact is a fact that involves the elements of the cause of action or defenses at issue to an extent that necessitates resolution of the issue by a trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 24 (citation omitted). Testimony of the parties\u2019 intentions regarding the term \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d would be material if the Agreement was ambiguous. \u2018It is true that, when a contract term is ambiguous, interpretation of the term involves determining a question of fact regarding the intent of the parties to the contract. The initial determination of whether an ambiguity exists in a contract, however, is a question of law for a court to determine.\u201d <em>Wurl v. Poison Sch. Dist. No. 23, </em>2006 MT 8, \u00b6 17, 330 Mont. 282, 127 P.3d 436 (citations omitted). However, we have already determined that the disputed language is not ambiguous. Therefore, the interpretation of the Agreement is a question of law rather than fact, and the parties\u2019 intentions are to be determined from the writing alone, if possible. Section 28-3-303, MCA. Here, as in <em>Baker Revocable Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 77-79, the disputed phrase is clear, explicit, and does not involve an absurdity. The intention of the parties can be gleaned from the language alone. Consequently, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cpractice of medicine,\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"AeC\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\"> This provision of the Agreement was the subject of prior litigation. <em>See Mungas v.
