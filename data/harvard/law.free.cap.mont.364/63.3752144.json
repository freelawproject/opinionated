We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u00b62 Norris raises the following dispositive issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined that the pre-trial circumstances warranted excluding a treating physician\u2019s testimony regarding the appropriate standard of care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">\u00b64 Kathryn contracted a viral infection eight months into her pregnancy with T.M.N. Doctors advised an immediate C-section. Doctors delivered T.M.N. through C-section the next day on October 11, 2001. The treating pediatrician, Dr. Tom Strizich (Strizich), admitted T.M.N. to the Special Care Nursing unit later that same day following a cyanotic episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">\u00b65 Strizich ordered an IV with glucose. He also directed that T.M.N.\u2019s blood glucose be tested the morning of October 12,2001. T.M.N.\u2019s blood glucose test revealed a reading of 63. Strizich responded to the 63 result by increasing the rate of the IV infusion and thereby increasing the amount of glucose that T.M.N. was receiving. He ordered a retesting of T.M.N.\u2019s glucose for the morning of October 13, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">\u00b66 Strizich served at that time in the same pediatric clinic as Dr. John Reynolds (Reynolds) and Dr. Blayne Fritz (Fritz). Reynolds took over T.M.N.\u2019s care on the evening of October 12, 2001. Reynolds was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>caring for T.M.N. when the second glucose lab result arrived. The second lab result showed a glucose level of 38. The lab report identified the 38 level as \u201ccritical.\u201d The 38 level prompted lab employees to call the results to the nursing floor. Reynolds discontinued the IV and ordered no re-testing of T.M.N.\u2019s glucose after T.M.N. began breastfeeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b67 Fritz took over T.M.N.\u2019s care at noon on October 13, 2001. Fritz had been made aware of T.M.N.\u2019s earlier glucose results. Fritz did not restart the IV or order any follow-up tests. Fritz testified that he could monitor a baby\u2019s glucose level by visual inspection. He further testified that he believed that T.M.N. would receive sufficient glucose from his mother\u2019s milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b68 A nurse found T.M.N. flaccid and unresponsive the morning of October 14, 2001. Fritz ordered a glucose lab test. The test result revealed that T.M.N.\u2019s glucose level was zero. Doctors administered glucose. T.M.N.\u2019s body began recovering after several hours, but he soon began having seizures. Doctors life-flighted T.M.N. to Benefis Hospital in Great Falls after he stabilized. T.M.N. suffered severe, permanent development issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b69 Norris filed a complaint on May 5, 2005, against Reynolds, Fritz, and St. Peter\u2019s Hospital (collectively Defendants). District Judge Thomas Honzel assumed jurisdiction. The parties conducted extensive discovery. Pretrial proceedings continued for a number of months into years. These proceedings included a 2005 deposition of Strizich. Counsel for Norris and Defendants questioned Strizich at the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b610 The parties identified their lay and expert witnesses in September, October, and November of 2006. Norris filed an expert disclosure that identified all of T.M.N.\u2019s treating physicians. Defendants filed motions in limine in March 2007 to prevent the treating physicians from providing opinion testimony. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b611 The court determined that the treating physicians could provide expert testimony. The court noted that the treating physicians \u201cwere not retained ... in advance of or for purposes of litigation\u201d so an expert disclosure under M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) was unnecessary. The order implied that the disclosure provided by Norris was wholly consistent with the scope of the treating physician\u2019s allowable testimony. The court concluded its order with the somewhat contradictory directive that Defendants could object at trial if \u2018Plaintiffs are attempting to elicit opinions from the treating physicians beyond what is set out in the Plaintiffs disclosure....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u00b612 Fritz\u2019s counsel filed another motion in limine in November 2008, after Judge Honzel\u2019s March 2007 order, to prevent the treating physicians from providing standard of care testimony. Norris\u2019s counsel filed a brief in opposition to that motion in December 2008. Neither party has cited any ruling by the District Court as to this motion in limine. And nothing in the record indicates whether the District Court provided any ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b613 Judge Honzel retired on December 31,2008. District Judge Kathy Seeley assumed jurisdiction of the case. Norris settled with Reynolds and St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in 2009. The settlement left Fritz as the sole defendant. The court granted Fritz\u2019s motion for leave to re-depose certain treating physicians. Fritz did not seek to depose Strizich a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b614 The case went to trial on July 19,2010. Norris\u2019s counsel described during her opening statement the events that culminated in T.M.N.\u2019s developmental injury. She specifically described the treatment offered by Strizich. She further informed the jury that Strizich would testify that a glucose level of 50 represents \u2018his threshold for a baby like [T.M.N.].\u201d She also stated that Strizich would testify that T.M.N. was hypoglycemic when the test results of October 13, 2001, revealed a glucose level of 38. Norris called Strizich as her first witness on July 21, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b615 Before trial started that morning, however, Fritz moved to limit the scope of Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony. Fritz argued that he had become aware only during Norris\u2019s opening statement that Strizich would testify that he considered a sick newborn with a 50 glucose level to be at risk. Norris countered that Strizich would testify only to the standard of care for blood glucose level, but would not state specifically that Fritz had violated that standard in his treatment of T.M.N. The District Court granted Fritz\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b616 The court directed Strizich not to testify as to any standard of care. The court limited Strizich to testify as to his own personal practice. The District Court also instructed the jury that a physician\u2019s testimony regarding his personal practice does not establish a general medical standard of care. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Fritz. Norris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b617 We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony. <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2011 MT 223, \u00b6 18, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined that the pre-trial circumstances warranted excluding a treating physician\u2019s testimony regarding the appropriate standard of care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b619 Montana R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) governs expert disclosures. It allows a party, through interrogatories, to require the opposing party to disclose certain information regarding his expert and the expert\u2019s predicted testimony. M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4). These disclosure requirements eliminate surprise and promote effective cross-examination of expert witnesses. <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County, </em>276 Mont. 329, 333, 916 P.2d 91, 93 (1996). Absent such disclosures, a party would incur difficulty in ascertaining the particular approach of an adversarial expert. <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 72, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. Disclosure provides a party sufficient information and time, therefore, to plan effectively for cross-examination and to obtain an expert to refute the adversarial expert\u2019s testimony. <em>Superior Enters. LLC v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2002 MT 139, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 198, 49 P.3d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b620 Notably, M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) limits disclosure requirements to retained experts. Its language restricts the provision\u2019s application to \u2018facts known and opinions held by experts ... acquired or developed <em>in anticipation of litigation or for trial....\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). This language, when adopted, mirrored its federal counterpart. The Federal Advisory Committee noted that Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) had limited application when it adopted the rule. It stated that the rule \u201cdoes not address itself to the expert whose information was not acquired in preparation for trial but rather because he was an actor or viewer with respect to transactions or occurrences that are part of the subject matter of the lawsuit.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. Comments (1970). The Committee determined that \u2018tsjuch an expert should be treated as an ordinary witness.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. Comments (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">\u00b621 The rule\u2019s limited application supports the idea that the purpose underlying expert disclosure simply does not apply to non-retained experts. The M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) disclosures and pre-trial depositions provide a party\u2019s only access to an adversarial, retained expert\u2019s identity and opinions. A retained expert\u2019s identity could remain unknown and his opinions unattainable until the expert disclosure deadline within a scheduling order. <em>See, e.g., Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b622 In contrast, a non-retained expert\u2019s role in the factual scenario makes his identity well known to both parties and his opinions more readily available. A non-retained expert typically will be a hybrid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>witness. This witness possesses personal knowledge of factual events relevant to the case. He also possesses specialized training that allows him to formulate expert opinions regarding those factual events. His involvement usually stems from his profession thereby making his expertise obvious. His opinions largely are ascertainable, therefore, and useful to any party who seeks them.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b623 Courts from various jurisdictions recognize this concept, particularly with treating physicians. The California Supreme Court noted that treating physicians-who are inherently hybrid witnesses-ean be identified early in the litigation through interrogatories or through discovery of the plaintiffs medical records. <em>Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser, </em>989 P.2d 720, 725 (Cal. 1999). Opposing counsel also possesses a strong incentive to depose a treating physician early in the litigation to ascertain his opinions. Opposing counsel can use the treating physician\u2019s opinion in order to assess the viability of the plaintiffs claims. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 725. The treating physician\u2019s opinions are well known to opposing counsel long before the deadline for expert disclosures. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 725. The court accordingly concluded that the rules governing disclosure of an expert\u2019s opinions do not apply to treating physicians. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b624  Other courts also have determined that concerns regarding the unfair surprise that accompanies an undisclosed expert do not apply to treating physicians. For example, the Utah Supreme Court recognized a party\u2019s ability to subpoena medical records to identify treating physicians. <em>Drew v. Lee, </em>250 P.3d 48, 55 (Utah 2011). These medical records generally will provide greater information than any expert disclosure. The abundant information available through a party\u2019s medical records negates claims of unfair surprise from a treating physician\u2019s testimony. <em>Drew, </em>250 P.3d at 55. <em>Drew </em>and <em>Schreiber </em>reached this conclusion in the context of a plaintiff asking the treating physician to opine as to the cause of the plaintiffs personal injury outside the medical malpractice realm. We agree with these courts that the heightened disclosure requirements of the opinions to be offered by retained experts do not apply to non-retained, treating physicians under these circumstances. <em>Schrieber, </em>989 P.2d at 725; <em>Drew, </em>250 P.3d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b625 Few courts have addressed, however, whether a treating physician remains a hybrid witness when opining on the standard of care in medical malpractice cases. The Iowa Supreme Court has determined that, in ordinary circumstances, a treating physician may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>not testify on the standard of care without a full expert disclosure. <em>Cox v. Jones, </em>470 N.W.2d 23, 25 (Iowa 1991). In such circumstances, a physician\u2019s opinion regarding standard of care does not represent an obvious line of deposition inquiry, and thus, disclosure is required to prevent unfair surprise. <em>See Hansen v. C.Hosp. Corp., </em>686 N.W.2d 476, 481-82 (Iowa 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b626 The rule stems from the notion that a \u201cphysician <em>ordinarily </em>is not required to formulate such an opinion in order to treat the patient.\u201d <em>Hansen, </em>686 N.W.2d at 482 (emphasis added). Nansen\u2019s statement that an expert disclosure \u201cmay\u201dbe required and that disclosure \u201cordinarily\u201d is necessary suggests, however, that a treating physician may be required occasionally to develop an opinion regarding standard of care in his treatment of the patient. <em>See Hansen, </em>686 N.W.2d at 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b627 Several courts have recognized expressly that a physician may develop an opinion regarding standard of care in his treatment of the patient. The Illinois Supreme Court ratified the \u201ctreating physician\u201d exception to the expert disclosure requirement in <em>Boatmen\u2019s Natl. Bank v. Martin, </em>614 N.E.2d 1194, 1201 (Ill. 1993). The Illinois court permitted a non-disclosed, treating physician to opine on the standard of care in a medical malpractice case. The court reasoned that the treating physician had offered this expert testimony based on information that he had acquired through his treatment of the plaintiff. The court cited the central role that the treating physician had played in the plaintiffs treatment to support the likelihood that he would have formed an opinion as to the cause of plaintiff s injury. <em>Boatmen\u2019s Natl. Bank, </em>614 N.E.2d at 1203. The treating physician further testified that he had formed his opinion when he had first examined the plaintiff, based on his own knowledge and experience, and well before the prospect of litigation had developed. <em>Boatmen\u2019s Natl. Bank, </em>614 N.E.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b628 The California Supreme Court has offered similar reasoning. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726. The California court disagreed with an appellate court\u2019s determination that \u201ca treating physician could never, regardless of the manner in which he obtained the factual basis of his opinion, testify as to the standard of care....\u201d <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726. A treating physician\u2019s ability to testify as to standard of care instead would be determined by whether the physician formulated the opinion during medical treatment. <em>See Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726. Under these circumstances, prudent counsel would inquire during a deposition whether the treating physician had developed an opinion regarding the standard of care. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726. An opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>formulated by the physician regarding the standard of care in this context would be inherent to his treatment of the patient. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b629  Strizich\u2019s role required that he formulate an opinion regarding the requisite standard of care for treating T.M.N. even before the alleged negligence occurred. Strizich had to determine what standard of care needed to be employed to monitor T.M.N.\u2019s glucose level when he initiated T.M.N.\u2019s treatment. As a result, Strizich developed his opinion regarding standard of care in the context of patient treatment rather than in the context of litigation. Strizich accordingly remains a hybrid witness even for the purposes of standard of care testimony. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b630 Strizich\u2019s proffered testimony nevertheless required some disclosure to prevent unfair surprise. Indeed, the federal rules address squarely the issue of unfair surprise stemming from hybrid witness testimony. The federal rule distinguishes between the disclosure of the identity of a hybrid witness and disclosure of a hybrid witness\u2019s opinions. Federal R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A) requires a party to disclose the identity of <em>all </em>witnesses who will provide expert testimony. Retained experts must additionally provide a report that includes \u201ca complete statement of all opinions.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). Non-retained experts, in contrast, must provide only a summary of their expected testimony. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(C). Federal R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)\u2019s requirement that the identity of non-retained experts be disclosed, and the general nature of that expert\u2019s opinion, prevents unfair surprise. This same provision acknowledges that comprehensive disclosure for non-retained experts is unnecessary to prevent unfair surprise. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b631 The language of M. R. Civ. P. 26 fails to provide the same level of clarity. Montana R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) dictates the permissible disclosure for retained experts. This disclosure includes the identity of retained experts, the opinions of these retained experts, and the basis of those opinions. M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4). Our rules do not provide, however, any disclosure requirements for either identity or opinions of non-retained experts. M. R. Civ. P. 26(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b632 Absent an express rule, we must review the pre-trial circumstances to determine whether sufficient notice existed of the non-retained expert\u2019s identity and any opinions to be offered by the non-retained expert to prevent unfair surprise. <em>Faulconbridge v. State, </em>2006 MT 198, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 333 Mont. 186, 142 P.3d 777. We attempted in <em>Faulconbridge </em>to explain the distinction between retained experts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>non-retained experts. A full M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) disclosure must be made for retained experts. <em>Faulconbridge, </em>\u00b6 43. This same disclosure does not apply to non-retained experts. <em>See Faulconbridge, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44. We suggested, however, that the opposing party should have adequate notice of the non-retained expert\u2019s testimony in order to be admissible. <em>See Faulconbridge, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"Arh\">\u00b633 The inquiry should focus on whether the objecting party had adequate notice of the non-retained expert\u2019s proposed testimony. The discussion in <em>Faulconbridge </em>parallels the principle established through M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)4;hat opposing counsel have adequate notice of the identity of an expert and the expert\u2019s opinions to prevent unfair surprise. The standard also recognizes, though, that the comprehensive disclosure requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) regarding an expert\u2019s opinion are not necessary to prevent unfair surprise when a hybrid witness provides expert testimony. <em>See Ostermiller v. Alvord, </em>222 Mont. 208, 212, 720 P.2d 1198, 1201 (1986). \u00b634 Our discussion in <em>Faulconbridge </em>proved central to Judge Honzel\u2019s 2007 order that allowed expert testimony from T.M.N.\u2019s treating physicians. Norris\u2019s expert disclosure noted that the treating physicians were \u2018hybrid witnesses\u201d who need not be disclosed under Montana law. Norris identified all of T.M.N.\u2019s treating physicians individually, including Strizich, as potential witnesses in her M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) disclosure in order to \u201cprovide full disclosure and no surprise to the Defendants.\u201d Judge Honzel\u2019s order in 2007 agreed that the treating physicians qualified as hybrid witnesses who were not retained for litigation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b635 Fritz contends that Judge Honzel\u2019s original scheduling order required Norris to \u201cdisclose expert witnesses together with Rule 26(b)(4), M. R. Civ. P., expert disclosures.\u201dWe agreed in <em>Sunburst </em>that a disclosure requirement pursuant to an M. R. Civ. P. 16 order \u201ccarried the same effect as would a party\u2019s interrogatory\u201d that requested disclosure of expert witnesses pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4), and thereby negated \u201cthe need for either party to file interrogatories.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 70. The district court excluded testimony from several of Texaco\u2019s retained expert witnesses due to Texaco\u2019s failure to provide full expert disclosures pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4). We affirmed. <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 73. Here, of course, Strizich represents a hybrid witness based on his role as a treating physician for T.M.N. Montana R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4) limits full disclosure requirements to retained experts. Norris never retained Strizich.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b636 Fritz does not contend that Norris failed to provide sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>notice as to Strizich\u2019s identity. He argues instead that Norris failed to provide sufficient notice as to Strizich\u2019s opinions. Fritz contends that Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony regarding the standard of care for an infant\u2019s glucose level exceeded the scope of Judge Honzel\u2019s order. He further notes that Norris\u2019s disclosure fails to identify a level-specific blood glucose standard. Fritz claims that he first became aware of this standard, and Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony about it, during Norris\u2019s opening argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b637 It would be difficult to conclude, based on the totality of the pretrial circumstances, that Fritz lacked sufficient notice of Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony on standard of care to prevent unfair surprise. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726. The disclosure submitted by Norris on October 16, 2006, stated that Strizich, as a treating physician, would testify as to the standard of care that he would employ generally. Similar to any treating physician, Strizich presumably would not create his own standard of care out of whole cloth. Strizich\u2019s standard of care instead likely would conform to his medical training, current medical literature, and to national practice. <em>Chapel v. Allison, </em>241 Mont. 83, 92, 785 P.2d 204, 213 (1989). Cross-examination normally would reveal any faulty basis on which Strizich relied in opining as to standard of care. <em>N. Plains Resource Council v. Bd. of Nat. Resources &amp; Conserv., </em>181 Mont. 500, 537, 594 P.2d 297, 317 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b638 Fritz\u2019s access to T.M.N.\u2019s medical records, particularly when the records catalog Strizich\u2019s own treatment, further negates Fritz\u2019s claim of unfair surprise at the prospect that Strizich would testify as to the standard of care for a newborn\u2019s blood glucose level. <em>Drew, </em>250 P.3d at 55; <em>Boatmen\u2019s Natl. Bank, </em>614 N.E.2d at 1201. These medical records contain several reports prepared specifically by Strizich. The records further detail Strizich\u2019s care of T.M.N. through notes prepared by assisting nurses and lab reports requested by Strizich. Strizich\u2019s opinion regarding the appropriate standard of care, therefore, should have been relatively obvious given his actions to treat T.M.N. <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b639 Any ambiguity within these records readily could have been clarified through proper inquiry at Strizich\u2019s deposition. Strizich also opined in that deposition, without objection, that a newborn infant with a glucose level of 40 would be hypoglycemic. Norris\u2019s counsel highlighted this opinion by Strizich in her opening statement. Strizich also testified that a glucose level of 63 presented a normal level for an infant. Strizich believed that the threshold for risk, therefore, fell clearly between a glucose level of 40 and 63. Fritz never inquired as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>where Strizich specifically considered that the risk level fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b640 Strizich repeatedly referred to his \u201cstandard teaching and training\u201d and to \u2018the teaching\u201d that he had received in responding to questions. Some of these questions dealt specifically with matters related to blood glucose levels in newborns. Strizich\u2019s references to \u201cstandard teaching and training\u201d and \u2018the teaching\u201d that he had received paraphrases the standard of care. Fritz\u2019s counsel left the matter hanging and took no steps to clarify when given the opportunity at Strizich\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b641 Fritz later moved to re-depose various treating physicians after both parties had filed expert disclosures. The District Court granted Fritz\u2019s motion. Fritz did not re-depose Strizich. Fritz made this decision despite Strizich\u2019s central role in T.M.N.\u2019s treatment and despite Norris\u2019s expert disclosure that indicated Strizich would testify to his standard of care in treating T.M.N. As noted by the court in <em>Schreiber, </em>defendants have a strong incentive to depose treating physicians \u201cto ascertain whether their observations and conclusions support the plaintiffs allegations.\u201d <em>Schreiber, </em>989 P.2d at 725. Fritz declined this second opportunity to depose Strizich.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b642 Fritz himself actually admitted standard of care testimony from Dr. Donald Wight, who treated T.M.N. at Benefis Hospital. Neither party had disclosed Wight as an expert witness. Fritz nevertheless took advantage of the inquiry by N orris\u2019s counsel at Wight\u2019s deposition as to whether Wight had formed an opinion regarding the care that Fritz had provided to T.M.N. Fritz successfully moved the District Court, over Norris\u2019s objection, to admit those portions of Wight\u2019s deposition that contained his standard of care opinion. Neither Fritz nor Norris asked Strizich during his deposition for his opinion regarding standard of care. In effect, Fritz seeks to distinguish the admissibility of opinion testimony from a treating physician on the basis of whether either counsel inquired on the matter during the treating physician\u2019s deposition. We decline to encourage counsel, plaintiffs or defendant\u2019s, to avoid obvious standard of care issues during a discovery deposition in order to claim unfair surprise at trial. We agree with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant cannot claim unfair surprise when he could have inquired, at a deposition, into the treating physician\u2019s opinions. <em>See Savage v. Correlated Health Services, </em>591 N.E.2d 1216, 1220 (Ohio 1992). As was the case with Strizich\u2019s testimony, the Ohio court determined that unfair surprise proved a difficult claim to substantiate when the \u201ctestimony on [the relevant issues] was fairly predictable.\u201d <em>Savage, </em>591 N.E.2d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u00b643  Fritz reasonably cannot claim prejudice from Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony regarding a newborn\u2019s blood glucose level. This testimony related to a central issue in the casewvhether Fritz violated the established standard of care for pediatricians by failing to monitor T.M.N.\u2019s glucose levels adequately. Fritz clearly had identified T.M.N.\u2019s blood glucose level to constitute a central issue for the jury\u2019s consideration. Fritz presented three separate experts who opined on the requisite standard of care regarding blood glucose levels. These experts functioned as a sufficient rebuttal to Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b644 Finally, any surprise claimed by Fritz derives from his narrow interpretation of Judge Honzel\u2019s order. Fritz contends that Judge Honzel\u2019s order allowed Strizich to testify only as to his personal practice. This argument interprets Judge Honzel\u2019s order, however, as authorizing largely irrelevant and inadmissible testimony. A medical malpractice plaintiff must establish that a physician\u2019s conduct breached a national standard of care. Chapel, 241 Mont, at 92, 785 P.2d at 213. A physician\u2019s individual practice, when not based on national standards, lacks relevance to a medical malpractice case. <em>Collins v. Itoh, </em>160 Mont. 461, 469, 503 P.2d 36, 41 (1972). Fritz\u2019s counsel argued this point extensively in opposing Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony on standard of care. Fritz\u2019s interpretation of Judge Honzel\u2019s order, however, would have allowed Strizich to offer only testimony that likely could have been excluded as inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 402. <em>Collins, </em>160 Mont. at 469, 503 P.2d at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b645 Fritz alternatively argues that Strizich lacked the expertise to offer an expert opinion on blood glucose levels. He notes that Strizich could not explain in his deposition the cause of glucose problems present in newborns. For example, Strizich could not say with certainty whether the body uses more glucose if the infant is under distress. Strizich admitted in his deposition to little knowledge regarding glucose storage in infants at birth. Strizich also could not explain why unhealthy newborns are more likely to have a problem with glucose. Strizich further conceded in his deposition that depletion rates for glycogen stores following birth was \u201cout of my expertise.\u201d Fritz cites similar examples from Strizich\u2019s deposition to contend that he lacked the requisite expertise to opine on the appropriate standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b646 The examples cited by Fritz demonstrate that Strizich admittedly could not explain the pathophysiology that underlies glucose depletion in newborns. Strizich\u2019s inability to explain why a medical condition occurs, however, does not necessarily prevent him from possessing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>expertise on the necessary medical treatment when the condition occurs. Fritz could have used Strizich\u2019s admissions regarding the limits of his expertise on cross-examination to undermine the weight of Strizich\u2019s testimony. <em>Kissock v. Butte Convalescent Ctr., </em>1999 MT 322, \u00b6 20, 297 Mont. 307, 992 P.2d 1271. Strizich\u2019s admissions should not have affected the admissibility of his testimony regarding the standard of care for a pediatrician when faced with glucose-related concerns arising from his treatment of T.M.N. <em>Kissock, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b647 We turn finally to the issue of whether the District Court\u2019s exclusion of Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony prejudiced Norris\u2019s case. Montana R. Civ. P. 61 dictates that a verdict may be set aside only if an error affects a party\u2019s substantial rights. We have recognized that a district court\u2019s ruling at trial may cause-through no fault of the party-unfair surprise that detrimentally prevents a litigant from presenting his case. <em>See Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 30, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650. We specifically determined in <em>Clark </em>that unfair surprise may occur when a district court issues a pre-trial order, but the district court only clarifies the scope of that order at trial. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 30. This unfair surprise affects a party\u2019s substantial rights when it relates to, and prevents a party from, addressing adequately a material issue. <em>See Clark, </em>\u00b6 30. Such circumstances warrant a new trial. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b648 Norris contends, and we agree, that exclusion of Strizich\u2019s proposed testimony caused unfair surprise. Norris had conducted video depositions with multiple witnesses. Norris argues that the admissibility of these video depositions rested upon Strizich\u2019s proposed standard of care testimony. Norris specifically, and fairly, had relied on Judge Honzel\u2019s order to perpetuate this video testimony. Without Strizich\u2019s testimony, though, Norris claims that the video testimony was rendered useless as Norris could not modify these depositions, and had to forgo entirely the video testimony due to the court\u2019s late ruling. \u00b649 Moreover, Fritz capitalized on Judge Seeley\u2019s ruling to undermine the importance of testimony of Strizich-Norris\u2019s primary medical witness. The jury instructions directed the jury not to consider any physician\u2019s personal practice as relevant to the standard of care. Fritz\u2019s counsel used this instruction to his advantage during the closing, stating, \u2018Dr. Strizich talked about his personal practice. Dr. Strizich is a nice man, and he is a good pediatrician. But his personal practice, the law says, is not to be considered as establishing standard of care....\u201d This statement, combined with the jury instruction, undermined the importance of Strizich\u2019s testimony to Norris\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u00b650  We determine that the District Court abused its discretion when it prevented Strizich from providing standard of care testimony. We reverse and remand with instructions to the District Court to vacate its judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
