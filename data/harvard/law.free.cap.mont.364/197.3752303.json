(Patterson) appeals the judgment of the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, denying Patterson\u2019s motion for summaryjudgment on its strict liability claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\u00b62 Patterson raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it permitted the defense of assumption of the risk to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u00b64 2. If this Court determines it was proper to instruct the jury regarding assumption of the risk, whether the District Court abused its discretion in failing to instruct the jury regarding the subjective knowledge requirement set forth in <em>Lutz v. National Crane </em>Corp., 267 Mont. 368, 884 P.2d 455 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">\u00b65 In the fall of 2006, Patterson was hired by Doug Ferraro and Dan Vanderzwaag to construct a road on property owned by Ferraro and Vanderzwaag located approximately 20 miles west of Missoula. Because the road was to be constructed in mountainous terrain, it was determined that a significant amount of blasting would be required. Patterson did not have any personnel trained or knowledgeable in blasting techniques, so he hired Archie Johnson Contracting (AJC) to perform all necessary blasting on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">\u00b66 On January 2, 2007, Patterson and AJC entered into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>agreement for the blasting on the project which they referred to as the Nine Mile Project. This agreement required AJC to drill and blast various small rock outcroppings as well as a main cliff section which was approximately 400 feet in length. Adam Pummill was the project superintendent for Patterson as well as the excavator operator. His job was to work with AJC\u2019s crews to remove blasted material as the project progressed. Despite his experience building roads and performing general excavation work, Pummill did not have any background in drilling, blasting or geology. Thus, AJC was in charge of the blasting while Patterson was in charge of the excavating.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\">\u00b67 Testimony at trial indicated the following standard sequence of events during the project. Patterson would use its equipment to clear or build a flat pad for AJC\u2019s drilling equipment to sit on. AJC would then place its drilling equipment on the pad, drill a series of holes in the rock, and fill the holes with explosives. Before detonating the explosives, AJC would clear the area of personnel and equipment. The explosion was intended to fracture the rock sufficiently for Patterson to use its excavators to remove the blasted material. AJC and Patterson repeated this basic process numerous times as they worked to construct the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b68 On February 26,2007, AJC detonated 503 pounds of explosives in 46 holes along 500 yards of rock. This blast created a rock overhang that caused both Patterson\u2019s and AJC\u2019s crews to be concerned. On the evening of February 28, 2007, Archie Johnson and the owners of the project met on site to discuss how to deal with the overhang. One idea was for AJC\u2019s crews to come in from above using ropes and drills so that they could safely get to the overhang and bring it down without having to be underneath it. Since this would take several days, the owners were opposed to the idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b69 Trial testimony differed on whether AJC continued blasting in the area of the overhang to try to bring it down. However, Pummill testified that when he arrived for work on the morning of March 1, 2007, it was apparent to him that the overhang had been altered. Pummill moved his excavator into an area near the overhang and began excavating the blasted rock. AJC\u2019s crew arrived sometime later and checked on Pummill\u2019s progress. Henry Bentley, AJC\u2019s driller, did not advise or warn Pummill that the overhang was still dangerous because, according to Bentley, Pummill already knew that it was dangerous. When Bentley stopped by the area again more than an hour later, he noticed that Pummill was working directly below the overhang, so he signaled for Pummill to exit the excavator. Almost immediately after Pummill exited the excavator, an entire section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>rock above the excavator collapsed crushing it. Pummill was not injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b610 AJC denied liability for the accident, consequently Patterson filed suit on September 11, 2007. In its second amended complaint, Patterson asserted claims of negligence, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and strict liability. AJC denied all of the allegations and asserted various affirmative defenses including contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. AJC also asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract for money still owed to AJC for the work AJC performed on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b6 11 Patterson filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on November 25, 2008, arguing that blasting constitutes an abnormally dangerous activity thereby subjecting AJC to strict liability for Patterson\u2019s damages. Thereafter, AJC filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that (1) the case should not be governed by strict liability because the damages claimed by Patterson did not occur until days after any blasting done by AJC and after Patterson\u2019s operator had excavated under the overhang, (2) if the court found that the case was governed by negligence, then Patterson was contributorily negligent as a matter of law, and (3) if the court found that the case was governed by strict liability, then Patterson assumed the risk as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b612 The District Court entered an Opinion and Order on October 5, 2009, finding that blasting is inherently an abnormally dangerous activity subjecting it to strict liability. However, the court pointed out that, in this case, the damage to the excavator occurred more than 24 hours after the blasting process had occurred and after Pummill spent at least three hours removing rock from underneath the overhang. The court stated that \u201csomeone who engages in an abnormally dangerous activity does not have the legal duty to in essence \u2018insure\u2019 damages for any and all harm that may result at some time in the future following the performance of the abnormally dangerous activity ....\u2019\u2019Thus, the court determined that when AJC\u2019s strict liability started and stopped were factual questions for the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b613 The court further noted that this case is primarily an ordinary negligence action and that there was \u201cplenty of evidence upon which the jury could find the parties contributorally [sic] negligent at trial.\u201d In addition, the court stated that \u201cthe causal question under [Patterson\u2019s] claim of strict liability under the abnormally dangerous activity legal theory is a question for the jury to determine because of the intervening work of the excavator more than 24 hours after the blasting activities occurred.\u201d Based on these findings, the court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Patterson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court also denied AJC\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment stating that there were questions of fact regarding AJC\u2019s affirmative defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">\u00b614 Trial of this case began on December 13, 2010. During trial, Patterson filed a supplemental trial brief arguing that the assumption of risk defense should not be submitted to the jury as a defense to Patterson\u2019s strict liability claims. Patterson argued in its brief that AJC failed to satisfy the elements of the defense as enunciated in <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 377, 884 P.2d at 460. In addition, during the settling of the jury instructions, Patterson objected to the wording of the assumption of the risk instruction on the basis that it failed to properly instruct the jury regarding the subjective knowledge standard set forth in <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 378, 884 P.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b615 Following the close of evidence, the court determined that it would submit the case to the jury as a strict liability case, and that it would permit the jury to be instructed on the assumption of risk defense. The court also submitted AJC\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b616 On December 17, 2010, the jury returned a verdict finding that AJC\u2019s blasting caused the damages sustained by Patterson and that Patterson and its employees assumed the risk of harm. The jury allocated 51% of the fault to AJC and 49% to Patterson, and awarded damages to Patterson in the amount of $50,000. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of AJC on its breach of contract claim and awarded damages to AJC in the amount of $19,255.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b617 Patterson appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to allow the defense of assumption of the risk to go to the jury as well as the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding the subjective knowledge requirement set forth in <em>Lutz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it permitted the defense of assumption of the risk to go to the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u00b619 Patterson contends on appeal that the District Court incorrectly concluded that the defense of assumption of the risk was applicable under the facts of this case, thus the court erred in permitting that defense to go to the jury. Patterson argues that the jury\u2019s focus should have been on the dangerous condition, not on the conduct of the injured party. Thus, Patterson maintains that in this case, allowing the jury to focus on Pummill\u2019s conduct, in the face of an obviously dangerous condition which he lacked the knowledge to assess, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>impermissibly inserted questions of contributory negligence into a purely strict liability case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b620 AJC argues on the other hand that to hold it strictly liable for blasting activities that occurred days before the incident at issue here, yet find that Patterson and its employees only assumed the risk of harm if the stringent standards set out in <em>Lutz </em>are met, would be fundamentally unfair and contrary to the intent of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts. </em>AJC contends that there was sufficient evidence presented to the jury to show that Pummill knew that overhangs are dangerous and unstable, and that it was unsafe to place the excavator under the overhang. AJC further contends that there was sufficient evidence presented to the jury that Pummill knew that digging underneath the overhang would undercut support for the overhang, yet Pummill did so resulting in the overhang falling on the excavator. \u00b621 Whether the trial court erred in permitting the defense of assumption of the risk to be submitted to the jury is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. </em>Co., 2009 MT 248, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 26, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649 (citing <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6 37, 345 Mont. 469, 191 P.3d 451).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b622 Assumption of the risk is a statutory affirmative defense in Montana under \u00a727-1-719(5), MCA. This statute provides that the defense may be asserted if the \u201cuser or consumer of the product discovered the defect or the defect was open and obvious and the user or consumer unreasonably made use of the product and was injured by it.\u201d Section 27-l-719(5)(a), MCA. In addition, assumption of the risk \u201cmust be applied in accordance with the principles of comparative fault set forth in 27-1-702 and 27-1-705.\u201d Section 27-1-719(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b623 In the instant case, Patterson points out that Montana\u2019s leading case on the assumption of risk defense is <em>Lutz. </em>Thus, Patterson urges this Court to extend the <em>Lutz </em>standard applicable in product liability cases to those cases involving allegations of abnormally dangerous activities. We decline to do so under the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b624 Lutz was killed when the crane cable he was using to retrieve drilling pipe that had spilled onto the highway from a semi-trailer contacted a power line. Before lifting the pipe, Lutz and his supervisor, who were both aware of the overhead power lines in the area and that the crane cable with which they were working was uninsulated, marked off the pipes that they did not believe were safe to move. Lutz\u2019s supervisor operated the crane while Lutz hooked metal chains attached to the uninsulated crane cable around the ends of the pipe and guided the pipes to a waiting semi-trailer. At one point the crane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cable came into contact with a power line thereby electrocuting Lutz. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 372, 884 P.2d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\">\u00b625 On behalf of Lutz\u2019s estate, Lutz\u2019s widow, Lori, sued National Crane Corporation (National) on the theory of strict liability in tort, alleging that the crane was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous because it lacked an insulated link. National raised the statutory affirmative defenses of assumption of risk and misuse. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 372-73, 884 P.2d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b626 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Lori, but reduced the amount of her award by 20 percent, the percentage of responsibility the jury allocated to Lutz. National appealed from the verdict and judgment while Lori cross-appealed on the issues of assumption of risk and misuse, seeking to recover the jury\u2019s full determination of damages. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 373, 884 P.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b627 We stated in <em>Lutz </em>that assumption of the risk in a product liability case is analyzed under a subjective standard rather than under the objective \"reasonable person\u201d standard, and we set forth that standard as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">what the particular plaintiff sees, knows, understands and appreciates. In this it differs from the objective standard which is applied to contributory negligence.... If by reason of age, or lack of information, experience, intelligence, or judgment, the plaintiff does not understand the risk involved in a known situation, he will not be taken to assume the risk, although it may be found that his conduct is contributory [comparative] negligence because it does not conform to the community standard of the reasonable man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\"><em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 378, 884 P.2d at 461 (citing <em>Krueger v. General Motors Corp., </em>240 Mont. 266, 276, 783 P.2d 1340, 1347 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b628 Despite the fact that there was a known objective hazard in <em>Lutz; </em>that Lutz recognized the hazards associated with operating a crane next to live power lines; and that Lutz knew he could be killed if the cable came into contact with those power lines, this Court determined that the assumption of the risk defense was not available in that case because the contact between the cable and the power lines was inadvertent. It was not a voluntary act by either the crane operator or Lutz. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont. at 380, 884 P.2d at 462. We ruled in <em>Lutz </em>that the assumption of the risk defense in a product liability case is inapplicable as a matter of law without evidence that the victim actually knew that serious injury or death <em>would </em>result, and knowing that, the victim voluntarily exposed himself to a known danger. <em>Lutz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>267 Mont. at 379-80, 884 P.2d at 461-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b629 Patterson\u2019s theory in the case <em>sub judice </em>was simply that AJC created the dangerous condition and should be held strictly liable for all damages that resulted therefrom. Patterson maintains that AJC\u2019s employees were the blasting and rock experts on the project and, as such, they recognized the danger. Pummill on the other hand was not an expert in blasting or geology, hence he had to rely upon AJC\u2019s employees to determine whether the situation was safe. Patterson maintains that while Pummill may have understood that there was some danger, he did not understand that taking the excavator into the area would result in its destruction. According to Patterson, this falls short of the subjective knowledge requirement set forth in <em>Lutz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b630 We decline to apply the subjective knowledge requirement of <em>Lutz </em>to the facts in this case because unlike in <em>Lutz, </em>where the contact with the power line was inadvertent, Pummill\u2019s actions in the instant case of excavating beneath the overhang were intentional. Furthermore, Pummill knew the dangers associated with excavating there.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b631 Patterson also relies on our recent decision in <em>Patch v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., </em>2011 MT 175, 361 Mont. 241, 257 P.3d 383, to support its claim that the assumption of risk defense should not have gone to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b632 In <em>Patch, </em>eighteen-year-old Brandon Patch was struck in the head by a batted ball during an American Legion baseball game. The ball was hit by a player using an aluminum bat manufactured by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co. (H&amp;B). Brandon died from his injuries. His parents and his estate sued H&amp;B in strict products liability asserting manufacturing and design defect, and failure to warn claims. Plaintiffs claimed the bat was in a defective condition because of the enhanced risks associated with its use. The aluminum bat increased the velocity of a batted ball when struck by the bat thus decreasing infielders\u2019 reaction times, and resulting in a greater number of high energy batted balls in the infield. <em>Patch, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b633 Before trial, the District Court granted H&amp;B\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs manufacturing defect claim, but denied summary judgment on Plaintiffs design defect and failure to warn claims. The court granted Plaintiffs motion in limine excluding H&amp;B\u2019s assumption of the risk defense. <em>Patch, </em>\u00b6 10. The court concluded that Brandon\u2019s voluntary participation in the game did not make assumption of the risk applicable. <em>Patch, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\u00b634 At trial, Plaintiff s design defect and failure to warn claims were submitted to the jury. The jury concluded that the bat was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>designed defectively, but that it was in a defective condition due to H&amp;B\u2019s failure to warn of the enhanced risks associated with its use. The jury awarded Plaintiffs $850,000 on their failure to warn claim. <em>Patch, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">\u00b635 On appeal, we examined both \u00a7 27-l-719(5)(a), MCA, the assumption of the risk statute, and our holding in <em>Lutz. </em>We concluded in <em>Patch, </em>that an assumption of the risk defense was not applicable in that case because there was no evidence that Brandon actually knew that he would be seriously injured or killed while pitching to a batter using one of H&amp;B\u2019s aluminum bats. <em>Patch, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b636 We hold that <em>Patch </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the evidence here indicates that, unlike Brandon Patch who was unaware of the danger from balls hit from H&amp;B\u2019s aluminum bat, Pummill was aware of the danger from the overhang.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b637 Pummill testified at trial as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Q. [Plaintiffs counsel]. Okay, and did any of the blasters ever express any concern to you about this overhang, that we know, now, eventually, came down on your excavator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">A. [Pummill]. They did, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">Q. What did they tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">A. They-we discussed it, and they felt that it was a very hazardous condition, that was presented, also, up there, and I expressed my concerns that I, also, felt it was very hazardous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">Q. Okay, and could you reach this large overhang? When you crawled your excavator on top of that ramp, and extended the arm, as high as you could, could you reach the overhang with the excavator?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">A. No, I couldn\u2019t completely reach it, and to be able to do that, it would have been very dangerous because the only position, that I could have been in, would have been right underneath it, to be able to reach it, and do anything with it with the machine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">\u00b638 Thus, rather than apply <em>Lutz </em>in this case, we will follow our holding <em>in Matkovic v. Shell Oil Co., </em>218 Mont. 156, 707 P.2d 2 (1985). In response to certified questions posed to this Court by the United States District Court of the District of Montana, we stated in <em>Matkovic </em>that we saw no reason to apply a different standard to strict liability which arises as the result of conducting an abnormally dangerous activity than to strict liability which arises in the case of a defective product. Consequently, in <em>Matkovic, </em>we extended the defense of assumption of the risk to strict liability based on abnormally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dangerous activities. <em>Matkovic, </em>218 Mont. at 160, 707 P.2d at 4. In addition, we stated in <em>Matkovic </em>that while assumption of the risk is a defense to both strict products liability and strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities, that defense may be used only in rare circumstances. <em>Matkovic, </em>218 Mont. at 160, 707 P.2d at 4 <em>(citing Zahrte v. Sturm, Ruger &amp; </em>Co., 203 Mont. 90, 661 P.2d 17 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b639 AJC contends that Pummill, by placing his excavator underneath the overhang and digging out from underneath that overhang, voluntarily participated in the abnormally dangerous activity in this case. Hence, in evaluating whether Pummill assumed the risk of harm, AJC maintains that the focus is properly on Pummill\u2019s actions in voluntarily participating in an abnormally dangerous activity that his employer, Patterson, was hired to do. On that basis, AJC urges this Court to apply the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7523 (1977), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Assumption of Risk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">The plaintiffs assumption of the risk of harm from an abnormally dangerous activity bars his recovery for the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In particular, AJC urges us to adopt comment d to \u00a7 523 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">The risk is commonly assumed by one who takes part in the activity himself, as a servant, an independent contractor, a member of a group carrying on a joint enterprise or as the employer of an independent contractor hired to carry on the activity or to do work that must necessarily involve it. Thus a plaintiff who accepts employment driving a tank truck full of nitroglycerin, with knowledge of the danger must be taken to assume the risk when he is injured by an explosion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b640 We conclude that in this case, the District Court reached the right result, but for the wrong reason. In that respect, although there was argument that \u00a7523 was not effectively raised below, we conclude that comment d of \u00a7523 currently sets forth the law that applies to these types of cases. Here, Patterson and AJC entered into a joint enterprise regarding an abnormally dangerous activity. Under the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7523 (cmt. d) Patterson and his employees assumed the risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">\u00b641  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err when it permitted the defense of assumption of the risk to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">\u00b642 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in failing to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>instruct the jury regarding the subjective knowledge requirement set forth in Lutz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">\u00b643 During the settling of the jury instructions, Patterson\u2019s counsel renewed his objection to allowing the assumption of the risk defense to go the jury. Counsel also objected to the specific wording of the proposed jury instruction. The District Court overruled counsel\u2019s objections and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">Assumption of risk is a defense to plaintiff s claims. In order to establish assumption of risk, the defendant must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">First, that the condition which caused damage was open and obvious or the plaintiffs employee discovered such condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">Second, that even though the condition was open and obvious, or the plaintiffs employee discovered the condition, the plaintiff unreasonably proceeded in the face of the danger; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">Third, that the plaintiff was damaged as a result of its employee proceeding in the face of the danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">Assumption of risk by the plaintiffs employee does not bar its recovery unless its responsibility for the damage is greater than the defendant\u2019s. However, any damages you award will be reduced by the Court according to the percentage of plaintiff s responsibility as determined by you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\u00b644 Patterson argues on appeal that the District Court improperly instructed the jury regarding the assumption of risk defense. The court determined that \u00a7 27-1-719(5), MCA, had been enacted or substantively amended subsequent to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lutz </em>and thus the plain language of the statute controlled. As a result, the court did not instruct the jury regarding the subjective knowledge requirement set forth in <em>Lutz. </em>Patterson maintains that the amendments to \u00a727-1-719(5), MCA, were not substantive and did not alter the basic analytical framework set forth in <em>Lutz. </em>Consequently, Patterson contends that the District Court erred in determining that \u00a727-1-719(5), MCA, superseded the guidance in <em>Lutz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\u00b645 AJC contends that the instruction given by the District Court on assumption of risk substantially tracked the language in Montana Pattern Instruction (MPI) Second 7.06 and correctly states the law on assumption of the risk in Montana. In this case, the court modified the instruction to refer to a condition rather than a defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">\u00b646 MPI2d 7.06 was written by the Montana Supreme Court Commission on Civil Jury Instruction Guidelines (the Commission) in 2003. In promulgating MPI2d 7.06, the Commission listed as its source \u00a727-l-719(5)(a), MCA, and noted that it \u201cconsidered the language of <em>Lutz v. National Crane Corp., </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 368, 884 P.2d 455, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the subject of assumption of risk in drafting this instruction.\u201dAlthough the Commission did consider Lutz, it did not adopt in its model instruction the language regarding subjective knowledge from <em>Lutz </em>that Patterson urged the District Court to include in the jury instruction at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b647 A district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Goles v. Neumann, </em>2011 MT 11, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 132, 247 P.3d 1089 (citing <em>State v. Christiansen, </em>2010 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 357 Mont. 379, 239 P.3d 949). Although a district court\u2019s discretion is broad, it is restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. Thus, to constitute reversible error, the instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Goles, </em>\u00b6 9. \u2018The purpose of jury instructions is to guarantee decisions consistent with the evidence and the law, which can be accomplished when the instructions are as plain, clear, concise, and brief as possible.\u201d <em>Goles, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b648 We find no prejudice in the court\u2019s refusal to include the language proposed by Patterson in this jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b649  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to instruct the jury regarding the subjective knowledge requirement set forth in <em>Lutz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b650 As for the Dissent, <em>Lutz </em>and \u00a727-1-719(5), MCA, both deal with strict products liability, not with abnormally dangerous activities. While Patterson and the Dissent would have us apply legal principles governing the former to resolve the latter, we conclude that is unwarranted here. Foremost, no defective <em>product </em>is involved in the instant case. Rather, this case concerns an abnormally dangerous <em>activity </em>involving two participants. Accordingly, we have determined that, on the facts of the instant case, <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 523 (cmt. d) best expresses the legal principles that should govern.</p>\n<p id=\"Anv\">\u00b651 Applying those principles and based on the record before us, we are not persuaded that Pummill failed to recognize the danger of operating his excavator under the rock overhang as the Dissent contends. Dissent, \u00b6 57. Pummill was, after all, an experienced contractorJndeed, he was in charge of the construction project for his employer, as far as the excavation went. He was engaged with AJC in a road construction project that involved blasting and excavating rock. The blasters had expressed concern to Pummill about the rock overhang that eventually fell on the excavator; they told him \u2018It was a very hazardous\u201d condition and Pummill testified that he \u201calso, felt it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>was very hazardous.\u201d In fact, Pummill testified that placing the excavator \u2018bight underneath\u201d the overhang would have been \u2018Very dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">\u00b652 We are also not persuaded that AJC knew Pummill was operating the excavator underneath the overhang as the Dissent contends. Dissent, \u00b6 57. When Bentley, AJC\u2019s driller, first checked on Pummill\u2019s progress on the morning of the accident, Pummill was working to one side of the overhang. However, when Bentley returned some time later, he noticed that Pummill had moved the excavator directly below the overhang and that is when Bentley signaled for Pummill to exit the excavator. Opinion, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b653  Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that Pummill possessed the subjective knowledge of the danger that the overhang posed. The trial evidence showed that, in the face of this knowledge, Pummill operated his excavator \u2018bight underneath\u201d the \u2018Very dangerous\u201d rock overhang that he, himself, felt was \u2018Very hazardous.\u201d In so doing, it is clear that Pummill assumed the very risk that what <em>could </em>happen, <em>did </em>happen. The overhang collapsed while Pummill was excavating underneath it. The District Court correctly instructed the jury, and the fact-finder\u2019s decision was fully supported by the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b654 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b233-7\">JUSTICE WHEAT</author>\n<p id=\"ACW\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u00b655 The District Court correctly concluded that blasting is an abnormally dangerous activity, thus subjecting Archie Johnson Contracting (AJC) to strict liability. Strict liability arising from an abnormally dangerous activity, such as blasting, is confined to the damages that arise from the abnormal danger of the activity itself. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7519 cmt. e (1977). One obvious danger associated with blasting is the chance that falling rock will cause injury to a person or property, which is exactly what happened here. \u00b656 However, I believe the District Court erred when it allowed the assumption of the risk defense to go to the jury. To establish the assumption of the risk defense, the defendant must establish (1) that the injured party discovered the defect, or the defect was open and obvious; and (2) that the injured party unreasonably made use of the product (or condition). Section 27-1-719(5), MCA. This Court applied these standards to strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity in <em>Lutz v. National Crane </em>Corp., 267 Mont. 368, 884 P.2d 455 (1994). As to the first element of \u00a727-1-719(5), MCA, a defendant must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that the victim knew that serious injury or death <em>would </em>result, and knowing that, the victim voluntarily exposed himself to a known danger. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont, at 378, 884 P.2d at 461. This Court further noted that in the context of strict liability, allowing the assumption of the risk defense to be submitted to the jury under any other set of facts would \u201conly enlarge the concept of contributory negligence to consume the separate defense of assumption of the risk[.]\u201d <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont, at 380, 884 P.2d at 462. As to the second element, this Court found that if a given use of equipment in a particular location is reasonably foreseeable, then the use is reasonable as a matter of law. <em>Lutz, </em>267 Mont, at 379-80, 884 P.2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b657 Here, as in <em>Lutz, </em>the elements of \u00a727-1-719(5), MCA, were not met. Regarding the first element, Pummill did not fully understand the danger posed by the overhang; he was not a geologist, he had no background in blasting, and he did not have the requisite experience to assess the danger of the overhang. As to the second element, AJC knew it was possible that the overhang might fall, and knew Pummill was operating an excavator under the overhang. Accordingly, Pummill\u2019s operation of the excavator beneath the overhang was reasonable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b658 Based on these facts, I believe that the District Court would have found the assumption of the risk defense inapplicable had it applied this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lutz. </em>In this case, Patterson could not have assumed the risk that the excavator would be destroyed because (1) Pummill lacked the subjective knowledge of the danger the overhang posed, and (2) it was foreseeable to AJC that the overhang could collapse while Pummill was operating the excavator beneath it. For these reasons I believe that the District Court erred in allowing the assumption of the risk defense to go to the jury, and I would modify the judgment to reinstate the full verdict against AJC, less an offset for AJC\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
