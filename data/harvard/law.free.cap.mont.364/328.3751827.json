Muller (Muller) appeals the order from the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Rosebud County, upholding his driver\u2019s license suspension. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Muller\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b64 A witness stopped at a stop sign at the intersection of Highway 212 and Tongue River Road in Ashland, Montana. The witness saw a blue Ford pickup nearly \u2018T-bone\u201d her car on May 7, 2011, at around 8:00 pm. The witness accelerated quickly to avoid a collision. The blue pickup turned onto Old Mission Road. The witness stopped at a nearby convenience store and told Rosebud County Deputy Sheriff Jimmy Baisch (Baisch) about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u00b65 The witness described the man and vehicle as follows: \u201ca new, blue, Ford 3/4 ton pickup driven by an older white male in his fifties or sixties with salt and pepper hair.\u201d The witness told Baisch that she watched the truck turn down Old Mission Road. After hearing the description, which took a short time, Baisch drove down Old Mission Road to look for a truck matching the witness\u2019s description. Baisch saw a new, four-door, blue Ford one-ton truck nosed into foliage in front of a camper trailer a couple hundred yards down Old Mission Road. Muller stood by the passenger door of the truck. Muller walked to his camper trailer door when he saw Baisch approach. Baisch parked and walked around the truck. Baisch could smell an alcoholic odor emanating from the truck. Baisch watched Muller as Muller attempted to open the door of the camper trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">\u00b66 Baisch testified that Muller was swaying and looked dazed. Baisch told Muller to come over. Baisch smelled the odor of alcohol coming from Muller. Muller and Baisch walked to Baisch\u2019s patrol vehicle. Muller refused to perform a field sobriety test. Baisch read Muller his rights. Muller refused to take a preliminary breath test. Baisch arrested Muller for driving under the influence (DUI) and transported him to the Rosebud County Detention Center in Forsyth.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u00b67 Muller again refused to submit to a breath test at the detention center. Baisch cited Muller for DUI, a misdemeanor, that day. Muller\u2019s refusal to submit to a breath test resulted in the automatic suspension of his license pursuant to \u00a761-8-402(4), MCA. Muller filed a petition for reinstatement of driver\u2019s license (Petition) on May 16, 2011. The District Court held a judicial review proceeding on the Petition on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>June 27, 2011. Muller, Baisch, and the witness testified at the proceeding. The District Court denied the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b68 We review for clear error a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license and driving privileges. Weer <em>v. State, </em>2010 MT 232, \u00b6 7, 358 Mont. 130, 244 P.3d 311. We look to the ruling to determine whether the court has made a correct conclusion of law. <em>Weer, </em>\u00b6 7. A presumption of correctness attaches to the suspension or revocation of a driver\u2019s license. <em>Widdicombe v. State, </em>2004 MT 49, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 133, 85 P.3d 1271. The driver bears the burden of proving improper suspension or revocation of his driver\u2019s license. <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b67.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b69 Montana\u2019s implied consent law presumes that any person driving on the ways of the state open to the public has consented to have his blood, breath, or urine tested for the presence of alcohol. Section 61-8-402(1), MCA. In a non-accident scenario, a law enforcement officer must arrest a person for DUI before requesting a breath test. Section 61-8-402(2), MCA. A driver whose license has been suspended may appeal that suspension on the grounds that the driver was not properly under arrest for DUI or that the driver had not refused a requested breath or blood test. Section 61-8-403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b610  A district court may consider only three issues in a hearing for reinstatement of a petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license <em>Weer, </em>\u00b6 9. First, the court may resolve whether the arresting officer had particularized suspicion that the individual had been driving or was in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Second, the court can evaluate whether the officer lawfully arrested the petitioner and had probable cause for the arrest. Finally, the court may ascertain whether the petitioner did indeed decline to submit to a breath test. <em>Weer, </em>\u00b6 9. The District Court determined that Baisch had particularized suspicion to arrest Muller, that Baisch had probable cause to arrest Muller, and that Muller declined to submit to a breath test. Muller argues that Baisch made an illegal warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"AY_\">\u00b611 Section 46-6-311(1), MCA, provides that a peace officer may make a warrantless arrest \u2018if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person is committing an offense or that the person has committed an offense and existing circumstances require immediate arrest.\u201d Muller argues that no exigent circumstances existed for his arrest. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>points to <em>United States v. Shephard, </em>21 F.3d 933, 937-38 (9th Cir. 1994), in which the Ninth Circuit equated \u201cexisting circumstances\u201d as used in \u00a746-6-311(1), MCA, with exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b612 Montana police officers, without a warrant, entered a home and arrested Shephard, a Montana probationer, for a probation violation. The officers relied on Shephard\u2019s probation officer\u2019s oral authorization. Police seized a gun belonging to Shephard during his arrest. <em>Shephard, </em>21 F.3d at 935. The trial court convicted Shephard of gun possession by a felon. Shephard argued on appeal that the court should have suppressed the gun as a product of an illegal arrest. <em>Shephard, </em>21 F.3d at 935-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b613 The Ninth Circuit determined that Shephard\u2019s arrest violated a now-revised statute that required written authorization of a probation officer for a warrantless arrest for a probation violation. <em>Shephard, </em>21 F.3d at 936; \u00a746-23-1012, MCA (1987). The court determined that a probation violation did not rise to the level of an exigent circumstance. <em>Shephard, </em>21 F.3d at 937. We need not address the Ninth Circuit\u2019s questionable decision to equate \u201cexisting circumstances\u201d with exigent circumstances. Muller nevertheless urges the Court to examine a number of cases that considered whether exigent circumstances supported warrantless arrests. <em>See e.g. State v. Kenfield, </em>2009 MT 242, 351 Mont. 409, 213 P.3d 461; <em>State v. Saale, </em>2009 MT 95, 350 Mont. 64, 204 P.3d 1220; <em>State v. Logan, </em>2002 MT 206, 311 Mont. 239, 53 P.3d 1285. These cases offer little support for Muller\u2019s appeal, however, as Muller\u2019s arrest falls within the category of \u201cexisting circumstances\u201d under \u00a746-6-311(1), MCA. As such, we need not address whether exigent circumstances justified Baisch\u2019s warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b614 The Court determined in <em>State v. Bauer, </em>2001 MT 248, \u00b6 33, 307 Mont. 105, 36 P.3d 892, that the \u201cexisting circumstances\u201d referred to in \u00a746-6-311(1), MCA, mean \u201cspecial circumstances such as a concern for the safety of the offender or the public.\u201d The police officer in <em>Bauer </em>arrested the defendant for being a minor in possession of alcohol (MIP). <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 8. MIP is a nonjailable offense. Section 45-5-624, MCA. Bauer did not pose a concern for public safety, and, therefore, his warrantless arrest was invalid. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 32. In a similar case, however, we determined that the existing circumstances supported a warrantless arrest when the child suspected of MIP was reported missing, truant, and only 14. <em>In re Z.M., </em>2007 MT 122, \u00b6 36, 337 Mont. 278, 160 P.3d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b615 The Court examined similar circumstances to the instant case in <em>State v. Ellinger, </em>223 Mont. 349, 725 P.2d 1201 (1986). A citizen called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the police and reported a truck driving in a reckless manner. The citizen provided the license plate number and vehicle description. The police officer drove to the house of the vehicle\u2019s registered owner. <em>Ellinger, </em>223 Mont. at 351, 725 P.2d at 1202. Ellinger leaned against the doorway of his mobile home and appeared intoxicated. Ellinger complied with the field sobriety tests and failed them. He was charged with DUI. He appealed on the basis of an illegal warrantless arrest. <em>Ellinger, </em>223 Mont. at 351, 725 P.2d at 1202. The Court concluded that the citizen\u2019s report alone provided probable cause. The citizen\u2019s tip plus the defendant\u2019s presence outside his trailer, his appearance of intoxication, and failure of the field sobriety tests, constituted \u201cfull probable cause.\u201d <em>Ellinger, </em>223 Mont. at 352, 725 P.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b616 The witness\u2019s report to Baisch about the near-accident at the intersection occurred minutes before Baisch encountered Muller outside Muller\u2019s camper trailer. Muller, his truck, and their location closely matched the witness\u2019s description. The District Court noted the \u201cextremely short period of time between the commission of the offense and the arrest.\u201dThe short time span between the witness\u2019s report and Baisch\u2019s encounter with Muller raised the likelihood that Muller had been operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and by itself posed a concern for public safety. Baisch then observed behavior consistent with a DUI. These \u201cexisting circumstances\u201d encountered by Baisch justify a warrantless arrest as required by \u00a746-6-311(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b617  The District Court determined properly that Baisch legally arrested Muller. We affirm the court\u2019s denial of Muller\u2019s petition for reinstatement of driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, NELSON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
