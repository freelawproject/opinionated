We affirm. Lacey raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b62 <em>Did the prosecutor make multiple statements during her opening and closing statements to the jury that warrant this Court\u2019s exercise of plain error review ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u00b63 <em>Did the State impermissibly change its legal theory of how Lacey committed sexual intercourse without consent?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">\u00b64 We recounted in detail the factual and procedural history of this matter in <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2010 MT 6, \u00b6 5, 355 Mont. 31, 224 P.3d 1247. We provide here only those details pertinent to Lacey\u2019s present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Amk\">\u00b65 J.G. ran away from home at the age of 15 in the spring of 1995. Lacey, the father of J.G.\u2019s friend, offered J.G. a place to stay. Lacey provided J.G. with free alcohol. J.G. frequently consumed excessive amounts of alcohol at Lacey\u2019s house. Lacey also provided J.G. with free marijuana. J.G. smoked daily. Lacey, more than 30 years J.G.\u2019s senior, repeatedly initiated sexual contact with J.G. when J.G. became intoxicated from drugs and alcohol. J.G. repeatedly resisted Lacey\u2019s advances. These encounters made J.G. uncomfortable, but he nevertheless continued to live at Lacey\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\u00b66 Lacey came into J.G.\u2019s bedroom one evening when J.G. was highly intoxicated. Lacey, half undressed, had an erection. He grabbed J.G.\u2019s head and shoved his penis into J.G.\u2019s mouth. J.G., who was 16 years old at the time, unsuccessfully resisted Lacey\u2019s assault in his impaired state.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">\u00b67 J.G. moved out of Lacey\u2019s house for a brief period following the encounter. Lacey eventually enticed J.G. to return, however, with offers of free alcohol and marijuana. Lacey resumed his sexual advances. J.G. continued to resist. On one occasion, however, J.G. awoke with Lacey\u2019s penis in his mouth. J.G. again moved out of Lacey\u2019s house following this second assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u00b68 Lacey moved to California shortly after the second incident. J.G. confided in Lacey\u2019s daughter, Rian, about Lacey\u2019s conduct. Rian corresponded with her father about the accusations made by J.G. Lacey denied that the incidents had occurred. Lacey further indicated that he had cancer-a diagnosis that Lacey never substantiated. Lacey explained that he was moving to Mexico to seek radical cancer treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b69 The Gallatin County Sheriffs Office began to investigate J.G.\u2019s allegations of sexual misconduct by Lacey in November 1997. The State of Montana eventually charged Lacey with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent in April 1999. Count two of the information specifically alleged that Lacey had committed the crime while \u201cJG was asleep and therefore incapable of consent.\u201d Gallatin County could not locate Lacey until 2007 when law enforcement arrested him in Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b610 Lacey\u2019s case proceeded to trial in 2008. A jury convicted him on both counts. This Court reversed, however, based on the district court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence regarding Lacey\u201d s conduct with other young men under the transaction rule. We ordered a new trial. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b611 Lacey again faced a jury in October 2010 on two counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The first count alleged that Lacey had completed the crime through force. The second count alleged that Lacey had committed sexual intercourse without consent based upon J.G.\u2019s incapacity to consent either due to being asleep or due to intoxication. Lacey defended himself on the grounds that he and J.G. had a consensual, loving relationship. The jury convicted Lacey on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b612 Lacey moved for a new trial. He argued that the prosecutor had made inappropriate comments during her opening and closing statements intended to prejudice him with the jury. Lacey also argued that the State unlawfully had changed its legal theories regarding the nature of the sexual intercourse without consent. He argued specifically that the information did not allege force, but that the State had offered the theory at trial that Lacey had committed the sexual assault through the use of force. He further argued that the information alleged only that J.G. had been incapable of consent due to having been asleep. Lacey contended that the information had not alleged incapacitation due to J.G.\u2019s intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b613 The District Court agreed with Lacey that it should not have allowed the State to proceed on the force theory. The court substituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>a not guilty verdict for the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on count one to remedy its error. The court denied Lacey\u2019s motion for a new trial with respect to the other count. Lacey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b614 We generally will not review issues not raised before the district court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>2010 MT 92, \u00b6 23, 356 Mont. 150, 231 P.3d 1096. We may undertake review of such an issue, however, under the plain error doctrine. <em>Thorpe, </em>\u00b6 23. This Court invokes plain error review sparingly. <em>Thorpe, </em>\u00b6 23. We apply plain error review only in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Thorpe, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b615 We review jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Spotted Eagle, </em>2010 MT 222, \u00b6 6, 358 Mont. 22, 243 P.3d 402. The district court has broad discretion in formulating jury instructions. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 6. We review jury instructions to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 6. Any mistake in instructing the jury must affect prejudicially the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in order to constitute reversible error. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b616 <em>Issue 1: Did the prosecutor make multiple statements during her opening and closing statements to the jury that warrant this Court\u2019s exercise of plain error review?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b617  Prosecutors generally may not offer personal opinions as to the credibility of the accused or other witnesses. <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 33, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798. Prosecutors may comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony. <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 33. They also may comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences that may be drawn from that evidence. <em>Green, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">\u00b618 Lacey contends that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument went beyond comments on the testimony and creeped into the realm of personal opinion. He first argues that the prosecutor inappropriately offered her opinions regarding witness credibility. The prosecutor informed the jury that Tt]he instruction tells you that you get to consider the appearance of the witness on the stand, their candor. Was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>[J.G.] candid? You bet he was.\u201d The prosecutor proceeded to list various reasons to support the proposition that J.G. provided credible testimony before concluding that, \u201c[J.G.] was candid with you.\u201d The prosecutor also commented on Lacey\u2019s credibility. She concluded her commentary by stating, \u2018Candid? Absolutely not. Absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b619 Lacey further argues that the prosecutor made inappropriate comments regarding his guilt. The prosecutor told the jury during her opening statement that its \u2018Verdict... should be guilty, which [Lacey] is.\u201d The prosecutor also stated in her closing that the jury should \u201cgo back there and find [Lacey] guilty because, by God, he is.\u201d Lacey contends that the prosecutor\u2019s inclusion of the statement \u201cwhich [Lacey] is\u201d and \u201cfind [Lacey] guilty because, by God, he is\u201d inappropriately encroached on the jury\u2019s exclusive domain of determining guilt or innocence. He argues that these statements suggested that the prosecutor possessed personal knowledge of Lacey\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b620 Lacey further notes that the prosecutor made an inappropriate inference regarding his silence. She requested the jury to \u201cconsider what [Lacey] stayed away from in his testimony on direct exam.\u201dLacey notes that a criminal defendant who exercises his right to remain silent cannot have his silence used against him. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>427 U.S. 610, 619-20 (1976). He concedes that his case is distinguishable from <em>Doyle </em>in light of Lacey\u2019s decision to take the stand. He nevertheless argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement violates the spirit of <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">\u00b621 The State counters that Lacey failed to object at trial to all the statements that he now claims prejudiced his case. The State argues that Lacey\u2019s failure to object at trial failed to preserve these issues for appeal. Lacey acknowledges that he made no objection at trial, but contends that this Court should apply plain error review. Lacey alternatively argues that counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted ineffective assistance of counsel that warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b622 Lacey concedes that no single allegation of prosecutorial misconduct sufficiently warrants a new trial. He instead contends that we must review his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in the aggregate. He argues that the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s statements warrants this Court undertaking plain error review and to determine whether his counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b623 We first turn to the issue of whether this Court should engage in plain error analysis. We decline to consider, in a cumulative analysis, Lacey\u2019s argument that the prosecutor inappropriately requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the jury \u201cconsider what [Lacey] stayed away from in his testimony on direct exam.\u201d Lacey supports his position by offering only the conclusory argument that the prosecutor\u2019s statement violates the spirit of the right to remain silent, while simultaneously acknowledging that Lacey waived this right when he testified. He provides no authority to support the notion that a prosecutor may not suggest negative inferences from a defendant\u2019s avoidance of issues when the defendant chooses to testify. He also offers no unique analysis as to how the prosecutor\u2019s statement implicates Lacey\u2019s right to remain silent in light of Lacey\u2019s voluntarily decision to testify. We decline to exercise plain error review with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s comments on those issues that Lacey avoided in his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b624 The prosecutor\u2019s remaining comments may have been the subject of an appropriate objection. We note particularly the inappropriate nature of the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on God in her closing statements to support her claim that Lacey was guilty. Two equally troubling implications arise from the prosecutor\u2019s comments: either the prosecutor has access to information to demonstrate Lacey\u2019s guilt that is not available to the jury, or the jury should accept her belief that Lacey is guilty based on an oath that she has sworn to a higher authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b625 To invoke a higher power, under these circumstances, serves no purpose other than to seek an emotional, and prejudicial, response from the jury. <em>Sandoval v. Calderon, </em>241 F.3d 765, 776 (9th Cir. 2000). Counsel should focus on the facts of a case, inferences that reasonably can be drawn from these facts, as instructed by the court, and application of the law to these facts and reasonable inferences. Counsel\u2019s unwarranted reliance on a higher authority diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the court\u2019s instruction on the law to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad5\">\u00b626 The prosecutor\u2019s comments do not stray so far from permissible, however, to satisfy our standard for the exercise of plain error review. The prosecutor buried her statements within an otherwise well supported, and permissible, commentary on the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. The context in which the prosecutor made the statements prevents us from determining that plain error review should be applied under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b627 We turn next to whether Lacey received ineffective assistance of counsel. Article II, \u00a7 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 282, 206 P.3d 403. A defendant bears the burden of proving that he was denied effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>assistance by establishing that 1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and 2) a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 12. We afford deference to the trial counsel when reviewing counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Worthan v. State, </em>2010 MT 98, \u00b6 10, 356 Mont. 206, 232 P.3d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b628  Lacey has failed to satisfy the first element. Lacey\u2019s only alleged error relates to his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements during the opening and closing argument. This Court has determined, however, that failure to object does not qualify as unreasonable conduct by trial counsel. <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 63, 106 P.3d 1175. To the contrary, we specifically have recognized that trial counsel may choose not to object during opening or closing statements for strategic purposes. <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 20. This Court has noted that objections during opening and closing statements fall within the \u201cwide range\u201d of professional conduct. <em>Clausell, </em>\u00b6 20. Lacey\u2019s counsel similarly may have declined to object to prevent drawing the jury\u2019s attention to the prosecutor\u2019s comments, believing the objection more harmful than the statement itself. Our deference to counsel\u2019s strategic decision on whether to object during opening and closing statements leads us to conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to object does not constitute unreasonable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b629 <em>Did the State impermissibly change its legal theory of how Lacey committed sexual intercourse without consent?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b630 Lacey also argues that the State impermissibly expanded its theories of sexual intercourse without consent. Section 45-5-501(l)(a)(ii), MCA, provides that \u201cwithout consent\u201d can mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">(ii) the victim is incapable of consent because he is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">(A) mentally defective or incapacitated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">(B) physically helpless; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">(C) less than 16 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u00b631 Lacey notes the State alleged in the information only that J.G. had been \u2018incapable of consent\u201d due to being asleep. The State more specifically argued at trial that J.G. had been incapable of consent due to being \u201cphysically helpless\u201d or \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d because of either sleep or intoxication. The court offered jury instructions that allowed the jury to convict Lacey based on either J.G. having been asleep or J.G. having been intoxicated during the encounters.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">\u00b632 Lacey argues that the State impermissibly relied on the multiple definitions of\u2018incapable of consent\u201d at trial, contained in subsection (a) of \u00a7 45-5-501(1), MCA, without specifying which definition in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>information. He relies heavily on our decision in <em>Spotted Eagle. </em>The State charged the defendant in <em>Spotted Eagle </em>with partner or family member assault. The State specifically alleged in the information that the defendant had caused bodily injury. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 2. The State proceeded to offer a jury instruction after the parties had presented all the testimony that the defendant alternatively had committed the offense by having caused reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b633 We determined that the State\u2019s reliance on the additional theory of reasonable apprehension of bodily injury constituted a substantive change to the charge rather than simply a change in form. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 11. We concluded that \u201cchanging the essential elements change the nature and substance of the charge\u201d against the defendant. <em>Spotted Eagle, </em>\u00b6 11. The State\u2019s general citation to the criminal statute, rather than to the particular subsection, proved insufficient for the specific theory to be considered included in the information. <em>Spotted Eagle, \u00b6 </em>12.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b634 Lacey misplaces his reliance on <em>Spotted Eagle. </em>Our decision in <em>Spotted Eagle </em>rests on the premise that the State made no suggestion, before or during trial, that it would offer a reasonable apprehension of bodily injury theory. The State first raised the theory through the jury instruction at the close of evidence. Lacey cannot claim similar surprise here. As a general matter, we \"read the information, and the affidavit in support thereof, as a whole to determine the sufficiency of the charging documents.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2007 MT 327, \u00b6 25, 340 Mont. 191, 172 P.3d 1264. Lacey\u2019s argument neglects entirely the material available in the affidavit in support of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b635  The affidavit by Jane Mersen, a deputy county attorney, includes multiple references regarding J.G.\u2019s intoxication. For example, J.G. stated that he had been \u2018incredibly drunk\u201d every time that Lacey made a sexual advance. J.G. also stated that he had been \u2018incredibly trashed\u201d when one instance of the sexual intercourse without consent occurred. The affidavit also noted that J.G. had been highly intoxicated during the other instance of sexual intercourse without consent. The affidavit itself contained many references to J.G.\u2019s intoxication that constituted sufficient notice to Lacey that the State might rely upon subsection (B) of the \u2018incapable of consent\u201d statute. Section 45-5-501(l)(a)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
