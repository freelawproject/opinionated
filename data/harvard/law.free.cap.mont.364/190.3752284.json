He was convicted by a jury on January 5, 2011, and committed to the Department of Corrections for seven years with two years suspended on Count I, and given a six-month concurrent sentence to the Valley County Jail on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b62 Booth appeals, claiming that the State presented insufficient evidence to convict him of criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs. He also claims that his defense counsel was ineffective in failing to move for dismissal of Count I at the close of the State\u2019s case. We state the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b63 <em>Does \u00a7 45-9-107(1), MCA, require possession of two or more of the statute\u2019s listed precursor chemicals as an element of the offense ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b64 Law enforcement received reports from two pharmacies in Glasgow that Booth and his companion, Rebekah Ostwald, were purchasing the maximum allowable amount of pseudoephedrine cold medicine. Pharmacy employees also reported that Booth appeared nervous, fidgety, and wore no coat despite single-digit temperatures. Further, both signed pharmacy logs using out-of-town addresses. Police made contact with the duo, who explained that they were on their way back home to Williston, North Dakota, from Ostwald\u2019s National Guard training in Malta. They claimed to be stocking up on 12-hour pseudoephedrine products because Booth worked half-day shifts on oil rigs and could not stop working to take pills more frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b65 Ostwald would not consent to a search of her car, so police seized the car and applied for a search warrant. Upon receiving a warrant, a search yielded 10 boxes of cold medicine containing 10.08 grams of pseudoephedrine. The pills were from the two pharmacies in Glasgow, along with some purchased at Valley Drug in Malta. The search also revealed two bags of insulin syringes, a receipt for the purchase of pseudoephedrine from a Williston pharmacy, and a receipt for the purchase of Coleman fuel and lithium batteries from a WalMart in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Williston.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b66 At trial, the State presented witnesses who testified that the pseudoephedrine, discovered in conjunction with the receipts for Coleman fuel and lithium batteries, was consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine. Defense counsel conceded to Booth\u2019s possession of 10.08 grams of pseudoephedrine, but argued that the State failed to prove all of the elements of Count I because Booth had not possessed the drug \u2018in combination\u201d with another precursor as required by statute. Despite making this argument, defense counsel failed to move for the dismissal of Count I at the close of the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b67 We review a question on the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Azure, </em>2008 MT 211, \u00b6 13, 344 Mont. 188, 186 P.3d 1269. Our review of a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict is de novo. <em>Azure, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b68 Booth was charged with criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs, an offense that a person commits when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">(a) the person possesses any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination of the following with intent to manufacture dangerous drugs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">(i) phenyl-2-propanone (phenylacetone);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">(ii) piperidine in conjunction with cyclohexanone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">(iii) ephedrine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">(iv) lead acetate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">(v) methylamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">(vi) methylformamide;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-16\">(vii) n-methylephedrine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-17\">(viii) phenylpropanolamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-18\">(ix) pseudoephedrine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-19\">(x) anhydrous ammonia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-20\">(xi) hydriodic acid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-21\">(xii) red phosphorus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-22\">(xiii) iodine in conjunction with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or red phosphorus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(xiv) lithium in conjunction with anhydrous ammonia; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ane2\">(b) the person knowingly possesses anhydrous ammonia for the purpose of manufacturing dangerous drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Section 45-9-107(1), MCA. Violation of the statute is a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b69 A fundamental principle of our criminal justice system is that the State must prove every element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623. As noted above, an element of \u00a745-9-107(l)(a), MCA, requires that the defendant \u201cpossesses any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination of the following [precursor chemicals]....\u201d Booth argues that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to convict him because, of the list of precursors set forth in \u00a745-9-107(l)(i)-(xiv), MCA, he possessed pseudoephedrine alone. He argues that the plain language of the statute requires a showing he possessed a \u201ccombination\u201d of the listed precursors. The State argues that the statute does not require the possession of two or more precursors.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b610 From the outset, it is important to note that the receipt for the Coleman fuel and lithium batteries is not implicated in this appeal. The State\u2019s expert testified that the receipt evidenced the classic pattern of acquiring the materials needed to manufacture methamphetamine, and was thus relevant to the issue of intent. However, Coleman fuel (petroleum naphtha) is not found within the \u00a745-9-107(l)(a), MCA, list of precursor chemicals. Further, lithium is solely implicated when found \u2018in conjunction with anhydrous ammonia.\u201d Section 45-9-107(l)(a)(xiv), MCA. As such, our analysis is constrained to the argument of whether Booth\u2019s possession of 10.08 grams of pseudoephedrine is proscribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b611 In the construction of a statute, we are simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300. Our function as an appellate court is to ascertain and carry out the Legislature\u2019s intent by looking at the plain meaning of the words in the statute. <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 12. If legislative intent can be determined by the plain meaning of the words, we may go no further in applying any other meaning or interpretation. <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b612 The State refers to the canon of statutory construction that \u2018[t]he singular includes the plural and the plural the singular,\u201d and argues that possession of \u201c \u2018precursors\u2019 would necessarily include possession of a single identified \u2018precursor.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019See </em>\u00a71-2-105(3), MCA. However, we cannot ignore that the Legislature saw fit to include the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201ccombination\u201d in the statute. There is a presumption that the Legislature does not perform meaningless acts. <em>See e.g. U.S. v. Juvenile Male, </em>2011 MT 104, \u00b6 10, 360 Mont. 317, 255 P.3d 110. The word \u201ccombine\u201d means \u201cto join (two or more substances) to make a single substance, such as a chemical compound.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 377 (3d ed., Houghton Mifflin Co. 1996). Clearly, a single precursor chemical cannot be joined or united into a compound. Thus, we find the language of \u00a745-9-107(l)(a), MCA, clear and unambiguous and we need not consult canons of statutory construction in determining the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b613  We construe the language that states \u201cpossesses any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination of\u2019 to mean that one must possess two or more of the listed precursor chemicals or combinations of chemicals with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine to fall within the statute. This construction is based on a common sense approach that gives proper import to the use of the plural \u201cprecursors,\u201d and the inclusion of the word \u201ccombination\u201d in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b614  Accordingly, we conclude that the jury could not have rationally found beyond a reasonable doubt that the items seized from Ostwald\u2019s automobile met the statutory requirements of \u00a745-9-107, MCA. Given the above conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to address Booth\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b615 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse in part the judgment of the District Court and remand so that it can dismiss the felony criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs charge against Booth.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b218-9\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AY7\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u00b616 I concur in the decision to reverse, but under a different rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">\u00b617 I believe that \u00a7 45-9-107, MCA, is ambiguous. The pertinent statutory language provides that a person commits the offense of criminal possession of precursors to dangerous drugs \u2018if... the person possesses any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination\u201d of the list of precursor chemicals with intent to manufacture dangerous drugs. Section 45-9-107(l)(a), MCA. As the Court notes, the word \u201ccombination\u201d typically refers to two or more items joined together. Opinion, \u00b6 12. Yet, the terms \u201cany material\u201d or \u201ccompound\u201d could indicate that possession of just one of the listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>substances would be sufficient to incur criminal liability, particularly because it is not clear whether the term \u201ccombination\u201d applies to \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201ccompound,\u201d or just to \u201cpreparation.\u201d In the latter case, possession of a \u201cpreparation that contains any combination\u201d would be a separate offense from possession of a \u201ccompound.\u201d Further, as the State argues: \u2018Interpreting the term \u2018combination,\u2019 as used in the statute, to require possession of \u2018two or more\u2019 of the specified precursorsJl)(a)(i) through (xiv)-adds unnecessary and unintended terms to the offense. The legislature has already specifically indicated its intent to criminalize the possession of certain combinations of chemicals as precursors-moting those chemicals that would not constitute precursors, except in combination with other chemicals.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-9-107(l)(a)(xiii) and (xiv), MCA (\u201ciodine in conjunction with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or red phosphorus\u201d and \u201clithium in conjunction with anhydrous ammonia\u201d). Concluding that the statutory language is ambiguous, I would look to legislative history. <em>See In re </em>K.M.G., 2010 MT 81, \u00b6 26, 356 Mont. 91, 229 P.3d 1227 (citations omitted) (\u201cWhen the intent of the legislature cannot be determined from the plain language of the statute, we examine the statute\u2019s legislative history to determine its correct interpretation.\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b618 The language in question, \u201cpossesses any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any combination\u201d and most of the listed precursors, were added to the statute by Senate Bill 6 in 1999. Laws of Montana, 1999, ch. 24, \u00a7 1, at 82-83. Mike Batista, Administrator of the Division of Criminal Investigation of the Department of Justice, testified in support of the bill before both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. In the House Committee hearing, Batista testified that \u2018the key\u201d to the bill is that the chemicals have to be used together and there has to be intent to manufacture dangerous drugs. Mont. H. Comm, on Jud., <em>Hearing on Sen. Bill 6, </em>56th Legis., Reg. Sess. (Jan. 19,1999). In response to a question about whether retailers or pharmacists would need to register these chemicals or whether prescriptions would be needed, Mr. Batista responded, \u2018The short answer is no. Most of the chemicals you see before you [on the list], with few exceptions, are not controlled. Those chemicals have to be used in conjunction with one another. And the key point here is to establish the intent to manufacture.\u201d Mont. H. Comm, on Jud., <em>Hearing on Sen. Bill 6 </em>(Jan. 19, 1999). Further, in response to a question about whether there is a presumption that possession of some or all of these chemicals would constitute intent to manufacture dangerous drugs, Mr. Batista offered this explanation: \u2018This is a two-tier bill. Most of the chemicals you see [on the list]-if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>have them, if you possess them by themselves-it\u2019s not against the law. There\u2019s not a law against possession of those <em>individually. </em>It\u2019s two-tier, you have to have them <em>in conjunction with other chemicals </em>used to manufacture meth, which those are, and you have to have intent.\u201d Mont. H. Comm, on Jud., <em>Hearing on Sen. Bill 6 </em>(Jan. 19, 1999) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b619 I believe this legislative history resolves the ambiguity in the statutory language and demonstrates that possession of two or more of the listed precursor chemicals was intended to be necessary, along with the intent to manufacture dangerous drugs, in order to be held criminally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b620 I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-6\">JUSTICE NELSON and JUSTICE WHEAT join the concurring opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
