The case was subsequently transferred to District Court, which later denied M.W.\u2019s petition to be relieved of the registration requirement. M.W. appeals the denial of his petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by denying M. W. \u2019s petition to relieve him from the requirement to register as a sexual offender ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b63 In June 2007, the State filed a petition in Youth Court alleging M.W. was a delinquent youth. M.W. admitted that he committed sexual assault, in violation of \u00a745-5-502, MCA (2005), by touching his sister\u2019s genital area. At the time of the offense, M.W. was 14 and was three or more years older than his sister. The Youth Court adjudged M.W. as delinquent and placed him on probation until the age of 18, subject to numerous conditions. M.W. was not required to register as a sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\u00b64 In May 2008, the State filed a revocation petition, alleging that M.W. had violated probationary conditions. M.W. admitted to several of the allegations. The Youth Court committed M.W. to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for placement at Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility until the age of 18, but suspended the commitment upon conditions, including that he complete a sexual offender treatment program. M.W. was not required to register as a sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\u00b65 In April 2009, the State filed another revocation petition after M.W. was unsuccessfully discharged from sexual offender treatment. Describing M.W. as \u201ca serious juvenile offender,\u201d and reasoning that, despite all reasonable efforts to keep M.W. in his home and community, placement outside the community was necessary, the Youth Court committed M.W. to the DOC for placement at Pine Hills. The court stated that M.W. was to fully comply with sexual offender treatment at Pine Hills and \u201cshall not be discharged prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>completion of the program.\u201d In the event that M.W. failed to successfully complete the program by age 18, the State \u201cshall request that jurisdiction of the matter be transferred to District Court for Lewis and Clark County, pursuant to Montana Code Ann. Section 41-5-208.\u201d The court also ordered that M.W. \u201cshall register as a sexual offender at Level I,\u201d stating Tt]he statute tells me you have to register unless I can say that it\u2019s not necessary for the protection of the public and that registration is not in the public\u2019s best interest. And I don\u2019t believe I can find that at this point, so I\u2019m going to require registration.\u201dWhile M.W. argued against imposition ofthe registration requirement, he did not appeal from the Youth Court\u2019s July 2009 dispositional order.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b66 In August 2009, the State moved to transfer M.W.\u2019s case to District Court and his supervision to adult probation and parole pursuant to \u00a741-5-208, MCA, because he was approaching age 18 and had not completed sexual offender treatment. The Youth Court granted the motion, and the District Court entered an order that M.W. was \u201ctransferred to adult supervision under the Montana Department of Corrections until he reaches the age of 25, subject to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">1. The Defendant shall participate in a program of Sexual Offender Treatment with an MSOTA affiliated counselor as approved by the Adult Probation Department and successfully complete the program; said treatment program shall be evaluated on an on-going basis by his treatment team to determine that it is meeting the defendant\u2019s treatment needs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">2. The Defendant shall register as a sexual offender at Level I....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anu\">\u00b67 In February 2010, the State moved to amend the transfer order to add language stating: \u2018Should the youth complete all of his probation requirements prior to his 25th birthday, consideration may be given for an early release from supervision.\u201d The court granted the motion and amended the order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b68 In March 2010, M.W. filed a petition to terminate the remainder of his suspended sentence, stating he had completed sexual offender treatment and all probation requirements. The District Court granted M.W.\u2019s petition, ordering that M.W. \u201cshall be released from supervision by the Department of Corrections for the remaining portion of his suspended sentence.\u201d In July 2010, M.W. petitioned for an order relieving him of his duty to register as a sexual offender. The District Court denied the request, reasoning \u201c[t]he Court concludes that it has no authority at this time to modify the sentence and grant Defendant\u2019s request. Notwithstanding its lack of authority, the Court has no inclination to grant Defendant\u2019s request.\u201d M.W. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b69 \u2018We review conclusions of law to determine if they are correct.\u201d <em>In re C.D.H., </em>2009 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 349 Mont. 1, 201 P.3d 126 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err by denying M. W. \u2019s petition to relieve him from the requirement to register as a sex offender?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b611 M.W. first challenges the original imposition of the registration requirement. He notes that, while the 2007 version of the MCA mandated registration except in limited circumstances, the 2005 version made registration discretionary with the Youth Court. Because his offense was committed in 2006, M.W. argues that the 2005 version applies, and that the discretionary provisions and associated procedures within that version \u201ccannot be retroactively denied to him.\u201d M.W. argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>2011 MT 104, \u00b6 9, 360 Mont. 317, 255 P.3d 110, does not operate to retroactively apply the 2007 Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (SVORA) amendments to him because the \u201cprocedural protections\u201d under the 2005 Act \u201ccannot be deleted after-the-fact\u201d without violating ex post facto protections. Thus, M.W. argues that, because he was not afforded the protections of the 2005 law when the registration requirement was originally imposed, he cannot be validly required to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b612 However, as the State notes, M.W. did not appeal from the order imposing the registration requirement entered by the Youth Court in July 2009. Under M. R. App. P. 5 (now M. R. App. P. 4(5)), M.W. had 60 days to appeal, but that time has long passed, and the challenge he now attempts to make to the original imposition of the requirement has been forfeited. <em>See State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318 (citation omitted) (\u2018Muhammad first filed his notice of appeal on July 26, 2000, more than one year after the imposition of the banishment condition in the May 28, 1999, Order. Therefore, since Muhammad failed to timely file a notice of appeal from the May 28, 1999, Order, he is precluded from now challenging the legality of the conditions therein imposed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">\u00b613 Alternatively, M.W. argues that, even if the 2007 amendments are retroactively applicable to him, he is no longer under a duty to register because the requirement was imposed as a condition of his sentence, and he has now been released from supervision. Although no precedent is offered in support of this proposition, M.W. reasons that he \u2018has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>complied with all of the terms of his probation and has been relieved of his probationary sentence, [and] is now entitled to be relieved from the probationary condition that he register as a sexual offender.\u201d The State responds that M.W. waived this argument because he is raising it for the first time on appeal, and even if this Court chooses to address M.W.\u2019s argument, sexual offender registration is an independent requirement under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"ABC\">\u00b614 \u201c \u2018The general rule is that issues not raised before the trial court and new legal theories are not considered by this Court on appeal because it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it was never given an opportunity to consider.\u2019 <em>\u201dState v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 11, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929 (quoting <em>State v. Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 5, 313 Mont. 218, 61 P.3d 749); <em>see also Whitehorn v. Whitehorn Farms, Inc., </em>2008 MT 361, \u00b6 21, 346 Mont. 394, 195 P.3d 836. However, if an appellate argument is a change in emphasis, rather than an entirely new theory, we have considered such arguments. <em>See Whitehorn, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>see also Becker v. Rosebud Operating Servs., Inc., </em>2008 MT 285, \u00b6 18, 345 Mont. 368, 191 P.3d 435. It is correct, as the State points out, that M.W. did not argue in the District Court that, because of his release from supervision, he was relieved of the duty to register as a matter of law. He did argue that \u00a7\u00a746-23-506(3) and 41-5-1513, MCA, provided discretion to the District Court to relieve him from the registration requirement because he had registered \u2018for a sufficient time period.\u201d Further, the District Court denied M.W.\u2019s petition, in part, upon the conclusion that it was without authority to grant relief from registration, and thus the court had the opportunity to rule on the issue. Therefore, we conclude that M.W.\u2019s appellate argument is appropriately made.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b615  M.W.\u2019s argument assumes that sexual offender registration is a general sentencing condition which operates only as long as the probationary sentence is in effect. Generally, probation conditions cannot continue beyond the time of supervision. <em>See State v. Grana, </em>2009 MT 250, \u00b6 17, 351 Mont. 499, 213 P.3d 783 (emphasis added) (an internet restriction as a condition of sentence \u201capplies <em>only so long </em>as Grana is subject to probationary conditions\u201d). However, registration is not a general condition which a sentencing court is merely authorized to impose upon a probationary sentence. Rather, apart from the general sentencing statutes, registration is prescribed by discrete statutes that govern the imposition and duration of registration for sexual offenders, including youth offenders. Section 41-5-1513, MCA (2007); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-23-502 through -506, MCA (2007). These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>provisions specifically delineate the crimes for which registration must be imposed and the circumstances under which an offender may be exempted from registration. <em>See State v. White Bear, </em>2005 MT 7, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 337, 106 P.3d 516 (citing <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 68, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829) (\u201cWhite Bear\u2019s argument is based on the incorrect premise that registration was a condition of his sentence for the previous ... offense and, as such, was part of the punishment for that offense. Violation of the SVORA registration requirements is a separate statutory offense; the registration requirements are not part of criminal sentencing on the original sexual or violent offense.\u201d); <em>C.D.H., </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis added) (\u201cSection 46-23-504, MCA, calls for <em>all </em>sexual offenders to register, including those offenders designated as level l.\u2019O. Failure to register as required by these separate provisions constitutes a crime, for which criminal penalties may be imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00b6 16 [2] \u201cA district court\u2019s authority in sentencing a criminal defendant is defined and constrained by statute, and the court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, 133 P.3d 206 (citation omitted). Here, sentencing courts are constrained and must impose registration under the terms of the governing statutes. Courts have no authority to exempt or release a defendant from registration unless authorized to do so by these provisions. Other jurisdictions have likewise held. <em>See State v. Myers, </em>256 P.3d 13, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44 (N.M. 2011) (internal citations omitted) (\u201cSORNA registration is not a sentence, nor is it a condition of release. Rather, \u2018registration and notification provisions under SORNA are immediate and automatic\u2019.... \u2018The duty to register ... arises by legislative mandate, not by court order.... The duty to register is an independent statutory duty with a remedial purpose and is not terminated by dismissal of criminal charges.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Munds, </em>922 P.2d 215, 217 (Wash. App. Div. 3 1996) (\u2018the duty to register as a sex offender arises pursuant to legislative mandate, rather than by order of the sentencing court\u201d and rej ecting defendant\u2019s argument that registration was not required because he was not under supervision); <em>State v. Robinson, </em>142 P.3d 729 (Idaho 2006) (rejecting request of defendant-who pled guilty to a sexual offense and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>placed on probation, then completed probation and successfully petitioned to set aside his guilty plea-feo be relieved from registration because he had not satisfied the statutory requirements). While M. W.\u2019 s disposition order may have treated registration as a condition of sentence, nonetheless it was also a stand-alone requirement dictated by statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b617 Section 41-5-1513(l)(d), MCA (2007), requires a delinquent youth who has been adjudicated for a sexual offense, as defined by \u00a746-23-502, MCA, to register unless the court finds that the youth has not previously been adjudicated for a sexual offense, that registration is not necessary for protection of the public, and that relief from registration is in the public\u2019s best interest. <em>See C.D.H, </em>\u00b6 24. M.W. was adjudicated of such a sexual offense and registration was imposed because, as the Youth Court indicated, it could not find the facts necessary under the statute to exempt M.W. from the requirement. M.W. did not appeal from the order imposing the requirement. Then, the duration of a youth\u2019s registration requirement is governed by several provisions, beginning with \u00a741-5-1513(5), MCA. It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">The duration of registration for a youth who is required to register as a sexual or violent offender must be as provided in 46-23-506, except that the court may, based on specific findings of fact, order a lesser duration of registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In turn, \u00a746-23-506, MCA, which is part of the adult sexual offender registration statutes, provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">46-23-506. Duration of registration. (1) A sexual offender required to register under this part shall register for the remainder of the offender\u2019s life, except as provided in subsection (3) or during a period of time during which the offender is in prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">(3)(b) [Except for circumstances not applicable here], at any time after 10 years of registration for a level 1 sexual offender and at any time after 25 years of registration for a level 2 sexual offender, an offender may petition the sentencing court or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides for an order relieving the offender of the duty to register.... The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>court may grant the petition upon finding that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">(i) the offender has remained a law-abiding citizen; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">(ii) continued registration is not necessary for public protection and that relief from registration is in the best interests of society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b618 Applying these provisions here, the Youth Court entered no \u201cspecific findings of fact\u201d necessary under \u00a7 41-5-1513(5), MCA, to order a lesser duration of M.W.\u2019s registration requirement. It simply ordered that M.W. \u201cshall register as a sexual offender at Level I.\u201d Consequently, registration was imposed for the standard duration, which, as stated by \u00a741-5-1513(5), MCA, is governed by \u00a746-23-506, MCA. Under \u00a7 46-23-506, MCA, registration is imposed for life, but permits level 1 and level 2 offenders to petition the court for relief of the requirement after a period of registration. The period is 10 years for level 1 offenders, and 25 years for level 2 offenders. M.W. was designated a level 1 offender, and thus may petition for relief from registration only after he has completed a 10-year period of registration. M.W.\u2019s registration requirement began with the Youth Court\u2019s order in July 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b619  The District Court analyzed the issue correctly by concluding that it did not have authority, at the present time, to relieve M.W. from the registration requirement. Under his sentence, M.W. must register for a period of 10 years before he becomes eligible to seek relief of the requirement. Nothing in our opinion today forecloses M.W.\u2019s ability to petition the court for such relief from registration after that period has elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, BAKER, MORRIS and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-4\"> Violation of a condition of supervision may result in revocation of the suspended sentence.
