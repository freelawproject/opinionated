He was sentenced to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for two concurrent, 20-year terms with ten years suspended. He was classified as a tier III sexual offender, and his sentence imposed numerous conditions on the suspended portion related to this classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b62 The State moved to revoke the suspended portion of Cook\u2019s sentence on June 17, 20104wo days before he was scheduled to be released from custody. The District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, revoked Cook\u2019s suspended sentence and sentenced him to two concurrent, 10-year commitments to the DOC with five years suspended. Cook timely appeals from the District Court\u2019s disposition order revoking his suspended sentence. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b63 The suspended portion of Cook\u2019s sentence contained 25 total conditions. The following four played some role in his revocation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">1. Defendant shall be placed under the supervision of the Adult Probation and Parole Bureau during the suspended portion of the sentence and shall follow all rules and regulations thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">6. Defendant shall obtain any counseling/evaluations, at his own expense, as deemed appropriate by his supervising officer and shall follow all recommendations of his counseling/evaluations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">10. Defendant shall obtain sex offender counseling by an MSOTA [Montana Sexual Offender Treatment Association] recognized therapist and abide by all of the expenses, conditions and recommendations of the therapist....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">15. Defendant\u2019s place of residence shall not be within 1500 feet of a school, playgrounds, toy stores, etc....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b64 Having served nearly 10 years and completed sexual offender treatment under his initial commitment, Cook\u2019s pre-parole plan listed his sister-in-law\u2019s Great Falls address as his residence upon release. However, he was notified in January, 2010 that this address violated the condition of his suspended sentence that prohibited him from residing within 1500 feet of certain locations. Cook was then told by his institutional probation officer that he could stay at a rescue mission in Great Falls, but this was later ruled out because of its proximity to a women\u2019s athletic center. His probation officer then informed him he could be released as a transient. Three days before his release, however, Cook was told that his outpatient treatment provider was dropping him because of lack of adequate housing. Cook was now in violation of condition 10 as well. The next day, on June 17, the State petitioned to revoke his suspended sentence, alleging that he was in violation of conditions 1, 10 and 15. Cook was arrested while still an inmate and held pending hearings in September and November of 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u00b65 With the hearings pending, Cook found providers for outpatient treatment in both Great Falls and Helena. Blair Hopkins was willing to accept Cook as a client in Helena, and Dr. Donna Zook was willing to treat him in either city. He also found potentially suitable housing in each community. In Great Falls, Cook found a trailer park with other sexual offenders living in it that his probation officer was willing to approve. They also found an apartment that complied with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>residency conditions. In Helena, he obtained a commitment from God\u2019s Love Shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b66 The State argued that the Helena shelter was inappropriate because it served women and children, although those populations resided on a separate, locked floor. Similarly, the State opposed the Great Falls trailer park residence because a rebuttal witness informed the court that she drove past the park and it was \u2018Virtually across the street\u201d from school bus stops. The witness did concede, however, that several other sex offenders had been paroled to that particular park. As for the Great Falls apartment, the State\u2019s witness testified that while it was not near schools, daycares, or parks, \u201cgrandmothers, reside within the building that provide daycare to their grandchildren.\u201d Travel to Helena for treatment was rejected because Cook could not be supervised there by his parole officer. Finally, the State opposed treatment in Great Falls by Dr. Zook because she was not a member of MSOTA. Cook presented evidence by an investigator who testified that in two months of effort, he found a single landlord who would rent Cook one of three apartments. Only one of those apartments satisfied condition 15. Cook argued that the DOC made no effort to help him comply with his conditions, and that because of his lack of culpability and the fact that there were alternatives available, due process required consideration of alternatives to revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b67 The District Court found that Cook violated conditions 1 and 15 of his suspended sentence by not having an approved residence on the eve of his release. Instead of finding that he had violated condition 10, the court found that he violated condition 6 \"with respect to treatment and counseling. The District Court found that \u201cwith respect to residence, [Cook] has not identified a place of residence outside the 1,500 feet from schools, playgrounds, places where children congregate, etc... in the nearly five months that have elapsed since his discharge dates.\u201d The court rejected the Great Falls apartment complex because it contained \u201cat least nine units, and maybe more, in which it can be assumed that children live and congregate.\u201d Treatment from Dr. Zook was rejected because she was not MSOTA qualified, and the court was unwilling to consider Cook living at the shelter or travelling to Helena for his treatment. The court opined, \u2018This is the defendant\u2019s issue and the difficulty is a result of his conduct and record. And that is not something that the Court can remedy or overlook.\u201d In addition to revoking Cook\u2019s suspended sentence and sentencing him to two concurrent, 10-year commitments to the DOC with five years suspended, the District Court reimposed the conditions of Cook\u2019s original suspended sentence and added 16 more.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00b68 Cook initially claims that the District Court lacked authority to revoke his suspended sentence because the petition to revoke was not filed during the term of the suspended sentence. He also claims that the District Court erred in finding that he violated the conditions of his suspended sentence when he was still in custody and had yet to have the opportunity to comply with the conditions. He urges that it was an abuse of discretion and due process violation to revoke his suspended sentence when his alleged violations were not willful and alterative measures were available to meet the State\u2019s penological interests. Finally, he argues that his revocation sentence contains illegal sentencing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b69 <em>Issue one: whether the District Court exceeded its statutory authority, in violation of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA (1999), when it considered and granted the State\u2019s petition to revoke Cook\u2019s suspended sentence that was filed before the period of suspension had begun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b610 <em>Issue two: whether the District Court abused its discretion by revoking Cook\u2019s suspended sentence when his violations were unwillful.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">\u00b611 <em>Issue three: whether the District Court imposed illegal conditions on Cook\u2019s revocation sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a suspended sentence for abuse of discretion and whether a preponderance of the evidence supported the court\u2019s decision. <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, \u00b6 8, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300. The trial judge must be reasonably satisfied that the conduct of the probationer has not been what the probationer agreed it would be if the probationer were given liberty. <em>State v. Goff, </em>2011 MT 6, \u00b6 13, 359 Mont. 107, 247 P.3d 715. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Burke, </em>2005 MT 250, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 1, 122 P.3d 427. However, when the issue presented is whether the district court had authority to take a specific action, the question is one of law and is subject to de novo review. <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b613 Where a defendant was sentenced to more than one year of actual incarceration, and therefore is eligible for sentence review, we review the sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Bullplume, </em>2011 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 359 Mont. 289, 251 P.3d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u00b614 <em>Issue one: whether the District Court exceeded its statutory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>authority, in violation of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA (1999), when it considered and granted the State\u2019s petition to revoke Cook\u2019s suspended sentence that was filed before the period of suspension had begun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Stiffarm, </em>we concluded that then-existing case law that allowed prosecutors to file petitions to revoke before the start of the suspended sentence was contrary to the plain language of \u00a746-18-203(2), MCA (1999), which at the time provided: \u201c[T]he petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court during the period of suspension or deferral.\u201d <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 19. Because the State filed its petition to revoke two days before the commencement of Cook\u2019s suspended sentence, he argues that the District Court lacked legal authority to revoke his suspended sentence. The State argues that our <em>Stiffarm </em>holding should only be applied prospectively, thus applicable to cases between the decision date of January 26, 2011, and April 20, 2011, when the Legislature amended \u00a746-18-203(2), MCA, in response to the case. We are persuaded by the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b616 When a decision of this Court results in a \u201cnew rule,\u201d that rule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review. <em>State v. Reichmand, </em>2010 MT 228, \u00b6 14, 358 Mont. 68, 243 P.3d 423. However, when an offender appeals the revocation of a suspended sentence, he does not attack the validity of his conviction. Rather, he attacks the validity of his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a746-21-101, MCA (providing for collateral remedy from sentences). A revocation proceeding is a \u201cpurely administrative action designed to determine whether a parolee or probationer has violated the conditions of his parole or probation, not a proceeding designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law.\u201d <em>State v. Haagenson, </em>2010 MT 95, \u00b6 15, 356 Mont. 177, 232 P.3d 367. Revocation subjects the defendant to execution of the original sentence as though he had never been given a suspension of sentence. <em>Haagenson, </em>\u00b6 16. This process, however, \u201cis not a criminal adjudication, does not require proof of a criminal offense, [and] does not impose punishment for any new offense.\u201d <em>Haagenson, </em>\u00b6 16. As such, the posture of our review in this case is collateral in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b617 When a conviction is already final and a collateral remedy is sought, a \u201cnew rule\u201d applies only in limited circumstances. <em>State v. Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. 114, 126, 900 P.2d 260, 267 (1995). New substantive rules generally apply retroactively. <em>Shriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-352, 124 S. Ct. 2519, 2522 (2004). A rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes. <em>Shriro, </em>542 U.S. at 353, 124 S. Ct. at 2523. Retroactive application is needed in situations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201cnecessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal\u201d or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him. <em>Shriro, </em>542 U.S. at 351-352, 124 S. Ct. at 2522 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b618 New rules of procedure, however, do not typically apply retroactively. <em>Shriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S. Ct. at 2523. New constitutional rules of criminal procedure apply only when they are \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure ... without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u201d <em>Gratzer v. Mahoney, </em>2006 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 297, 150 P.3d 343 (quoting <em>Shriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S. Ct. at 2523 (internal quotation omitted)). Rules that regulate only the manner of determining the defendant\u2019s culpability are procedural. <em>Gratzer, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Shriro, </em>542 U.S. at 353, 124 S. Ct. at 2523).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b619 In Cook\u2019s case the State moved to revoke his suspended sentence two days before its commencement and over seven months before we announced <em>Stiffarm. </em>The timing of the State\u2019s petition conformed to our then-existing interpretation of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA. <em>See e.g. Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>State v. LeDeau, </em>2009 MT 276, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 352 Mont. 140, 215 P.3d 672; <em>State v. Morrison, </em>2008 MT 16, \u00b6\u00b6 13-18, 341 Mont. 147, 176 P.3d 1027. Procedural statutes in effect at the time that a case proceeds to trial are the rules that are to be applied to the resolution of that dispute. <em>State v. Edwards, </em>2011 MT 210, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 478, 260 P.3d 396. <em>Stiffarm </em>overturned a prior line of cases involving the judicial interpretation of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA. In doing so, we announced a rule that did not inhibit the State\u2019s ability to substantively proscribe and punish a defendant, but merely established procedures that the State must follow when moving to revoke a suspended sentence. Moreover, this was not a watershed rule that could have application to the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b620  Accordingly, we hold that <em>Stiffarm </em>applies prospectively to cases on collateral review in Montana courts and therefore conclude that the District Court did not lack authority to revoke Cook\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b621 <em>Issue two: whether the District Court abused its discretion by revoking Cook\u2019s suspended sentence when his violations were not willful.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b622 Cook contends that the District Court abused its discretion in revoking his suspended sentence because there was no evidence that he actually violated a condition. He argues that his substantive due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>process rights were violated when the District Court failed to consider alternatives to revocation, and that any violations were not willful. The State simply counters that Cook did indeed violate conditions of his suspended sentence, and thus the District Court\u2019s decision was supported by evidence. The State further argues that Cook\u2019s due process rights do not require that his violations be willful, and that the District Court considered, but rejected, any offered alternatives to revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b623 Where the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended sentence, the judge has the authority to revoke the suspended sentence. <em>State v. Tirey, </em>2010 MT 283, \u00b6 21, 358 Mont. 510, 247 P.3d 701. A single violation of the terms and conditions of a sentence is sufficient to support a court\u2019s revocation of that sentence. <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 21. However, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution imposes procedural and substantive limits on the revocation of the conditional liberty created by probation or parole. <em>State v. Lee, </em>2001 MT 176, \u00b6 18, 306 Mont. 173, 31 P.3d 998 (citing <em>Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 666, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 2069 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Bearden, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered the substantive limits imposed by the Due Process Clause on revocation for failure to pay a fine and restitution in the absence of evidence that the defendant was culpable or that alternative forms of punishment were inadequate. <em>Bearden, </em>461 U.S. at 665, 103 S. Ct. at 2069. The Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">If the probationer has made all reasonable efforts to pay the fine or restitution, and yet cannot do so through no fault of his own, it is fundamentally unfair to revoke probation automatically without considering whether adequate methods of punishing the defendant are available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\"><em>Bearden, </em>461 U.S. at 668-669, 103 S. Ct. at 2070-2071.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b625 Accordingly, the revocation resulted in a denial of due process. The holding of <em>Bearden, </em>however, does not prohibit a revocation of probation in other contexts, even if the failure to obey a condition of probation is not found to be intentional or willful. <em>See Black v. Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 611, 105 S. Ct. 2254, 2257 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b626 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bearden </em>was limited to \u201crevocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution.\u201d <em>Bearden, </em>461 U.S. at 672, 103 S. Ct. at 2073. Importantly, the Supreme Court went on to observe: \u2018We do not suggest that, in other contexts, the probationer\u2019s lack of fault in violating a term of probation would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>necessarily prevent a court from revoking probation.\u201d <em>Bearden, </em>461 U.S. at 668, 103 S. Ct. at 2070 n.9. Montana case law also holds that violations of non-financial conditions need not necessarily be willful in order to justify revocation. <em>See Lee, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b627 In <em>Lee, </em>defendant\u2019s suspended sentence was conditioned on completing a sexual offender treatment program while incarcerated. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 5. Lee spent several years on a wait list for the various levels of the sexual offender program, a delay that was further delayed by a sit down strike. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 6. He nearly completed phase II before his release date and subsequent revocation. We found that when the circumstances are such that failure to complete a condition of probation is solely the fault of the State, due process requires the trial court to consider adequate alternatives to incarceration. <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 23. \u00b628 Despite our conclusion in <em>Lee, </em>we have subsequently rejected analysis based upon fault when an alleged good faith effort to comply with conditions nevertheless results in the violation of conditions related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation or the protection of the public. <em>See e.g. Tirey, </em>\u00b6 24 (revocation affirmed over defendant\u2019s allegation that his good faith effort was frustrated by his probation officer\u2019s unreasonable demands, his poverty, and bad weather); <em>State v. Senn, </em>2003 MT 52, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 314 Mont. 348, 66 P.3d 288 (revocation affirmed despite argument that good faith effort to comply was derailed by poor health and poverty); <em>State v. Williams, </em>1999 MT 240, \u00b6 24, 296 Mont. 258, 993 P.2d 1 (defendant\u2019s inability to secure sex offender treatment frustrated purpose of probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b629 Our holding in <em>Williams </em>is instructive in this case. Williams was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent and received a suspended sentence conditioned upon his acceptance into either of two state pre-release centers and completion of a sex offender treatment program. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. However, both pre-release center programs rejected Williams because of his lack of social skills, immaturity, and behavior. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 9. The State\u2019s motion to revoke Williams\u2019 probation was granted because he could not comply with the conditions of suspension. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 10. We affirmed the revocation because Williams\u2019 inability to secure treatment \u2018frustrated the purpose of probation, namely, his rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 17. In <em>Lee, </em>we reaffirmed this conclusion, opining: \u2018We do not believe our holding in <em>Williams </em>suffers from any constitutional infirmity.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 21. Importantly, we observed that the court in <em>Williams </em>considered alternatives, but determined that none short of incarceration was suitable. <em>See Lee, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u00b630  In this case, the District Court found Cook to be an \u201cextremely dangerous sex offender,\u201d with \u201cquestionable\u201d prospects for rehabilitation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cook\u2019s burden was to come up with a plan to show that he could be released to serve his suspended sentence in compliance with its conditions. Yet, even five months after the petition to revoke was filed, Cook had failed to find an MSOTA-qualified treatment provider and a residence that complied with his conditions of suspension. Thus, the court found him to remain a \u2018high risk to children in need of the highest level of supervision,\u201d and determined that no alternatives short of incarceration were suitable. Cook\u2019s reliance upon <em>Lee </em>is misplaced because there is no indication that the State was responsible for any portion of this failure. Whether Cook\u2019s violations were or were not voluntary is not dispositive. Such an approach to the revocation question ignores the fact that circumstances other than conduct chargeable to the defendant may nevertheless frustrate the purposes of probation and suspension of sentences-specifically, rehabilitation and protection of the public. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Cook\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b631 <em>Issue three: whether the District Court imposed illegal conditions on Cook\u2019s revocation sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b632 Cook\u2019s revocation sentence reimposed the conditions of his original suspended sentence and added another 16. Cook challenges two of the newly imposed conditions, along with the 1500 foot residential exclusionary zone condition of his original suspended sentence. He argues that these conditions are punitive in nature, and thus constitute a greater sentence upon revocation than that to which he was originally sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b633  When the court finds that the offender has violated the conditions of the suspended sentence, it may \u201crevoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence imposed or any lesser sentence.\u201d Section 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA (1997). Determining whether the sentence at revocation is the \u201csame or lesser\u201d than the sentence originally imposed requires that we look at the substance of the conditions to determine whether they are punitive in nature. <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 28. We review new conditions in the context of the entire sentence; that is, whether the overall revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>sentence constitutes more or less punishment than the sentence originally imposed. <em>Tirey, </em>\u00b6 28. The District Court sentenced Cook to serve the 10 years originally suspended, but now with 5 years suspended. In other words, Cook\u2019s revocation sentence suspends 5 years of a commitment that he could have otherwise been required to serve. As such, the revocation sentence conforms to the requirements of \u00a746-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b634 Although the 2010 sentence requires the integration of 16 new conditions, many of those conditions merely reiterate the conditions of Cook\u2019s original suspended sentence. Condition two of Cook\u2019s revocation sentence prohibits him from frequenting \u201cplaces where children congregate,\u201d including \u201cparties, family functions, [and] holiday festivities\u201d without probation and parole approval and a chaperone. Cook argues that this is an unduly restrictive intrusion into his family relations and right to associate. However, \u00a746-18-203(7)(a)(ii), MCA (1997), allows for modified or additional terms or conditions. And, when found \u201cnecessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-202(l)(c), MCA, permits a court to impose \u201crestrictions on the offender\u2019s freedom of association.\u201d Likewise, Cook alleges that the 1,500 foot residential exclusionary zone in the original sentence is unduly punitive because it is \u201ctantamount to banishment.\u2019Tn <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318, we did hold that a condition banishing the offender from Cascade County was \u201cnot reasonably related to the goals of rehabilitation and is broader than necessary to protect the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b635  We use a nexus test to determine whether a restriction or condition meets the requirements of \u00a746-18-202(l)(g), MCA. <em>State v. Guill, </em>2011 MT 32, \u00b6 59, 359 Mont. 225, 248 P.3d 826. This test is satisfied so long as the condition is reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society, and has a correlation to the underlying offense or the offender. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 59. Here, the nexus between these conditions and Cook, considering his substantial history as a sexual offender, as well as his current offense, is readily apparent. The last time Cook was left unsupervised with children he sexually assaulted them. Further, the District Court found that Cook still presented an extreme threat to children. Thus, restricting Cook\u2019s contact with children not only serves to protect society, but the condition will serve the objective of rehabilitation in that it reduces his likelihood of reoffending. We find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing conditions reasonably designed to protect society and serve Cook\u2019s rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u00b636  Finally, the revocation sentence requires that Cook be \u201cplaced on GPS monitoring for the entirety of his supervision at his own expense.\u201d This service is currently unavailable in Montana. As such, the State concedes the issue as an impossible condition. Consequently, this matter will be remanded to the District Court to strike the GPS requirement as illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b637 We affirm the District Court\u2019s revocation of Cook\u2019s suspended sentence. However, we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition 15 in the revocation order and remand to strike the illegal GPS condition. We affirm the District Court's imposition of the other new conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b638 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-7\">JUSTICES RICE, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\"> <em>See N.C. v.

The \u201cconcerns for stability, predictability and equal treatment\u2019 in the law\u201d I voiced in <em>Stiffarm </em>(\u00b6 22 (Baker, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Formicove, Inc. v. Burlington N., </em>207 Mont. 189, 194, 673 P.2d 469, 472 (1983)), would not be served by overruling it, as the State advocates we do in this case. The legislature quickly changed the statute to leave no doubt about the intent we ascribed to it for many years. Continuing the roller coaster at this point would advance little purpose. Rather, for the reasons stated by the Court, I concur that Stiffarm\u2019s application should be prospective only. The petition to revoke Cook\u2019s suspended sentence was filed properly according to the law in effect at the time of Cook\u2019s crimes, the law in effect at the time of revocation, and the law in effect now. For that reason, I join the Court\u2019s opinion here.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-10\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b196-11\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AI4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b640 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">\u00b641 The State has misstated the issue in this case, and the Court has unfortunately taken the bait. The question here is not whether <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300, should be applied retroactively. This is not a retroactivity case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">\u00b642 Our law is well established and unequivocal: \u2018The law in effect at the time an offense is committed controls as to the possible sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>for the offense, <em>as well as the revocation of that sentence.\u201d State v. Tirey, </em>2010 MT 283A, \u00b6 26, 358 Mont. 510, 247 P.3d 701 (emphasis added) (citing <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 220, 113 P.3d 297). \u201c[A] person has the right to be sentenced <em>under the statutes which are in effect at the time of the offense, </em>and ... imposition of a sentence under statutes not in effect at the time an offense was committed is an <em>ex post facto </em>application of the law and therefore unconstitutional.\u201d <em>State v. Striplin, </em>2009 MT 76, \u00b6 30, 349 Mont. 466, 204 P.3d 687 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b643 The 1997 Montana Code Annotated was in effect at the time of Cook\u2019s offense. Section 46-18-203(2), MCA (1997), states that \u201c[t]he petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court <em>during </em>the period of suspension or deferral\u201d (emphasis added). The revocation of Cook\u2019s sentence is controlled by this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b644 So, what does \u201c[t]he petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court during the period of suspension or deferral\u201d mean? In <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14, this Court explained exactly what this language means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">The language of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA, is clear and unambiguous. It states that a petition for revocation must be filed <em>\u201cduring </em>the period of suspension or deferral.\u201d Section 46-18-203(2), MCA (emphasis added). The meaning of \u201cduring\u201dis: \u201c1: throughout the continuance or course of; 2: at some point in the course of,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>703 (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1971), \u201c1: throughout the entire time of; all through; 2: at some point in the entire time of; in the course of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary </em>443 (4th ed., Wiley Publishing 2002).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">The plain meaning of \u00a746-18-203(2), MCA, is that the State may properly file a petition to revoke a suspended or deferred sentence only after the sentence has commenced and before it concludes, not before and not after the period of suspension or deferral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b645 In <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17, this Court explained that \u00a746-18-203(2), MCA, has <em>always </em>had this meaning, ever since its enactment in 1983. The problem was that some of our post-1983 precedents had relied on pre-1983 decisions in suggesting that a district court has the authority to consider and grant a petition to revoke a suspended sentence that is filed <em>before </em>the defendant begins serving that sentence. We corrected that erroneous conception in <em>Stiffarm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u00b646 While the State consumes some 14 pages of its brief on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>attacking and bemoaning <em>Stiffarm, </em>the fact remains that <em>Stiffarm </em>is the law. Contrary to the Court\u2019s analysis, our decision <em>in Stiffarm </em>did not announce any \u201cnew rules.\u201d All this Court did in <em>Stiffarm </em>is simply interpret and apply the plain language of \u00a746-18-203(2), MCA, which stated that Tt]he petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court <em>during </em>the period of suspension or deferral\u201d (emphasis added). This is the language which existed in the 1997 MCA. This is the language, therefore, which governed the District Court\u2019s authority to revoke Cook\u2019s sentence. We said in <em>Stiffarm </em>that \u201cduring\u201d really does mean \u201cduring,\u201d not \u2018before\u201d and not \u201cafter.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court lacked authority to revoke Cook\u2019s suspended sentence based on the State\u2019s petition for revocation that was filed two days <em>before </em>Cook was scheduled to begin serving the suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b647 Retroactivity analysis is completely irrelevant to this case. And in applying such analysis here, the Court violates the fundamental principle that the revocation of a suspended sentence is controlled by \u201cthe statutes which are in effect at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 16. Regrettably, I believe the Court has, in fact, continued \u201cthe roller coaster\u201d in this case. Concurrence, \u00b6 39.1 would reverse on Issue One and not address Issues Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b648 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
