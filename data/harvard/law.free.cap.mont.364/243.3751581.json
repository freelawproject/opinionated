The District Court limited the scope of evidence regarding foreseeability, denied Newman\u2019s motion for partial summaryjudgment as to joint liability for the tortious conduct of the defendants, and excluded certain evidence of the history of the defendants\u2019 schools and programs. A jury found that defendants Robert Lichfield (Lichfield) and the World Wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Association of Specialty Programs and Schools, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (WWASP), were not negligent, did not commit deceit or negligent misrepresentation, and were not liable for the possible wrongful acts of other defendants regarding Karlye\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b62 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b63 Newman raises three issues on appeal. A restatement of the issues is:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b64 1. Did the District Court err in limiting the scope of evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">concerning foreseeability?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\u00b65 2. Did the District Court err in denying partial summary judgment as to joint tortious conduct by the defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">\u00b66 3. Did the District Court err in excluding certain evidence of the history of the defendants\u2019 programs and schools?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">\u00b67 After years of working at boarding schools designed to assist troubled teens, Lichfield and colleague Brent Facer (Facer) started similar specialty schools and related businesses that provided services to the schools. Around 1996, Lichfield and others formed Peacox Enterprises, LLC (Peacox), and purchased the property and facilities of a former boarding school in Thompson Falls, Montana. The group also formed Utah-based Spring Creek Lodge, LLC, to operate a specialty boarding school for trouble teenagers on the Thompson Falls property. Cameron Pul\u00edan (Cameron) was hired as director, and his twin brother Chaffin Pul\u00edan (Chaffin) was hired as associate director. Cameron had a high school education and previously worked as an electrician, YMCA counselor, and shift supervisor at Cross Creek Manor, a Utah-based facility for wayward youth, owned by Lichfield and Facer. Chaffin previously worked as a waiter, ran a handyman business, and was a residential manager of Cross Creek Manor.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">\u00b68 Around 1997, Lichfield and Facer formed Teen Help, LLC (Teen Help); National Contract Services, LLC (National Contract); WWASP; and other entities. Teen Help dealt with admissions to specialty schools. Parents would contact Teen Help and select a school where they wished to place their child. Teen Help would then place the child at a school and receive a commission from the school. National Contract provided billing, collections, consulting, and budget services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>for the specialty schools in exchange for a percentage of each school\u2019s gross income. WWASP provided seminars, support groups, a web-based communication program, a magazine, a Policy and Procedure Manual listing its responsibilities and those of its member schools, and a combination of purchasing, public relations, and consulting services in exchange for an association fee of $75 per student per month from the schools. In addition, WWASP member schools were required to sign contracts with other companies owned by Lichfield and his relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b69 Meanwhile, Cameron helped form a Montana-based Spring Creek Lodge, LLC, to own and operate the school in Thompson Falls. In 1999, while Peacox retained title to the property and buildings, the Utah-based Spring Creek Lodge, LLC, sold the school to the Montana-based Spring Creek Lodge, LLC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under a lease requiring the land to be used for a WWASP member school, Peacox leased the property to the Montana-based Spring Creek Lodge, LLC. In 2000, the Montana-based Spring Creek Lodge, LLC, was dissolved and Spring Creek Lodge, Inc. (Spring Creek), a Montana close corporation, was formed. It was created to run an independent boarding facility and school for minor children and engage in business transactions. Cameron was the registered agent of Spring Creek and held forty percent of the ownership interest, while the remaining shares were held by four other shareholders, all family members of Lichfield. As director, Cameron was responsible for Spring Creek\u2019s operations, including treatment and education, policy implementation, and staff supervision. Chaffin became the assistant director of Spring Creek, though he never became a corporate officer or director.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b610 Spring Creek utilized products and services from Teen Help, National Contract, and WWASP. Using the basic WWASP model, the Spring Creek staff drafted the 2004 policy and procedure manual, including numerous challenges the students could use to earn credits and privileges. As presented by the parties, the challenges included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApM\">(1) carrying a bucket of rocks every step a student took for days or weeks; (2) having groups of students stay up all night holding a log, with a loss of all points if it touched the ground;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">(3) dressing male students as girls; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">(4) jumping blindfolded off a bridge into a pond during winter months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b611 Spring Creek charged parents a monthly fee of $2,990 per child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>which later increased to $3,490 per month. An accounting of finances for Spring Creek in 2004 showed gross revenues of $17,385,403, a payment of management fees of $5,789,339, an occupancy expense of $495,134, and quality control services of $377,900. In addition, Cameron and Chaffin received a monthly salary, bonuses for every student that enrolled, and dividends, sometimes totaling close to $400,000 per year. Cameron and Chaffin both expressed concern in their pretrial depositions about the amount of money leaving Spring Creek to pay the other companies, which they believed made it difficult to properly run the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b612 Just a few years after Spring Creek was formed, Newman\u2019s daughter Karlye was having behavioral problems as a high school freshman. In the fall of 2003, Newman sent Karlye to the Brush School, a boarding school in New Mexico. Karlye attended there until she was expelled in March 2004 for taking so much Benadryl she had to be hospitalized. Consulting Teen Help, Newman enrolled Karlye in Spring Creek on March 31,2004, after seeing a brochure about Spring Creek. Though Newman only wished for Karlye to stay at Spring Creek through June 2004, the minimum contract length Spring Creek would accept was twelve months. Newman signed Spring Creek\u2019s required twelve-month enrollment contract, paid the requisite fees to Spring Creek, and Karlye entered the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b613 The WWASP Manual, intended as a guideline for member programs with student populations, suggested that no students with suicidal behavior be admitted. However, the brochures advertising Spring Creek, which Newman reviewed, indicated the facility was suitable for suicidal youths. The evidence established that no formal assessments were done when students entered the program to determine if the students were suicidal upon admission, nor was the Spring Creek staff provided with specific suicide assessment training. As a result, the Spring Creek staff was largely unaware of Karlye\u2019s history of depression and suicidal behavior prior to her admission. One of the only alerts was a check mark for \u2018Suicide Thoughts/Talk\u201d placed on Teen Help\u2019s Admission Criteria form.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b614 Throughout her time at Spring Creek, Karlye struggled with learning. She was emotional, injured herself, made suicidal threats, was placed on \u2018high risk\u201d status, and was put in solitary confinement on multiple occasions. Spring Creek documented numerous instances where Karlye was depressed, suicidal, wanted a therapist, or attempted suicide. Newman was never informed of these events, nor was she allowed to visit Karlye, and Karlye was not allowed to contact Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u00b615 On October 7, 2004, Karlye was found unconscious with a sweatshirt tied around her neck, having hanged herself from a doorknob in the bathroom of the dormitory where she lived. She died after being airlifted to a hospital in Missoula. She was sixteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b616 On October 23, 2006, Newman brought suit for the alleged negligent care and treatment that caused Karlye\u2019s death. She sued Spring Creek Lodge Academy; Spring Creek Lodge, LLC; Spring Creek Lodge, Inc.; Cameron Pul\u00edan; Chaffin Pul\u00edan; and John Does 1 through 20, as the parties responsible for or involved in the planning, supervision, management, operation, or profiting from Spring Creek. Newman alleged the defendants were liable for their independent tortious conduct, were vicariously liable for the acts of their fellow agents, employees, or others under their control under the theory of respondeat superior, and were jointly liable with the other defendants. In the complaint and the amended complaint, Newman stated claims for wrongful death, negligence, breach of contract, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b617 In June 2008, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the issue of the individual liability of Cameron and Chaffin. Newman then filed a second amended complaint on July 9, 2008,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which added defendants Lichfield; Teen Help; Premier Educational Systems, LLC f/k/a WWASP; Peacox; and National Contract. With the exception of the breach of contract claim, all the counts previously stated were alleged against these additional defendants, as were violations of the Consumer Protection Act and civil conspiracy. Newman also alleged premises liability against Peacox.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b618 In early 2010, Newman settled her claims against Spring Creek, Teen Help, and National Contract. Lichfield, WWASP, and Peacox remained as defendants. The court then granted Peacox\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and in September 2010, denied Newman\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b619 Three experts retained by Newman testified at trial as to numerous violations of the standard of care of the Spring Creek program, and that the WWASP model of care is contraindicated for a youth like Karlye. Newman also sought to call journalist Maia Szalavitz (Szalavitz) at trial as an expert witness relative to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>research on \u201cbough love\u201d schools, but the District Court excluded her testimony. Moreover, the District Court restricted the scope of evidence allowed before the jury to matters directly linked to Karlye as an individual and what she knew, and did not allow evidence pertaining to foreseeability and the knowledge of the defendants concerning the propriety of their programs for students like Karlye. \u00b620 On October 27, 2010, after a twelve-day jury trial involving twenty-five witnesses, the jury delivered a defense verdict. The jury found that Lichfield and/or WWASP were not negligent, did not commit deceit and/or negligent misrepresentation, and were not liable for any wrongful acts of WWASP, Spring Creek Lodge, Teen Help, or National Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b621 Newman appeals. She contends that a number of the rulings made by the District Court before and during trial were in error and restricted her ability to show foreseeability and prove vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b622 \u201cA district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible.\u201d <em>Weber v.

P. 56 criteria as the district court, we determine whether the moving party has established both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b625 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in limiting the scope of evidence concerning foreseeability ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b626 Newman argues on appeal that a number of the pretrial rulings made by the District Court were fundamentally flawed in that they unduly limited the scope of the evidence allowed before the jury. Newman contends that the court failed to apply this Court\u2019s \u2018^one of risk\u201d foreseeability analysis, and instead adopted a narrow \u2018foreseeable plaintiff\u2019 paradigm. Under the \u2018foreseeable plaintiff\u2019 paradigm, Newman argues that the court mistakenly limited evidence of negligence to matters directly linked to Karlye as an individual, thus restricting the jury\u2019s understanding of what the defendants actually knew pertaining to other suicide attempts and conditions at Spring Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b627 Conversely, the defendants argue that foreseeability, as part of the duty element of a negligence action, was not at issue at trial because of Newman\u2019s settlement with Spring Creek.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants further contend that any evidence of bad acts before or after Karlye attended Spring Creek were attributable to Spring Creek and not Lichfield or WWASP, and was therefore properly excluded. Accordingly, the defendants maintain the court properly ruled that events that occurred before Karlye attended Spring Creek and after her death, as well as anything beyond what she personally \u201csaw, heard, experienced, [or] felt\u201d could not possibly have contributed to her death. They argue that evidence of other bad acts by Spring Creek and those of other schools having nothing to do with Karlye or the care provided to her while at Spring Creek, were not relevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>disputed issues or sufficiently probative to outweigh their prejudicial effect. Furthermore, the defendants claim that any error made by the District Court in limiting the evidence was harmless, since the jury concluded that Lichfield and WWASP were not vicariously liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b628 Pertinent to the issue at hand, the District Court ruled that the evidence at trial would be limited to that which was known by Karlye, witnessed by her or within her general knowledge, and had to do directly with her death. The court determined that this case was not about other schools, students, or places, but specifically about Karlye as an individual and her time at Spring Creek. Ultimately, the court admitted evidence as to what Karlye knew, and did not allow evidence pertaining to what the defendants knew, as the latter was \u201cso highly prejudicial\u201d and had \u201csuch small probative value to prove notice.\u201d Newman\u2019s counsel protested on numerous occasions, arguing that the evidentiary limitation was unfair and precluded Newman from proving the foreseeability of Karlye\u2019s suicide. She insisted that evidence of \u201cwhat occurred to other people and their notice of what occurred to other people\u201d was relevant and probative of the foreseeability of Karlye\u2019s suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b629  We conclude that the District Court abused its discretion when it limited the evidence concerning negligence to what Karlye knew and what happened to Karlye. \u2018Under Montana law, the duty element of negligence turns primarily on foreseeability.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 20. As stated in <em>Fisher, </em>\u201c[i]n analyzing whether a duty exists, we consider whether the imposition of that duty comports with public policy, and whether the defendant could have foreseen that his conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b630  As <em>Fisher </em>instructs, the question in analyzing the existence of a duty turns on whether <em>the defendant </em>could have foreseen that his conduct could have resulted in an injury to the plaintiff. Here, the District Court determined it appropriate to admit evidence of what Karlye knew, but exclude evidence of what the defendants knew. This analysis is contrary to our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b631 A negligence claim requires the plaintiff to establish that the defendant owed a legal duty, and there existed a breach of that duty, causation, and damages. <em>Poole, </em>\u00b6 19. \u2018Foreseeability as it relates to the duty element of negligence is measured on a scale of reasonableness dependent upon the foreseeability of the risk involved with the conduct alleged to be negligent.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Servs., </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6 27, 295 Mont. 416, 986 P.2d 1081. We have said: \u201c[i]f a reasonably prudent defendant can foresee neither any danger of direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>injury nor any risk from an intervening cause he is simply not negligent.\u201d <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 362, 916 P.2d 122, 134 (1996) (quoting <em>Mang v. Eliasson, </em>153 Mont. 431, 437, 458 P.2d 777, 781 (1969)). Conversely, it stands to reason that if a reasonably prudent defendant can or should foresee a danger of direct injury, he may be negligent. Again, the focus is on what the defendant could or could not foresee.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b632 The jury in a negligence action is tasked with deciding whether the risk in question-here, Karlye\u2019s despair and resulting suicide-was foreseeable to the defendants. In order to make an informed determination, the jury in this case had to assess what the defendants knew regarding the school\u2019s program and whether it was designed or intended to treat suicidal teens, what the defendants knew about the successes and failures of the program in dealing with suicidal teens, and what the defendants knew about Karlye specifically. Without this information, the jury could not determine whether it was foreseeable to these defendants that Karlye was at risk of injury while a student at Spring Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b633 Moreover, we disagree with the defendants\u2019 contention that because the issue of <em>Spring Creek\u2019s </em>negligence was settled prior to trial, so too was the issue of negligence as it pertained to them, and their related argument that all of the evidence Newman sought to introduce at trial went solely to the issue of what was foreseeable to Spring Creek. It was WWASP that designed and supplied the Policy and Procedure Manual to its member schools, listing the responsibilities of its member schools, including Spring Creek, and it was Lichfield who formed the network of entities responsible for the operation of the school. While a jury could certainly conclude that neither Lichfield nor WWASP could have foreseen the risk of Karlye\u2019s suicide and thus were not negligent, that determination is for the jury to make only after it hears all the relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b634  The District Court stated that the evidence that pertained to foreseeability was \u2018highly prejudicial,\u201d had \u201csmall probative value,\u201d and therefore should be excluded. We conclude to the contrary. The District Court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence was highly prejudicial to Newman, as it largely prevented her from being able to argue foreseeability, duty, and negligence on the part of Lichfield and WWASP. Because this issue was at the heart of the jury trial, we conclude it was an abuse of discretion to exclude this foreseeability evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b635 We remand to the District Court for a new trial in which evidence that shows what Lichfield and/or WWASP knew regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>program\u2019s treatment of mentally unstable minors and the dangers the programs might pose to minors similarly situated to Karlye is allowed. In addition, the District Court shall allow evidence of other problems that previously existed at Spring Creek, so long as they were predictable of the problems Spring Creek faced when dealing with suicidal or disturbed minors like Karlye. Evidence of previous similar problems occurring at other member schools may also be allowed, as long as it is established that Lichfield and/or WWASP was aware of those problems, and the program at the member school in question was the same as the program in effect at Spring Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b636 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in denying partial summary judgment as to joint tortious conduct by the defendants ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b637 Newman sought partial summary judgment prior to trial, arguing that Lichfield and WWASP acted in concert with others in causing the wrongful death of Karlye, and that they should be held liable in common for their joint tortious conduct under <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7876 (1979). Conversely, Lichfield and WWASP claimed that there was an absence of admissible evidence in the record as to common liability for joint tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b638 On September 1, 2010, the District Court denied Newman\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on this issue of common liability. The court found that the documentary, affidavit, and deposition evidence in the record was sufficient to raise a material issue of fact on the issue of joint tortious conduct. Specifically, the court noted that the facts did not establish whether the already dismissed defendants tortiously caused Karlye\u2019s death, whether Lichfield and WWASP acted in concert with or pursuant to a common design with the already dismissed defendants, or whether Lichfield and WWASP gave the already dismissed defendants substantial assistance or encouragement in tortiously harming Karlye.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b639 Summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issues of material fact are shown from the pleadings, discovery and disclosure materials on file, and affidavits, and when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). \u201cA material fact is a fact that involves the elements of the cause of action or defenses at issue to an extent that necessitates resolution of the issue by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Corp. Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr. Mont. </em>Inc., 2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111 (quoting <em>Arnold v. Yellowstone Mt. Club, LLC, </em>2004 MT 284, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 295, 100 P.3d 137.

In <em>Sloan, </em>we adopted the theory of \u00a7 876 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1979), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">For harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">(a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">(b) knows that the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">(c) gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u00b641 On appeal, Newman argues that no genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the joint liability of the defendants for each other\u2019s torts, in that the \u201c[m]assive evidence shows that WWASP and Lichfield gave assistance and encouragement to Teen Help, Spring Creek Lodge, the Pullans, and others who breached duties to Karlye Newman.\u201d She asserts that such \u201csubstantial assistance or encouragement\u201d meets the requirements articulated in <em>Sloan, </em>and demonstrated in <em>Zimmerman v. Cambridge Credit Counseling Corp., </em>529 F. Supp. 2d 254, 280 (D. Mass. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">\u00b642 More specifically, Newman argues that Lichfield exercised control over Spring Creek. She states that Lichfield periodically visited Spring Creek to see that his policies were followed, that he presented Cameron with contracts that diverted fees to corporations within Lichfield\u2019s control, and that he required Cameron to sign those contracts. Newman also argues that Lichfield controlled the operations of Teen Help, which she alleges improperly marketed Spring Creek, improperly incentivized admissions, and used telemarketing tactics to address concerns raised by parents. Newman also alleges that Lichfield controlled the operations of WWASP and the policies of Spring Creek, through which he \u201ccoerced\u201d the schools to decrease the number of students discharged early and to \u201cattack the honesty of students who brought allegations against them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u00b643 In response, the defendants argue that it is necessary to establish the <em>intent </em>of a defendant to be jointly involved in acts which result in the tort, as ostensibly required by <em>Sloan </em>and the cases cited therein. The defendants also cite <em>Sloan </em>for the proposition that affirmative and voluntary actions, substantial assistance, and encouragement must be present in order to establish the requisite intent of the joint tortfeasors. <em>Sloan, </em>239 Mont. at 385-86, 784 P.2d at 896-97. In the instant case, the defendants argue that intent to be jointly involved in a tort was not shown, nor were the <em>Sloan </em>elements of knowledge and substantial assistance or encouragement, and therefore Newman did not establish the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7876 (1979); <em>Sloan, </em>239 Mont. at 385, 784 P.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b644 As noted in <em>Sloan, </em>one of the subsections under the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7876 (1979) must be met in order for a person to be subject to liability for the harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another. Sloan, 239 Mont. at 385, 784 P.2d at 896. Such a determination must be based on the facts of each case. In the instant case, the facts necessary to determine this potential liability are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b645  As provided in subsection (b) of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 876 (1979), a person is subject to liability for the harm to a third person from the tortious conduct of another if: 1) the other\u2019s conduct is a breach of duty, 2) he <em>knows </em>that the other\u2019s conduct is a breach of duty, and 3) he provides substantial assistance or encouragement to the other for such conduct. (Emphasis added.) The requirement of the knowledge element is further articulated in <em>Sloan. Sloan, </em>239 Mont. at 386, 784 P.2d at 896-97. Newman did not definitively show prior to trial that Lichfield or WWASP <em>knew </em>that the negligence of another was a breach of duty to Karlye, and that they nonetheless provided substantial assistance or encouragement to that person or entity. Both Lichfield and WWASP deny any knowledge of Karlye\u2019s admission to Spring Creek, and of her care and treatment while there. Because the material facts central to a finding of joint liability are in dispute, the District Court did not err in denying Newman\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b646 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court err in excluding certain evidence of the history of the defendants\u2019 programs and schools </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b647 Newman argues on appeal that the District Court should have allowed Maia Szalavitz, an investigative journalist, to testify during trial and that it was error to exclude her testimony. Szalavitz is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>journalist, researcher, and author of <em>Help at any Cost,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a compilation of the history of programs for troubled teens. She amassed information on WWASP schools from her research and interviews, and was prepared to testify about \u201ctough love\u201dboarding schools and the history, ideology, and methods used at the WWASP schools. The defendants moved the District Court to exclude her testimony under several of the Montana Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b648 The District Court barred Szalavitz from testifying, concluding that she was \u201ctrying to indict the entire program.\u201d The court determined that the results of her research would primarily be \u2018hearsay offered for the purpose of proving [it] is a failed program,\u201d and that cross-examination would only reveal how she got the information and not whether the information was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b649 According to Newman, Szalavitz had specialized knowledge as a historian of \u201ctough love\u201d schools, and under M. R. Evid. 702 and Montana case law, was a qualified expert who should have been able to testify. Newman also contends that Szalavitz\u2019s testimony would have assisted the jury\u2019s understanding of key issues, such as the defendants\u2019 notice of abuse and dangerous conditions in the schools, the defendants\u2019 breach of duty to Karlye, and the defendants\u2019 assistance and encouragement of the breaches of duty to Karlye by other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b650 The defendants argue that Szalavitz\u2019s testimony was properly prohibited under one or more of the Montana Rules of Evidence. First, they argue that Szalavitz, an investigative journalist, was not qualified as an expert in the operation of specialty schools or treatment of students at specialty schools, and her opinions consequently could not be admitted as expert opinions under M. R. Evid. 702. Second, they argue that she was a journalist whose research consisted of interviews with miscellaneous third persons, and that her testimony therefore would be hearsay in the classic sense. M. R. Evid. 802. Third, they contend that Szalavitz\u2019s proposed testimony was not relevant under M. R. Evid. 402, as it was not connected to the cause of Karlye\u2019s death or the relationship between Spring Creek and Lichfield, or Spring Creek and WWASP. They also opine that her opinions were that \u201call specialty schools and persons connected therewith [were] misguided, incompetent and harmful,\u201d and that even if some of her proposed testimony was relevant, its probative value did not substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury. M. R. Evid. 403. Lastly, the defendants argue that Szalavitz did not have personal knowledge of the operations at Spring Creek, the events related to Karlye\u2019s treatment, or the relationships among the parties, and therefore her testimony was properly barred for lack of personal knowledge pursuant to M. R. Evid. 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b651 According to the Montana Rules of Evidence, relevant evidence is any \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. Any evidence that is relevant is admissible, unless prohibited by constitution, statute, Rules of Evidence, or other rules applicable in the state. M. R. Evid. 402. However, relevant \u201cevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b652 In reviewing the record, we find that the District Court provided Newman with opportunities to show how Szalavitz\u2019s testimony was relevant, and even provided examples of the types of evidence that might be admissible. The District Court offered to conduct a Rule 402 hearing outside of the presence of the jury with Szalavitz present in order to determine the relevancy of her proposed testimony. However, Newman declined to present Szalavitz for a hearing and instead filed an offer of proof, which the court rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b653 As noted above, a district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Weber, \u00b6 18. We conclude the District Court did not abuse that discretion when it excluded the testimony of Szalavitz under the foregoing circumstances. The court appropriately expressed concern over the hearsay nature of her testimony and its relevancy. On retrial, the court may revisit this issue, and if it is satisfied that under our ruling with respect to Issue One, some of Szalavitz\u2019s proposed testimony would be relevant and otherwise admissible, it may allow her to testify within limitations it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b654 Based on the foregoing, we affirm in part and reverse in part. We remand to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-14\"> Also known as World Wide Association of Specialty Programs, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"> Also known as Spring Creek Academy or Spring Creek Lodge Academy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> Newman filed a third amended complaint on December 30, 2008.
