Stuivenga and Britni R. Evans were injured in a single-vehicle accident. Stuivenga and Evans were the only occupants of the vehicle-a 2006 Dodge Ram pickup owned by Stuivenga. Stuivenga claimed that Evans was driving at the time of the accident and was liable to Stuivenga for his injuries. Conversely, Evans claimed that Stuivenga was driving and was liable to Evans for her injuries. They both sought proceeds available under a Montana automobile insurance policy issued to Stuivenga by Progressive Direct Insurance Company. The policy\u2019s per person liability limit was $25,000. Progressive determined that Evans\u2019 and Stuivenga\u2019s competing claims could not be settled in an amount equal to or less than this limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">\u00b62 Progressive commenced an interpleader action in the Third Judicial District Court, Powell County, and deposited the $25,000 with the court pursuant to \u00a725-8-101, MCA. Progressive asked the court to determine to whom the funds should be issued-Stuivenga or Evans. Ultimately, a jury found that Evans was the driver at the time of the accident. The District Court denied Evans\u2019 motion for a new trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>entered an order releasing the $25,000 to Stuivenga. Evans now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b63 There are two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">1. Should this appeal be dismissed as moot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">2. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">denying Evans\u2019 motion for a new trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">We conclude that this appeal is not moot, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\u00b64 The accident occurred October 11, 2008, at around 4:00 a.m. on U.S. Highway 12 between Helena and Garrison. Stuivenga and Evans had attended a bull-riding event in Helena the previous evening and had spent time with friends after the event, and were on their way back to Deer Lodge. Near milepost 10 on Highway 12 (within Powell County), Stuivenga\u2019s pickup drifted across the roadway, struck the end of a guardrail on the left-hand side of the road, slid into the ditch, and overturned. The pickup came to rest on the passenger side, at almost a 90-degree angle, in a group of trees. There were no vehicle markings on the roadway indicating corrective or evasive maneuvers; it appeared the driver had simply fallen asleep. Neither Stuivenga nor Evans was wearing a seatbelt. They both survived the accident but were hospitalized for several days.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\u00b65 Evans later recalled that she had been driving Stuivenga\u2019s pickup when they departed the Helena area, but she had no memory of the accident. She claimed that she had pulled over to take a nap on the outskirts of Helena, and she had a vague memory of switching positions with Stuivenga (such that he became driver and she became passenger), but she could not recall precisely where and how that transpired. Her first recollection after the accident was of a doctor, nurse, or emergency medical technician (EMT) using scissors to cut off her clothes in order to treat her injuries. But even that memory was foggy, and Evans admitted that she did \u201cnot recall most of that time,\u201d including some of the time spent in the hospital. EMT records reflect that Evans was conscious and alert after the accident and may have admitted to being the driver. The preliminary report of the investigating officer identifies Evans as the driver, as do various hospital records. Stuivenga\u2019s parents visited Evans in the hospital and later reported that she had apologized to them for the accident and had told them she fell asleep while driving home. Later, however, Evans became convinced that Stuivenga had been driving. About a week after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the accident, she had conversations with the investigating officer and one of her treating physicians, both of whom expressed the view that Stuivenga was the driver. When subsequently questioned by Stuivenga\u2019s counsel about her admissions to Stuivenga\u2019s parents and about the various EMT and hospital records indicating she was the driver, Evans stated that she could not recall having admitted this to anyone. She opined that if she did tell people that she was the driver, it was because someone had \u201csuggested\u201d it to her and she simply repeated it to others \u201csubconsciously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b66 Stuivenga did not remember the accident itself. He did recall several surrounding events, however. He remembered that Evans was driving. He reported that he was lying on the pickup seat asleep, with his head toward Evans, when the accident occurred. He stated that when he woke up, the pickup was on its side and he was standing on the inside of the passenger door, leaning against the passenger seat. Evans was lying in the window space of the passenger door next to where Stuivenga was standing. Stuivenga heard Evans shivering and moaning, and he thus placed a blanket over her. He looked around the cab and found a mobile phone. He then crawled out the back window, climbed up to the roadway, and called 911. He tried to flag down three passing motorists, but none of them stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b67 As noted, Stuivenga and Evans made separate claims against Progressive for their injuries. After Progressive deposited the $25,000 per person liability limit in the District Court\u2019s registry, the court dismissed Progressive from this action with prejudice. Evans then filed a motion for summary judgment on the question of who was driving the pickup. The District Court denied the motion, observing that the parties had presented conflicting evidence which warranted submission of the question to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b68 Evans and Stuivenga testified at trial, providing their respective versions of the accident. Each argued to the jury that the other had a motive to deny being the driver. Of relevance to the second issue raised in this appeal, Evans sought to establish that Stuivenga had a special type of automobile insurance which he was required to carry because he had two prior convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). Evans\u2019 theory was that the premium for this insurance is \u201cvery heavy\u201d and, thus, if Stuivenga \u201cwere to have another DUI he might be in a situation where he wouldn\u2019t be able to get any insurance. So he had a lot of motivation to try and say that [Evans] was the driver, it wasn\u2019t him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b69 Stuivenga objected when Evans raised the two prior DUIs during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>her examination of him at trial. The District Court held a conference outside the jury\u2019s presence to discuss the matter. The court noted that the evidence of the prior DUIs could cut both ways: on one hand it could undermine Stuivenga\u2019s credibility by showing he had a motivation after the accident to say that Evans was the driver, but on the other hand it could bolster his credibility by showing he had a motivation before the accident to have Evans do the driving that night (since Stuivenga admittedly had drunk quite a bit during the course of the evening prior to the accident). In any event, the court initially expressed the view that any probative value of the prior DUIs was substantially outweighed by the potentially prejudicial effect. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 403. After further discussion, however, the court decided to overrule Stuivenga\u2019s objection</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">with the understanding that there is an agreement that there is to be no further mention during the course of the trial of the fact of Mr. Stuivenga\u2019s prior DUI\u2019s, except for whatever argument there might be during closing argument, which will be limited to the issue of whether Mr. Stuivenga had a motivation to, to say that [Evans] was the driver rather than himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The intent and effect of this ruling was to allow Evans to argue, consistently with her counsel\u2019s stated purpose for introducing the evidence, that Stuivenga had a motivation to lie, but at the same time to prevent unfair prejudice to Stuivenga.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b610 Separate from the <em>prior </em>DUI convictions, Stuivenga was charged with DUI arising out of the October 2008 accident. Upon motion of the Powell County Attorney, this charge was dismissed with prejudice prior to trial in the instant case. Stuivenga elicited testimony of this fact from Evans during his cross-examination of her, without objection by Evans. During his summation, however, when Stuivenga referred to the dismissed DUI charge, Evans objected that there had been no evidence on this point (an incorrect assertion, given that Evans herself had testified to it) and that any references to DUIs were prohibited by the District Court\u2019s earlier ruling (also an incorrect assertion, given that the ruling pertained to <em>prior </em>DUI convictions, not the dismissed 2008 charge). The District Court held a brief discussion at the bench and then stated: \u201cAlright, what I\u2019m going to do is to send you guys back and you\u2019ll go on with your closing. And not another word about it.\u201dThe court did not specifically sustain (or overrule) Evans\u2019 objection. Evans did not request a cautionary instruction to the jury, nor did she request permission to address Stuivenga\u2019s remarks in her rebuttal closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u00b611 The jury rejected Evans\u2019 claim that Stuivenga had been driving. The jury rendered its verdict on May 24, 2011, declaring that Evans was the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident. Evans filed a motion for a new trial under Rule 59 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. She claimed that Stuivenga had violated the District Court\u2019s order regarding DUIs when he referred in his summation to the fact that the October 2008 DUI charge had been dismissed. Evans argued that this \u2018improper argument\u201d had prejudiced the jury against her and prevented her from receiving a fair trial. Evans reasoned that \u2018Tt]he Jury was told by Stuivenga\u2019s Counsel that the issue as to who was driving had already been decided by the County Attorney of Powell County.\u201d Evans also claimed that Stuivenga\u2019s argument was improper because it introduced facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">\u00b612 The District Court entered an order on August 12, 2011, denying the motion for a new trial. The court observed that Evans was confusing the issues and facts pertaining to the <em>prior </em>DUI convictions versus the dismissed DUI charge arising out of <em>this accident. </em>Stuivenga\u2019s reference to the dismissed 2008 DUI charge did not violate the court\u2019s order regarding his prior DUI convictions. In addition, the court observed, the record reflects that during cross-examination of Evans there was testimony revealing the DUI charge and dismissal. \u2018The motion for new trial in this regard is, therefore, not well taken.\u201d Finally, the court stated that it was confident each of the parties had received a fair trial. \u2018The case was well tried and the parties were permitted to and they did present their theories of the case to the jury. Ample evidence was presented to the jury from which they could reasonably conclude, as they did, that Britni Evans was the driver of the vehicle at the time that the accident took place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b613 On or about August 16, 2011, Stuivenga\u2019s counsel provided the District Court with a proposed order directing the Clerk of the District Court to pay the interpleaded sum of $25,000 to Stuivenga. Stuivenga\u2019s counsel provided a copy of the proposed order to Evans\u2019 counsel. Evans did not file an objection. Nor did she request a stay pending the disposition of her Rule 59 motion or a stay pending an appeal. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 62; M. R. App. P. 22. The District Court signed the proposed order on August 23. Evans then filed her notice of appeal with this Court on September 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b614 Stuivenga moved to dismiss this appeal as moot because the $25,000 has already been released to him. In response, Evans argued that satisfaction of a money judgment does not render an appeal moot. This Court noted that \u201cthe mootness question presented here is one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>first impression and not settled by our previous decisions.\u201d We therefore determined to permit the appeal to proceed on its merits and directed the parties to provide further analysis of the mootness question in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1. Should this appeal be dismissed as moot?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">I. Mootness Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b616 The judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts is limited to justiciable controversies. <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Regl. Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567; <em>Gateway Opencut Mining Action Group v. Bd. of County Commrs., </em>2011 MT 198, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 398, 260 P.3d 133; <em>State v. Benn, </em>2012 MT 33, \u00b6 9, 364 Mont. 153, 274 P.3d 47. Ajusticiable controversy is one upon which a court\u2019s judgment will effectively operate, as distinguished from a dispute invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical, or academic conclusion. <em>Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6 8. The central concepts of justiciability have been elaborated into more specific doctrinesmamely, advisory opinions, feigned and collusive cases, standing, ripeness, mootness, political questions, and administrative questions-each of which is governed by its own set of substantive rules. <em>Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881. At issue here is the question of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b617 Mootness is the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness). <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 23. Thus, if the issue presented at the outset of the action has ceased to exist or is no longer \u201clive,\u201d or if the court is unable due to an intervening event or change in circumstances to grant effective relief or to restore the parties to their original position, then the issue before the court is moot. <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Gateway Opencut, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Benn, </em>\u00b6 9. Because the constitutional requirement of a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d contemplates real controversies and not abstract differences of opinion or moot questions, courts lack jurisdiction to decide moot issues insofar as an actual case or controversy no longer exists. <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 23. Hence, mootness is a threshold issue which we must resolve before we may address the substantive merits of a dispute. <em>Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>2010 MT 246, \u00b6 23, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\u00b618 Stuivenga argues that, due to an intervening event or change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>circumstances, this Court is unable to grant effective relief. Specifically, he contends that it is impossible to grant effective relief because he has already used the $25,000 to pay the medical bills he incurred as a result of the accident. Stuivenga asserts that it would be wrong to force the ambulance services and emergency medical providers to pay back the monies and await the results of further proceedings in this case. He faults Evans for not taking some action to hold and maintain the funds in the District Court\u2019s registry pending an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">\u00b619 In response, Evans argues that the medical providers would not have to return the monies which Stuivenga has paid to them. Rather, Evans contends that if she prevails on this appeal (i.e., if this Court reverses and remands for a new trial), and if she prevails at a second trial in the District Court, then Stuivenga, not the medical providers, will be liable for the $25,000. Evans maintains, therefore, that this Court can grant effective relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b620 As will be seen in the ensuing discussion, our jurisprudence concerning the mootness of appeals, where the underlying judgment has been satisfied, has followed a somewhat tortuous path. We therefore undertake herein to reconcile our cases and to articulate clear guidelines on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">II. Restitution as a Form of Relief</p>\n<p id=\"AoS\">\u00b621 At the outset, we note that there is substantial support for Evans\u2019 restitution theory. It is a \u201cwell established\u201d principle that one has a \u201cright to recover what one has lost by the enforcement of a judgment subsequently reversed.\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. United States, </em>279 U.S. 781, 786, 49 S. Ct. 492, <em>493 (1929); accord Anderson v. Border, 87 </em>Mont. 4, 11, 285 P. 174, 177 (1930); <em>Nepstad v. East Chicago Oil Assn., </em>96 Mont. 183, 190-91, 29 P.2d 643, 646 (1934); <em>Waggoner v. Glacier Colony of Hutterites, </em>131 Mont. 525, 528-29, 312 P.2d 117, 118-19 (1957); <em>Reil v. State Compen. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>254 Mont. 274, 278, 837 P.2d 1334, 1336-37 (1992); <em>Crail Creek Assocs., LLC v. Olson, </em>2008 MT 209, \u00b6 42, 344 Mont. 321, 187 P.3d 667. This is the longstanding rule of the <em>Restatement</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Under <em>Restatement (First) of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Restitution </em>\u00a774 (1937), \u201c[a] person who has conferred a benefit upon another in compliance with a judgment, or whose property has been taken thereunder, is entitled to restitution if the judgment is reversed or set aside, unless restitution would be inequitable or the parties contract that payment is to be final; if the judgment is modified, there is a right to restitution of the excess.\u201d Likewise, under <em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 (2011), Ta] transfer or taking of property, in compliance with or otherwise in consequence of a judgment that is subsequently reversed or avoided, gives the disadvantaged party a claim in restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Hansen v. Hansen, </em>134 Mont. 290, 295, 329 P.2d 791, 793-94 (1958), this Court favorably cited and applied <em>Restatement (First) of Restitution </em>\u00a774. The Court also quoted similar principles from Am. Jur. <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 1242:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">TA]11 proceedings taken under the judgment are dependent for their validity upon the judgment being sustained. When it is reversed or set aside, the law raises an obligation against the party to the record who has received the benefit thereof to make restitution to the other party of any and all money or property received under it, or of its value or equivalent, in money in case the recipient asserts title to the thing received or has converted it to his own use. In other words, a party against whom an erroneous judgment or decree has been carried into effect is entitled, in the event of a reversal, to be restored by his adversary to that which he had lost thereby, but no further liability should in any case be imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\"><em>Hansen, </em>134 Mont. at 294-95, 329 P.2d at 793 (emphasis omitted); <em>accord Aye v. Fix, </em>192 Mont. 141, 147, 626 P.2d 1259, 1263 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">\u00b623 Of relevance to the issue at hand, the <em>Restatement </em>applies these principles where funds received in satisfaction of a judgment are in turn paid by the judgment creditor to a bona fide payee. If the judgment is subsequently reversed, the judgment debtor has a restitution claim against the judgment creditor. The bona fide payee, on the other hand, holds the payment free of the judgment debtor\u2019s restitution claim. <em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>Enrichment </em>\u00a7 18 cmt. g. Thus, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-3\">A sues B and obtains a money judgment of $150,000, which B pays. A pays $50,000 of this amount to discharge an obligation to Bank, a bona fide payee (\u00a767). A\u2019s judgment against B is later set aside on the ground that it was based on a claim that A knew to be fraudulent. B is entitled to restitution from A of $150,000 with interest from the date of payment. B has no claim against Bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdM\"><em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 illus. 15. This principle also applies to situations where property of a judgment debtor is sold on execution and the underlying judgment is thereafter set aside. The judgment debtor has a restitution claim against the judgment creditor, but not against a bona fide purchaser of the property (unless the underlying judgment is void <em>ab initio). Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 cmt. f. Likewise, where the underlying action is a contest over title to real estate, and the party who prevails at trial then sells the property to a bona fide purchaser, after which the underlying judgment is set aside, the opposing party has a restitution claim against the prevailing party or, depending on the doctrine of lis pendens, may instead have a claim against the purchaser. <em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a7 18 cmt. g, illus. 12; <em>Fox v. Clarys, </em>227 Mont. 194, 196, 738 P.2d 104, 105 (1987) (explaining the doctrine of lis pendens).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b624 Restitution may be ordered in connection with the reversal, either by the appellate court or by the trial court on remand, or may be pursued in an independent action. <em>See Burgess v. Lasby, </em>94 Mont. 534, 550, 24 P.2d 147, 153 (1933); <em>Hansen, </em>134 Mont. at 295, 329 P.2d at 793-94; George E. Palmer, <em>The Law of Restitution </em>vol. II, \u00a79.9(b), 290 (Aspen 1978); <em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 cmt. b; <em>see also e.g. Aye, </em>192 Mont. at 147-48, 626 P.2d at 1263; <em>Reil, </em>254 Mont. at 278, 837 P.2d at 1336-37. But what is important, for purposes of this discussion, is the fact that restitution may be a form of relief available to an appellant upon obtaining a reversal of a judgment on appeal. This, in turn, bears on the question whether the appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">III. Mootness Jurisprudence</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b625 Turning now to our mootness jurisprudence, this Court\u2019s cases addressing the mootness of appeals (where the underlying judgment has been satisfied) have relied on differing, and sometimes inconsistent, rationales. Although we have overruled some of the cases in an effort to eliminate \u201cconfusion,\u201d the law in this area still remains unsettled. It is helpful, therefore, to provide a comprehensive picture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>of where things stand, in order that we may clarify the rules to be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">A. Academic Questions; Futility of Rendering a Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b626 The foundational precedent is <em>State ex rel. Begeman v. Napton, </em>10 Mont. 369, 25 P. 1045 (1891). Ajuror (Begeman) applied to the district court for a writ of mandamus requiring Napton, clerk of the district court, to issue Begeman a certificate of his mileage and attendance as a trial juror in that court. The district court ordered the writ to issue, and Napton appealed to this Court. Meanwhile, Napton obeyed the writ and issued the certificate. Given these circumstances, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">[a] judgment of any kind from this court would present a peculiar result. An affirmance would be to direct the District Court to issue a writ, which that court has already issued, and which has been obeyed. A reversal would be to say to the lower court, you may not order the clerk to do that which he has already fully performed. It is apparent that there is no controversy before us. The case is fictitious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>Begeman, </em>10 Mont. at 370, 25 P. at 1046. Napton acknowledged that a decision from the Court would not affect <em>this case. </em>He explained that he was pursuing the appeal only for the purpose of having this Court provide guidance for the future. We refused, however, to depart from the rule that \u201ccourts will hear only genuine controversies, and will not tender advice upon matters not in litigation.\u201d <em>Begeman, </em>10 Mont. at 370, 25 P. at 1046. We accordingly dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b627 To the same effect is <em>Snell v. Welch, </em>28 Mont. 482, 72 P. 988 (1903). There, the defendants (members of the textbook commission) filed an appeal from an order of the district court enjoining them from letting contracts under an act of the Legislature which provided for a uniform series of textbooks for use in public schools. The parties then settled their differences and the contracts were let. Citing <em>Begeman, </em>this Court dismissed the appeal, observing that \u201c[t]here is nothing in this case now for us to decide. It has been disposed of by the parties themselves pending the appeal.\u201d <em>Snell, </em>28 Mont. at 483, 72 P. at 988. \u00b628 Likewise, in <em>State ex rel. Hauswirth v. Beadle, </em>90 Mont. 24, 300 P. 197 (1931), Hauswirth applied for a writ of prohibition to restrain the Butte mayor and city council from enacting an ordinance that would permit Montana Power Company to supply natural gas to the city\u2019s inhabitants. The district court denied the application, and Hauswirth did not request a stay. Thereafter, the city council enacted and the mayor approved the ordinance. Accordingly, this Court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>issue had become moot, since nothing would be achieved by reversing the district court and directing it to issue the writ. \u201cUnder the circumstances the writ of prohibition cannot undo that which has been done.\u201d <em>Hauswirth, </em>90 Mont. at 27, 300 P. at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\u00b629 In <em>State ex rel. Brass v. Horn, </em>36 Mont. 418, 93 P. 351 (1908), Brass was charged in the police court of Helena with disturbing the peace. When the police judge (Horn) denied Brass\u2019 request for a transfer of the cause to the nearest justice of the peace, Brass applied to the district court for a writ of mandamus to compel the transfer. The district court granted the writ, and Horn appealed. Yet, on the same day that he filed his appeal, Horn also complied with the district court\u2019s mandate. As a result, this Court dismissed the appeal as moot. The Court observed that \u2018it would serve no useful purpose to reverse the judgment appealed from, because the cause was, immediately upon the issuance of judgment and service of the writ, transferred to the justice, and has doubtless long since been disposed of.\u201d <em>Brass, </em>36 Mont. at 420, 93 P. at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b630 A similar situation arose in <em>Johnson v. Rosenbeck, </em>141 Mont. 72, 375 P.2d 221, (1962). There, the district court (in a mandamus proceeding) found that the judgments of conviction entered against Johnson in the police court of Superior were null and void. Thus, the district court ordered the police judge (Rosenbeck) to return the fines Johnson had paid. The district court also stated, however, that it was not prohibiting the Town of Superior from filing proper charges against Johnson. On the parties\u2019 appeals to this Court (Rosenbeck from the district court\u2019s order; Johnson from the denial of his request for damages and attorney\u2019s fees), we noted that sworn complaints had since been filed and the prosecution against Johnson instituted anew in the police court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">Thus, the [district court] judgment anulling the previous proceedings in the police court was recognized and carried into effect. A reversal of the district court judgment would be futile. The ostensible effect of the reversal would be to reinstate the original judgments entered by the police judge, but that result is now impossible because the original judgments have been superseded and abrogated by new proceedings in the police court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATl\"><em>Johnson, </em>141 Mont. at 74-75, 375 P.2d at 223. We accordingly dismissed Rosenbeck\u2019s appeal. <em>Johnson, </em>141 Mont. at 75, 76, 375 P.2d at 223, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b631 The foregoing cases involved the grant or denial of injunctive-type relief where subsequent events mooted the original dispute and left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>this Court unable to issue anything more than an advisory opinion on the matter. A slightly different situation arose in <em>Fox v. Hacker, </em>68 Mont. 413, 220 P. 749 (1923). There, Fox brought an action against Hacker to enforce a contract for the sale of land. During the pendency of the action, Hacker conveyed the land in question to Fox, and Fox paid the purchase price therefor with the exception of a portion of the price that was in dispute. The district court determined that Hacker was entitled to the disputed amount, and Fox appealed. On appeal, however, Fox argued that the district court\u2019s judgment should be reversed because the instrument in question was not a valid contract in the first place. Noting difficulty in understanding Fox\u2019 s position, this Court concluded that 'ho practical result could follow\u201d from a decision on Fox\u2019s contention. <em>Fox, </em>68 Mont. at 418, 419, 220 P. at 750, 751.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoOL\">[WJhether the instrument referred to in the complaint was a valid contract, subject to enforcement as such in an action for its specific performance, has become a moot question, interesting perhaps from an academic point of view, but its decision could not result in any practical relief to the parties to this suit, since ... they have by stipulation consummated the deal contemplated in the instrument, irrespective of any defects which may have existed therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><em>Fox, </em>68 Mont. at 418, 220 P. at 750. We acknowledged that the parties had agreed in their stipulation \u201cthat the case shall proceed as though the land had not been conveyed and no part of the purchase money paid.\u201d But we held that the parties to litigation cannot by stipulation present a moot question to this Court as the basis of a judicial decision. <em>Fox, </em>68 Mont. at 419-20, 220 P. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">B. Satisfaction of Judgment vis-\u00e1-vis Effective Relief</p>\n<p id=\"A-TT\">\u00b632 The next case, <em>In re Black\u2019s Estate, </em>32 Mont. 51, 79 P. 554 (1905), has been cited in subsequent cases on the question of mootness, but a careful reading reveals that the decision is grounded on principles of waiver-a distinction that is important to make for reasons discussed below. The deceased\u2019s son and daughter appealed from the district court\u2019s decree of distribution. Yet, prior to the appeal, the son and daughter received the shares allotted to them by the decree and gave the estate administrator receipts in full therefor. As a result, the administrator moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the son and daughter had accepted the provisions of the decree and voluntarily satisfied the same. This Court granted the motion, observing that Tt]he right to accept the fruits of a judgment, and at the same time to prosecute an appeal from it, are not concurrent. On the contrary, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>are wholly inconsistent rights. The election of one necessarily excludes the enjoyment of the other.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Estate, </em>32 Mont. at 53, 79 P. at 555. The Court recognized that there are exceptions to this general rule, but determined that none of them applied here. The appeal had been taken generally, and the purpose sought was a reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment as a whole-something the son and daughter could not do, having already accepted the fruits of that judgment. <em>Black\u2019s Estate, </em>32 Mont. at 54-55, 79 P. at 555-56. The Court also noted that the receipts executed by the son and daughter reflected an intention to acknowledge receipt in full of all the distributive shares to which they were entitled in the estate and to release the administrator of liability. <em>Black\u2019s Estate, 32 </em>Mont. at 56, 79 P. at 556. Essentially, the son and daughter had agreed that the decree was to be final. Lastly, one other facet of <em>Black\u2019s Estate </em>must be mentioned. In the course of its analysis, the Court posited that \u201c[w]hen a judgment has been paid, it has passed beyond review; the satisfaction of it being the end of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Estate, </em>32 Mont. at 53, 79 P. at 555. This categorical rule was repeated in several subsequent cases. However, as will be seen, this Court ultimately repudiated the rule as an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">\u00b633 The next two cases are significant in that the Court reached opposite conclusions on the question of mootness despite the similar procedural postures of the cases4;he distinction being the involvement of third-party interests in the moot case. First, in <em>State ex rel. Kurth v. Grinde, </em>96 Mont. 608, 32 P.2d 15 (1934), the district court issued a writ of mandate commanding that Kurth be reinstated as Great Falls water registrar. The existing water registrar (Pierse) complied with the writ, but still maintained an appeal to this Court. We allowed the appeal. We noted that, as a general rule, once a party has complied with the commands of a writ of mandate, the question whether the writ should have been granted will not be reviewed. <em>Kurth, </em>96 Mont. at 611, 32 P.2d at 16. But here, we reasoned, the underlying question is \u201cwho has the title to the office in question,\u201d and if that person is Pierse, then this Court may compel Kurth to surrender to Pierse all of the books, papers, and insignia belonging or appertaining to that office. <em>Kurth, </em>96 Mont, at 612-13, 32 P.2d at 16. \u2018We may exercise the right of compelling restitution by our own mandate or direct the lower court to do so\u201d; hence, \u201cthe fact that the order or judgment of the district court has been complied with does not warrant us in dismissing the appeal.\u201d <em>Kurth, </em>96 Mont, at 613, 32 P.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b634 In the second case, <em>State ex rel. Hagerty v. Rafn, </em>130 Mont. 554, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>304 P.2d 918 (1956), the district court issued a writ of mandamus compelling the Montana Liquor Control Board to issue beer and liquor licenses to parties who had tribal permits to engage in the liquor business on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. An application was made to this Court for a stay pending the outcome of an appeal, but this Court was in summer recess at the time. The Board, therefore, issued the licenses \u201cunder protest,\u201d while still maintaining an appeal to this Court. In contrast to <em>Kurth, </em>however, we dismissed the appeal as moot. We acknowledged that the Board\u2019s compliance with the writ had been involuntary. We also rejected the notion that \u201cwhen a judgment has been paid it has passed beyond review, the satisfaction of it being the end of the proceeding.\u201d Besides the fact that this statement was \u201cdictum\u201d in <em>Black\u2019s Estate, </em>we pointed out that the statement \u2018is not always true in every case even of a judgment for money damages when payment is voluntarily made and generally speaking is clearly an incorrect statement of the law when payment or performance otherwise is involuntary.\u201d <em>Hagerty, </em>130 Mont. at 557, 304 P.2d at 919-20. Nevertheless, whether the Board obeyed the writ voluntarily or involuntarily, we concluded that our review of the issues would be \u201cto no purpose\u201d and that a reversal would be \u201cwithout effect\u201d4.e., the appeal was moot-because the persons named in the issued licenses had since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">acted upon the permission given them thereby to dispense liquors and beer at Browning. Presumably each has a tavern, has invested capital in his respective enterprise as he was lawfully entitled to do, and has acquired patrons and customers, and has what is commonly known as an established and going business, all of which is of some value. If the appellants were to prevail in this action and upon a reversal we were to order the board and court below to cancel out the licenses now outstanding, the status quo of the parties to this litigation could not be restored as it was when the judgment of the lower court was entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Hagerty, </em>130 Mont. at 557-58, 304 P.2d at 920. We distinguished <em>Kurth </em>on the ground that, unlike there, we could not here \u201ceffect restitution\u201d upon a reversal of the district court\u2019s writ. <em>Hagerty, </em>130 Mont. at 558, 304 P.2d at 920; <em>see also Gill v. Rafn, </em>133 Mont. 505, 509-10, 326 P.2d 974, 976 (1958) (discussing this facet of <em>Hagerty).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b635 This brings us to the most problematic case in this line of authority: <em>Gallatin Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v. Henke, </em>154 Mont. 170, 461 P.2d 448 (1969). The case has since been overruled, but certain aspects of the decision are pertinent to the instant discussion and, thus, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>be noted here. As an initial matter, <em>the Henke </em>Court consumed several pages addressing the merits of Henke\u2019s appeal, 154 Mont. at 172-76, 461 P.2d at 449-51, only then to observe that Twjhile we have heretofore discussed the merits of this case, we choose to discuss the motion to dismiss the appeal,\u201d 154 Mont. at 176, 461 P.2d at 451. This approach, of course, puts the proverbial cart before the horse because, as stated above, mootness is a <em>threshold </em>issue which must be resolved <em>before </em>we may address the substantive merits of a dispute. <em>See </em>\u00b6 17, <em>supra. </em>The <em>Henke </em>Court then proceeded to dismiss the appeal as moot, 154 Mont. at 177, 461 P.2d at 452, thereby rendering the entire preceding discussion of the merits of the appeal dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">\u00b636 In concluding the appeal was moot, the <em>Henke </em>Court cited the facts that Henke had not posted a supersedeas bond, that this Court had denied her application for a stay of execution, and that the judgments against Henke had thereafter been satisfied. 154 Mont. at 177, 461 P.2d at 452. The Court purported to resurrect the rule that Twjhen the judgment is paid it passes beyond review; its satisfaction ends the proceeding.\u201d <em>Henke, </em>154 Mont. at 177, 461 P.2d at 451-52 (citing <em>Black\u2019s Estate, </em>32 Mont. 51, 79 P. 554). Doing so was concededly in conflict with Hagerty\u2019s criticisms of <em>Black\u2019s Estate, </em>a point that ultimately had to be resolved in later cases. First, in <em>Mont. Natl. Bank of Roundup v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>167 Mont. 429, 539 P.2d 722 (1975), we rejected the Department of Revenue\u2019s reliance on <em>Henke </em>in support of the contention that the Bank\u2019s appeal was moot. We reaffirmed the \u201cwell recognized\u201d rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">payment of a money judgment by the judgment debtor does not, by itself, render the cause moot for purposes of appeal. <em>State ex rel. Hagerty v. Rafn, </em>130 Mont. 554, 304 P.2d 918, and cases cited therein. A defeated party\u2019s compliance with the judgment renders his appeal moot only where the compliance makes the granting of effective relief by the appellate court impossible. <em>State ex rel. Begeman v. Napton, </em>10 Mont. 369, 25 P. 1045; Anno. q39 A.L.R.2d 153, 179.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>Bank of Roundup, </em>167 Mont. at 432-33, 539 P.2d at 724. We did not expressly overrule <em>Henke </em>in <em>Bank of Roundup, </em>but later did so in an Opinion and Order Denying Motion to Dismiss in <em>First Natl. Bank in Eureka v. Giles, </em>No. 86-195, 1986 Mont. LEXIS 979 (July 24, 1986). There, after discussing <em>Henke, Bank of Roundup, </em>and <em>Hagerty, </em>we adopted the rule that if a judgment is satisfied by an involuntary payment or performance, the appeal from the judgment is not thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>rendered moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Bank in Eureka, </em>1986 Mont. LEXIS 979 at *5; <em>accord Le Clair v. Reiter, </em>233 Mont. 332, 335, 760 P.2d 740, 742 (1988). As will be seen, we later rejected the voluntary/involuntary distinction as an element of mootness analysis. But the critical point to be taken from these post <em>-Henke </em>decisions is that this Court returned to the fundamental principle that a defeated party\u2019s compliance with the judgment renders the appeal moot <em>only where the compliance makes the granting of effective relief by the appellate court impossible. Bank of Roundup, </em>167 Mont. at 432-33, 539 P.2d at 724 (citing <em>Begeman, </em>10 Mont. 369, 25 P. 1045).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b637 Lastly, one other aspect of <em>Henke </em>must be noted. In its brief discussion of <em>Black\u2019s Estate </em>and <em>Hagerty, </em>the Court opined that we \u201cappeared to have set up [in Hagerty] a new rule to the effect that where rights of third persons are involved and the parties cannot be restored to their original position the appeal becomes moot.\u201d <em>Henke, </em>154 Mont. at 177, 461 P.2d at 451-52. This dictum in Hera&amp;e-which has worked its way into subsequent cases4s not entirely accurate. First, the question is not merely whether the parties can be restored to their original positions, but whether it is possible for this Court to grant effective relief. In some situations, the only effective relief would be to restore the parties to their original positions, and if that is no longer possible, then the appeal is moot. <em>See e.g. Hauswirth, </em>90 Mont. at 26-27, 300 P. at 198 (since the Butte city council and mayor had already enacted the ordinance permitting Montana Power Company to supply natural gas, the appeal was moot); <em>Povsha v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 353, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 340 Mont. 346, 174 P.3d 515 (because the City had long ago granted the zoning change at issue, and Big Sky Auto Auction had already been built adjacent to Povsha\u2019s property, the appeal was moot). As explained above, however, relief may also take the form of restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment-father than a literal return of the parties to their starting positions4n which case it would be possible to grant effective relief. Second, as <em>Hagerty </em>reflects, third-party interests may bear on this issue. In <em>Hagerty, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>beer and liquor licenses had been issued to parties who then acted upon them to create going businesses, and it was not possible for this Court to \u201ceffect restitution\u201d upon a reversal of the district court\u2019s writ. 130 Mont. at 557-58, 304 P.2d at 920. Yet, while third parties (as bona fide payees and purchasers) may be free from restitution claims, the appellant who obtains a reversal of the lower court\u2019s judgment may have a claim in restitution against the appellee. <em>See </em>\u00b6 23, <em>supra. </em>In those situations, as noted, this Court may grant effective relief. Thus, it was wrong to suggest in <em>Henke </em>that the involvement of third-party interests and the inability to restore the parties to their original positions necessarily moots an appeal. Again, the question, more accurately stated, is whether it is possible to grant some form of effective relief to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">C. <em>Martin </em>Factors; Clarification of Mootness Versus Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b638 We now come to <em>Martin Dev. Co. v. Keeney Constr. Co., </em>216 Mont. 212, 703 P.2d 143 (1985), which presents the most analogous circumstances to the present case. There, the district court entered judgment in favor of Martin for $72,000: $40,000 in lost profits, $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $12,000 in interest. Peschel, the appellant, did not take any action to stay execution of the judgment, and the judgment was thereafter satisfied. For this reason, Martin argued (like Stuivenga does here) that the appeal was moot. This Court disagreed. While acknowledging some apparent \u201cconfusion\u201d in our caselaw, we concluded that the basic rule on mootness was stated best in <em>Bank of Roundup: </em>payment of a money judgment by the judgment debtor does not, by itself, render the cause moot for purposes of appeal; a defeated party\u2019s compliance with the judgment renders his appeal moot only where the compliance makes the granting of effective relief by the appellate court impossible. <em>Martin, </em>216 Mont. at 218-19, 703 P.2d at 147 (citing <em>Bank of Roundup, </em>167 Mont. at 432, 539 P.2d at 724). Martin had relied on <em>Henke </em>and <em>First Sec. Bank of Kalispell v. Income Props., Inc., </em>208 Mont. 121, 675 P.2d 982 (1984), but we found these cases distinguishable. In <em>Bank ofKalispell, </em>the defendants had surrendered real property pursuant to the lower court\u2019s order, and this Court accordingly dismissed their appeal as moot because we were not able to render the relief the defendants sought. In <em>Henke, </em>various changes of position had occurred in the course of satisfying the judgment which would have made it very difficult, if not impossible, for this Court to reverse. In contrast, Tn]o property changed hands pursuant to the judgment\u201d in <em>Martin </em>and there were no \u2018third party interests involved\u201d; rather, \u201ca simple money judgment was satisfied.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>216 Mont. at 220, 703 P.2d at 148. Thus, we held that there was \u2018ho reason\u201d why this Court could not grant effective relief. <em>Martin, </em>216 Mont. at 220, 703 P.2d at 148. Though not citing the <em>Restatement, </em>we implicitly recognized Peschel\u2019s entitlement to restitution of the amounts that had been improperly paid to Martin in satisfaction of the judgment (the $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and the $12,000 in interest). \u00b639 The last significant clarification in this line of cases occurred in <em>Turner v. Mt. Engg. &amp; Constr., </em>276 Mont. 55, 915 P.2d 799 (1996). There, we noted that \u201cconfusion\u201dhad arisen from this Court\u2019s attempt to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary compliance with a judgment within the context of analyzing mootness. <em>See Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 59, 915 P.2d at 802 (citing cases). We explained that voluntariness bears on the question whether the appellant has waived his or her right of appeal, but has no bearing on the question of mootness. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 59-60, 915 P.2d at 802. The fact that the appellant has voluntarily complied with the judgment does not necessarily mean the appeal is moot. Likewise, the fact that the appellant has involuntarily complied with the judgment does not necessarily mean the appeal is still \u2018live.\u201dRather, in deciding whether the appeal is moot, the issue is \u201cwhether this Court can fashion effective relief.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 61, 915 P.2d at 803. Separate and distinct from this issue is the question of waiver. V oluntary compliance with the judgment may result in a waiver of the right to appeal-in which case it would be unnecessary to address the question of mootness. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 61, 64, 915 P.2d at 803, 805; <em>see also H-D Irrigating, Inc. v. Kimble Props., Inc., </em>2000 MT 212, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 34, 8 P.3d 95 (\u2018The general rule is that a litigant who voluntarily and with knowledge of all the material facts accepts the benefits of an order, decree, or judgment of court, cannot afterward take or prosecute an appeal to reverse it.\u201d). This is what occurred in <em>Black\u2019s Estate. </em>Conversely, where compliance is involuntary, the party cannot be deemed to have waived or acquiesced in the judgment such that an appeal would be precluded. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 61, 64, 915 P.2d at 803, 805; <em>see also e.g. Kennedy v. Dawson, 1999 </em>MT 265, \u00b6\u00b6 30-33, 296 Mont. 430, 989 P.2d 390. The appeal may, however, be moot to the extent that this Court cannot grant any effective relief, as occurred in <em>Hagerty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b640 The <em>Turner </em>Court criticized some of our prior decisions for \u201cfail[ing] to analyze the question of what, if any, relief could be fashioned in the event of a reversal.\u201d 276 Mont. at 62, 915 P.2d at 803. The <em>Turner </em>Court itself, however, failed to provide a complete analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of this question. The underlying dispute in the case was between a mortgagee (Turner) and construction lien creditors who had performed work on the subject property. The district court determined that Turner\u2019s mortgages were valid and superior to the construction liens and entered a decree of foreclosure and order of sale. The lien creditors filed a notice of appeal but did not stay the foreclosure sale or post a supersedeas bond. A sheriffs sale was held to satisfy the outstanding mortgages, and Turner purchased the property. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 58, 915 P.2d at 801. On appeal, this Court identified two \u2018factors\u201d as dispositive of the mootness issue: whether property has changed hands, and whether third party interests are involved. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 63, 915 P.2d at 804 (citing <em>Martin, </em>216 Mont. at 219-20, 703 P.2d at 147-48). Here, the Court observed, \u2018the subject property has been sold at a sheriffs sale and third party interests, albeit Turner\u2019s, are involved.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 63, 915 P.2d at 804. The Court posited that because the lien creditors had not posted a supersedeas bond or stayed the foreclosure sale pending appeal, and because no surplus had been recovered at the sale, it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for this Court to grant effective relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 63, 915 P.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">\u00b641 Stuivenga engages in the same sort of analysis in the present case. He reasons that because Evans did not post a supersedeas bond or stay disbursement of the interpleaded funds, and because Stuivenga has since paid those funds to third parties, it is impossible for this Court to grant effective relief. The flaw in this analysis is that it fails to account for the possibility of a restitution claim. This Court in <em>Hagerty-to </em>which the \u2018third party interests\u201d factor may be traced-miade a specific point of noting that it could not \u201ceffect restitution\u201d upon a reversal of the district court\u2019s writ in that case. 130 Mont. at 558, 304 P.2d at 920. The <em>Hagerty </em>Court distinguished <em>Kurth, </em>where we held that \u201cif [the appellant] is entitled to a reversal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>judgment,\u201d then Tw]e may exercise the right of compelling restitution by our own mandate or direct the lower court to do so.\u201d <em>Kurth, </em>96 Mont. at 612-13, 32 P.2d at 16; see <em>also Hagerty, </em>130 Mont. at 558, 304 P.2d at 920. The <em>Turner </em>Court, in contrast, did not analyze whether, upon a reversal of the judgment, the lien creditors would have <em>\u201ca </em>claim in restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a7 18; see <em>also Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 cmt. f (discussing the rights of purchasers at execution sales); <em>cf. Marriage of Gorton, </em>\u00b6 18 (reasoning that although the real estate had already been sold to a third party, \u201cthe basic question in analyzing mootness is whether effective relief could be granted,\u201d and \u201c[i]f we were to conclude the [parties\u2019] agreement is unconscionable or invalid, we would remand to the District Court to fashion a remedy which could involve payment from the sale proceeds or other adjustments\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stuivenga, likewise, overlooks the fact that Evans may be entitled to restitution upon a reversal of the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">D. Synopsis of Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b642 We have considered the \u201cproperty changed hands\u201d and \u201cthird party interests\u201d factors in a handful of cases subsequent to <em>Turner. See e.g. Graveyard Creek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15; <em>Mills v. Alta Vista Ranch, LLC, </em>2008 MT 214, \u00b6 22, 344 Mont. 212, 187 P.3d 627; <em>In re Marriage of Dahm, </em>2006 MT 230, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 333 Mont. 453, 143 P.3d 432; <em>In re Marriage of Caras, </em>2012 MT 25, \u00b6 10 n. 1, 364 Mont. 32, 270 P.3d 48. Without calling into question the validity of these decisions, which were decided on their particular facts, it is necessary nonetheless, in light of the above discussion, to clarify this jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b643  First, to dispel any further confusion on the point, we reject the categorical rule recited in <em>Black\u2019s Estate, Henke, </em>and the cases listed at \u00b6 36 n. 2, <em>supra, </em>that when a judgment has been satisfied, it passes beyond review, the satisfaction of it being the end of the proceeding. A party might waive the right to appeal by voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>complying with the judgment or by accepting benefits under it. But compliance with the judgment, whether voluntary or involuntary, does not necessarily, in and of itself, render an appeal moot (or not moot). The question of mootness is whether this Court can grant effective relief, which will depend on the specific factual and procedural circumstances of the particular case and the relief sought by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\">\u00b644  Second, the fact that property has changed hands and third-party interests are involved does not necessarily, in and of itself, render an appeal moot. If the appellant is requesting that the parties be restored to their original pre-judgment positions, the fact that property has already changed hands and third-party interests are now involved may make this impossible, in which case the appeal will be deemed moot. But if the appellant, upon reversal, will have \u201ca claim in restitution as necessary to avoid unjust enrichment,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6 21, <em>supra, </em>then effective relief can be granted and the appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">IV. Stay of Execution; Supersedeas Bond</p>\n<p id=\"AX8\">\u00b645 Lastly, it is necessary to address the significance of Evans\u2019 failure to request a stay or post a supersedeas bond. The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure do not require an appellant to seek a stay of execution. <em>See Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34; M. R. App. P. 7 (prior to 2007) (a party \u201cmay\u201d apply for a stay); M. R. App. P. 22 (2007 to present) (\u201c[i]f the appellant desires a stay\u201d). The failure to post a supersedeas bond \u201cdoes not affect the right to an appeal,\u201d <em>Allers v. Willis, </em>197 Mont. 499, 508, 643 P.2d 592, 597 (1982), and compliance with the judgment \u201cdoes not necessarily render the appeal moot,\u201d <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 61, 915 P.2d at 803. Nevertheless, this Court has noted on several occasions that failure to post a supersedeas bond \u201cmakes the rights of the parties subject to execution, subsequent satisfaction of the judgment and <em>possible </em>mootness so far as appeals are concerned.\u201d <em>Henke, </em>154 Mont. at 177, 461 P.2d at 451 (emphasis added); <em>accord Niles v. Carbon County, </em>174 Mont. 20, 22, 568 P.2d 524, 525 (1977); <em>Erdman v. C &amp; C Sales, Inc., </em>176 Mont. 177, 183-84, 577 P.2d 55, 58 (1978); <em>Moore v. Hardy, </em>230 Mont. 158, 162, 748 P.2d 477, 480 (1988). Several of the cases discussed above reflect this fact. Consequently, while a party is not <em>required </em>to seek a stay of execution, \u201ca party choosing not to seek such a stay <em>runs the risk </em>of having his appeal become moot.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34 (emphasis added); <em>see also Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 60, 915 P.2d at 803 (\u201cA party may not claim an exception to the mootness doctrine where the case has become moot through that party\u2019s own failure to seek a stay of the judgment.\u2019!).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u00b646 With regard to the present case, the <em>Restatement </em>explains that while it is often possible to postpone compliance with an adverse judgment-by a bonding procedure or otherwise-pending a challenge by direct appeal or in collateral proceedings, \u201cthe failure to obtain or even to seek interim relief from the judgment is not a bar to subsequent restitution.\u201d Restaiemeni <em>(Third) ofRestitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 cmts. a, c; <em>see also Strong v. Laubach, </em>443 F.3d 1297, 1299 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cA judgment debtor who is unable or is unwilling to post a supersedeas bond retains the right to appeal even if the judgment is executed. Should the judgment be reversed on appeal, a district court may, on motion or sua sponte, order the judgment creditor to restore the benefits obtained.\u201d(citation omitted)). One of the underlying rationales for this rule is that any payment made in response to a judgment is treated as a payment made under compulsion. <em>Restatement (Third) ofRestitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a7 18 cmt. c. Conversely, a payment by way of compromise and settlement, where the purpose of the agreement is to effect a final resolution between the parties irrespective of the validity or correctness of any prior decrees, is not subject to recovery in restitution unless the agreement of compromise may itself be avoided, on contract principles, for reasons such as fraudulent concealment or invalidating mistake. <em>Restatement (Third) ofRestitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a7 18 cmt. c.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">V. Application to Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b647 Here, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of Stuivenga. The District Court denied Evans\u2019 motion for a new trial. Evans did not attempt to stay execution of the judgment, but she also did not enter into an agreement of compromise with Stuivenga. The District Court disbursed the interpleaded $25,000 to Stuivenga. He then used the funds to pay the medical bills he had incurred as a result of the accident. On appeal, Evans seeks a reversal of the District Court\u2019s judgment and a new trial. She indicates that she will seek restitution from Stuivenga if she prevails in the new trial. Under these circumstances, the fact that the monies have passed into the hands of third parties does not render this Court unable to grant effective relief to Evans. This Court may reverse and remand for a new trial, and should Evans prevail on retrial, she will then have a restitution claim against Stuivenga. <em>See Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment </em>\u00a718 cmt. g; <em>Ohio Natl. Life Assur. Corp. v. Langkau, </em>353 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Fed. Appx. 244, 248 (11th Cir. 2009)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u201cAn appellant\u2019s rights to property on deposit in the court registry are not abolished merely because the court has entered judgment and disbursed the property. We conclude from the record that this appeal is not rendered moot by the district court\u2019s disbursement of the [interpleaded insurance] proceeds because Clay can recover the proceeds if the court determines on remand that he is the proper recipient of the insurance proceeds.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>USAA v. Parker, </em>200 P.3d 350, 357 (Colo. 2009) (TP]ayment of a money judgment will not moot an appeal absent agreement to the contrary because the money can be restored to the defendant in the event of a judgment in its favor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">\u00b648 Stuivenga contends that the interpleaded funds have \u201cchanged hands thereby affecting third-party interests.\u201d He argues that the medical providers whom he has paid \u201ccannot be restored to the status quo\u201d without imposing an unfair hardship on them. For the reasons discussed, however, it is not necessary to \u201crestore the status quo\u201d in order to grant Evans effective relief. The availability of a restitution claim, should this Court reverse the District Court\u2019s judgment and should Evans prevail at a second trial, makes it possible for this Court to grant effective relief. Contrary to Stuivenga\u2019s concern, the medical providers need not \u201cpay back the monies and await the results\u201d of further proceedings. Stuivenga also criticizes Evans for not obtaining a stay. But, as stated, the failure to obtain a stay does not, in itself, render an appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b649  In sum, there are no magical \u2018factors\u201d in mootness analysis where the underlying judgment has been satisfied. The only question is whether this Court can grant effective relief, and that will depend on the unique facts, procedural posture, and relief requested in the particular case. If returning the parties to their original positions would be the only effective relief under the circumstances, but doing so is now impossible, then the appeal is moot. But if restitution or some other form of relief would be possible upon a reversal, then the appeal is not moot-even if property has changed hands and third-party interests are involved. Here, the issue presented at the outset of the action (Who was driving?) has not ceased to exist, and Stuivenga\u2019s payment of the funds to third parties does not render this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>unable to grant effective relief. This appeal, therefore, is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoy\">\u00b650 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Evans\u2019 motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b651 As for the merits of the appeal, Evans argues that she was denied a fair trial because Stuivenga engaged in Improper argument\u201d during summation. The basis of this claim is that Stuivenga violated the District Court\u2019s earlier ruling regarding evidence of DUIs when he referred to the dismissal of the DUI charge arising out of the October 2008 accident. (As noted, the Powell County Attorney dismissed this charge with prejudice prior to trial in the instant case.) Evans asserts that Stuivenga\u2019s reference to the dismissal was highly prejudicial because she could not rebut the implication that the issue of who was driving had already been resolved by the Powell County Attorney. Evans further contends that, in referring to the dismissal, Stuivenga introduced facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b652 As to the first point, Evans is incorrect about the scope of the District Court\u2019s ruling. That ruling, quoted above at \u00b6 9, pertained specifically to Stuivenga\u2019s <em>prior </em>DUI convictions. Evans cites an excerpt from the transcript where the trial judge observes that \u201cI\u2019ve got a commitment from attorneys for Ms. Evans that there will be no further evidence about the DUI in the case.\u201d But when this statement is read in context, it is unmistakably clear that the judge was referring to evidence of <em>prior </em>DUIs. In fact, the discussion in this portion of the transcript resulted from Stuivenga\u2019s objection to Evans\u2019 questioning regarding his prior DUI convictions. There was no discussion at this time regarding the <em>dismissed </em>DUI charge. As to the second point, the record reflects that there was testimony, by Evans herself on cross-examination, revealing the DUI charge and dismissal. This evidence was not objected to. Thus, Stuivenga did not introduce facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b653  When the basis of a motion for a new trial is an irregularity in the proceedings or surprise, we review the denial of the motion for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Styren Farms, Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 12, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230. A manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable. <em>Styren Farms, </em>\u00b6 12. Here, we conclude that the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Evans\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b654 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\"> This Court has, on numerous occasions, cited sections of the <em>Restatements </em>as persuasive authority, or has adopted certain sections outright. <em>See e.g. Brandenburger v.
