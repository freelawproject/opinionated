Hardman was found guilty by a jury in the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court of deliberate homicide and tampering with evidence. The court sentenced Hardman to 110 years in prison with no parole eligibility for thirty years. Hardman appeals his conviction and seeks a new trial. On appeal, we consider the following dispositive issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">\u00b62 <em>Whether the District Court made numerous erroneous evidentiary rulings amounting to cumulative error and requiring reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">\u00b63 At approximately 4:40 p.m. on October 15, 2009, near Molt, Montana, Hardman shot and killed his neighbor, Michael Blattie, on Blattie\u2019s front porch. The two had been at odds over a $35 loan that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Hardman had made to Blattie. Hardman lent Blattie the money to repair Blattie\u2019s tractor, so that Hardman could then use the tractor to cut weeds around their adjoining properties. Several weeks passed and Blattie did not repair the tractor. Hardman phoned Blattie regarding the money and the tractor, but did not receive a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b64 On the day of Blattie\u2019s death, Hardman left a threatening message on Blattie\u2019s cell phone. Later in the afternoon, Hardman had a heated telephone conversation with Blattie. Hardman then placed a handgun in the back side waist of his pants and went to Blattie\u2019s home. Hardman testified that as he stepped onto Blattie\u2019s porch, Blattie \u201ccame flying out of his house, slamming the screen door up against the wall and yelling.\u201d According to Hardman, a struggle ensued between the two men, with Blattie hitting Hardman in the face. Hardman pulled out the gun, allegedly hoping that Blattie would back away upon seeing the weapon. Blattie then reached for the gun and, in the resulting struggle, fanned the hammer. The gun went off, shooting Blattie in the abdomen. Hardman testified that he did not intend to shoot Blattie. There were no other witnesses to the incident. Blattie was found dead on his porch a short time later, having bled to death. After leaving the scene, Hardman buried the gun in a nearby field.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b65 At trial, the State alleged that Hardman intentionally killed Blattie because he was angry with him regarding the unpaid debt. Hardman maintained the shooting was accidental or, at worst, negligent. He claimed he armed himself only because he feared Blattie would attack him when confronted about the debt and he was too physically infirm to fight back.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b66 Hardman initially lied to investigators about his involvement, and attempted suicide by overdosing on medication. Hardman finally met with a local pastor, Robert Griggs, and confessed to his role in the shooting. He later contacted the authorities and was charged both with deliberate homicide and with evidence tampering for burying the murder weapon, which was never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b67 Hardman did not raise a justifiable use of force defense but claimed the shooting was accidental. He requested and received a jury instruction on negligent homicide. There were multiple objections and evidentiary rulings throughout the trial. The jury found Hardman guilty of one count of deliberate homicide and one count of tampering with the evidence. He timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u00b68 We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. \u201cA court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19. We will not overturn a district court\u2019s evidentiary determinations absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 31, 313 Mont. 376, 61 P.3d 153. However, to the extent an evidentiary ruling is based on interpretation of an evidentiary rule or statute, the review is de novo. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b69 On appeal, Hardman contends the District Court made a series of erroneous evidentiary rulings, the sum of which necessitates a new trial. He argues further that under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the District Court\u2019s one-sided evidentiary rulings prevented him from effectively rebutting the State\u2019s case and presenting a defense, violating his right to a fair trial. We conclude the majority of the court\u2019s contested rulings were not error and therefore their aggregate does not warrant reversal. Since our holding on the first issue controls, we need not reach the constitutional argument. In his opening brief, Hardman lists six points of error by the District Court. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">a. Blattie\u2019s phone call to Hardman moments before the shooting</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b610 At 4:34 on the afternoon of the shooting, Hardman called Blattie but he did not answer. Blattie called Hardman back moments later, and the two had a heated conversation. Hardman sought to introduce the statements Blattie made during the conversation. The court excluded the contents of the conversation on hearsay and relevancy grounds. The court later clarified its ruling, citing <em>City of Red Lodge v. Nelson, </em>1999 MT 246, 296 Mont. 190, 989 P.2d 300, for the proposition that \u2018if it\u2019s an accident, evidence of the victim\u2019s prior conduct is irrelevant.\u201d The court stated that Hardman was attempting to introduce the telephone conversation as justification for carrying a weapon with him when he went to Blattie\u2019s home. However, Hardman\u2019s accidental shooting defense made Hardman\u2019s reason for carrying a weapon irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\u00b611 Hardman contends the substance of the conversation and the statements made by Blattie prompted him to arm himself when approaching Blattie about the debt. He further argued in chambers he intended to testify that he brought the gun with him, not because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>planned to harm Blattie, but because he feared that Blattie would physically attack him when confronted about the debt. Hardman contends the conversation was admissible under the \u201ctransaction rule\u201d and that the evidence was not hearsay because it was not being asserted for its truth but rather to demonstrate the effect the words had on him. The State argues these exceptions to the hearsay rule are inapplicable and regardless, the statements are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b612 The record reflects that the District Court excluded the evidence on the ground it was irrelevant and did not qualify for admission under the transaction rule. Hardman argues that evidence as to why he armed himself is relevant to the mental state element of a deliberate homicide charge. He contends evidence that he was scared, and armed himself only as a deterrent, tends to make it less probable that Hardman\u2019s conscious object was to kill Blattie, or that he was aware of a high probability that his conduct of drawing the gun would cause Blattie\u2019s death. Absent evidence of the words exchanged during the phone conversation, he argues it seems more probable he armed himself with the intention of shooting Blattie.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b613 \u2018Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. \u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible ... Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d M. R. Evid. 402. A district court has broad discretion to determine whether or not evidence is relevant. <em>State v. Matz, </em>2006 MT 348, \u00b6 34, 335 Mont. 201, 150 P.3d 367. Hardman testified the hammer of the gun was fanned inadvertently during the struggle and he did not intend to shoot Blattie. The District Court concluded that Blattie\u2019s statements during the phone call were irrelevant to a defense of accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b614 In <em>City of Red Lodge, </em>we considered the appeal of a conviction for partner assault. The defendant attempted to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior convictions for assault to show her intent to assault him and to show he had to use reasonable force against her in his defense. <em>City of Red Lodge, </em>\u00b6 7. He initially argued self-defense, but at trial \u201cemphatically\u201d contended he accidentally struck the victim. <em>City of Red Lodge, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 18. The Court noted there was a tenuous basis for the defendant\u2019s claim he relied on the defense of self-defense at trial. <em>City of Red Lodge, </em>\u00b6 18. The Court affirmed the conviction, holding that even if the defendant asserted self-defense, he had not established he knew of the victim\u2019s prior convictions at the time he struck her and therefore evidence of the convictions was irrelevant. <em>City of Red Lodge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Justice Trieweiler, specially concurring, added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">[the defendant\u2019s] contention that he did not intend to strike her is inconsistent with a defense that he struck her in self-defense. Therefore, in spite of what he did or didn\u2019t know about her prior conduct at the time of the event which formed the basis for the charges against him, [the victim\u2019s] prior conduct was irrelevant. For this reason alone, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>City of Red Lodge, </em>\u00b6 22 (J. Trieweiler, concurring). The District Court relied on this language in concluding evidence of Blattie\u2019s statements immediately prior to the shooting was irrelevant. The District Court allowed Hardman to present evidence that provided context for Hardman\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting and served to rebut the State\u2019s allegations Hardman purposely or knowingly killed Blattie. During his testimony, Hardman was permitted to describe the conversation as heated and that the subject of the debt owed was discussed. Moreover, he testified that he went to Blattie\u2019s home immediately thereafter to confront him about the money, and that he took a firearm with him in preparation for the encounter. Pastor Griggs testified that during Hardman\u2019s confession to him, Hardman told him that Blattie came out yelling and \u201cslammed the screen door,\u201d and that the yelling was a continuation of the phone call. Hardman testified Blattie\u2019s eyes were \u201cvery dark\u201d and that he got so scared he lost control of his bladder. This evidence bolstered Hardman\u2019s contentions he brought the gun for security and the shooting was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b615  We hold that, in light of the nature of Hardman\u2019s defense, the District Court did not abuse its broad discretion in excluding the statements as irrelevant. <em>Matz, </em>\u00b6 34. Though Hardman was prohibited from testifying as to the exact words Blattie spoke during the conversation, he was able to introduce evidence about the nature of the exchange and why he brought the gun. Thus, Hardman was permitted to describe the conversation and how it related to the subsequent events in line with his defense. It was not error for the District Court to exclude the evidence as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b616 Hardman also argues the evidence was admissible under the \u201ctransaction rule,\u201d \u00a726-1-103, MCA. Evidence that may be admissible under that rule is still subject to fact-specific balancing under Rule 403. <em>State v. Detonancour, </em>2001 MT 213, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, 306 Mont. 389, 34 P.3d 487. The District Court expressed concern over the lack of trustworthiness of Hardman\u2019s proffered hearsay testimony, since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>prosecutor had no way of cross-examining him on Blattie\u2019s purported statements. It noted that the purpose of the evidence was to have the jury \u2018infer the defendant relied upon what was said to him in taking his next steps.\u201d The trial court carefully weighed the probative value of the evidence against its attenuated relevance. Its exclusion of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">b. Impeachment of good character evidence</p>\n<p id=\"A_X\">\u00b617 The State called Tab Moen to testify at trial. Moen was a friend of Blattie\u2019s and discovered Blattie\u2019s body. The State, referring to Blattie, asked, \u201cwhat kind of guy was he?\u201d Hardman did not object to the question. Moen responded, Tgjreat guy. I mean, you know, the little bit I knew him, he was a really good guy.\u201d In cross-examination, defense counsel asked, \u201cwould it change your opinion of Michael Blattie if you knew he was a meth user?\u201d The State objected before Moen could answer. The court heard the parties\u2019 arguments on the matter in chambers. Defense counsel further sought to cross-examine Moen on whether his opinion would change if he knew Blattie was on probation for stolen goods. Moreover, counsel intended to introduce information that Moen and Blattie used drugs together at Blattie\u2019s home. Counsel for the State objected on all fronts, citing M. R. Evid. 404 and 405(b). The court sustained the objection, ruling that some of the character evidence would be admissible if there was a proper foundation laid on a self-defense theory, but that \u201c404 simply says this kind of evidence with regard to the victim does not come in unless it meets the criteria set forth in 404.\u201dMoreover, the court noted allowing this line of questioning \u201cwould be more prejudicial than probative as to whether the defendant committed this homicide.\u201d Hardman argues this ruling was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b618 Generally, evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is inadmissible to prove action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion. M. R. Evid. 404. However, the rule provides an exception pertaining specifically to admissibility of evidence of the victim\u2019s character in certain cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">Character of victim. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character of the victim of the crime offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case or in an assault case where the victim is incapable of testifying to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">M. R. Evid. 404(2). When character evidence is admissible, M. R. Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>405 governs the method of proving character, either as reputation or opinion evidence, or specific instances of conduct. Character evidence must first be deemed admissible under Rule 404 before Rule 405 applies. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 23, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623 (\u201cwhen character evidence is admissible, Rule 405 provides the methods of proving character.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b619 Hardman contends that Rule 404 is explicitly limited to prohibiting introduction of character evidence \u2018Tor the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith.\u201d In this instance, he argues, the defense was not offering evidence of Blattie\u2019s character to prove conformity, but rather to impeach Moen\u2019s testimony that Blattie was a \u201creally good guy.\u201d Hardman contends that under M. R. Evid. 105, evidence which is inadmissible for one purpose may be admissible for another. He argues the evidence should have been admitted, with a cautionary instruction to the jury that the evidence was only for impeachment purposes, and not to be considered as actions in conformity with Blattie\u2019s character. Hardman further argues he should have been permitted to cross-examine Moen on his drug use with Blattie as a means to show bias and question his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b620  We have held a defendant must first lay a foundation that he acted in self-defense before evidence of the victim\u2019s character will be admitted. <em>State v. Logan, </em>156 Mont. 48, 64-65, 473 P.2d 833, 842 (1970); <em>State v. Cartwright, </em>200 Mont. 91, 104, 650 P.2d 758, 764-65 (1982). \u2018The determination of the adequacy of the foundation for the admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Weeks, </em>270 Mont. 63, 75, 891 P.2d 477, 484 (1995). We stated in <em>Cartwright </em>that, \u201cuntil such time as the defendant took the stand and admitted the killing, the issue of self-defense was not joined at the trial.\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>200 Mont. at 104, 650 P.2d at 764-65 (quoting <em>Logan, </em>156 Mont. at 65, 473 P.2d at 842). Moreover, we recently reiterated that evidence of the character of a victim is admissible where the \u201ccharacter of the victim relates to reasonableness of force used by the accused in self defense.\u201d <em>State v. Branham, </em>2012 MT 1, \u00b6 11, 363 Mont. 281, 269 P.3d 891. The interplay between a defense of self-defense and evidence of the victim\u2019s character is thus critical to the analysis. For a victim\u2019s character trait to be \u201cpertinent,\u201dit must relate to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense-a claim not raised here. Blattie\u2019s character was not \u201cpertinent\u201d when offered to challenge the credibility of the State\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b621 Hardman\u2019s invocation ofM. R. Evid. 105 is unavailing. A primary concern for a court in determining limited admissibility is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>issue for which the evidence is offered is actually in controversy. A district court must consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">whether the party seeking to offer evidence of limited admissibility for a proper purpose has manipulated the presentation of evidence in order to manufacture a controversy and permit the party to waft otherwise inadmissible evidence before the jury... [the purported use of evidence for impeachment purposes] can sometimes represent a veiled attempt to tempt the jury to use the evidence for its impermissible purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">David P. Leonard, <em>The New Wigmore: Selected Rules of Admissibility </em>60-64 (rev. ed., Aspen Publishers 2002). Moen\u2019s testimony provided very little information as to Blattie\u2019s character. Moen primarily was questioned about his visit to Blattie\u2019s home on the day of the shooting and his discovery of the body. Impeachment of Moen\u2019s lone statement that Blattie was a \u201cgood guy\u201d would have introduced evidence of Blattie\u2019s bad character, which was not a proper matter for the jury\u2019s consideration. Hardman cannot use his failure to object to the State\u2019s question as a backdoor to introduce otherwise inadmissible testimony not at issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b622 The District Court determined evidence of Blattie\u2019s character was inadmissible under Rule 404 absent a claim of self-defense. Thus, impeachment pertaining to Blattie\u2019s character was likewise inadmissible \u201cuntil such time as [Hardman] took the stand and admitted the killing.\u201d Moreover, a district court may exercise its discretion to exclude otherwise relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. M. R. Evid. 403. In <em>State v. Passmore, </em>2010 MT 34, \u00b6\u00b6 57-60, 355 Mont. 187, 225 P.3d 1229, we considered whether testimony regarding a sexual assault victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statement on an arguably collateral matter was admissible to challenge the victim\u2019s credibility. The defendant sought to introduce witness testimony to contradict the victim\u2019s testimony denying a statement she allegedly made regarding a sexual fantasy, but the evidence offered did little to establish that the victim had lied in her testimony about the defendant\u2019s unlawful sexual acts against her. <em>Passmore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52, 53, 63. Although the evidence arguably undermined the witness\u2019s credibility, we concluded that the admissibility of contradiction evidence ultimately is governed by M. R. Evid. 401 and 403. <em>Passmore, </em>\u00b6 61. We held that the evidence offered by the defendant had limited probative value and was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues. <em>Passmore, </em>\u00b6 63. The evidence offered by Hardman likewise carried little probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>value when balanced against its potential for prejudice and confusion of the issues. The District Court acted within its discretion in excluding the evidence as impermissible under M. R. Evid. 404 and because of a danger of unfair prejudice under M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">c. Hardman\u2019s other bases for fearing Blattie</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b623 Hardman sought to introduce evidence that he was fearful of Blattie because he knew from various sources that Blattie could potentially blow up or get very angry if confronted. The District Court again ruled that unless Hardman admitted killing Blattie and raised a justifiable use of force defense, evidence regarding his fear of Blattie was irrelevant. Hardman argues Blattie\u2019s history and Hardman\u2019s fear of him were relevant because they established his own mental state. In other words, absent evidence of Hardman\u2019s fear, evidence that Hardman deliberately took the gun to Blattie\u2019s home makes it seem more probable that Hardman intentionally shot Blattie. Again, Hardman contends the evidence was not admitted for the purpose of proving Blattie\u2019s character and should have been admitted to rebut the State\u2019s contentions that Hardman went over to Blattie\u2019s house specifically to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b624  As discussed above, Hardman was permitted to testify on redirect why he brought the gun with him. He testified he was afraid Blattie would get angry about the money, that a physical altercation might arise, and that he is \u2018hot a fighter.\u201d In light of Hardman\u2019s accident theory, the District Court did not misapply Rule 404 or abuse its discretion in excluding further evidence of Hardman\u2019s fear of Blattie.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">d. Asked and answered</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b625 Jennifer Couch, Hardman\u2019s stepdaughter-in-law, with whom he was residing at the time of the shooting, was called as a prosecution witness at trial. Couch testified about weapons in their home, Hardman\u2019s financial difficulties, and how he had come to live with her and her husband. During a line of questioning about drug use in the home, the prosecutor asked her whether Hardman possessed a medical marijuana card. The examination went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">Q. Did the defendant have a medical marijuana card?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">MR. SCOTT: I object to this as relevancy, to character evidence. I don\u2019t see-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">THE COURT: The question has been asked and answered. You\u2019re going to have to object a little more quickly. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">Hardman protests that defense counsel objected immediately after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>witness said Nes\u201d and the only way counsel could have objected more quickly would have been to beat the witness\u2019s monosyllabic answer. He argues the District Court abused its discretion under M. R. Evid. 611(a), which mandates a district court \u201cexercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.\u201d Though Hardman cites the \u201cwell-settled practice\u201d of striking improper testimony and giving a cautionary instruction to the jury, he did not request such a remedy in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b626  \u2018The court has a duty to conduct the trial in a speedy and fair manner and has a great amount of discretion in so doing.\u201d <em>State v. Insua, </em>2004 MT 14, \u00b6 36, 319 Mont. 254, 84 P.3d 11 (quoting <em>State v. </em>Dickens, 198 Mont. 482, 486, 647 P.2d 338, 341 (1982)). We note the District Court handled a similar objection by the State in the same fashion. When defense counsel cross-examined Pastor Griggs, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Q. And on your single-action pistol, you could pretty much fan the hammer on your weapon as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">A. I believe so. I\u2019ve never done it, but I believe it would work that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">MR. PETAK: Your Honor, it\u2019s calling for speculation. I ask-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1p\">THE COURT: It\u2019s been asked and answered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Our reading of the transcript indicates the court was fair and evenhanded in managing the trial. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in exercising reasonable control over the proceedings as required by M. R. Evid. 611(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">e. Medical opinion testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u00b627 Hardman makes two arguments as to the exclusion of medical opinion testimony from two doctors. First, following his suicide attempt, Hardman was treated by Dr. Samuel Paczkowski, an emergency room physician in Billings. After his initial admission, Hardman\u2019s care was assigned to a Dr. Blossom, who was not listed as a trial witness by either party. In his direct testimony, Dr. Paczkowski testified Hardman\u2019s main complaint upon admission to the ER was \u201caltered mentation.\u201d On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Paczkowski whether, after reviewing Dr. Blossom\u2019s subsequent report, he was able \u201cto form an opinion as to what Jeff s condition was on that day.\u201d Counsel for the State objected, arguing hearsay and lack of foundation. The court sustained the objection, stating that defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>counsel would need to establish that Dr. Paczkowski relied upon Dr. Blossom\u2019s report in treating Hardman for the evidence to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b628 On appeal, Hardman argues the defense sought to elicit the testifying doctor\u2019s opinion as to the seriousness of Hardman\u2019s suicide attempt, not the other doctor\u2019s report. Hardman contends M. R. Evid. 703 permitted Dr. Paczkowski to opine as an expert based on a reading of Dr. Blossom\u2019s report. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">[t]he data in a particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in a particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Hardman never established, however, that Dr. Paczkwoski was qualified to provide an expert opinion on a patient\u2019s suicidal condition as required by M. R. Evid. 702, nor did he inform the District Court he was seeking such an opinion. Generally, we will not review an issue that was not properly preserved for appeal because the objecting party never gave the trial court an opportunity to address and correct perceived errors. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2011 MT 286, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 473, 265 P.3d 638. M. R. Evid. 703 does not permit an expert to simply transmit the out-of-court opinion of another without adding any analysis. <em>Weber v. BNSF </em>Ry. Co., 2011 MT 223, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984. Dr. Paczkowski did testify Hardman had to be intubated to prevent him from dying, and the jury was given sufficient information to show the seriousness of Hardman\u2019s suicide attempt. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Paczkowski\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b629 Secondly, Hardman sought to corroborate his testimony that Blattie was in a rage by introducing evidence about Blattie\u2019s autopsy and the presence of methamphetamine in his blood. During cross-examination by defense counsel, the forensic pathologist who performed Blattie\u2019s autopsy, Dr. Thomas Bennett, testified that he had sent blood to the crime lab for testing to see if anything in the blood would help make a determination of what happened. Defense counsel asked about the results of the blood test and the State objected on hearsay grounds. The court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b630 Hardman contends that under M. R. Evid. 703 and 702, the defense could elicit an opinion from Dr. Bennett about the condition of Blattie\u2019s physiology moments before his death even if his medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>opinion relied in part upon laboratory data. Moreover, he argues that under M. R. Evid. 705, he was permitted to cross-examine Dr. Bennett regarding the underlying facts or data which formed the basis of his opinion. Since Dr. Bennett testified that blood data was <em>\u201ca </em>standard part of [his] autopsy,\u201d Hardman contends cross-examination on the data was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b631 Hearsay is evidence of an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. M. R. Evid. 801. Hardman sought to introduce evidence from the blood data that Blattie was under the influence of methamphetamine at the time he encountered Hardman on the porch. Out-of-court statements to that effect are hearsay and inadmissible unless an exception applies. M. R. Evid. 803(6) provides the \u2018business records exception\u201d to the hearsay rule, which permits admissibility of records of regularly conducted activity, including blood tests. However, the party offering the evidence must establish two primary foundational facts before the evidence is admissible: \u201c(1) the records must have been made or transmitted by a person with knowledge at or near the time of the incident recorded; and (2) the record must have been kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.\u201d <em>State v. Baze, </em>2011 MT 52, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 411, 251 P.3d 122 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Ray, </em>920 F.2d 562, 565 (9th Cir. 1990)). Such a showing must be made \u2018by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness.\u201d M. R. Evid. 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b632  Dr. Bennett was not the party who performed the blood test and Hardman does not argue he was a custodian or otherwise qualified witness who could provide the foundation for its admission into evidence. Hardman did not call any other witness from the crime lab to lay the foundation for the blood test. In any event, the jury heard testimony from Dr. Bennett that Blattie\u2019s condition at death was consistent with methamphetamine use, which can cause violent outbursts, lending corroboration to Hardman\u2019s theory of Blattie\u2019s enraged state at the time of their encounter. There was no error in the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">f. Photo of Hardman holding a gun in California</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b633 During Couch\u2019s testimony, she identified Hardman in a photograph where he was holding a gun at a California shooting range. The court admitted the photograph into evidence over defense counsel\u2019s relevancy objection. On appeal, Hardman contends the photograph was irrelevant because the State did not link the weapon in the photograph to the crime, nor did its admission say anything about what gun Hardman used on October 15, 2009, or whether he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>purposely or knowingly killed Blattie. The State concedes the photograph was irrelevant because it was remote and the prosecutor failed to tie the gun in the photograph to the gun used in the shooting. However, it argues the admission of the photograph was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b634 Error is harmless when the State demonstrates there is \u201cno reasonable possibility that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 814, \u00b6 47, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735. Hardman admitted taking a gun to Blattie\u2019s house, drawing the gun, and, whether accidentally or otherwise, shooting Blattie. Defense counsel and Hardman conducted a demonstration of the alleged accident, with an unloaded gun, during Hardman\u2019s testimony. Hardman also admitted burying the gun after the incident. Based on the weight of evidence presented at trial, and Hardman\u2019s own admissions, we cannot conclude there was a reasonable probability that this lone photograph contributed to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b635 The cumulative error doctrine mandates reversal of a conviction where numerous errors, when taken together, have prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2009 MT 61, \u00b6 100, 349 Mont. 347, 208 P.3d 363. Having found no abuse of discretion in all but one of the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, cumulative error does not require reversal of Hardman\u2019s conviction. Since we reject Hardman\u2019s argument that the trial was \u201cstarkly one-sided,\u201d we do not further consider his due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b636 The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
