He appealed the conviction to the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County. Ellison now appeals from an order from the District Court, denying his motion to supplement the record and denying his issues on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b62 Ellison claims that the District Court erred when it declined to consider on appeal evidence that he alleges was withheld by the prosecution in violation of his due process rights according to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963), and \u00a746-15-322, MCA. We state the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Ellison\u2019s motions, which were based upon the State\u2019s alleged withholding of exculpatory information, in violation of his right to due process?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b64 Ellison and his wife, Rhonda, were arguing near the front door of their home on September 19, 2009, when Ellison grabbed her by the arms, put his foot behind her leg, and pushed her into a post supporting the handrail. She called 911 shortly thereafter, and a Montana Highway Patrol trooper responded. Observing a fresh minor injury to Rhonda\u2019s arm, the trooper concluded there was probable cause to arrest Ellison. A second trooper arrived and took Rhonda\u2019s statement, along with photographs of her injury and the handrail post.</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">\u00b65 Ellison denied having any physical contact with Rhonda during the argument, and testified that he had been working on a horse pen when a tool jumped and possibly struck Rhonda\u2019s arm. He claimed that it was not until later in the day that the trooper unexpectedly arrived and he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u00b66 A week after Ellison\u2019s arrest, Rhonda filed a petition for an order of protection. While both the PFMA charge and the order of protection petition were pending, Ellison was separately charged with witness tampering. In investigating this latter case, law enforcement collected two pieces of evidence that constitute the basis for the alleged <em>Brady </em>violations. The first piece of evidence is the transcript of an undated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>interview of Rhonda by a police detective, where she states that, on the day of the PFMA incident, she had ingested a Lexipro antidepressant, cough medicine, energy drinks, and some diet pills. She stated that this cocktail made her \u201creally jittery\u201d and gave her the \u201cshakes.\u201d In this interview she also states, \u201cI thought that they should be aware of that because Lionel also felt that they should be aware of that.\u201d The second piece of evidence that Ellison claims was withheld are text messages found on his cell phone, which was seized in the witness tampering investigation two months after the PFMA incident. The messages, which Ellison claims were from Rhonda, were received from the address \u201canonymous@textem.net,\u201d and read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">Oct. 4, 2009: \u2018ILY 4vr 2. scared of you tho.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">Oct. 5, 2009: \u201cdo you want me dead?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">Oct. 6, 2009: \u201cpsswrd 4 ur mail is sillybear\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">Oct. 6, 2009: \u201call ur passwords are sillybear Crgslist + email\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxQ\">Oct. 6, 2009: \u201cHoney I went 2 C attny 2 day told em truth Manic attack like AK I know you not hurt only tryn 2 protect ILY PLEASE forgive PLEASEEE\u00dc! ILY\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b67 Both of these pieces of evidence were provided to Ellison\u2019s attorney in the witness tampering case approximately one month before the PFMA trial. However, Ellison\u2019s District Court appeal counsel asserted that the evidence should have been provided to the attorneys in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b68 Upon Ellison\u2019s appeal from Justice Court, the District Court functioned effectively as an intermediate appellate court. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a73-5-303 and 3-10-115, MCA. We review the case as if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court. <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643. We examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision, reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion, and its legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact under the de novo standard. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26. We will affirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason. <em>City of Billings v. Staebler, </em>2011 MT 254, \u00b6 9, 362 Mont. 231, 262 P.3d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">\u00b69 In this case, the District Court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to provide a ruling on the claims alleged by Ellison because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the scope of the court\u2019s appellate review was limited to the record from the Justice Court. Ellison argues that \u00a7 46-20-701(2)(b), MCA (commonly referred to as the plain error rule), constitutes a statutory exception that should have allowed the District Court to consider his new evidence. The State argues that \u00a746-20-701(2)(b), MCA, simply constitutes an exception to the rule that failure to make a timely objection constitutes waiver, but that it does not excuse the need for a record with which to conduct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s power to review justice court decisions is provided by Montana law, reading in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(1) A party may appeal to district court a judgment or order from a justice\u2019s court of record. The appeal is confined to review of the record and questions of law, subject to the supreme court\u2019s rulemaking and supervisory authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(3) The district court may affirm, reverse, or amend any appealed order or judgment and may direct the proper order or judgment to be entered or direct that a new trial or further proceeding be had in the court from which the appeal was taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8X\">Section 3-10-115(1), (3), MCA. Accordingly, \u2018Twjhen a District Court exercises its power of appellate review, it must refrain from deciding issues not properly raised or objected to in the court below.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Robertson, </em>2000 MT 52, \u00b6 26, 298 Mont. 419, 998 P.2d 144; <em>see also State v. Mix, </em>239 Mont. 351, 361,781 P.2d 751, 757 (1989) (\u201cWe have long held to the principle that an appellate court in reaching its decision will only consider material ascertainable from the record.\u201d). \u00b611 On the other hand, \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, which provides for statutory plain error review, governs claims that arise on appeal due to suppression of evidence and newly discovered facts or rights. <em>City of Missoula, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>see also State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 915 P.2d 208 (1996), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. The statute reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">(2) Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded. A claim alleging an error affecting jurisdictional or constitutional rights may not be noticed on appeal if the alleged error was not objected to as provided in 46-20-104, unless the convicted person establishes that the error was prejudicial as to the convicted person\u2019s guilt or punishment and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(b) the prosecutor, the judge, or a law enforcement agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>suppressed evidence from the convicted person or the convicted person\u2019s attorney that prevented the claim from being raised and disposed of[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Section 46-20-701(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b612  This Court has adopted the rationale in <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>and cases therein, and we have previously reviewed <em>Brady </em>claims not contained within the record below under the plain error authority of \u00a746-20-701(2)(b), MCA. <em>See e.g. State v. Arlington, </em>265 Mont. 127, 151-152, 875 P.2d 307, 321-322 (1994). Obviously, a defendant alleging that the prosecution withheld exculpatory information in violation of <em>Brady </em>would be unable to object at trial if he was unaware that the information had not been disclosed. In this case, the District Court had two options. First, the District Court could have reviewed Ellison\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims on their merits pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-701(2)(b), MCA. Second, \u00a73-10-115(3), MCA, allows a district court to \u201cdirect that a new trial or further proceeding be had in the court from which the appeal was taken.\u201d In this instance, the District Court could have ordered the Justice Court to conduct a hearing on the allegation. We hold that it was error for the District Court not to exercise one of the above options.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b613 The State contends that Ellison should have either moved for a new trial at the justice court level, or sought post conviction relief. While the prior option was viable given the circumstances, the latter imposes several impediments. First, \u00a746-21-101(2), MCA, provides that Ti]f the sentence was imposed by a justice\u2019s, municipal, or city court, the petition may not be filed unless the petitioner has exhausted all appeal remedies provided by law.\u201d Thus, having either missed or declined his opportunity to move for a new trial at Justice Court, Ellison was required to appeal to the District Court as he did. He would then be entitled to petition for postconviction relief, but face the additional pitfall of no guarantee to appointed counsel. <em>See </em>\u00a746-8-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b614 As noted above, the District Court should have reviewed Ellison\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim pursuant to \u00a746-20-70 l(2)(b), MCA. However, because we review appeals from the district court acting in an appellate capacity de novo, we will consider Ellison\u2019s claim on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\u00b615 Under <em>Brady, </em>the State must disclose any evidence that is material to a defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. <em>State v. Field, </em>2005 MT 181, \u00b6 22, 328 Mont. 26, 116 P.3d 813; \u00a746-15-322(1)(e), MCA. The prosecutor also has a continuing duty to promptly disclose any additional, discoverable evidence pursuant to \u00a746-15-327, MCA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>State\u2019s failure to properly release exculpatory, material evidence to a defendant is a violation of the defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s good faith. <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>269 Mont. 307, 311, 888 P.2d 899, 901-902 (1995) (citing <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1196-1197).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b616 \u2018There are three components of a true <em>Brady </em>violation: The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d <em>State v. St. Dennis, </em>2010 MT 229, \u00b6 47, 358 Mont. 88, 244 P.3d 292. In this case, Ellison fails to establish a prima facie <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b617 The evidence that provides the basis for Ellison\u2019s Brady claim is arguably favorable to his case. However, Ellison has not established that his defense was prejudiced under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b618 Ellison was aware of this information before he went to trial. The State did not suppress the evidence. The evidence was produced to Ellison\u2019s counsel in the witness tampering case because it was collected in connection with the investigation of that charge. Significantly, the text messages that Ellison claims were suppressed by the prosecution were received on Ellison\u2019s own phone well before the device was seized. Moreover, as Rhonda noted during the interview with the police detective, she was there at the behest of Ellison who thought that law enforcement should know about her nervous condition on the day of the incident. Finally, he claims the information that explains Rhonda\u2019s \u201cmental and physical state at the pertinent time of the alleged offense\u201d and the text messages constitute material that he could have used to impeach her as a witness at trial. However, a review of the record indicates that defense counsel not only elicited extensive testimony from Rhonda regarding her medications and mental health at the time of the incident, but that multiple witnesses testified as to Rhonda\u2019s inconsistent stories regarding the incident. Moreover, nothing precluded the defense from using the text messages for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b619  Ellison claims that he was entitled to assume that the State would produce this evidence. To the contrary, \u2018Where is no <em>Brady </em>violation when the accused or his counsel knows before trial about the allegedly exculpatory information and makes no effort to obtain its production.\u201d <em>St. Dennis, </em>\u00b6 51 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Valera, </em>845 F.2d 923, 927-928 (11th Cir. 1988)). Moreover, evidence is only material within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>\u201cwhen there is a reasonable probability that, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Smith v. </em>Cain, _U.S. _, 132 S. Ct. 627, 630, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 576 at *5 (January 10, 2012). We are not persuaded that any of the evidence in question would have produced a different result in this case. The court was presented with ample evidence of Ellison\u2019s guilt of PFMA at the bench trial, and the disputed evidence is not material within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>and its Montana progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b620 As noted above, we will affirm a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches such a result for the wrong reasons. The District Court dismissed <em>Ellison\u2019s Brady </em>claims because it found that they were not ripe for appellate review. While we disagree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning, we agree with the ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b621 For the foregoing reasons, Ellison\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-9\">JUSTICES BAKER, NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
