We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u00b62 The City of Dillon owns a water main line that diverts water from Rattlesnake Creek, as it has done since the early 1900s. At the time of this action only ten residences receive water from this line and all are located outside the Dillon city limits. In 1981 the City entered an agreement with Robert and Patricia McNeill allowing them to connect to the Rattlesnake Creek water main with \u201cone water service\u201d for their domestic water supply. In 1994 the McNeills anticipated subdividing their property and selling a lot. They requested the City to approve a second water service for the new lot but that request was not approved, according to a letter from the Mayor, \u2018because of a lack of information.\u201d In 1997 the McNeills completed the subdivision and sold a parcel of their land. The McNeills divided their water tap from the main line so that water could be piped to their house and to the subdivided lot. As part of the subdivision process, a July, 1997 letter from the Mayor of the City of Dillon to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality states that the \u201cWater Department of the City of Dillon\u201d had granted permission to McNeill to \u201cactivate an existing water service to his property.\u201d The address given for this newly activated or permitted water service is the address of the Conners\u2019 house. The City installed a water meter on the second tap alongside the meter for the McNeill lot, and began billing the owner of the subdivided lot for the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u00b63 In 2004 the Conners bought the subdivided lot with the water tap, the City water meter, and the monthly City billing for water use all in place. The Conners submitted a $35 \u201cmeter deposit\u201d to the City and obtained a receipt. Since September, 2004 the Conners have received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>and paid the City\u2019s monthly bills for water furnished to them through the McNeills\u2019 tap from the Rattlesnake Creek water main.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b64 In the winter of2008, Rattlesnake Creek and the water main both froze solid during a period of cold weather. By all accounts this was an unusual event. The City hired an excavator who dug the ice out of about a mile of Rattlesnake Creek, restoring the flow of water. The water main pipe remained frozen for a longer time, however, and the Conners were without water service for a period of weeks. During that time the City tried unsuccessfully to drill a water well to replace the Rattlesnake Creek water and to thaw the frozen water main pipe. The City offered a large water storage tank to the Conners, but they declined to use it. The City later supplied a portable toilet and bottled water to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b65 In January, 2010 the Conners sued the City for damages arising from the interruption of water service, basing their complaint upon claims of breach of contract, negligence, and infliction of emotional distress. The City moved for summary judgment and both sides filed affidavits and briefs. The District Court referred the summary judgment to a Special Master who conducted a hearing and issued a decision in favor of the City. The Special Master found that there was no contract between Conners and the City because they did not have a contract for water service approved by the City Commission as required by City Ordinance \u00a713.04.110. Therefore, the Special Master determined that the Conners\u2019 water use was unlawful and could not be the basis for a contract. In addition, the Special Master determined that the negligence claim was barred by City Ordinance \u00a713.04.150 which provides that the City can \u201cshut the water off in its mains\u201d and is not liable for claims for the resulting interruption of water service. The District Court subsequently entered summary judgment for the City based upon the Special Master\u2019s decision, and the Conners appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b66 On appeal this Court reviews a district court decision on summary judgment under the same criteria used by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Grimsrud v. Hagel, </em>2005 MT 194, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 142, 119 P.3d 47. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Gliko v. Permann, </em>2006 MT 30, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 112, 130 P.3d 155. This Court applies the same standard of review to an adopted master\u2019s report that we do to any other district court order. <em>Schmidt v. Colonial Terrace Assoc., </em>215 Mont. 62, 66, 694 P.2d 1340, 1343 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b67 <em>Issue One: Did the City of Dillon have a legal obligation to provide water to the Conners under express or implied contract? </em>The Special Master, citing \u00a728-2-102, MCA, found that the elements of a contract are identifiable parties capable of contracting; the consent of the parties; a lawful object of the contract; and sufficient consideration. The Special Master found that if there were a contract between the City and the Conners, it was an implied contract under \u00a728-2-103, MCA, which requires the same elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b68 The Special Master concluded that the elements of a contract required by \u00a728-2-102, MCA, were present in this case, except for the requirement of \u201ca lawful object.\u201d Neither party contests the determination that as between the City and the Conners there were parties capable of contracting, there was consent of the parties, and there was sufficient consideration. The Special Master determined that the Conners\u2019 water use was barred by the original contract between the City and the McNeills, by the City\u2019s 1994 denial of the McNeills\u2019 request for a second tap, and by the City\u2019s municipal code requirement that the City Council approve installation of a second water service. \u00b69 On appeal, the Conners argue that they had an implied contract with the City and that they should be allowed to proceed with their claim that the City breached the contract. A contract may be either express or implied. The terms of an express contract are stated in words while both the existence and terms of an implied contract are manifested by the conduct of the parties, and a party may be estopped by its conduct from denying the existence of a contract. <em>C B &amp; F Development Corp. v. Culbertson State Bank, </em>256 Mont. 1, 5, 7, 844 P.2d 85, 87, 89 (1992). A party\u2019s performance of a contract for a period of years \u201cstrongly indicates\u201d that a contract existed. <em>Somont Oil Co., Inc. v. Nutter, </em>228 Mont. 467, 473, 743 P.2d 1016, 1019 (1987). A party is not allowed to take the benefit of a contract and then later repudiate its existence. <em>Williams v. Schwager, </em>2002 MT 107, \u00b6 28, 309 Mont. 455, 47 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b610 It is clear that neither the City\u2019s contract with the McNeills providing for \u201cone water service\u201dfrom the Rattlesnake Creek main line nor the 1994 denial of permission for a second tap bar the Conners\u2019 claim for breach of contract. The Conners were not parties to the City\u2019s contract with the McNeills, and it is clear that in 1997 the City\u2019s Water Department actually approved the activation of water service to the lot subsequently purchased by the Conners.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b611  The conduct of the City of Dillon manifested the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>a contract to furnish water to the Conners\u2019 lot by approving the water service as part of the subdivision process, installing a water meter, and billing and collecting for the water that was furnished. With this background the City is estopped from asserting there was no contract for this water service because the service was not \u201cspecifically approved by the City Council\u201d as provided in \u00a713.04.110 of the Dillon Municipal Code. The City itself, through the 1997 letter to the DEQ, acted contrary to the position the City now takes, allowing its Water Department to act with regard to approving the second water service from the McNeill tap. An established course of conduct can vary the requirement of a regulation. <em>Lewis v. Huyser, </em>264 Mont. 141, 145, 870 P.2d 95, 98 (1994) (requirement of building code varied by course of conduct). To the extent that the City of Dillon required City Council approval of the water tap for the Conners\u2019 lot, that requirement was completely undermined by the City\u2019s own clear course of conduct in this case. Therefore \u00a713.04.110 of the Dillon Municipal Code does not render the Conners\u2019 use of water illegal so as to vitiate the existence of an implied contract to furnish water.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b612 The Special Master\u2019s conclusion, adopted by the District Court, that an illegal object barred finding an implied contract between the Conners and the City of Dillon is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b613 <em>Issue Two: Is the liability of the City of Dillon in contract or tort limited by \u00a7 13.04.150 of its Municipal Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b614 Section 13.04.150 of the Dillon Municipal Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">The water/sewer department reserves the right, at any time, without notice, to shut the water off in its mains for the purpose of making repairs or extensions or for any other purpose. No claim shall be made against the City of Dillon by reason of the breaking of any service pipe or from any other damage that may result from shutting off the water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b615 The Special Master construed this provision as an absolute bar to any claim that the Conners could have against the City under tort or contract. The Conners argue on appeal that this provision is not a bar to liability because it conflicts with Article II, Sec. 18 of the Montana Constitution. That section provides that governmental entities, including cities have no immunity from liability except as \u201cspecifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b616  This Court will avoid deciding constitutional issues whenever possible, <em>Weidow v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2010 MT 292, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d 704, and we do so in this case. Section 13.04.150 of the Dillon Municipal Code clearly applies when the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>itself decides to shut off water service. In the present case it is clear that the City did not decide to shut off the water service, but that it was shut off by the water freezing in the creek and the main line. Therefore, by its express terms, this provision does not apply here and cannot bar the Conners\u2019 claims in either tort or contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b617 The City also argues that it is not liable to the Conners because the freezing water resulted from an act of God. Neither the Special Master nor the District Court reached this issue and we do not address it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b618  Nothing in this opinion should be construed as a determination that the City of Dillon is in fact liable to the Conners on either contract or tort claims. We only hold that the Special Master and the District Court erred by dismissing the Conners\u2019 claims as a matter of law. This matter is therefore reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
