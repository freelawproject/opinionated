He appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b62 On January 5, 2010, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Billings Police Officers Tom Keightley and David Dierenfield (Officers Keightley and Dierenfield) responded to an apartment building on Monad Road in Billings, Montana, to investigate a noise complaint. Upon arrival, Officers Keightley and Dierenfield met with the complainant who told them loud television noises were coming from the apartment below hers. The apartment below the complainant\u2019s was occupied by Kirn.</p>\n<p id=\"AGs\">\u00b63 Officers Keightley and Dierenfield went to Kirn\u2019s apartment to speak with him about the noise. When Kirn opened his door, he was \u2018irritated instantly\u201d and \u2018Very agitated, very animated, belligerent and frankly, came to the door on the fight.\u201d Kim denied his television was too loud and \u201crefused to turn the t.v. down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u00b64 During the officers\u2019 conversation with Kirn, they moved into and out of Kirn\u2019s apartment. At some point, inside Kirn\u2019s apartment, Kirn put his hand on Officer Keightley\u2019s shoulder. Officer Keightley testified \u2018it wasn\u2019t like he was necessarily pushing me, he just put some light pressure against me[.]\u201dOfficer Keightley pushed Kirn\u2019s hand away and said \u2018Vou don\u2019t need to touch me, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d Kirn then \u201creached out and this time pushed me [Officer Keightley] back.\u201d Officer Keightley \u201cshouted at him ... not to touch me[.]\u201dKirn then said \u201c\u2018we\u2019ll see about this\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019ll see about that,\u2019 one of those two things.\u201d Kirn then walked away and into a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u00b65 Wffiile Kirn was out of sight, Officer Keightley said to Officer Dierenfield \u2018he\u2019s going to get something, I think it\u2019s a gun.\u201dKirn then reappeared. He was standing in a \u201cbladed stance\u201d showing his left side while obscuring his right hand. Both officers believed Kirn walked away to get a gun, and both were scared. Neither officer could see Kirn\u2019s right hand. The officers drew their weapons and shouted at Kirn to show his hands. Kirn did not respond. Officer Keightley finally shouted at Kirn \u201ca warning that I would shoot him.\u201dKirn then \u201craised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>both hands out to the side and dropped what [Officer Keightley] could then see was a shotgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b66 Kirn dropped the shotgun in a chair, but still within his reach. The officers shouted at Kirn to move away, but Kirn did not move. Officer Keightley then deployed his taser at Kirn. Kirn immediately fell to the ground and was handcuffed by Officer Dierenfield. After Kirn was apprehended, Officer Dierenfield checked the shotgun and found it was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b67 Kirn was subsequently charged with two felony counts of assault on a peace officer by causing reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury by use of a weapon. The matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of the State\u2019s case, Kirn moved to dismiss the case for lack of sufficient evidence. His motion was denied, and Kirn was convicted. Kirn timely appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss for lack of sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b68 We review the denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence (formerly a motion for directed verdict) de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511; <em>State v. Skinner, </em>2007 MT 175, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 197, 163 P.3d 399; <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6 37, 341 Mont. 517, 178 P.3d 121; <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 33, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102; <em>State v. Hill, </em>2008 MT 260, \u00b6 20, 345 Mont. 95, 189 P.3d 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">\u00b69 Section 46-16-403, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">When, at the close of the prosecution's evidence or at the close of all the evidence, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding or verdict of guilty, the court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the defendant, dismiss the action and discharge the defendant. However, prior to dismissal, the court may allow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>case to be reopened for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b610  Granting a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence \u2018is only appropriate if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there is no evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b611 Kirn was charged under \u00a745-5-210(l)(b), MCA, which provides \u2018Ta] person commits the offense of assault on a peace officer or judicial officer if the person purposely or knowingly causes ... reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in a peace officer or judicial officer by use of a weapon[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b612 Kirn argues that Officers Keightley and Dierenfield could not have had reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury by use of a weapon because the officers did not see the shotgun until Kirn dropped it in the chair. Therefore, Kirn argues the State did not present sufficient evidence for the jury to convict him. Stated another way, Kirn argues there was not sufficient evidence to prove reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury, an essential element of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b613 The State argues that Montana law is clear that a person need not actually see a weapon to feel threatened by the use of that weapon, and with that in mind, the State presented ample evidence to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b614  We have held numerous times that it is not necessary that the victim personally observe a weapon in order to experience reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury by use of that weapon. <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>State v. Steele, </em>2004 MT 275, \u00b6 33, 323 Mont. 204, 99 P.3d 210; <em>State v. Hagberg, </em>277 Mont. 33, 40-41, 920 P.2d 86, 90 (1996); <em>State v. Misner, </em>234 Mont. 215, 219, 763 P.2d 23, 25 (1988). Kirn\u2019s attempt to factually distinguish these cases in unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u00b615 The circumstances of Officer Keightley\u2019s and Officer Dierenfield\u2019s interaction with Kirn show they faced an unpredictable situation with an angry, belligerent man. The situation escalated from simply talking with Kirn about his television volume, to Kirn making physical contact with Officer Keightley. Then, Kirn made what the officers perceived as a threatening comment and retreated to a bedroom. Officer Keightley testified that he felt Kirn left to get a gun. Officer Keightley also told Officer Dierenfield, \u2018he\u2019s going to get something, I think it\u2019s a gun.\u201d Both officers unequivocally testified that they were scared and concerned for their lives. Kirn returned, standing in a \u201cbladed stance\u201d with his right hand obscured and refused to follow the officers\u2019 command to show his hands. When he finally obeyed the officers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>commands, their fears proved correct-Kirn had left to get a gun, a shotgun he dropped in a chair nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b616  We conclude under these circumstances that the State presented sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. As we held in <em>Swann, Steele, Hagberg, </em>and <em>Misner, </em>Officers Keightley and Dierenfield did not have to personally see the weapon in order to experience reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury. The District Court did not err in denying Kirn\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b617 For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICE COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-17\"> The State asserts the standard of review is for an abuse of discretion, citing <em>Swann. Swann </em>actually overruled our previous cases using the abuse of discretion standard, and adopted the de novo standard of review in cases involving the denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. See our discussion in <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19. Our seemingly contradictory statement in <em>State v. Coluccio, </em>2009 MT 273, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 122, 214 P.3d 1282 (\u201cwe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence de novo if the court based its denial on a conclusion of law.\u20190, is overruled to the extent that it conflicts with our holding in <em>Swann </em>and its progeny. We clarify again that \u2018for all denials of motions for directed verdict, the proper standard of review is not abuse of discretion, but de novo.\u201d <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
