Gill appealed to the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County. The District Court also denied Gill\u2019s motion to suppress and remanded the case to Justice Court for execution of sentence. Gill now appeals to this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b62 Gill raises one issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in denying Gill\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u00b63 Shortly before 9:00 p.m. on April 30, 2010, Susan Brady was traveling eastbound on Interstate 90 near Missoula when she spotted what she described as a \u201cvery intoxicated driver.\u201d Brady used a cell phone to call 911. She reported to the dispatcher that the driver was also heading eastbound on Interstate 90, and that he was unable to stay in his own lane. She stated that the vehicle had hit the cement barrier separating the opposing lanes of traffic on the freeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u00b64 Brady described the vehicle as a dark green Chevy pickup that was probably manufactured during the 1990s. She also described the pickup as having more of a square appearance than a rounded one and that in the bed of the pickup was an unsecured load of wooden pallets. Brady told the dispatcher that there was debris flying out of the back of the truck, thus she was afraid to pull in behind the pickup to obtain its license plate number. Brady reported that there were two males in the pickup and that the passenger was drinking a beer. Brady further reported that she exited the freeway at the Van Bur\u00e9n Street exit, and that she last saw the pickup still heading eastbound on Interstate 90 towards the city of East Missoula.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\u00b65 Brady gave the dispatcher her name, home address, and the number of the cell phone from which she had placed the 911 call. Brady also indicated that she was willing to sign a complaint if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>vehicle could be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b66 A few minutes after Brady\u2019s tip, Missoula dispatch broadcast a report that there was a green Chevy pickup with a load of pallets in the back traveling eastbound from the Van Bur\u00e9n exit on Interstate 90 that was \u201call over the road.\u201d The report also described the occupants of the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b67 At 9:46 p.m., Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Richard Salois saw a dark green 1998 Chevy pickup matching the description in the dispatch report parked near the entrance of the Town Pump in Bonner. The Bonner Town Pump is located just off Interstate 90 east of Missoula. As the pickup pulled out of the Town Pump, Trooper Salois followed it and activated his emergency lights. He did not observe any visible damage to the pickup either before or after he initiated the traffic stop. Trooper Salois made contact with the driver whom he later identified as Gill. There were two other males inside the pickup. Trooper Salois observed various open containers of alcohol in the pickup and he detected a strong odor of alcohol, thus he initiated a DUI investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b68 Gill received citations for DUI in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(a), MCA, and possession of alcohol while under the age of 21 in violation of \u00a745-5-624(2)(a)(i), MCA. Gill filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence in this case arguing that law enforcement did not have particularized suspicion to support an investigative stop of his vehicle. The Justice Court denied his motion. Thereafter, Gill entered into a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b69 Gill appealed to the Fourth Judicial District Court wherein he filed a new motion to suppress. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing at which Gill waived his right to appear due to his deployment in Iraq. His motion to suppress was ultimately denied. Gill then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were applied correctly as a matter of law. <em>City of Missoula v. Moore, </em>2011 MT 61, \u00b6 10, 360 Mont. 22, 251 P.3d 679 (citing <em>State v. Clawson, </em>2009 MT 228, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 354, 212 P.3d 1056). A district court\u2019s finding that particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact which we review for clear error. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 10. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the lower court has misapprehended the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with the firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 476, 977 P.2d 974).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Gill\u2019s motion to suppress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b612 Gill argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress because Brady\u2019s report to 911 was unreliable as the truck stopped by Trooper Salois showed no signs of damage from hitting the median cement barrier on Interstate 90. Thus, Trooper Salois was unable to corroborate Brady\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b613 The State argues that the District Court\u2019s determination that Trooper Salois had particularized suspicion to stop Gill is supported by substantial evidence in the record and is not clearly erroneous. The State maintains that Brady\u2019s report contained sufficient indicia of reliability to support the stop made by Trooper Salois.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b614 Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S, Const, amend. IV; Mont. Const, art II, \u00a7 11. These constitutional protections extend to investigative stops of vehicles made by law enforcement officers. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2011 Mont. 276, \u00b6 8, 362 Mont. 411, 264 P.3d 1136 (citing <em>State v. Flynn, </em>2011 MT 48, \u00b6 7, 359 Mont. 376, 251 P.3d 143; <em>State v. Larson, </em>2010 MT 236, \u00b6 19, 358 Mont. 156, 243 P.3d 1130). \u201cUnder Montana Law, a law enforcement officer \u2018may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 8 (quoting \u00a746-5-401(1), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u00b615 We held <em>in Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842, that to establish particularized suspicion for a stop, the State must show that the officer possessed (1) objective data and articulable facts from which the officer can make certain reasonable inferences, and (2) a resulting suspicion that the person to be stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. Furthermore, \u2018twjhether particularized suspicion exists is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances and requires consideration of the quantity or content of the information available to the officer and the quality or degree of reliability of that information.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 16 <em>(citing State v. Rutherford, </em>2009 MT 154, \u00b6 12, 350 Mont. 403, 208 P.3d 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u00b616 In addition, an officer may rely on information conveyed by a third person to formulate particularized suspicion to stop a person. When an officer\u2019s particularized suspicion is based upon a citizen informant\u2019s report, that report must contain some indicia of reliability. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 165, 951 P.2d 37, 42 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Villegas-Varela, </em>887 P.2d 809, 811 (Or. 1994)). Hence, we have identified three factors to be considered when assessing the reliability of a citizen informant\u2019s report: (1) whether the informant identified herself to law enforcement thereby exposing her to criminal and civil liability if the report is false; (2) whether the informant\u2019s report was based on the personal observations of the informant; and (3) whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42-43 (citing <em>Villegas-Varela, </em>887 P.2d at 810-11). We will examine each of these factors in relation to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether the informant identified herself to law enforcement thereby exposing her to criminal and civil liability if the report is false.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYt\">\u00b618  A citizen informant who is motivated by good citizenship and who is willing to disclose the circumstances by which the incriminating information became known is presumed to be telling the truth. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 34, 314 Mont. 434, 67 P.3d 207). Information provided by the citizen informant, such as the informant\u2019s name, address, and telephone number, lends a high indicia of reliability to the informant\u2019s report. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Myhre, </em>2005 MT 278, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 210, 124 P.3d 126).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b619 Gill concedes that Brady provided dispatch with sufficient information to meet this prong of the test. She gave dispatch her first and last name, her home address, the number of the cellular phone from which she placed the call, and the location from which she was calling. She even agreed to continue to work with law enforcement on the case and sign a complaint if officers located the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b620  By identifying herself to law enforcement, Brady exposed herself to civil and criminal liability if her report turned out to be false. Consequently, Trooper Salois was justified in presuming that the information Brady provided was truthful and had a high indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b621 <em>2. Whether the informant\u2019s report was based on the personal observations of the informant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b622 A citizen informant\u2019s belief that a person is driving under the influence must be based, in part, on his or her personal observations. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13). An officer is allowed to infer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>a report is based on a citizen informant\u2019s personal observations if the report contains sufficient detail that \u2018it is apparent the informant has not fabricated the report out of whole cloth and the report is of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable <em>way.\u201d Moore, </em>\u00b6 21 (brackets and ellipsis omitted) <em>(citing Pratt, </em>286 Mont, at 165, 951 P.2d at 42-43; <em>Villegas-Varela, </em>887 P.2d at 811). Innocent details personally observed by the informant are also relevant in assessing the reliability of the report. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165-66, 951 P.2d at 43).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b623 In this case, Gill argues that the second factor of the <em>Pra tt </em>test has not been met as Brady\u2019s information was not reliable. Gill points out that Brady stated that she observed the pickup hit the cement barrier on Interstate 90; however, Trooper Salois did not observe any damage to the pickup Gill was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b624 The State points out that Brady was traveling in a vehicle on Interstate 90 in the same direction of travel as Gill when she observed his dangerous driving behavior and placed the call to dispatch. Brady provided dispatch with her own personal observations of Gill\u2019s driving behavior including that he was unable to stay in his own lane of traffic, leading her to believe that he was very intoxicated. Brady told dispatch that although she did not observe Gill take a drink, she did observe Gill\u2019s passenger drinking from a container of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b625 In addition, Brady was able to provide dispatch with a detailed description of the pickup including its make, model-type, color, approximate age, and general body shape, as well as its last known location and direction of travel. She also reported to dispatch that there were two male occupants in the pickup and that it carried a load of wooden pallets.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b626 As for Brady\u2019s observation that Gill\u2019s pickup hit the cement barrier separating the lanes of traffic, the State points out that cement barriers such as the one on Interstate 90 are specifically designed, not only to prevent vehicles from crossing into the oncoming lanes of traffic, but also to prevent or minimize vehicle damage if a vehicle does come in contact with those barriers. Such barriers are wider at the base than they are at the top to allow a vehicle\u2019s tires to ride up the barrier and to funnel the tires back into the proper lane of travel. Thus, according to the State, a vehicle\u2019s tires can hit a concrete barrier of this type without the vehicle\u2019s body ever coming into contact with the barrier and without the vehicle sustaining any damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b627 Moreover, Brady never stated that the pickup was damaged in anyway after hitting the cement barrier. Consequently, the fact that Trooper Salois did not observe any damage to Gill\u2019s pickup does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>call into question the reliability of Brady\u2019s report under this factor of the <em>Pratt </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b628 We conclude that Brady\u2019s own contemporaneous personal observations of Gill\u2019s pickup, its occupants, and Gill\u2019s driving behavior provided specific, articulable and objective facts that justified Trooper Salois\u2019 reliance upon the information Brady provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b629 <em>3. Whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b630 \u201cAn officer corroborates an informant\u2019s report by observing illegal activity <em>or </em>by finding \u2018the person, the vehicle, and the vehicle\u2019s location substantially as described by the informant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43). Furthermore, we stated in <em>Pratt </em>that if the first and second factors are met, an officer may corroborate an informant\u2019s tip by observing wholly innocent behavior. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 168, 951 P.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b631 Gill argues that in this case, Trooper Salois did not corroborate the informant\u2019s report because he did not locate a similarly described truck \u201cuntil 45 minutes later, yet only five miles from where the truck was first reported.\u201d Gill maintains that this time frame is too large for the requisite particularized suspicion that his pickup was the same pickup observed by Brady. He claims that based on the passage of time, the reported truck would have been found further down the road near Drummond, not at Bonner. In addition, Gill contends that his pickup was not \u201csubstantially as described by the informant\u201d because there was no damage to his pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b632 The State argues that Gill has not pointed to any cases where this Court has determined that particularized suspicion was extinguished due to the passage of time between the receipt of an informant\u2019s tip regarding an individual driving under the influence and the discovery of the vehicle in question. In addition, the State contends that the delay of 50 minutes between Brady\u2019s report and Trooper Salois\u2019 discovery of Gill\u2019s pickup was not so unreasonably long as to render Brady\u2019s report stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b633 We agree with the State. Moreover, Gill\u2019s argument that his pickup could not possibly be the pickup reported by Brady 50 minutes earlier because he was found only a few miles away, makes no sense. Trooper Salois found the pickup parked at the Town Pump, a casino and convenience store. It is unknown how long Gill was there, but it is not unreasonable to assume that he stopped there shortly after Brady observed the pickup and then remained there for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>\u00b634 Trooper Salois confirmed the make, model-type, color, approximate age, and general body shape of the vehicle described by Brady. Trooper Salois also confirmed the sex of the driver, that the vehicle was in an expected location based on its last known direction of travel, and that it was carrying the same distinctive and unusual payload described by Brady. In addition, contrary to Gill\u2019s contentions, Trooper Salois did not need to corroborate that the pickup was damaged because Brady did not report that the pickup sustained any damage when it hit the cement barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b635 As we noted earlier in this Opinion, an officer corroborates an informant\u2019s report by observing illegal activity or by finding \u201cthe person, the vehicle, and the vehicle\u2019s location substantially as described by the informant.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43). We conclude in this case, that Trooper Salois sufficiently corroborated Brady\u2019s report when less than an hour after Brady\u2019s call, Trooper Salois found a vehicle substantially as described by Brady in the general area also described by Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b636  Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the information provided to Trooper Salois contained sufficient indicia of reliability to form the basis for his particularized suspicion that Gill\u2019s pickup was the same one that Brady observed engaged in criminal activity thereby warranting further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b637 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Gill\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
