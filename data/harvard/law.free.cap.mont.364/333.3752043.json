We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b62 MSF raises the following three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b63 1. Whether the WCC erred in concluding that Grande is suffering from a compensable occupational disease arising out of and in the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether the WCC erred in ordering payment of temporary total disability benefits and medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">\u00b65 3. Whether the WCC erred in ordering payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">\u00b66 MSF\u2019s entire argument on Issues 2 and 3 consists of one sentence in the conclusion section of its initial brief wherein MSF states: \u2018Upon reversal of the threshold issue regarding the compensability of the claim, the award of benefits and costs should likewise be reversed disposing of the two remaining issues on appeal.\u201d Since we are affirming on the threshold issue, we do not address MSF\u2019s second and third issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">\u00b67 Grande has been a truck driver his entire life. Prior to his employment with Valcon, he was self-employed as an over-the-road truck driver. He also drove a dump truck for one season.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">\u00b68 Grande began working for Valcon in October 2005, as a long-haul propane truck driver. He worked up to 15 hours per day, 60 hours per week driving throughout the northwest and into Canada obtaining and delivering propane in a truck that consisted of a tanker and a pup (a second tanker hooked behind the first). Grande\u2019s job required that he hook up several large hoses to the tanker and the pup as well as the propane storage tanks. Some of the hoses were four inches in diameter with a heavy brass end. Grande had to unscrew the caps covering the valves of the truck, the pup and the storage tanks before connecting the hoses. Grande testified that there were as many as 12 valves that needed to be opened and closed during the loading and unloading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b69 In addition, Grande was constantly shifting amongst the 18 gears on his truck. And, during the winter, Grande would have to chain up his truck as often as three times a week depending on the weather. A set of triple chains, which went on both sides of the truck, weighed 75 pounds. Grande also had to install sets of single chains on the back of the truck and on the pup.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b610 Janet Schroeder of Vocational Management Services, Inc., described Grande\u2019s job duties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">Operates tractor/trailer to transport propane over the road in western Montana, Idaho, and eastern Washington: Performs pretrip inspection. Drives tractor/trailer to pick up propane in Canada and delivers to customers. Drives truck into position to load at filling rack. Opens valves or starts pumps to fill tank. Reads gauges or meters and records quantity loaded. Drives truck and delivers propane to customer\u2019s businesses. Pulls hose from a storage tube along side of tank. Pulls hose from a storage tube on side of truck. Opens valves to drain tank. Records amount delivered. Returns hose to hose tubes. Maay [sic] have to chain up during adverse weather conditions. Maintains driver\u2019s log according to DOT regulations.... Employee reaches wai[s]t to chest height on a continual basis to steer vehicle; use of clutch and break [sic] as well as accelerator is used continuously. Employee must use right arm to shift truck.... Employee uses grip/grasp to steer and shift truck, pull self into/out of truck, and to pull hose, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b611 Dr. John Schumpert, who specializes in occupational and environmental medicine, conducted an independent medical examination of Grande for a prior back injury on January 9,2007. Dr. Schumpert later noted that at the time of that evaluation, Grande did not exhibit symptoms of arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b612 Grande was referred to Dr. Bernadette Van Belois in August 2007, for suspicion of arthritis in his hands. Dr. Van Belois is board certified in both rheumatology and internal medicine. She diagnosed Grande as having osteoarthritis with the possibility of an additional diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, possibly rheumatoid arthritis. Dr. Van Belois noted that there is a genetic predisposition for a person to develop osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Grande has a family history of arthritis with his parents, grandparents, a brother and a cousin all suffering from various forms of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u00b613 Grande had a number of follow-up visits with Dr. Van Belois <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>between January 2008 and July 2009. Dr. Van Belois changed Grande\u2019s medications several times, but without any significant improvement in his condition. On July 16,2009, Grande called Dr. Van Belois\u2019 office complaining of pain and swelling in his hands to such a degree that it made it difficult for him to work. After a visit on July 27, 2009, Dr. Van Belois noted in Grande\u2019s medical chart that Grande was unable to continue working as a truck driver because of the significant swelling and pain in his right hand in particular \u201cthat would make any occupation, including a sedentary one, difficult for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b614 In a letter dated August 3, 2009, \u2018To Whom it May Concern,\u201d Dr. Van Belois stated that Grande\u2019s arthritis, which caused significant pain and swelling in his right hand in particular, \u2018impaired his ability to safely drive a truck.\u201d Dr. Van Belois also noted in the letter that the pain medication Grande was taking may make him drowsy and impair his senses, thus she had advised him to stop working.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b615 Grande resigned from his employment with Valcon effective August 7, 2009. He had worked for Valcon for almost four years. In addition to Dr. Van Belois\u2019 recommendation that he stop working, Grande was unable to pass the physical examination necessary to renew his commercial drivers license (CDL). Grande later testified that if it wasn\u2019t for his arthritic condition, he would still be driving truck. Grande filed a claim for compensation with MSF on August 13, 2009. He alleged in his claim that he suffered from an occupational disease in the form of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis as a result of his employment with Valcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b616 In response to questions from Grande\u2019s counsel, Dr. Van Belois wrote a letter dated August 26, 2009, wherein she opined that Grande\u2019s job duties, which involved repetitive use of his hands with repetitive firm gripping, had aggravated his arthritis to such an extent that he was unable to continue working. She pointed out that Grande\u2019s job aggravated his arthritis rather than causing it. Dr. Van Belois stated that, in her medical opinion, Grande\u2019s arthritis is an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b617 Dr. Schumpert reviewed Grande\u2019s medical records at the request of MSF. In a report dated February 18, 2010, Dr. Schumpert stated that he believed that Grande could continue to work as a truck driver. He also stated that he did not feel that Grande was suffering from an occupational disease or that Grande\u2019s employment was the major contributing cause of his condition. Instead, Dr. Schumpert stated that in his opinion, Grande is suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder that is unrelated to his employment as a truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>driver. Dr. Schumpert also opined that Grande\u2019s osteoarthritis is not caused by truck driving and that his work did not aggravate his underlying arthritic condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b618 MSF denied liability for Grande\u2019s occupational disease claim on March 5, 2010. Thereafter, Grande filed a Petition for Hearing with the WCC. After various filings by both parties, the WCC entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment on June 17, 2011, in which it concluded that Grande\u2019s job duties were the major contributing cause of his arthritis, therefore he is suffering from a compensable occupational disease. Grande filed a motion to amend the WCC\u2019s decision, but that motion was denied on July 22, 2011. The WCC subsequently granted MSF\u2019s motion for a stay while MSF appealed the WCC\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b619 We review findings of fact made by the WCC to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial, credible evidence, and we review conclusions of law made by the WCC to determine if those conclusions are correct. <em>Wright v. Ace American Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 43, \u00b6 13, 359 Mont. 332, 249 P.3d 485 (citing <em>Hiett v. Missoula County Pub. Schs., </em>2003 MT 213, \u00b6 15, 317 Mont. 95, 75 P.3d 341). In reviewing the WCC\u2019s factual findings, we will not resolve conflicts in the evidence or consider whether the evidence supports findings that are different from those made by the WCC. Instead, we will confine our review to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings made by the WCC. <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Quick v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2009 MT 162, \u00b6 32, 350 Mont. 455, 208 P.3d 415). In addition, we will defer to the WCC\u2019s findings concerning credibility and the weight to be accorded to the testimony of witnesses who testify in person at trial. But, because we are in as good a position as the WCC to assess deposition testimony presented at trial, we will review such deposition testimony de novo. <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Harrison v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2008 MT 102, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 342 Mont. 326, 181 P.3d 590). Nevertheless, \u201ceven where we conduct de novo review of deposition testimony, we are ultimately restricted to determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the WCC\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Harrison, </em>\u00b6 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the WCC erred in concluding that Grande is suffering </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>from a compensable occupational disease arising out of and in the course and scope of his employment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b621 MSF argues that following the changes to the occupational disease statutes in 2005, a claimant\u2019s employment must be the major contributing cause of the claimant\u2019s condition in order to have a compensable occupational disease. In addition, according to MSF, a work-related aggravation of a personal health condition, such as Grande\u2019s arthritis, is not compensable unless the aggravation is due to a compensable injury or occupational disease. MSF maintains that Grande\u2019s employment was not the major contributing cause of his arthritic condition, and that the aggravation of his condition was not due to a compensable injury or occupational disease, hence the WCC erred when it concluded that Grande suffers from an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b622 Grande contends on the other hand that where it is established that the harm complained of is evidenced by objective medical findings and the job duties were the leading cause contributing to that harm, an occupational disease is proven regardless of whether the harm is a new condition, or an aggravation of a pre-existing condition. Thus, Grande argues that the decision of the WCC should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b623  We have repeatedly stated that the law in effect on an employee\u2019s last day of work governs the resolution of an occupational disease claim. <em>Hardgrove v. Transportation Ins. </em>Co., 2004 MT 340, \u00b6 2, 324 Mont 238, 103 P.3d 999 (citing <em>Grenz v. Fire &amp; Cas., </em>278 Mont. 268, 271, 924 P.2d 264, 266 (1996)). Because Grande\u2019s last day of work was August 7, 2009, the 2009 version of the Workers Compensation Act (WCA) applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b624 In 2005, the Montana Legislature repealed the Occupational Disease Act (ODA) (Title 39, chapter 72, MCA), and amended numerous sections of the WCA to incorporate the necessary provisions to continue coverage for occupational diseases. 2005 Mont. Laws 1404-33. The 2009 version of the WCA is substantially similar to the WCA as amended in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b625 Section 39-71-116(20), MCA (2009), defines an occupational disease as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">(a) ... harm, damage, or death arising out of or contracted in the course and scope of employment caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">(b) The term does not include a physical or mental condition arising from emotional or mental stress or from a nonphysical stimulus or activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In addition, \u00a739-71-407(8), MCA (2009), provides that every employer is liable for the payment of compensation for an occupational disease that \u201carises out of or is contracted in the course and scope of employment.\u201d Section 39-71-407, MCA (2009), further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">(9) Occupational diseases are considered to arise out of employment or be contracted in the course and scope of employment if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">(a) the occupational disease is established by objective medical findings; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">(b) the events occurring on more than a single day or work shift are the major contributing cause of the occupational disease in relation to other factors contributing to the occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">(13) As used in this section, \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d means a cause that is the leading cause contributing to the result when compared to all other contributing causes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b626 MSF contends in the case <em>subjudice </em>that the WCC impermissibly reverted to the pre-2005 standard for determining compensability of an occupational disease claim. That standard was set forth in <em>Polk v. Planet Ins. Co., </em>287 Mont. 79, 951 P.2d 1015 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b627 Polk worked in a factory owned by Koch Agriculture, Inc. (Koch) from 1985 to 1993. Koch processed seeds from various types of grain into oil and meal generally sold for cattle feed. Polk performed physical labor at the factory which included carrying and stacking sacks of meal, cleaning the machinery, and scraping moldy grain from the inside of the elevator and machine pits. Although Polk\u2019s job subjected him to dust and airborne mold, Koch did not provide him with a dust mask until sometime in 1992. <em>Polk, </em>287 Mont. at 81, 951 P.2d at 1016. \u00b628 In April 1991, Polk began experiencing health problems. He tired easily, he had trouble breathing, and he lost nearly 40 pounds. Polk had been a heavy smoker for 30 years. He attempted to quit smoking in December 1993, but he was not entirely successful as he continued to smoke occasionally. By November or December 1993, Polk\u2019s doctor advised him to leave his job. <em>Polk, </em>287 Mont. at 81, 951 P.2d at 1016. \u00b629 Polk filed a claim for occupational disease benefits in January 1994. Polk was examined by several doctors, some of whom concluded that he suffered from an occupational disease and others who concluded that he did not. After a hearing, the hearings examiner with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry determined that Polk was not suffering from an occupational disease. Polk appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>WCC in March 1996. The WCC determined that the hearings examiner\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and were supported by substantial evidence. <em>Polk, </em>287 Mont. at 81-83, 951 P.2d at 1016-17. \u00b630 The statute at the time <em>Polk </em>was decided provided that a worker may receive compensation \u201c[i]f an occupational disease is aggravated by any other disease or infirmity not itself compensable or if disability or death from any other cause not itself compensable is aggravated, prolonged, accelerated, or in any way contributed to by an occupational disease ....\u2019\u2019Section 39-72-706(1), MCA (repealed 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b631 On appeal, we held in <em>Polk, </em>that the hearings examiner applied the wrong standard of causation by requiring Polk\u2019s occupational exposures to be the \u201cmajor or primary factor causing his medical condition\u201d rather than reviewing the medical experts\u2019 testimony to determine whether it supported a finding that an occupational exposure contributed to or aggravated Polk\u2019s condition. <em>Polk, </em>287 Mont. at 88, 951 P.2d at 1020. We stated in <em>Polk </em>that \u201can employer accepts his employee with all of his injuries and diseases.\u201d <em>Polk, </em>287 Mont. at 84, 951 P.2d at 1018 (citing <em>Ridenour v. Equity Supply Co., </em>204 Mont. 473, 665 P.2d 783 (1983); <em>Eastman v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>237 Mont. 332, 777 P.2d 862 (1989)). And, we held that the proper test for compensability of an occupational disease is \u201cwhether occupational factors significantly aggravated a pre-existing condition, not whether occupational factors played the major or most significant role in causing the claimant\u2019s resulting <em>disease.\u201dPolk, </em>287 Mont. at 85, 951 P.2d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b632 In the instant case, MSF argues that in light of the changes the Legislature made to the laws on occupational diseases in 2005, the <em>Polk </em>standard is no longer applicable. MSF maintains that the express language of the post-2005 occupational disease statutes requires that the damage or harm arise out of or be contracted in the course and scope of the claimant\u2019s employment which in turn requires the workplace events to be the major contributing cause of the claimant\u2019s condition. MSF contends that both Dr. Van Belois and Dr. Schumpert opined that Grande\u2019s job as a truck driver was not the major contributing cause of his arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b633 While it is true that the Legislature changed the definition of occupational disease after <em>Polk, </em>the Legislature did not specify in those changes that an occupational disease is not compensable at all if the underlying cause is a pre-existing condition. As already indicated, the 2009 version of the MCA defines an occupational disease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-9\">(9) Occupational diseases are considered to arise out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>employment or be contracted in the course and scope of employment if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">(a) the occupational disease is established by objective medical findings; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">(b) the events occurring on more than a single day or work shift are the major contributing cause of the occupational disease <em>in relation to other factors contributing to the occupational disease.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">(13) As used in this section, \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d means a cause that is the leading cause contributing to the result <em>when compared to all other contributing causes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Section 39-71-407, MCA (2009) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b634 In this case, MSF has not presented any evidence to support its position that the 2005 Legislature intended to revoke statutorily created benefits when it enacted \u00a739-71-407(13), MCA. In fact, there is nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-407(13), MCA, that precludes compensability of an occupational disease any time there is an underlying or pre-existing cause or disposition toward the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b635 Had that been the Legislature\u2019s intent, it would not have included the language we have italicized above. There is nothing to indicate that the Legislature intended to completely eliminate compensation for an occupational disease when there are congenital factors contributing to it. MSF\u2019s position is undermined by \u00a739-71-407(10), MCA (2009), which provides that the only employer liable for a compensable occupational disease \u201cis the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease.\u201d This language contemplates that an employer may be liable for an occupational disease even if the employee had the disease prior to working for that employer. MSF seems to acknowledge this by noting in its reply brief that its position is \u201cthat preexisting conditions that are substantially and materially aggravated by injuries or occupational diseases remain compensable.\u201d MSF takes the position, however, that an individual must <em>have </em>an occupational disease before an aggravation of it can be compensable, and thus only occupational factors can be considered in determining whether a condition meets the definition of an occupational disease. This argument overlooks the Legislature\u2019s clear expression that <em>all </em>contributing factors be considered in determining whether a condition qualifies as an occupational disease. Section 39-71-407(13), MCA (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u00b636 Moreover, the fact that the definition of \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d is tied to the <em>result </em>is significant in light of the evidence presented in this case. Section 39-71-407(13), MCA (2009), does not require the job to be the leading cause of the <em>onset </em>of the disease, but the leading cause contributing to the <em>result, </em>which in this case is the disease\u2019s progression to the point where Grande is unable to work. \u00b637 An employer cannot be required to take an employee as he finds him, while at the same time be allowed to ignore the impact of work-related factors on pre-existing conditions. It is only by finding that the statute requires the consideration of pre-existing conditions on the development of occupational diseases that courts can give meaning to the statutory requirement to determine the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d of the claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b638 MSF also argues that under \u00a739-71-407(2)(a)(ii), MCA, an insurer is liable only when an <em>injury </em>aggravates a pre-existing condition, not when an occupational disease aggravates a pre-existing condition. MSF notes that there was no <em>injury </em>in this case. Section 39-71-407(2)(a)(ii), MCA (2009), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">(2) (a) An insurer is liable for an injury, as defined in 39-71-119, if the injury is established by objective medical findings and if the claimant establishes that it is more probable than not that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">(ii) a claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">Contrary to MSF\u2019s interpretation, \u00a739-71-407(2)(a)(ii), MCA (2009), is not referring to an insurer\u2019s liability for an occupational disease. Instead, by referencing \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (2009) (which defines \u2018injury\u201d and \u201caccident\u201d), this subsection of the statute refers to liability for an injury. Section 39-71-119(4), MCA (2009), excludes from the definition of \u2018injury\u201d a \u201cdisease that is not caused by an accident.\u201d Liability for an occupational disease, as noted above, is covered by \u00a7 39-71-407(8), MCA (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b639 As the WCC pointed out, although the word \u201caggravation\u201d does not appear in the statutory definition of \u201coccupational disease,\u201d the statutory requirement that the work-related aspect of an occupational disease be the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d would be meaningless if, as MSF argues, permanent aggravations of underlying conditions can no longer be considered occupational diseases even if work-related factors are the major contributing cause of the condition. It is unlikely that the only contributing factor to an occupational disease will be the employee\u2019s job duties, and that is precisely why \u00a739-71-407, MCA, provides that for an occupational disease to be compensable under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>WCA, only \u2018the leading cause contributing to the result\u201d must be related to the employment. Moreover, \u00a739-71-407(13), MCA, requires that the \u2018leading cause\u201d must be compared to \u201call other contributing causes,\u201d and a preexisting condition certainly falls within the ambit of \u201call other contributing causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b640 MSF argues that in order for Grande\u2019s work to be the leading cause of his condition, the occupational factors must weigh heavier than any of the other individual contributors to an occupational disease. The WCC pointed out that just as a horse can \u2018lead\u201d a race by a nose, a \u2018leading cause\u201d under the statute is that cause which ranks first among all causes \u201ccontributing to the result\u201d4.e., the condition for which benefits are sought regardless of the respective percentages of multiple contributing causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b641 Both Dr. Schumpert and Dr. Van Belois acknowledged that the causes of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Dr. Van Belois testified that the current understanding of the cause of most forms of arthritis is that there may be a genetic component as well as an environmental exposure. She pointed out that with osteoarthritis, the genetic predisposition is triggered by trauma or exposure over time (\u201cwear and tear\u201d), while rheumatoid arthritis is triggered by an environmental agent that is different for each person. Because of the need for a genetic pre-disposition, Dr. Van Belois was unwilling to state that Grande\u2019s job duties caused his arthritis. She did state, however, that the repetitive use of his hands for shifting gears, gripping the steering wheel, and twisting hoses on and off accelerated both Grande\u2019s osteoarthritis and his rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b642 Dr. Van Belois opined that it was more probable than not that Grande\u2019s job duties, when compared to all other contributing causes, were the leading cause of the worsening or accelerating of his osteoarthritis because Grande spent most of his time doing his work-related activities repetitively. Dr. Van Belois testified that activities of daily living can aggravate arthritic conditions, but to a lesser degree because individuals can moderate how much time they spend doing those activities in a way that they cannot in a work environment which requires repetitive movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b643 As for Dr. Schumpert, his report is based solely on a review of Grande\u2019s medical records. Dr. Schumpert did not examine Grande at the time he wrote his report. In addition, Dr. Schumpert\u2019s opinion that the job of truck driver is not prone to aggravate either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis appears to rely more on the job title of truck driver rather than on the actual duties of Grande\u2019s job which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>gripping and twisting the caps on and off the valves on the storage tanks and the tanker, and gripping and twisting the hoses on and off of those valves. This is evident from various statements in Dr. Schumpert\u2019s report, such as his statement that he was \u201cunable to identify any factor in [Grande\u2019s] work as a truck driver that would cause this isolated problem involving the hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b644 Moreover, Dr. Schumpert based his opinion in part on the lack of any literature supporting aggravation of rheumatoid arthritis by individual\u2019s working in the vocation of truck driver.\u201d And, he noted that if driving truck could cause rheumatoid arthritis, then \u201crheumatoid arthritis would be far more prevalent than it is, as there are literally hundreds of thousands of truck drivers in the United States.\u201d Clearly Dr. Schumpert focused only on the truck driving portion of Grande\u2019s job; he did not take into consideration the other duties Grande was required to perform as part of his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b645  As a general rule, the opinion of a treating physician is accorded greater weight than the opinions of other expert witnesses. <em>EBI/Orion Group v. Blythe, </em>1998 MT 90, \u00b6 12, 288 Mont. 356, 957 P.2d 1134 <em>(EBI/Orion Group II) </em>(citing <em>EBI/Orion Group v. Blythe, </em>281 Mont. 50, 57, 931 P.2d 38, 42 (1997) <em>(EBI/Orion Group I)). </em>This Court has held, however, that a treating physician\u2019s opinion is not conclusive. \u201c \u2018To presume otherwise would quash the role of the fact finder in questions of an alleged injury. The [WCC], as the finder of fact, is in the best position to assess witnesses\u2019 credibility and testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>EBI/Orion Group II, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Kloepfer v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>276 Mont. 495, 498, 916 P.2d 1310, 1312 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b646 The WCC noted here that, in assigning relative weight to expert medical opinions, it takes into account whether the experts have physically examined the claimant, as well as the expert\u2019s background and experience working with the particular disease at issue in occupational disease cases. Thus, the WCC stated in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment that, on those bases, it assigned greater weight to Dr. Van Belois\u2019 opinions than to Dr. Schumpert\u2019s because, unlike Dr. Schumpert, Dr. Van Belois is Grande\u2019s treating physician; Dr. Van Belois has physically examined Grande on a number of occasions; and Dr. Van Belois is board-certified in rheumatology.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u00b647  We conclude in this case that the WCC\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial, credible evidence, and that its conclusions of law are correct. Accordingly, we hold that the WCC did not err in concluding that Grande is suffering from a compensable occupational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>disease arising out of and in the course and scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"AoD\">\u00b648 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b369-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b369-5\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AdR\">concurs in part and dissents in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b649 While I concur with much of the Court\u2019s analysis about the parties\u2019 arguments, I believe the Court ultimately reaches an incorrect result under the governing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b650 Most of the Court\u2019s analysis is directed to demonstrating that the 2009 legislative changes did not preclude \u201ccompensability of an occupational disease any time there is an underlying or pre-existing cause or disposition toward the condition.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34. With this I agree. Merely because a worker\u2019s medical condition pre-exists the subject employment does not prohibit compensability. The precondition is a factor in the analysis, but does not end the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b651 Under the statute, the worker\u2019s employment must be \u2018the major contributing cause <em>of the occupational disease </em>in relation to other factors <em>contributing to the occupational disease.\u201d </em>Section 39-71-407(9)(b), MCA (emphasis added). Thus, of all the factors that contribute to a worker\u2019s medical condition, including the pre-existing nature and extent of the condition, the current work duties must be \u201cthe major contributing cause\u201d of the medical condition in order for the condition to be a compensable occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u00b652 Section 39-71-407(13), MCA, defines the internal phrase \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d as \u201ca cause that is the leading cause contributing to the result when compared to all other contributing causes.\u2019T believe that the Court, rather than inserting this sub-definition back into the definition of occupational disease in \u00a739-71-407(9)(b), MCA, instead gives it a separate and inconsistent meaning. The Court reasons that \u201cthe result\u201d referenced within this sub-definition is the worker\u2019s occupational outcome, here, that \u2018Grande is unable to work.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36. However, a worker\u2019s occupational outcome is a disability issue, which is determined later. The provisions at issue here are not addressing disability and do not incorporate a worker\u2019s occupational result into the definition of occupational disease. Rather, \u201cthe result\u201d referenced here is the current medical condition at issue, to which the definition in \u00a7 39-71-407(9)(b), MCA, is applied to determine the compensability of the condition as an occupational disease. Paralleling 407(9)(b), which requires work duties to be the major contributing cause of the occupational disease \u2018in relation to other factors,\u201d407(13) likewise defines the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d to be the leading cause \u201cwhen compared to all other contributing causes.\u201d Together, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>provisions define \u201cthe major contributing cause <em>of the occupational disease,\u201d </em>\u00a7 39-71-407(9)(b), MCA (emphasis added), and are not addressing an occupational result.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b653 Thus, for Grande\u2019s current condition to be compensable, his work duties must be \u201cthe major contributing cause of the occupational disease.\u201d However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court (WCC) did not find this to be so. Crediting the opinion of Dr. Van Belois over the opinions of the other physicians, the WCC noted that Dr. Van Belois\u2019 opinion was that \u2018Grande\u2019s job duties, when compared to all other contributing causes, were the leading cause of the worsening or accelerating of [Grande\u2019s] osteoarthritis.\u201d Contrary to statutory requirement that Grande\u2019s duties must be the leading cause of his medical condition, the WCC found that the duties were <em>the leading cause of the \u201cworsening or accelerating\u201d </em>of his condition. I submit that this analysis failed to satisfy the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b654 MSF correctly argues that this outcome improperly returns to the <em>Polk </em>standard. <em>Polk </em>permitted job-related \u201caggravations\u201d of occupational diseases to be compensable. <em>Polk v. Planet Ins. Co., </em>287 Mont. 79, 951 P.2d 1015 (1997). Here, the disease found to be compensable is based on job duties that are merely \u201cthe leading cause\u201d of a <em>worsening </em>of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b655 I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
