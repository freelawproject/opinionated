We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly grant summary judgment to Ramlow and the Firm based upon its determination that H&amp;H\u2019s pro se 2007 complaint constituted a nullity and that H&amp;H\u2019s later amended complaints were time-barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">\u00b64 Slade House and his father, David House (collectively \u2018Houses\u201d), compose H&amp;H. H&amp;H sought to develop and sell property and homes adjacent to the Eagle Bend Golf Course (Eagle Bend) in Bigfork, Montana. Houses hired Ramlow to help them meet the regulatory requirements related to the development of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">\u00b65 Ramlow began to work on H&amp;H\u2019s requests. Ramlow set up various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>corporate entities. Ramlow drafted a Boundary Adjustment and Golf Membership Agreement (Agreement) with Eagle Bend. The Agreement required Eagle Bend to convey the property free of encumbrances except such encumbrances acceptable to H&amp;H. It allowed H&amp;H to cancel the Agreement if Eagle Bend failed to convey free and clear title.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b66 Ramlow emailed an electronic version of the Agreement to Eagle Bend and its lawyers. Ramlow alleged that Eagle Bend\u2019s lawyers made several untracked changes to the electronic version of the Agreement. Eagle Bend\u2019s lawyers apparently deleted three terms: a specific closing date, a provision for transfer of the required property density units, and the requirement for transfer of free and clear title. Eagle Bend returned the now revised Agreement to Ramlow. Ramlow acknowledges that he failed to review the document for any changes. Slade House and an Eagle Bend representative both signed the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b67 The parties contest the circumstances under which Slade House signed the Agreement. Ramlow claimed that Eagle Bend sent the Agreement directly to Slade House. Slade House alleged that someone from Ramlow\u2019s office called to inform him that the Agreement was ready for his signature. He claims that he signed the document in front of Ramlow\u2019s paralegal. H&amp;H defaulted and lost the subdivision in 2009. David House later lost his personal residence that he had used as collateral for a business loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b68 H&amp;H filed a complaint in Lake County against Ramlow and Ramlow\u2019s then firm, Kaufman, Vidal, Hileman and Ramlow, P.C., on March 8, 2007. Slade House signed the Lake County complaint on behalf of H&amp;H. The complaint alleged professional negligence and damages that arose from Ramlow\u2019s failure to review the altered Agreement. The clerk of court never issued a summons on the Lake County complaint and Slade House never served the Lake County complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b69 Eleven days after filing the Lake County complaint, H&amp;H, through counsel, filed a complaint in Flathead County against Eagle Bend. The Flathead County complaint sought damages based on allegations similar to those in the Lake County complaint. H&amp;H settled with Eagle Bend in February, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b610 H&amp;H, through counsel, filed a motion on January 20, 2010, that sought to transfer the Lake County complaint to the 11th Judicial District, Flathead County. The district court in Lake County granted H&amp;H\u2019s motion to transfer on January 22, 2010. The court in Flathead County granted H&amp;H\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>February, 2010. This amended complaint added David House as a plaintiff, renamed Ramlow\u2019s former firm, and added as a defendant Ramlow\u2019s current law firm, Ramlow &amp; Rudbach PLLP. The complaint also included a lawyer\u2019s signature. H&amp;H served Ramlow with this complaint on February 9, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b611 Ramlow and the Firms filed a motion to declare the Lake County complaint null and void. The District Court granted the motion. The court determined that the Lake County complaint constituted a nullity in light of the fact that a non-lawyer could not file a complaint on behalf of a limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b612 Ramlow and the Firms filed for summary judgment in March, 2010 based upon the running of the applicable statute of limitations. The District Court granted H&amp;H\u2019s second motion to amend its complaint in July, 2010. The District Court granted summary judgment for Ramlow and the Firms in February, 2011. Ramlow and the Firms moved for the entry of final judgment. H&amp;H and David House opposed the request for entry of final judgment on the grounds that the relation back doctrine, as recognized by M. R. Civ. P. 15(c), saved H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s amended complaint from the time bar. The District Court entered final judgment against H&amp;H and David House on March 29, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b613 A court\u2019s application of M. R. Civ. P. 15(c) to undisputed facts presents a question of law. <em>Citizens Awareness Network v. Mont. Dept. of Envtl. Rev., </em>2010 MT 10, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 60, 227 P.3d 583. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Citizens Awareness, </em>\u00b6 13. We similarly review de novo a court\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion. <em>Lampi v. Speed, </em>2011 MT 231, \u00b6 10, 362 Mont. 122, 261 P.3d 1000. Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Lampi, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u00b614  We first dispose of two procedural issues. H&amp;H and David House contend that the five-year statute of limitations for breach of contract actions should apply here. Section 27-2-202(2), MCA. The District Court applied the three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims. Section 27-2-206, MCA. H&amp;H and David House added claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty to their second amended complaint. We determined in <em>Guest v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>McLaverty, </em>2006 MT 150, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 332 Mont. 421, 138 P.3d 812, that if a plaintiffs claims all sound in legal malpractice, \u201c[a] plaintiff cannot, simply by virtue of mislabeling a claim for relief, change the gravamen of the action and secure a longer period of limitation.\u201d The District Court correctly concluded that H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s case is \u201cclearly grounded in alleged professional malpractice.\u201d The three-year statute of limitations for professional malpractice actions applies here. Section 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b615 Ramlow and the Firms next argue that H&amp;H and David House waived their arguments not made before the District Court granted summary judgment to Ramlow and the Firms. We generally will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal or changes in legal theory. <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, 961 P.2d 100. H&amp;H and David House argued in their brief opposing Ramlow\u2019s motions for summary judgment and to strike, however, that this Court never has determined that a <em>pro se </em>complaint constitutes a nullity. H&amp;H and David House pointed to the fact that Ramlow and the Firms exclusively relied upon cases from other jurisdictions to support their argument that the court should strike H&amp;H\u2019s 2007 complaint. In light of these circumstances, H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s appeal \u201cdoes not amount to such a significant change in legal theory that we must decline to consider [its] appeal.\u201d <em>Becker v. Rosebud Operating Serv., Inc., </em>2008 MT 285, \u00b6 18, 345 Mont. 368, 191 P.3d 435. We turn then to the merits of H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b616 H&amp;H and David House argue that the District Court failed to apply the relation back rule, contained in M. R. Civ. P. 15(c), to their amended complaint. The rule allows an amended pleading to relate back to the date of the original complaint if the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth, or attempted to be set forth, in the original pleading. M. R. Civ. P. 15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b617 The expiration of the applicable statute of limitations does not bar an amended pleading when the amendment fits the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 15(c). <em>Citizens Awareness, </em>\u00b6 21. M. R. Civ. P. 15(c) permits a claim raised in an amended pleading to relate back to the date of the original complaint. In this way, M. R. Civ. P. 15(c) removes the protection to a defendant otherwise afforded by the statute of limitations when a party amends a complaint. <em>Prentice Lumber Co. v. Hukill, </em>161 Mont. 8, 15, 504 P.2d 277, 281. M. R. Civ. P. 15(c) allows a court to render a dispositive decision on the merits of a party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>argument, rather than on technicalities. <em>Citizens Awareness, </em>\u00b6 21. We face the issue of whether H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s amended complaint should relate back, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 15(c), to the date of H&amp;H\u2019s filing of its <em>pro se </em>complaint in Lake County in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"AME3\">\u00b618 Montana law generally does not permit a corporation to file an action <em>pro se. </em>A corporation \u201ccannot appear on its own behalf through an agent other than an attorney.\u201d <em>Contl. Realty, Inc. v. Gerry, </em>251 Mont. 150, 152, 822 P.2d 1083, 1084 (1991). Non-lawyers who attempt to represent corporations or partnerships in court are guilty of contempt of court. <em>Zempel v. Liberty, </em>2006 MT 220, \u00b6 18, 333 Mont. 417, 143 P.3d 123; \u00a737-61-210, MCA. Our references to corporations in this opinion apply with equal force to partnerships, limited liability companies, and similar entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b619 This Court determined in <em>Weaver v. Law Firm of Graybill, Ostrem, Warne &amp; Crotty, </em>246 Mont. 175, 803 P.2d 1089 (1990), that Weaver, a non-lawyer stockholder, could not bring a <em>pro se </em>action on a corporation\u2019s behalf. The Court thus reviewed only the stockholder\u2019s claims for which he had individual standing. <em>See also Zempel, </em>\u00b6 18. Weaver unfortunately failed to heed these decisions. We recently rejected Weaver\u2019s <em>pro se </em>effort in <em>Weaver v. Adv. Refrigeration, </em>2011 MT 174, 361 Mont. 233, 257 P.3d 378, to reverse a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on the plaintiffs lack of standing. We instead reaffirmed that a shareholder may not bring a claim that belongs to the corporation. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b620 Similarly, counsel represented Continental Realty at a bench trial in the district court in an eviction dispute between Continental Realty and its tenants. <em>Cont. Realty, </em>251 Mont. at 151, 822 P.2d at 1084. The tenants prevailed in the district court. Continental Realty filed a brief on appeal signed by its president, a non-lawyer. <em>Cont. Realty, </em>251 Mont. at 151, 822 P.2d at 1084. The Court declined to consider Continental Realty\u2019s brief due to the corporation\u2019s representation by a non-lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b621 <em>Weaver </em>and <em>Continental Realty </em>stand for the proposition that a non-lawyer may not represent a corporation at trial or on appeal. They do not address directly the issue of whether a complaint filed on behalf of a corporation by a non-lawyer should be considered a nullity. Similarly, these decisions do not address whether a complaint filed on behalf of a corporation by a non-lawyer can be resuscitated by the eventual appearance of a lawyer on behalf of the party. H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s appeal squarely present these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b622 The North Dakota Supreme Court in <em>Carlson v. Workforce Safety </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>and Insurance, </em>765 N.W.2d 691, \u00b6 26 (N.D. 2009), determined that Tt]he proper remedy when a corporation is represented by a non-attorney agent is to dismiss the action and strike as void all legal documents signed and filed by the non-attorney.\u201dSeveral jurisdictions, on the other hand, have deemed <em>pro se </em>corporate complaints \u201ccurable defects.\u201d The Arizona Supreme Court held in <em>Boydston v. Strole Development Co., </em>969 P.2d 653, 656 (Ariz. 1998), that \u201ca reasonable opportunity should be given to cure the problem\u201d of a <em>pro se </em>corporate filing. The Utah Court of Appeals in <em>Graham v. Davis County Solid Waste Management and Energy Recovery Special Service District, </em>979 P.2d 363, \u00b6 15 (Utah Ct. App. 1999), likewise rejected the district court\u2019s determination that a <em>pro se </em>complaint filed by a corporation constitutes a complete nullity. The party potentially could have cured the defect by entering an appearance of counsel on its behalf. <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 15. To treat a <em>pro se </em>corporate complaint as a \u201ccurable defect\u201d leaves open the possibility of amending the complaint to add a lawyer\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b623 We have not yet addressed factors that a district court should apply to a <em>pro se </em>corporate complaint if the corporation later amends the filing to include a lawyer\u2019s signature and then attempts to relate it back to the original complaint using M. R. Civ. P. 15(c). The Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Save Our Creeks v. City of Brooklyn Park, </em>699 N.W.2d 307 (Minn. 2005), addressed such a scenario. A federal district court certified the question of \u201cwhether a complaint filed and signed on behalf of a corporate entity by a non-lawyer is a legal nullity.\u201d <em>Save Our Creeks, </em>699 N.W.2d at 309. The court answered the certified question in the negative. <em>Save Our Creeks, </em>699 N.W.2d at 308. The court determined that a corporate complaint signed by a non-lawyer does not necessarily constitute a nullity. <em>Save Our Creeks, </em>699 N.W.2d at 311. The court considered whether the corporation acted with knowledge that filing a <em>pro se </em>complaint was improper. The court analyzed whether the corporation had obtained counsel upon notice that it could not file <em>pro se. </em>The court evaluated the scope of the non-lawyer\u2019s participation. And finally, the court reviewed whether the non-lawyer\u2019s involvement had prejudiced the opposing party. <em>Save Our Creeks, </em>699 N.W.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b624  A district court has discretion to determine whether a corporation should be able to relate back to an amended complaint signed by a lawyer, to its original, <em>pro se </em>complaint. The district court in <em>Weaver </em>warned Weaver of the need to amend his <em>pro se </em>complaint to name a corporation as a party. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 16. Weaver failed to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>leave to amend during the nearly one year period that the court\u2019s scheduling order allowed for amendments. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 17. We affirmed. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b625 Courts should apply the factors deemed relevant by the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Save Our Creeks. </em>These factors include whether the entity had knowledge that it could not file a <em>pro se </em>complaint, the amount of time that has elapsed between learning of the prohibition and seeking counsel, whether the <em>pro se </em>complaint caused prejudice to the opposing party, and how extensively the non-lawyer participated in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b626 The Tennessee Supreme Court deemed a missing lawyer\u2019s signature on a corporation\u2019s complaint to constitute a \u201cdefect in the filing.\u201d <em>Old Hickory Eng. and Mach. Co. v. Henry, </em>937 S.W.2d 782, 786 (Tenn. 1996). The court declined to allow an appearance by counsel to resuscitate the earlier filed complaint. Counsel appeared for the first time more than one month after the defendant first had raised the issue. This month interval in the filing could not be considered \u201cprompt\u201d action to cure the defect in the original complaint. <em>Old Hickory, </em>937 S.W.2d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b627 A district court must evaluate the circumstances of each case as it arises. A district court\u2019s analysis of these factors will ensure that district courts will not declare an otherwise valid complaint void for technical reasons. <em>Citizens Awareness, </em>\u00b6 21. It further will ensure that corporations do not take advantage of the relation back doctrine offered by M. R. Civ. P. 15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b628  We do not need to reach the question of whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment to Ramlow and the Firms. We instead reverse and remand to the District Court to assess whether M. R. Civ. P. 15(c) permits H&amp;H\u2019s and David House\u2019s 2010 amended complaint in Flathead County to relate back to H&amp;H\u2019s 2007 Lake County complaint pursuant to the criteria set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
