He also argues that the District Court erred by overruling his objection to a statement made by the prosecutor during closing argument. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"A7TO\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the District Court err when it denied Roger\u2019s motion to suppress statements he made to police outside his house?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by overruling Roger\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement during closing argument?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b64 Roger, age 69, lived with his sister, Shirley Cote (Shirley), age 71. On May 21, 2010, Shirley was talking on the telephone to a computer technician about problems she was having with her computer. The call ended when Shirley hung up on the technician. The technician called back, and Roger answered the phone. Shirley insisted that Roger get off the phone, but Roger refused. Shirley responded by throwing two books at the back of Roger\u2019s chair. Roger claimed that Shirley became very angry and started to scratch his face and arms and otherwise became hysterical. Although Roger and Shirley\u2019s versions differed, at some point Roger grabbed Shirley and placed her on a bed, restricting her movement. Roger claimed Shirley continued to struggle and that he slapped her to \u201ccalm her down.\u201d Shirley claimed that Roger choked her until she could not breathe. Both indicated that Roger told Shirley he would kill her if she didn\u2019t stop struggling. Roger eventually let Shirley go, and Shirley walked to her daughter\u2019s house on an adjoining property.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">\u00b65 Shirley or her daughter then called for an ambulance and police. Two members of the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office arrived on the scene shortly after the ambulance. Deputy Joe Marble was the first officer to arrive and talk to Shirley about her version of events. As Deputy Marble was leaving the house to contact Roger about his version of the events, Sgt. Hudson arrived and accompanied Deputy Marble.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">\u00b66 The officers pulled into Roger\u2019s driveway, up to a driveway gate. Upon their arrival, Roger exited the house, walked up to the gate, opened it, and closed it behind him as he approached the officers, talking the entire way. The officers testified that they did not motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>for Roger to come to them, did not call him or otherwise indicate that he should talk to them, and that he exited the house on his own. The officers testified Roger appeared to be agitated, seemingly angry, and that he acted \u201c[a]lmost hyper\u201d when telling his side of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b67 Roger told the officers his sister had thrown two books at him and had scratched his face and arms. He said he slapped her and held her down on the bed because she \u201cwent bananas.\u201dThe officers talked with Roger for a couple minutes and asked several questions, giving him a <em>Miranda </em>warning during the conversation, to which Roger replied, \u2018Yes, of course I understand the rights. I\u2019m an ex-con.\u201d He further stated he was willing to talk with them. Roger then reiterated that he held his sister down on the bed, slapped her, and threatened to kill her if she didn\u2019t knock it off but insisted he did not strangle her as she claimed. Roger was eventually arrested and charged with aggravated assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-202, MCA, and partner or family member assault, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a745-5-206(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b68 Roger moved to suppress his statements. He conceded his initial statements were spontaneous but argued that everything he said after the officers asked questions should be suppressed because the <em>Miranda </em>warning was ineffective. He asserted the warning was ineffective because he was then in custody, and the officers had employed an impermissible \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201dinterrogation technique. The District Court denied the motion, ruling that Roger was not in custody at the time, and, therefore, a <em>Miranda </em>warning was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b69 Roger proceeded to a jury trial and was acquitted of aggravated assault but convicted of partner or family member assault. During closing argument, the prosecutor likened the burden of proof standard of\u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to whether jurors would allow Roger to babysit their children. Roger objected on the ground that the statement mischaracterized the burden of proof, and the District Court overruled the objection. Roger appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress and the denial of his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s underlying findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law to those facts. <em>State v. Main, </em>2011 MT 123, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 470, 255 P.3d 1240 (citations and quotations omitted). In determining whether a district court\u2019s findings of fact are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>clearly erroneous, we consider whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence, whether the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or whether this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves it with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, \u00b6 27, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b611 \u201cWe review allegations of prosecutorial error de novo, \u2018considering the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in the context of the entire proceeding.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019State v. Roundstone, </em>2011 MT 227, \u00b6 13, 362 Mont. 74, 261 P.3d 1009 (quoting <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2005 MT 129, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 228, 115 P.3d 182).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err when it denied Roger\u2019s motion to suppress statements he made to police outside his house?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b613 Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution, no person can be compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal case. <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 402, 66 P.3d 297. The U.S. Supreme Court held in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), that a prosecutor may not use statements that stem from the custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the defendant has been warned, prior to questioning, that he has the right to remain silent, to have an attorney present, and that any statements he makes may be used as evidence against him. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612. <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings are not required to be given by law enforcement unless a person is subject to a custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270 (citing <em>State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 30, 295 Mont. 212, 983 P.2d 916). One is fin custody\u201d when his freedom of action has been deprived in any significant way or if his \u2018freedom of action has been curtailed to a degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 30).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b614 Roger concedes that his initial statements, set forth below, were spontaneous and that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was not necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">Roger: Goin\u2019 out of her mind. I slapped her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">Dep. Marble: Do you have any weapons on ya\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">Roger: Oh, no, no, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">Dep. Marble: Okay. Just turn around and just let me check real quick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Roger: I was gonna call you guys and my niece says, \u2018Don\u2019t call. We\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d And what does she do? She calls you, that\u2019s how much of talking she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Dep. Marble: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Roger: I\u2019m not the troublemaker here ... my sister is totally gone, totally gone .... I\u2019ve been living with her for five months now and I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to deal with it. But... today she ... comes in my room. Sh, two big books of mine, she starts throwin\u2019 \u2018em at me. And I got, she won\u2019t deny it, I hope. And then and I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to hold her down, she scratches the shit outta me. I slapped her. All because I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to a guy that called me about her business line, the, the guy is tryin\u2019 to do his job. He\u2019s a computer wiz, one of these geeks, you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">Dep. Marble: Mm Hmm (indicating <em>\u201cyes\u201d).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">Roger: He\u2019s tryin\u2019 to do his job and because I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to the guy, she doesn\u2019t want, she, she\u2019s gettin\u2019 all upset. She\u2019s gone nuts. She starts throwin\u2019 books at me. And ... I\u2019ve got evidence on this because the guy\u2019s listening to it the whole thing .... The guy is beside himself. I says, \u2018Listen, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Roger asserts that the officers should have administered a <em>Miranda </em>warning right at this point because they started asking questions, and he was then in custody. Because the officers did not administer a warning until later, he argues the warning was untimely and insufficient and that all statements he made after Deputy Marble\u2019s first question, including those statements he made after waiving his Miranda rights, should be suppressed pursuant to <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S. Ct. 2601 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">\u00b615 In <em>Seibert, </em>the police purposely employed a \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201d technique whereby they interrogated the defendant until she confessed, then provided a Miranda warning and re-questioned her, recording both the <em>Miranda </em>warning and her post <em>-Miranda </em>confession. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 604-05, 124 S. Ct. at 2606. The Supreme Court held this practice violated the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination and affirmed the Missouri Supreme Court\u2019s suppression of both the pre- and post <em>-Miranda </em>confessions. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 606-07, 617, 124 S. Ct. at 2606-607, 2613.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">\u00b616 The State responds that Roger was not in custody, and therefore no <em>Miranda </em>warning was required. The State also offers that Roger\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>statements were not the product of an improper \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201d technique because the officers were merely attempting to listen to Roger\u2019s side of the story to determine what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>happened, rather than interrogate him to elicit a confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b617 The remaining pr <em>e-Miranda </em>statements Roger claims should be suppressed were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Dep. Marble: Right. When she threw the books at you, did she hit you with the books or ...?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">Roger: No, they glanced, they did went by me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Dep. Marble: Okay. And where did this take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Roger: In my room. I\u2019m watchin\u2019 ... my computer screen, she\u2019s cornin\u2019 in and the phone rings.

I don\u2019t want you to talk to him.\u201d ... \u2018Well, I\u2019m gonna talk to him.\u201d Well, that did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">Dep. Marble: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">Roger: That did it. You know, she just went, she went bananas, she, totally out of it. She was frantic, I mean, she was between scratchin\u2019 my face and my arms .... She was tryin\u2019 to do everything. I held her down but I mean, she was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">Dep. Marble: What do you mean by you \u2018held her down?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">Roger: On the bed, ... I had her on the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\">Dep. Marble: And how did she end up getting to the bed? She threw some books at you, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-14\">Roger: Oh, no, no. I took her and I put her on the bed tryin\u2019 to hold her down. She was goin\u2019 crazy. She was scratchin\u2019 me, tryin\u2019 to grab me. She\u2019s got nails, I don\u2019t know what but, uh, she, uh, so I got her on the bed, holdin\u2019 her down. I said, Hey, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, don\u2019t, that\u2019s enough,\u201dyou know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-15\">Dep. Marble: Did you make any threats while you were holding her down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-16\">Roger: Yes, I did; I fuckin\u2019 told her, \u2018You, you knock this shit out or I\u2019ll fuckin\u2019 kill ya\u2019.\u201d...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-17\">Dep. Marble: And how were you holding her down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-18\">Roger: Her arms, arms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-19\">Dep. Marble: On her upper arms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-20\">Roger: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-21\">Dep. Marble: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-22\">Sgt. Hudson: Probably a pretty good time to [give a <em>Miranda </em>warning] .... (at which time a warning was given)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-23\">The first step in the analysis is to determine whether Roger was in custody. This question is considered \u201con a case-by-case basis and focuses on whether a \u2018reasonable person\u2019 would feel free to leave,\u201d examining six factors. <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Dawson, </em>\u00b6 33). The factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>are: (1) place of the interrogation; (2) time of the interrogation; (3) persons present during the interrogation; (4) whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were gratuitously given;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (5) the length and mood of the interrogation; and (6) whether or not the suspect was arrested following the interrogation. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 59 (citing <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b618 Applying these factors, the contact between Roger and the officers occurred in the driveway of Roger\u2019s home, which is located in a rural part of Ravalli County. The officers pulled up to a gate at the foot of the driveway. A fence surrounded the house. Roger voluntarily exited the house and walked through the gate to meet the officers. The time was 2:20 on a Friday afternoon. The persons present were Roger, Deputy Marble, and Sgt. Hudson. After Roger made several inculpatory statements, Deputy Marble administered a <em>Miranda </em>warning to Roger. Roger acknowledged that he understood his rights and said T don\u2019t have a problem talking to you.\u201d Roger then reiterated that he had threatened and slapped his sister. The length of the conversation was approximately 15 minutes long, and the record reflects that both officers spoke calmly and respectfully. While Roger was also cooperative and respectful, his comments reflected his agitation. Finally, Roger was arrested at the end of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b619 The District Court held that all of the factors, except for factor six, Roger\u2019s arrest at the end of the interview, favored a determination that Roger was not in custody during the interview, and therefore, a Miranda warning was not necessary. The District Court noted that Roger made the first contact by voluntarily exiting the house, going through the gate, and meeting the officers in the driveway. It reasoned that Ta]s to the six questions [Roger] was asked prior to being Mirandized, all but one were asked to clarify [Roger]\u2019s previous statements\u201d and that the officers did not badger, intimidate, or threaten Roger. The District Court concluded that the facts were distinguishable from those in <em>Seibert, </em>where the defendant was clearly in custody, having been arrested and transported to the police station prior to being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b620 Roger argues that he did not pick the time or the place of the interview and that the officers were armed and in uniform, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>would make a reasonable person feel intimidated. However, as the District Court noted, Roger chose to engage the officers before they had a chance to say anything to him, and they acted respectfully, without any threatening language. In fact, Roger said, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s a nice looking gun ... I love guns but I can\u2019t have \u2018em\u201d-h.ardly an indication he was intimidated by the officers\u2019 weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b621  The circumstances surrounding Roger\u2019s statement were clearly dissimilar to those in <em>Seibert. </em>We agree with the District Court that all of the factors except for Roger\u2019s arrest weigh in favor of a determination that Roger was not in custody at the time he talked with the officers and that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was not necessary at any earlier point. <em>See Reavley, </em>\u00b6 18. The District Court correctly denied Roger\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he made to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"Av5\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did the District Court err by overruling Roger\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement during closing argument?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b623 TAJlthough counsel may comment on the burden of proof as it relates to facts presented in trial, it may not go outside the record or misrepresent the law as instructed by the judge.\u201d <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2000 MT 379, \u00b6 40, 303 Mont. 507, 16 P.3d 391 (citation omitted). In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s statement requires reversal, we first examine whether the comments were improper. <em>State v. Kolb, </em>2009 MT 9, \u00b6 10, 349 Mont. 10, 200 P.3d 504; <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 51, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444. If so, we then determine whether the comments prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>Kolb, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 51). Statements made during arguments are considered in the context of the entire argument. <em>State v. Roubideaux, </em>2005 MT 324, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 521, 125 P.3d 1114 (citing <em>State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 37, 290 Mont. 97, 966 P.2d 721, <em>State v. Hart, </em>191 Mont. 375, 384, 625 P.2d 21, 26 (1981)). \u00b624 Roger argues the following statement by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument was prejudicial and violated his right to a fair and impartial trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">[Prosecutor]: The standard of beyond a reasonable doubt is in your Jury Instruction No. 3, \u201cof such convincing character that a reasonable person would rely and act upon it in the most important of his or her own affairs,\u201d the third numbered paragraph. \u2018The most important of his or her own affairs.\u201dLet me suggest another that I believe is one of our most important affairs, and that\u2019s caring for our children. With what you know, would you hire him as a baby[sitter]? That\u2019s another way to look at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alq\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor, that\u2019s not an accurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>statement of the burden of proof. It relies on fears about somebody, not ration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">The Court: Well, it\u2019s final argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">[Prosecutor]: Thank you. Given that, what I\u2019m asking you to do is to tell this defendant that what he did was unacceptable. And the way we say that, the only way a jury can say it, is by saying the word guilty to the aggravated assault and guilty to the family member assault, the lesser crime of family member assault....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP\">Roger argues that by tying the concept of reasonable doubt to whether jurors would hire Roger as a babysitter, the prosecutor violated Roger\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial by making reasonable doubt something akin to any doubt or the slightest doubt. He argues that Tp]arents do not reject or fire a babysitter if beyond a reasonable doubt that person is bad. Parents terminate or refuse to employ a babysitter if the <em>slightest </em>possibility exists that the person is bad. A slight doubt about a person is all that\u2019s needed for a parent to keep them away from their child(ren). The prosecutor turned reasonable doubt on its head ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b625 The State argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper but, even if it was, the jury instructions made clear that the jury was to take the law only from the court, and not counsel. The State reasons that if the jury had misunderstood the concept of reasonable doubt and thought it was something less than what was instructed, then the jury surely would have convicted Roger of aggravated assault instead of acquitting him of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b626 The District Court instructed the jury that \u2018tp]roof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would rely and act upon it in the most important of his or her own affairs. Beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean beyond any doubt or beyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b627 It is improper for a prosecutor to misstate the law. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-54; <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 40. The prosecutor argued that the jurors deciding whether to leave their children in the defendant\u2019s care was an example of one of \u201cthe most important of his or her own affairs\u201d referenced in Jury Instruction 3, the reasonable doubt instruction. To the extent that this statement would be considered improper, we would then determine whether the statement was prejudicial to Roger\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b628 The jury was also instructed that \u2018ty]ou should take the law in this case from my instructions alone. You should not accept anyone else\u2019s version as to what the law is in this case ... Counsel, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>may comment and argue to the jury upon the law as given in these instructions ....\u201d The jury members were able to take a copy of the judge\u2019s jury instructions to the deliberation room with them. \u201cAmerican jurisprudence depends on a jury's ability to follow instructions.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 57. \u2018It is a well recognized principle of law that juries are presumed to follow the law as given them.\u201d <em>State v. Turner, </em>262 Mont. 39, 55, 864 P.2d 235, 245 (1993) (citations omitted). \u00b629 [2] We conclude that Roger has not rebutted the presumption that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions nor demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s statement. <em>See Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 58. The comment was brief, and the prosecutor did not return to this theme following the objection. The statement was made in argument, and the jury received and took with them the instruction requiring that they take the law from the court only.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b630 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> We clarified in <em>State v.
