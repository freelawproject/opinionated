Scheanette claimed that the denial of televisions to death row inmates violated his federal constitutional rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). He also raised state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Dismissals made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A are reviewed de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). As Scheanette has no constitutional right to watch television and because watching television is not a life necessity or a basic human need, his Eighth Amendment and retaliation claims were properly dismissed. <em>See O\u2019Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, </em>482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987); <em>McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 581 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Montana v. Commissioners Court, </em>659 F.2d 19, 23 (5th Cir. Unit A Sept.1981). Moreover, his equal protection claim fails because inmates with different housing classifications are not similarly situated. <em>See Martin v. Scott, </em>156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Mayabb v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 863, 870 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-16\">Scheanette fails to show that the fact that he is a death row inmate renders him disabled within the meaning of the ADA. <em>See Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, Texas, </em>118 F.3d 421, 428 (5th Cir. 1997); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2). Finally, because the district court properly dismissed all of Scheanette\u2019s federal claims, the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his supplemental state law claims was not an abuse of discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. <em>See Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., </em>180 F.3d 234, 246 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-17\">Scheanette\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1915(g). Scheanette has accumulated at least two other strikes. <em>See Scheanette v. Curry, </em>196 Fed.Appx. 302 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Scheanette v. Thomas, </em>No. 4:05-CV-208 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 8, 2005), <em>aff'd, </em>182 Fed. Appx. 345 (5th Cir.2006). As he has at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996); \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
