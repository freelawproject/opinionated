On appeal, Wilson argues that the Board violated and continues to violate his due process and <em>ex post facto </em>rights by holding parole hearings for him only every eight years, even though, at the time his crimes of conviction were committed, the law required that such hearings be held every year once the prisoner had served seven years\u2019 incarceration. Wilson relies heavily on <em>Akins v. Snow, </em>922 F.2d 1558 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Subsequently, however, the U.S. Supreme Court issued decisions holding that new parole procedures that decrease the frequency of parole reconsideration hearings did not necessarily violate prisoners\u2019 <em>ex post facto </em>rights. <em>See California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 501-02, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 1599, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995); see <em>also Garner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 256-57, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 1370-71, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000) (addressing the Georgia rule at issue in the instant case). We have acknowledged that the Supreme Court has overruled <em>Akins. Swan v. Ray, </em>293 F.3d 1252, 1253 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Wilson has argued only that the rule change facially constitutes an <em>ex post facto </em>violation, an argument that is contrary to the applicable law. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
