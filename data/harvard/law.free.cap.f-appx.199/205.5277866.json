The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Powell has not made the requisite showing. In addition, the court limits its review to the issues raised in Appellant\u2019s informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). This court generally does not consider issues raised for the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (noting that issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally not considered absent exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
