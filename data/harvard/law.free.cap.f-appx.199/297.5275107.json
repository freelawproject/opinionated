Memah specifically states that he does not challenge the denial of asylum and CAT relief. Rather, he contests only the denial of withholding of removal, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the IJ and Board failed to address his claim that he suffered past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-21\">As our review discloses that this claim has not in fact been addressed below, we grant the petition for review and remand this matter to the Board for a determination of Memah\u2019s past persecution claim in the context of his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>- U.S. -, -, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 1615, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006); <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-25\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
