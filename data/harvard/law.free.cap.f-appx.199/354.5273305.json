Portillo-Vela now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>court erred in enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because his prior sexual assault conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(b)(4) did not constitute a crime of violence. Because we agree that Portillo-Vela\u2019s prior conviction did not constitute a crime of violence, we VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a sixteen-level upward adjustment for an illegal-entry defendant with a prior conviction for a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). An offense qualifies as a crime of violence if it includes an element of force or constitutes an enumerated offense. <em>Id. </em>cmt. (n.1(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>United States v. Luciano-Rodriguez, </em>442 F.3d 320 (5th Cir.2006), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>2006 WL 2235104 (5th Cir. Aug.3, 2006), we held that because Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(1) defines sexual assault to include those offenses, such as here, where \u201cassent is rendered a legal nullity by the statute,\u201d a conviction under \u00a7 22.011(a)(1) is not a forcible sex offense and thus not a crime of violence. <em>Luciano-Rodriguez, </em>442 F.3d at 322; <em>see also United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336 (5th Cir.2004). Because we find no distinction between this case and <em>Luciano-Rodriguez, </em>we conclude that PortilloVela\u2019s prior conviction did not constitute a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Therefore, we VACATE Portillo-Vela\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
