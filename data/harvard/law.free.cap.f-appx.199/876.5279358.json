He argues that the district court abused its discretion by finding, without holding an evidentiary hearing, that prison officials were complying with an extant injunction to provide Brown adequate medical care. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b901-17\">Brown suffers from HIV, Hepatitis C, and a skin disorder. In 2003, Brown filed an action against his doctor and the Medical Administrator for the Georgia State Prison for their alleged deliberate indifference to Brown\u2019s serious medical needs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. After this Court reinstated Brown\u2019s complaint following its dismissal, <em>see Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344 (11th Cir.2004), the district court entered a preliminary injunction that required prison officials to provide Brown with \u201cproper medical treatment for his HIV, Heptatis C, and skin disorder.\u201d The district court enjoined the prison officials to (1) transport Brown to Augusta State Medical Prison to be seen by Dr. Presnell; (2) provide Brown with his prescribed HIV and Hepatitis C medications, Benadryl and Dove soap for his skin condition, and any other necessary medicine; and (3) provide Brown with any other care or treatments recommended by specialists or other physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-18\">In June 2005, Brown filed a motion for a second preliminary injunction that requested the same relief as his first motion for an injunction. Brown accused the prison officials of continuing to deny proper medication and treatment, and the prison officials responded that they were in compliance with the extant injunction. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>prison officials filed an affidavit by Dr. Tommy Lee Jones who averred that his clinic provided holistic care for Brown and that Brown received all the medication he had been prescribed. The prison officials also submitted Brown\u2019s medical records, which corroborated Jones\u2019s affidavit. The district court denied Brown\u2019s motion for an injunction. Over the next few months, Brown continued to move for more preliminary injunctions based upon his earlier contentions that the defendants were not complying with the preliminary injunction entered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">On February 1, 2006, the district court denied Brown\u2019s third motion for an injunction, which had been filed on January 28, 2006. Brown renewed his motion for a preliminary injunction the same day and, later that month, filed a notice of appeal. Because Brown mailed his notice of appeal before the district court could deny his February 1, 2006 motion, we consider his appeal to be from the denial of his January 28, 2006 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Two standards of review are relevant to this appeal. First, we review a denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Sierra Club v. Georgia Power Co., </em>180 F.3d 1309, 1310 (11th Cir.1999). Second, we review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Williams v. Best Buy Co., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Brown argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion without granting Brown an evidentiary hearing. We disagree. Whether we construe Brown\u2019s motion as a motion for a successive preliminary injunction or as a motion to hold the defendants in contempt, Brown\u2019s appeal fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Brown\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction to enforce an earlier injunction. \u201c[T]he proper method of enforcing [an injunction] is <em>not </em>a \u2018motion to enforce\u2019 or similar plea for the court to \u2018do something\u2019 about a violation of the [injunction].\u201d <em>Thomason v. Russell Corp., </em>132 F.3d 632, 634 n. 4 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cPrecedent dictates that a plaintiff seeking to obtain the defendant\u2019s compliance with the provisions of an injunctive order move the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to show cause why he should not be held in contempt and sanctioned for his noncompliance.\u201d <em>Wyatt v. Rogers, </em>92 F.3d 1074, 1078 n. 8 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Even if we were to construe Brown\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion for a preliminary injunction liberally, <em>see Jackson v. Reese, </em>608 F.2d 159, 160 (5th Cir.1979), and treat it as a motion for the district court to order that prison officials show cause as to why they should not be held in civil contempt, Brown\u2019s appeal would fail because we would lack jurisdiction to review it. Our jurisdiction extends to appeals from a limited class of interlocutory orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, but that class does not include an order denying a motion for civil contempt. \u201c[T]he denial of a motion for civil contempt may only be appealed after the conclusion of the principal action rather than in its course.\u201d <em>New York State Urban Development Corp. v. VSL Corp., </em>738 F.2d 61, 64 (2d Cir.1984). <em>Cf. Combs v. Ryan\u2019s Coal Co., Inc., </em>785 F.2d 970, 976 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cGenerally a finding of civil contempt is not reviewable on interlocutory appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">The denial of Brown\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
