Ramirez Canon, and Blanca Liria Canon Villalobos are natives and citizens of Colombia, S.A. On December 19, 2002, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) granted petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum and withholding of removal. According to the IJ, Petitioners suffered persecution at the hands of the FARC \u201con account of imputed political opinion.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). On May 20, 2004, the BIA issued an order concluding that Petitioners failed to satisfy the burden of proving eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) and ordered Petitioners\u2019 removal. The BIA therefore sustained the Department\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">Petitioners did not petition this court to review the BIA\u2019s May 20, 2004 order. Instead, they filed a timely motion with the BIA to reconsider its order. The BIA denied the motion on October 28, 2004. On June 8, 2005, this court summarily affirmed the BIA\u2019s October 28, 2004 decision. <em>Ramirez v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>No. 04-16158-BB (11th Cir. June 8, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">On January 13, 2006, Petitioners moved the BIA to reopen the case pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c), on the basis of new evidence in the form of two statements that described the \u201ccontinuing and present danger\u201d they would face if returned to Colombia. On February 15, 2006, the BIA denied the motion to reopen as untimely. It found in addition that Petitioners had failed to demonstrate that an exception to the time limit applied. On March 16, 2006, Petitioners filed the petition before us in this case, seeking review of the BIA\u2019s February 15, 2006, order denying their motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">Petitioners contend that the BIA erred in failing to uphold the IJ\u2019s finding that they had suffered persecution for their political opinion at the hands of the FARC. In response, the Attorney General argues that (1) we lack jurisdiction to review the May 20 decision because Petitioners failed to file a timely petition for review, and (2) Petitioners abandoned their claims as to the February 15 order be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>cause they raise no arguments concerning it in their brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Issues that are not raised on appeal are abandoned. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2003) (stating that the respondent abandoned his CAT claim because he did not raise it in his brief on appeal). We review whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a direct petition for review in an immigration case is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)). A motion to reopen filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); <em>cf. Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549 (holding that the finality of a BIA order is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Petitioners\u2019 petition for review should have been filed by June 21, 2004, to timely appeal the BIA\u2019s May 20, 2004, order reversing the IJ\u2019s order granting them asylum and withholding of removal. Petitioners petitioned us for review of the BIA\u2019s decision on March 16, 2006. Thus, their petition is untimely as to the BIA\u2019s May 20, 2004, decision. Accordingly, to the extent Petitioners argue on appeal that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s findings, we lack jurisdiction to consider those arguments, and that portion of their petition for review is dismissed. Our scope of review is limited to the BIA\u2019s February 15, 2006, denial of their motion to reopen. However, Petitioners make no arguments in their brief regarding the motion to reopen. By failing to argue this issue in his brief, Petitioners have abandoned it. Accordingly, we deny Petitioners\u2019 petition for review with regard to the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
