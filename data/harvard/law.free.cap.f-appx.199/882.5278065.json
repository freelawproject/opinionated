Because Strobele\u2019s 120-month statutory minimum sentence exceeded the applicable Guideline range, the district court first applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), under which the Guideline range became the statutory minimum 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, before departing downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">On appeal, Strobele argues that the district court erred in concluding that the Guideline range was the statutory minimum sentence, as opposed to the lesser range found in the Guidelines sentencing table, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that <em>Booker </em>invalidated our opinion in <em>United States v. Head, </em>178 F.3d 1205 (11th Cir.1999), in which we held that the appropriate starting point for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 departure when a defendant faces a statutory minimum sentence was not the applicable Guideline range, but rather the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Under our precedent, we must reject Strobele\u2019s argument. <em>\u201cPost-Booker, </em>we continue to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines just as we did <em>pre-Booker: </em>The district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to de novo review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUe\">[Ajfter <em>Booker, </em>the district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing. This consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines: After <em>Booker, </em>the Federal Sentencing Guidelines remain an essential consideration in the imposition of federal sentences, albeit along with the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). A sentencing court under <em>Booker </em>still must consider the Guidelines, and, such consideration necessarily requires the sentencing court to calculate the Guidelines sentencing range in the same manner as before <em>Booker. </em>In other words, as was the case before <em>Booker, </em>the district court must calculate the Guidelines range accurately. A misinterpretation of the Guidelines by a district court effectively means that the district court has not properly consulted the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-15\"><em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b), \u201c[wjhere a statutorily required minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>sentence is greater than the m\u00e1ximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d Moreover, a court has only limited authority, \u201c[u]pon motion of the Government, ... to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">In <em>Head, </em>we held that when a defendant faces a statutory minimum sentence, the appropriate starting point for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 departure is the statutory minimum sentence, not the otherwise applicable Guideline range. 178 F.3d at 1208. Specifically, we noted that \u201cthe Guidelines do not contemplate a downward departure for substantial assistance until after the court applies section 5G 1.1(b), which establishes that the applicable guideline sentence shall be the mandatory minimum sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, a court is to apply \u00a7 5G 1.1(b) before departing downward, pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, we have stated that a \u201cdistrict court was, and still is, bound by the statutory minimums.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005). Finally, we have concluded that \u201cBooker does not render application of individual guideline provisions advisory because the district court remains obligated correctly to calculate the Guidelines range pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1).\u201d <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
