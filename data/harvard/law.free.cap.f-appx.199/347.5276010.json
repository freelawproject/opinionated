STEWART, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Plaintiff-Appellant Kelli Barrett Fitch (\u201cFitch\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Defendant-Appellee Norman D. Morrow\u2019s (\u201cMorrow\u201d) motion for summary judgment. Additionally, she requests that this court overrule its well-established \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine and ultimately determine that Morrow was not entitled to qualified immunity. We decline to do so; therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Fitch and her husband initially brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in state distriet court in Harris County, Texas, on April 19, 2002, claiming that an arrest warrant applied for by Morrow and issued for Fitch failed to particularly describe the person for whom probable cause existed, as required by the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. U.S. Const, amend. IV. They alleged negligence and slander claims arising out of her arrest based on mistaken identity. The suit was originally filed against PS Texas Holdings, LTD (d/ b/a Public Storage), but Morrow was added in Fitch\u2019s second amended petition on January 16, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">The arrest warrant in question identified the subject as \u201cKelli Renee Barrett\u201d (Fitch) of Katy, Texas; however, the warrant should have been issued for another party, \u201cKelly Barrett.\u201d Therefore, Fitch states that Morrow\u2019s arbitrary selection of her as the intended target of the arrest warrant was objectively unreasonable in light of the information readily available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">Morrow removed the case to federal court on May 19, 2003, and subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>filed a motion to dismiss. The district court granted the motion to dismiss reasoning that, assuming arguendo that Fitch\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights had been violated by an invalid arrest warrant for which Morrow had applied, Morrow was entitled to qualified immunity under current Fifth Circuit case law. Specifically, the district court stated that, \u201cPlaintiffs have not alleged that Morrow intentionally withheld or misrepresented any information in his sworn application for warrant .... [they] clearly alleged only that Morrow was negligent .... [therefore, Plaintiffs complaint shows on its face that it is barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On February 20, 2004, Fitch moved for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order, requesting that it review its holding that the issuance of a warrant by a neutral and detached magistrate breaks the causal chain between an officer\u2019s application and a suspect\u2019s arrest. On the same day, Fitch also filed a third amended complaint, omitting her husband as a party, relinquishing her state law claims, and alleging \u201cconstitutional\u201d claims sounding in negligence. The district court responded, denying Fitch\u2019s request to hold the \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d theory unlawful; however, it found that the third amended complaint successfully stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">On December 7, 2004, Morrow filed a motion for summary judgment, stating that his subjective good faith, both independently and in conjunction with the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to issue the warrant for Fitch\u2019s arrest, broke the casual chain and protected him from liability under \u00a7 1983. The district court issued its final judgment on August 1, 2005, finding that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the information Morrow provided to the magistrate judge who issued the warrant for Fitch\u2019s arrest. It also held that Fitch did not provide sufficient evidence to indicate that Morrow tainted the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to sign the warrant. From the district court\u2019s judgment, Fitch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Freeman v. County of Bexar, </em>210 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and/or affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">B. Qualified Immunity and Clearly Established Law</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Fitch argues that this circuit\u2019s \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine is inconsistent with the element of causation enacted by Congress under \u00a7 1983 and Supreme Court precedent. This court has held that \u201can officer who acted with malice in procuring the warrant or the indictment will not be hable if the facts supporting the warrant or indictment are put before an impartial intermediary such as a magistrate or a grand jury, for that intermediary\u2019s independent decision breaks the causal chain and insulates the initiating party.\u201d <em>Hand v. Gary, </em>838 F.2d 1420, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1427 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, because Fitch asserts that the doctrine should be invalidated, in turn, she asserts that Morrow is not entitled to be shielded by qualified immunity. She also conclusively states that summary judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Morrow\u2019s conduct, however, is shielded by qualified immunity in light of clearly established law. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 210-11, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The clearly established law relied upon in applying the qualified immunity claim in this case is the \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine. Therefore, we must determine whether, \u201c[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, ... the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Measuring the objective reasonableness of Morrow\u2019s conduct in reference to the law regarding the \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine that clearly existed at the time of the conduct in question, we hold that in this case, Morrow\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable; his conduct did not violate Fitch\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Under the \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine, once \u201cfacts supporting an arrest are placed before an independent intermediary such as a magistrate or grand jury, the intermediary\u2019s decision breaks the chain of causation for false arrest, insulating the initiating party.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Gregg, </em>36 F.3d 453, 456 (5th Cir.1994) (internal citations omitted). The causal chain is not broken, however, \u201cif the plaintiff affirmatively shows that \u2018the deliberations of that intermediary were in some way tainted by the actions of the defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shields v. Twiss, </em>389 F.3d 142, 150 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Taylor, </em>36 F.3d at 456.). The \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine is \u201cfirmly ensconced circuit precedent\u201d that existed in 2000 when Morrow signed the probable cause affidavit and delivered the fruits of his investigation to the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office. This panel is bound by the holdings of prior panels of this circuit, including their decisions detailing the impact and law surrounding this doctrine. Therefore, because we continue to recognize the \u201cbreak in the causal chain\u201d doctrine, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to apply the qualified immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-11\">. The underlying warrant arose from activities surrounding the rental of a self-storage facility. Jesse Salazar rented a self-service storage unit in Houston, Texas, and listed \"Kelly Barrett\u201d as his alternate contact and co-renter on the face of the storage facility contract. Thereafter, the manager of the facility began noticing that Salazar and Barrett were acting suspiciously. After several tenants' items were stolen from numerous storage units, the manager contacted the Harris County Sheriff's Department for assistance. Based on interviews with the storage facility manager and a renter whose storage unit had been broken into and his items taken, Morrow searched via a Harris County computer search engine for matches in the Houston area for persons of the same name that matched Salazar and Barrett\u2019s physical descriptions, addresses, age, etc. Morrow\u2019s research led him to believe that Kelly Barrett was actually Kelli Renee Barrett (Fitch), even though the names were spelled differently. Eventually, Morrow signed a probable cause affidavit for her arrest and delivered it to the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s office for further processing. Fitch was arrested on May 1, 2001; however, it was later determined that she was not the same person listed on the rental agreement and, thus, she was released from jail. All of the records relating to Fitch\u2019s arrest and prosecution for the theft offenses were expunged and destroyed. Morrow has testified that he did not prepare the arrest warrant, meet with the magistrate judge that eventually signed the arrest warrant for Fitch, or personally arrest Fitch. Morrow also testified that he had no reason to believe that Kelly Barrett and Kelli Renee Barrett (Fitch) were not the same person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. We do not consider Fitch\u2019s concise and conclusory statement in her brief regarding summary judgment because she did not reference specific facts in the summary judgment record which demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact. She does not discuss the summary judgment issue in the body of her argument nor does she offer evidence to support a finding that summary judgment was improperly granted. Because she has failed to adequately raise or brief any claimed genuine issue of material fact, she has essentially abandoned this issue on appeal and waived this panel\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Morrow. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
