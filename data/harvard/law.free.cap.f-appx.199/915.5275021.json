On appeal, the government argues that (1) the district court erred by not applying an 8-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 based on Holder\u2019s admitted unlawful possession of 133 firearms, and (2) Holder\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. After careful review, we vacate Holder\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">Because the government objected to the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 2K2.1 enhancement below, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 812, 163 L.Ed.2d 639 (2005). Sentences imposed under an advisory Guidelines system are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, <em>\u201cBooker </em>did not affect 18 U.S.C. section 3742(f), which mandates remand of any case in which the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThus, whether the district court <em>misapplied </em>the Guidelines remains ... subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">The facts relevant to the government\u2019s sentencing claims are these. On July 1, 2005, Holden was charged with one count of possession of a machine gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o), and one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). He pled guilty to both counts and, in a written plea agreement, stipulated to the factual basis for the plea and agreed that the stipulated information would be used \u201cfor sentencing purposes.\u201d According to the Factual Basis provision in the plea agreement, on January 24, 2005, federal and local law enforcement agents executed a search, pursuant to a warrant, of his home. During the search, authorities discovered 133 firearms, none of which were registered to Holder, including a SWD Street sweeper 12-gauge with magazine drum, a silencer, a Colt AR-15 automatic rifle, and a Colt .45 caliber revolver that had been reported stolen. The Factual Basis also stated that Holder told the agents that he ingested three to four Oxycontin pills a day and spent $100 per day on his drug habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Holder a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B)(i), because he was a \u201cprohibited person,\u201d by virtue of his status as an unlawful user of or person addicted to a controlled substance (Oxycontin), in possession of the firearms. The PSI recommended the following adjustments: (1) an 8-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D), because of the number of firearms seized; (2) a 2-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because one of the firearms was reported stolen; and (3) a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). The PSI recommended that Holder had a criminal history category I, but noted that Holder was then facing charges in state court for trafficking in Oxycontin. The state court action was based on the Oxycontin seized in his home during the January 24, 2005 search that resulted in the federal gun charges. With an adjusted offense level of 27 and a criminal history category I, Holder faced a Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Holder filed the following objections to the PSI: (1) he challenged his status as a \u201cprohibited person\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B)(i); (2) he objected to the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D), for the amount of guns involved, arguing that some of the guns were not functional; and (3) he objected to the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) based on the fact that he did not know that one of the firearms was stolen. At the sentencing hearing, Holder further argued that although the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculations may have been correct, application of the range created an unduly harsh result.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">At the start of the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it intended to vary from the Guideline range because \u201c[wjell, it works with rendering an unjust result for sure, and I was just talking to the probation officer about that.\u201d The district court then asked the probation officer what would happen to the Guidelines range if it sustained Holder\u2019s objections (2) and (3). The probation officer responded that adjusting Holder\u2019s offense level from a 27 to a 17 would yield a range of 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, to which the district court responded it thought that range also was \u201ctoo harsh.\u201d The court then indicated: \u201cI\u2019m going to give the sentence that I think is fair regardless of how I calculate the Guidelines.\u201d The court further stated that, with respect to Holder\u2019s objection (1), there was \u201cno evidence before the court that, at the time he originally got those guns, he was a drug addict.\u201d It then sustained Holder\u2019s objection (2), noting \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend a whole lot of time analyzing this issue for this case. There\u2019s probably a good chance you can get me reversed if you appeal; but I can tell you, I\u2019m going to impose the sentence, whatev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>er the Guideline range is, whether I kept this in or not, I\u2019m going to impose a sentence I think is fair for this man and this man\u2019s history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">After sustaining objections (1) and (2), Holder\u2019s adjusted offense level was a 19. With a criminal history category I, the Guidelines range was 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court stated it was imposing a sentence of one year and one day because that was the sentence Holder deserved, \u201cwhatever the correct guideline range calculations turn out to be.\u201d In imposing sentence, the court stated that the PSI indicated only that authorities were aware that Holder \u201cwas a drug user and had a lot of guns.\u201d In response, the government argued that the warrant to search Holder\u2019s home was based on several undercover drug buys that were not pursued in an effort to preserve the informant, to which the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKo\">Of course, you could have stood up and said that before I imposed sentence. That might have made a difference on the sentence to me, even though it\u2019s not charged, that that\u2019s what made you all interested in him. That\u2019s a lot more serious than just being a drug user with guns in his house. If I had known that he was a distributor, that makes a big difference to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The district court nevertheless did not alter the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The district court then stated that it had considered the Guidelines range and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, in arriving at the sentence, had relied on the fact that Holder did not illegally obtain the firearms and had \u201cno criminal history to speak of.\u201d With regard to the PSI\u2019s statement concerning the pending state charges against Holder for Oxycontin trafficking, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-7\">I missed this. It\u2019s actually in the presentence report, trafficking Oxycontin. I think I was just thinking this was this case, because everything that\u2019s in here is really talking about this crime, do you see what I\u2019m saying, in the presentence report, but then it shows that there\u2019s a pending charge, released on bond, awaiting action. But then when I read everything underneath that, it\u2019s the federal crime, and I just didn\u2019t put two and two together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">The district court noted that Holder could face a more substantial sentence for his pending charges in state court, but again did not alter its sentence. At the conclusion of the hearing, the government objected to the Guidelines calculations and the overall reasonableness of the sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">First, the government argues that the district court erred by declining to increase Holder\u2019s base offense level by eight levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D), because, according to the undisputed facts of the factual basis for the plea agreement and the PSI, Holden was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d who unlawfully used, or was addicted to, a controlled substance while he possessed 133 firearms. Section 2K2.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines sets the base offense level for prohibited transactions involving firearms. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a) (Nov. 2004). Section 2K2.1(a)(6) provides for an enhanced offense level of 14 if the defendant \u201cwas a prohibited person at the time the defendant committed the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). Section 2K2.1(b)(1)(D), in turn, provides for an 8-level enhancement to a defendant\u2019s offense level if the offense involved 100 to 199 firearms. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D) (Nov.2004). In determining the number of firearms under the forgoing provision, the district court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>count only those guns \u201cthat were unlawfully sought to be obtained, unlawfully <em>possessed, </em>or unlawfully distributed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, (n.6) (emphasis added). The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1 defines a \u201cprohibited person\u201d by reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 922(n), and therefore includes a person \u201cwho is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Here, based on the <em>uncontested </em>facts before the district court, in calculating the Guidelines range, the court erred by failing to impose the 8-level enhancement for the 133 firearms that Holder unlawfully possessed. Holder admitted in his plea agreement that he used Oxycontin daily, and that the federal and local agents who executed the search warrant at his home on January 24, 2005 seized 133 firearms. Accordingly, the eight-level enhancement of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D) applied. The district court erred in its application of that section \u2014 and, accordingly, its calculation of the correct Guidelines range \u2014 because it considered only whether Holder was an Oxycontin addict when he <em>acquired </em>the firearms, rather than when he <em>possessed </em>them. To support the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6), we have required the government to show \u201cthe defendant was an \u2018unlawful user\u2019 of a controlled substance during the same time period as the firearm possession.\u201d <em>United States v. Edmonds, </em>348 F.3d 950, 953 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, the inquiry is not limited to whether Holder was an \u201cunlawful person\u201d when he acquired the firearms, as the district court\u2019s analysis suggested, but rather the inquiry should also encompass a consideration of whether holder was an \u201cunlawful user\u201d of a controlled substance at the same time that he possessed the 133 firearms found at his house. Based on the factual statement supporting Holder\u2019s plea agreement with the government, it is <em>clear </em>that the enhancement applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">The district court also expressed its own personal disagreement with the outcome of a correctly calculated Guidelines range, which it thought was \u201ctoo harsh,\u201d and indicated it was imposing a sentence of one year and one day because that was the sentence Holder deserved, \u201cwhatever the correct guideline range calculations turn out to be.\u201d After <em>Booker, </em>the district court remains obligated to consult and <em>correctly calculate </em>the Guidelines, although they now are only advisory. <em>McVay, </em>447 F.3d at 1353; <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cIt is only after a district court correctly calculates the Guidelines range, which it still must do after Booker, that it may consider imposing a more severe or more lenient sentence.\u201d <em>McVay, </em>447 F.3d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">The district court\u2019s foregoing errors\u2014 not applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(D) enhancement and considering its own personal disagreement with the correctly calculated range \u2014 resulted in an adjustment to the Guidelines range from 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment to 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district judge then proceeded to impose a sentence far below the lowest end of even the incorrectly calculated range, stating only that she had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that she was \u201cgiving [Holder] a chance. I\u2019m a great believer in people being able to turn their lives around.\u201d <em>Cf. McVay, </em>447 F.3d at 1357 (observing that \u201cwhen imposing a sentence falling far outside of the Guidelines range, based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u2018[a]n extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>On remand, because Holder <em>admitted </em>to all of the underlying facts necessary to enhance his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D) \u2014 and, thus, the government\u2019s evidence at sentencing was uncontested on this point \u2014 the district court shall apply the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(D) enhancement, thereby yielding an advisory range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. It then may impose \u201ca more severe or more lenient sentence\u201d based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">. The government also argues that Holder\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. Because the district court imposed sentence while working from an incorrectly calculated Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>range and we must remand on that basis, we leave it to the district court to consider in the first instance whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrant a departure from the correctly calculated range of 70 to 87 months' imprisonment. We decline to reach the question of reasonableness at this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
