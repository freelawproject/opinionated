Chestnut (\u201cChestnut\u201d), a Florida state prisoner serving a 270-month sentence for sexual battery on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>a person 12 years of age or older but less than 18 years old, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>federal habeas petition, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. On appeal, Chestnut argues that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object on hearsay grounds to the inadmissible testimony of the victim\u2019s mother, the victim\u2019s friend, and a pediatric nurse falls below an objective standard of reasonableness, was deficient performance, and was a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Chestnut also argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance while cross-examining the victim by \u201copening the door\u201d to highly prejudicial and otherwise inadmissible evidence of uncharged collateral sexual misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination as to whether the standard for granting a \u00a7 2254 petition has been met. <em>Van Poyck v. Florida Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>290 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2002). Where a state prisoner\u2019s claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal courts may only grant habeas relief where the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\u201cThe \u2018contrary to\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are separate bases for reviewing a state court\u2019s decisions.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1519, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if (1) the court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the United States Supreme Court on a question of law, or (2) the court confronts facts that are \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from relevant Supreme Court precedent, but arrives at an opposite result from that arrived at by the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of federal law occurs when the state court either (1) correctly identifies the legal rule from Supreme Court precedent but unreasonably applies the rule to the facts of the case, or (2) \u201cunreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In the instant case, the issue before us is not whether the state trial and appellate courts\u2019 decisions were \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law, but whether the decisions were \u201cunreasonable applications\u201d of federal law. The clearly established federal law on this issue is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under <em>Strickland, </em>for a movant to demonstrate whether counsel has provided ineffective assistance, he must show both (1) deficient performance by counsel and (2) a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s deficient performance affected the trial outcome. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. As to the performance prong, the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s performance is to be evaluated from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the alleged error and in light of all the circumstances, and the standard of review is highly deferential. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Moreover, the defendant bears the burden of proving that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms and that the challenged action was not sound strategy. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">As to the prejudice prong, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. In other words, \u201c[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. We have noted that both this Court and the Supreme Court \u201chave said that strategic choices are \u2018virtually unchallengeable.\u2019\u201d <em>Provenzano v. Singletary, 148 F.3d </em>1327, 1332 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). We have further explained that this is especially so \u201cwhere those decisions were made by experienced criminal defense counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient for failing to object to alleged hearsay testimony, Chestnut cannot show, absent the alleged hearsay testimony, that there was a reasonable probability that the trial\u2019s outcome would have been different. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. The jury heard detailed testimony from the victim on direct examination (1) identifying the defendant as Chestnut, and (2) stating that Chestnut had on two separate occasions inserted his finger inside her vagina. The victim also testified, over trial counsel\u2019s hearsay objection, that she had told a nurse that Chestnut had put his finger inside her vagina, and that the nurse had subsequently conducted a physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Regarding Chestnut\u2019s claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance during cross-examination by allowing in otherwise inadmissible evidence of collateral crimes, we conclude from the record that the district court did not err in finding that the state trial and appellate courts\u2019 rulings that counsel\u2019s decision was a reasonable tactical decision did not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The state trial court held an extensive evidentiary hearing during which trial counsel testified to the following: (1) he had 44 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney, (2) he had tried on average 30 or 40 trials per year, and (3) he thought it was important to cross-examine the victim in order to attack her credibility and discredit her testimony. Given that, under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>\u201cperformance\u201d prong, the standard of review is highly deferential, the state courts did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland </em>in finding that Chestnut had not met his burden of proving that trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient. <em>See </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Chestnut\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">.
