No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302 (2005)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In support of their asylum applications, Petitioners asserted that they were persecuted in the Congo because of Kubandi\u2019s leadership role in a political group called Christian Mission of Intercession for Change (\u201cCMIC\u201d). On appeal, the petitioners argue that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding as to Kubandi\u2019s testimony and that the IJ did not adequately consider the other evidence of persecution presented at the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In the case at bar, the BIA issued a decision in which it adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning regarding Kubandi\u2019s credibility without making additional findings. \u201cWe therefore review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Wei Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. See <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under this highly deferential test, we \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, 2.51 </em>F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cCredibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cA credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">At the evidentiary hearing on Kubandi\u2019s application, the IJ heard the testimony of Kubandi and his wife, and Kubandi submitted the following evidence, which the IJ noted in his order: \u201cthe Notice to Appear [# 1]; Notice of privilege of counsel and consequences of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum [# 2]; the respondent\u2019s 1-589 form [# 3]; respondent\u2019s filing of supplemental documents, un-tabbed and unnumbered [# 4]; Map of Democratic Republic of The Congo [# <em>5]; </em>Map of Africa [# 6]; and Medical Board of California information [# 7].\u201d After the hearing, the IJ made the following factual findings and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">The Court observed the testimony and demeanor of the respondent and finds that <em>he has not provided credible and consistent testimony. </em>His responses to questions were not logically forthcoming, straightforward, nor were they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>plausible, logically, or well connected. <em>Therefore, the court finds him to not be a credible witness. </em>The witness has failed to supply adequate evidence of the basis of his claims of torture and has provided photographs which appear to be altered. Additionally, the respondent has not supplied any information on the group ... which he claims to have founded that marched against the government of The Congo, and supplies instead photographs which appear to be altered and other material which does not appeal to be original. Foremost the respondent never testified that he was stabbed while in custody of the military, a fact that the Court cannot overlook, and which is most important to the respondent\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\">In the instant case, the respondent says he fears persecution or torture from the government of [the Congo]. However, I am not satisfied from the record that the respondent has met his burden of proof in establishing his claim for a grant of asylum is warranted. The respondent\u2019s fear in this case stems from his arrest in his country. However, he does not mention in his testimony today that he was stabbed with a military knife and completely omitted that testimony from his hearing today. This is not a matter that he would seemingly forget if in fact it did indeed happen. Further, the respondent has supplied copies of photographs and says that the originals are not available, however, upon close examination of these photographs recording his march against the government it appears that they have been altered by inserting various slogans and banners to bolster his testimony regarding his pretext. The respondent further states that he has no documents to support his testimony of the group he founded, has no original phonographs as he states his friend took the pictures and sent it on a disc.... The court simply does not believe this to be an original untouched photograph as the banners displayed in each photograph appeared to have been inserted into the photograph. There is a serious question as to whether the group that the respondent testified that he organized really exists? <em>There are no documents to establish that the group he calls \u201cMCIC\u201d ... ever existed and what little evidence the respondent submitted could have been created over any word processing computer. There are no \u201coffi</em>cial\u201d <em>pamphlets or other literature about this organization nor any reference to it within the Country Reports for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">As to the wife\u2019s testimony, and regarding the occasion of the alleged abuse at the hands of the soldiers (police?), the respondent\u2019s wife does not have any records to indicate that she ever saw a doctor or went to a hospital for any treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">In total, there is insufficient proof that the respondent did in fact suffer any alleged persecution from the hands of the Kabila regime. Given the evidence, or lack thereof, and as well what strongly appears to be altered photographs for which there are no originals to view, the Court finds that the evidence and the testimony of the respondent and his wife are not sufficient to establish his eligibility for a grant of asylum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">(emphasis added). Thus, the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was based primarily on two factors: (1) Kubandi did not provide \u201ccredible and consistent testimony\u201d and thus, was not a \u201ccredible witness,\u201d and (2) he failed to present sufficient corroborating evidence that the MCIC \u2014 again, his asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>application was based on his membership in this group \u2014 existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. See <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). The second prong of both the past-and future-persecution tests requires the applicant to show that the alleged persecution was \u201con account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing two-pronged tests for past and future persecution). Thus, to establish either type of persecution, the petitioner must show a causal connection between the persecution and the protected ground he asserts. The petitioner may establish this causal connection by \u201cpresenting specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutorily protected ground. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">An adverse credibility determination alone may be fatal to an asylum application. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, an adverse credibility finding does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by the applicant. <em>Id. </em>For a credibility finding to be dispositive, the IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After an adverse credibility finding is made, the applicant bears the burden of showing this decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. We have held that an IJ\u2019s concerns about the credibility of an applicant on \u201ckey elements of the claim,\u201d combined with the applicant\u2019s failure to rebut these with sufficient corroborating evidence and explanation, supported a finding that the applicant did not qualify for asylum. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1369 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Again, from our review of the order, the IJ enumerated two primary reasons for denying asylum: (1) Kubandi\u2019s lack of credibility, and (2) Kubandi\u2019s failure to provide credible corroborating evidence that the MCIC existed, or that Kubandi had founded the group, or that Kubandi had participated in MCIC-sponsored activities that led to his persecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>factors concerned the causal connection between the alleged persecution and the alleged statutorily protected ground (here, Kubandi\u2019s MCIC membership). Before finding that Kubandi was not credible, the IJ enumerated the corroborating evidence presented to him at the hearing. Contrary to Kubandi\u2019s argument that the IJ based his decision solely on an adverse credibility determination, our careful review of the record and parsing of the IJ\u2019s order reveals that the IJ not only did not believe Kubandi, but also was unpersuaded by the additional evidence Kubandi presented in corroboration of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">On this record, we cannot say the record compels us to a different conclusion than that of the IJ\u2019s \u2014 that is, Kubandi\u2019s evidence was insufficient to satisfy Kubandi\u2019s burden on the causal connection because he never established his membership in a statutorily protected group. Indeed, the IJ found, and our review of the record does not compel us to reach a different conclusion, that Kubandi had not established the existence of the MCIC group, let alone his membership in it. Simply put, Petitioners have not met their burden to show the IJ\u2019s decision, which was based not only on an adverse credibility determination but also on a lack of corroborating evidence, was not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\">. Because we find that Petitioners have not established a case for asylum under the INA, we do not consider whether they satisfied the higher standard for withholding of removal under the INA or relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. See <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-13\">. To the extent that the Petitioners challenge the manner in which the IJ conducted the asylum hearing, Petitioners did not raise this issue before the BIA and, accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the issue, as it is unexhausted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. Att'y. Gen. of U.S., 257 </em>F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\">. To the extent Kubandi raises arguments that exceed the IJ\u2019s reasoning for denying asylum, we are confined to reviewing the IJ's decision. <em>Cf. Wei Chen, </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1232, n. 4 (\"In his brief, Chen argues the merits of his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ, however, did not reach the merits of Chen\u2019s application, instead limiting his discussion to Chen\u2019s credibility. As a result, we are confined to reviewing the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.\u201d (citing <em>Gonzales v. </em>Thomas, - U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 1615, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (holding federal courts are not entitled to pass judgment on issues the agency did not address))).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
