We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">Popov asserts that he left Bulgaria because he was being persecuted for his political views. Specifically, he claims that he received threatening phone calls, was attacked in a local park, and had his office (located in his apartment building) ransacked by the Bulgarian mafia, acting in conjunction with the government. He attributes these violent acts to some twenty to twenty-five articles he wrote and published in small newspapers, exposing the mistreatment of Roma gypsies in Bulgaria. Although Popov wrote the articles in question from 1996 through 2000, the threats did not begin until mid 2000. Many of his personal papers (including his copies of the published articles) were destroyed when his office was raided. Popov fled to the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, then traveled to Mexico, eventually crossing the United States\u2019 border on January 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">Popov received a notice to appear before the IJ on January 31, 2001. The IJ denied his applications on November 3, 2005. In its own opinion on April 28, 2006, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Popov\u2019s appeal. Agreeing with much of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the BIA found that Popov could not sustain the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard of proof required for asylum much less the more stringent \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard required to withhold removal or recognize a CAT application. The BIA determined that Popov could not sufficiently link the violent acts perpetrated against him to the Bulgarian government or a group the government was unable or unwilling to control. Thus, Popov could not establish himself as a \u201crefugee\u201d for his asylum application; he could not show a clear probability of perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>eution for his withholding of removal application; and he could not demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured on his return to Bulgaria for his CAT application.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Insofar as the BIA adopts the reasoning of the IJ, this Court also reviews the decision of the IJ. <em>Id. </em>Here the BIA issued its own decision, but adopted some of the reasoning of the IJ. So both are reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir. 2004). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and affirm its decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18 (quoting <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1283-84) (quotations omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow us to \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">First, Popov contends that he meets the threshold definition of a \u201crefugee\u201d and is therefore entitled to asylum protection. He claims that he exposed Bulgaria\u2019s widespread discrimination against the Roma culture and was therefore persecuted by the Bulgarian mafia. He argues that because the IJ found him to be a credible witness, his testimony was sufficient to establish his status as a \u201crefugee.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">As a matter of discretion, an IJ may grant an alien asylum if he meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A refugee is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving refugee status, <em>see Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1284, and he can do so by showing that persecution is a \u201creasonable probability.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1217, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Thus, to merit asylum protection, the alien must offer specific and credible evidence under the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard to establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1287 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">We agree with the BIA that Popov has failed to meet his burden. He has not shown that he was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinions. Although his testimony may be credible, he cannot link the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>acts of violence committed against him to the Bulgarian government or any group that it is unable or unwilling to control. He cannot identify who actually threatened or assaulted him, preventing us from connecting his political views to the violent conduct. There is almost a four year gap between the first publication of Popov\u2019s articles and the attacks, discrediting his assertion that the two are linked. We find that the BIA\u2019s factual determination that Popov failed to sustain his burden of proof was reasonable and supported by the record. Popov\u2019s testimony was weak, and regardless of his credibility, it was in need of further corroboration. <em>Yang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA properly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Because Popov cannot sustain the lesser burden of proof required for his asylum application, he cannot withstand the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard attributed to both a withholding of removal and a CAT application. As to his request that removal be withheld, \u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of deportation must show a \u2018clear probability of persecution,\u2019 or that he will more likely than not be persecuted if deported. If an applicant is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Nkacoang v. INS, </em>83 F.3d 353, 355 (11th Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted). Thus, because Popov was not entitled to asylum, the denial of the withholding of removal was also proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Additionally, \u201c[i]n making out a claim under CAT, \u2018[t]he burden of proof is on the applicant ... to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2001)). We have previously held that where an applicant \u201cfailed to demonstrate a \u2018well-founded fear of persecution\u2019 sufficient to support an asylum claim, they likewise cannot establish \u2018torture\u2019 sufficient to warrant relief under CAT.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the CAT claim was properly' denied as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
