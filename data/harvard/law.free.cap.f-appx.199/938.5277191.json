The IJ found that Ocampo-Roncancio\u2019s asylum claim was time-barred and denied her requests for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and her claim for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). On appeal, Ocampo-Roncancio argues that: (1) her asylum application was improperly denied based on the INA\u2019s one-year time limitation for filing asylum applications, and (2) the IJ and the BIA erred by denying her application for withholding of removal based on her failure to establish her membership in a statutorily protected group. Ocampo-Roncancio urged that she was a member of a social group persecuted by the Cali Cartel by virtue of her refusal to transport cocaine, on behalf of the Cartel, from Colombia to the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We dismiss the petition in part for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">In the case at bar, the BIA issued a decision in which it adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning without making additional findings. \u201cWe therefore review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s.\u201d <em>Wei Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations using the substantial evidence test, meaning that we must affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted). In order to reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but <em>compels </em>it. <em>See Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002). We review questions of subject-matter jurisdiction and constitutional challenges in immigration proceedings <em>de novo. See Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (constitutional challenges); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 n. 5 (11th Cir.2003) (subject-matter jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">On appeal, Ocampo-Roncancio first argues that the IJ and the BIA erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>applying the one-year time limit for filing an asylum application. Ocampo-Roncancio arrived in the United States on February 3, 1999, but did not file her asylum petition under October 5, 2001. \u201cAn asylum application must be filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir. 2005); INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... <em>extraordinary circumstances </em>relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D) (emphasis added); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). The determination as to whether an alien can apply for asylum, however, is left <em>exclusively </em>to the Attorney General as \u201cfederal courts do not have jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s decision as to timeliness of such a request.\u201d <em>Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1217; <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (providing that \u201c[n]o court shall have the jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2) [the provision providing that the one-year time limit may be waived if extraordinary circumstances are demonstrated].\u201d); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">In <em>Fahim, </em>we held that although there is a \u201cpresumption favoring judicial review,\u201d we lack jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s extraordinary-circumstances determination because the specific statutory language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) demonstrates that Congress intended to bar such review. <em>See </em>278 F.3d at 1217-18. And, after passage of the REAL ID Act of 2005,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we again recognized that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) continues to \u201cdivest[] our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957 (quotations and citation omitted). Thus, it is beyond our jurisdiction to review the extraordinary-circumstances determination and we must dismiss the petition in part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Turning to Ocampo-Roncancio\u2019s challenge to the denial of her application for withholding of removal, she argues that the IJ and the BIA erred by finding that she did not suffer past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. She claims that if she returns to Colombia, she will be persecuted because she was constantly solicited by, and received death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>threats from, members of the Cali Cartel, even after she moved hours away from Bogota, but did not report the situation to the police because she feared for her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if she can show that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). The second prong of both the past and future-persecution tests requires the applicant to show that the alleged persecution was \u201con account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (discussing two-pronged tests for past and future persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, as well as the IJ\u2019s finding, that Ocampo-Roncancio did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution because she did not establish her membership in a statutorily protected group. To meet her burden, Ocampo-Roncancio claimed she was a member of a social group \u2014 persons who have been asked, but refused, to carry drugs on behalf of the Cali Cartel, from Colombia to the United States. The IJ said that he \u201ccould not find that an immutable characteristic exists to establish that [Ocampo-Oncancio] is a member of a particular social group.\u201d We recently considered whether an Colombian asylum applicant could establish refugee status based on his membership in a group of \u201cnoncriminal informants working against the Cali drug cartel.\u201d <em>Castillo Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2006). We observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">Congress did not directly speak on the issue of what constitutes a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d one of the five listed categories that qualify for refugee status or withholding of deportation, within the meaning of the INA. Accordingly, we must follow the BIA\u2019s determination that noncriminal informants working against the Cali cartel are not a social group under the INA unless the interpretation is unreasonable, i.e., arbitrary, capricious, or clearly contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYau\"><em>Id. </em>at 1196 (citations omitted). We found reasonable, for purposes of establishing the existence of a \u201csocial group\u201d within the meaning of the INA, the BIA\u2019s requirement of a \u201ccommon, immutable characteristic ... [that] is fundamental to [its members\u2019] individual identities or consciences\u201d \u2014 the very standard the IJ applied to Ocampo-Roncancio\u2019s application here. <em>Id. </em>at 1196-97 (citing <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233-34, 1985 WL 56042 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 447, 1987 WL 108943 (BIA 1987)). On this record, we can discern no legal error in the IJ\u2019s definition of a \u201csocial group,\u201d nor does the record compel reversing any of the IJ\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Based on Ocampo-Roncancio\u2019s failure to identify a statutorily protected social group, of which she was a member, the IJ did not err by denying the petition for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>deny the petition as to the withholding claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-12\">. Ocampo-Roncancio asserts no claim concerning the denial of CAT relief, although in her brief, she does mention that such relief was denied in laying out the underlying procedural history and facts. Accordingly, she is deemed to have abandoned any argument concerning the denial of CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that when an appellant fails to raise any challenge to the denial of CAT relief in her brief, that issue is abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\">. Pub. L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (REAL ID Act). After passage of the REAL ID Act, we have jurisdiction to review questions of law raised in the petition for review. <em>Tovar-Alvarez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 1350, 1351-52 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b964-7\">. As for Ocampo-Roncancio\u2019s argument that the one-year time limit violates the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, the Third Circuit recently rejected this very argument. <em>See Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 631-32 (3d Cir.2006). More specifically, the Third Circuit rejected the petitioners\u2019 argument, identical to the one made by Ocampo-Roncancio, that the one-year limit provided in \u00a7 1158(a)(2) conflicted with Article 34 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951 Convention). <em>Id. </em>at 631. The Third Circuit found no Supremacy Clause violation because: (1) Article 34 was not self-executing, and, thus, did not provide enforceable rights beyond those granted by the INA; and (2) the one-year limit was enacted after the 1951 Conventions and thus was \"last in time\u201d and, thus, overrode the 1951 Convention. <em>Id. </em>at 631-32 &amp; n. 3. We too can find no constitutional violation based on the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. The IJ also found that Ocampo-Roncanio presented no evidence that the Cali Cartel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ever attempted to harm her, but had threatened her only once after she stated that she would file a report with the police. In addition, Ocampo-Roncancio described telephone calls, during which the caller recruited her to engage in drug trafficking. Although the INA does not expressly define \"persecution,\" we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\" and \"[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations and citation omitted; alteration in original). In addition to our conelusion that the IJ did not err by finding no statutorily protected social group, we also observe that the record does not compel reversing the IJ's finding that the passage of over five years since Ocampo was solicited by the woman from the drug cartel suggested that Ocampo would not be contacted by the cartel in the future. Moreover, even assuming that Ocampo was called on the telephone by the drug cartel specifically because of her status as a person who refused to carry drugs to the United States, this treatment would not rise to the level of persecution under the INA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
