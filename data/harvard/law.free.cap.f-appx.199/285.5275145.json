Akhu contends the evidence did not support the negative credibility finding. She further contends she was denied a fair opportunity to present her case because the immigration judge ordered several continuances. Akhu also contends she was entitled to withholding from removal and withholding under the CAT. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2005). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that [s]he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004) (alteration added). To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that, if she was removed to her native country, her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); see <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004). An applicant has the burden of demonstrating her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005); <em>Gonahasa v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that there was enough evidence supporting the immigration judge\u2019s negative credibility finding. Accordingly, the evidence does not compel a different result with respect to Akhu\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">We further find Akhu was not denied a fair opportunity to present her case. Akhu agreed to the continuances. Nor did Akhu attempt to have Chief Taku testify when he was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)].\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (alteration added). Accordingly, Akhu was properly denied withholding from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">To obtain relief under the CAT, an applicant must establish \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Akhu failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
