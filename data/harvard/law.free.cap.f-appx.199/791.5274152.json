We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b816-21\">On 11 September 2005 Maysonet, a convicted felon, attempted to rob a convenience store with a Smith and Wesson .44 magnum revolver. His attempt was thwarted by the store clerk. Maysonet was arrested at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-22\">Following the failed robbery attempt, Maysonet was charged in the Middle District of Florida with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Subsequent to the initial complaint, the government filed a single-count information charging Maysonet not only with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(g), but also with having three prior felony convictions in violation of \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>these prior felonies, the information charged Maysonet under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), requiring that a person with more than three previous violent felony convictions be imprisoned for a minimum of fifteen years. Maysonet pled guilty to the charges contained in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer recommended that Maysonet receive an enhanced sentence pursuant to the \u201cArmed Career Criminal Act\u201d (\u201cACCA\u201d), \u00a7 924(e), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 (Nov. 2005). Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the offense level for an armed career criminal is 34 if the defendant used or possessed the firearm in connection with a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). Because of applicable enhancements, the probation officer recommended that his offense level be increased from 28 to 34. After a reduction of three levels for Maysonet\u2019s accepting responsibility and assisting the investigating authorities, the probation officer concluded that Maysonet\u2019s adjusted offense level was 31 and his criminal history category was VI; this resulted in a guideline range of 188-235 months of imprisonment, with a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years (180 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Maysonet objected to the application of \u00a7 924(e) to enhance his sentence. His objection focused on the first predicate conviction in 2002, for carrying a concealed firearm, which he contended did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(1) and (e)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because he had not been convicted of three \u201cviolent felonies,\u201d Maysonet argued that an enhanced sentence as an armed career criminal would be inappropriate. At his sentencing hearing, Maysonet reiterated this objection. The district court overruled Maysonet\u2019s objections and accepted the sentencing calculation in the PSI, and sentenced Maysonet to 188 months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">On appeal, Maysonet argues that (1) the district court erred in finding that his prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm constituted a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(1); and (2) his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were violated by that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">A. <em>Carrying a Concealed Firearm as a \u201cViolent Felony\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute ... is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilk, </em>452 F.3d 1208, 1221 n. 20 (11th Cir.2006). In addition, \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s interpretation of the [Sentencing [Guidelines is subject to de novo review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court must take into account the sentencing range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number><em>States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (llth Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">There is a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years of imprisonment for a convicted felon who possesses a firearm where the individual has three previous violent felony convictions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). \u201cViolent felony\u201d includes \u201cany act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm,\u201d punishable for a term of imprisonment exceeding one year if committed by an adult,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where the felony \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In such a case, the defendant is sentenced as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). The Sentencing Guidelines recommend an offense level of 34 for an armed career criminal where the defendant \u201cused or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3). The definition of a \u201c[cjrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines is similar to the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Maysonet\u2019s argues that the district court erred in construing his 2002 conviction for carrying a concealed weapon as a violent felony for purposes of activating the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. This argument is clearly at odds with our opinions in <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398 (11th Cir.1996) and <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">In <em>Hall, </em>a defendant who was sentenced by the district court as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d appealed his sentence and argued that he should not be subject to an enhanced sentence, since his prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Florida law did not constitute a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(1). 77 F.3d at 401. We rejected that argument and concluded that, since the act of carrying a concealed weapon did \u201cpose a serious risk of physical injury,\u201d it fell under the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 924(e)(2). <em>Id. </em>Moreover, in <em>Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), we extended <em>Hall\u2019s </em>scope and concluded that carrying a concealed weapon also constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the enhanced sentencing provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1). 138 F.3d at 1372. Maysonet\u2019s counsel has conceded that <em>Hall </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>dispose of this aspect of his appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> R3 at 4; Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>B. <em>Fifth and Sixth Amendment Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Maysonet argues that the district court violated his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution when it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his prior convictions were violent felonies, when that fact was neither charged in the information nor admitted by him. He argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2848, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in which the Court held that it was unconstitutional to remove from the jury the assessment of any facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed, prevented the district court from construing his prior conviction as a violent felony without first submitting that issue to the jury. \u201cWe review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, a district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as an armed career criminal for purposes of sentencing is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1359 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\u201cIn <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219 [140 L.Ed.2d 350] (1998), the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). Relying on Almendarez-Torres, we have rejected the arguments made by Maysonet relative to \u00a7 924(e)(1). <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1034-35 (11th Cir.2001). <em>See also United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that a district court does not err in considering prior convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence under \u00a7 924(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Contrary to Maysonet\u2019s argument, <em>Apprendi </em>expressly carved out an exception for prior convictions, making clear that <em>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory minimum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (emphasis added). We have repeatedly indicated that the rule of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1274; <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir. 2005) . Under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>it is clear that \u201cneither the Fifth Amendment nor the Sixth Amendment prevents] the district court from finding the fact of [defendant\u2019s prior convictions, or using them\u201d to enhance his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Finally, Maysonet asserts that, even if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law, the district court was only authorized to find the fact of his prior convictions, but not to characterize them as violent felonies or crimes of violence. Whether a prior felony conviction is a violent felony for purposes of an enhanced sentence is a question of law that can be answered by the district court. <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275; <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1196-98 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court was obligated to determine whether Maysonet\u2019s prior convictions were violent felonies under \u00a7 924(e)(1); that issue did not need to be submitted to a jury. Thus, the district court did not violate Maysonet\u2019s Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights by enhancing his sentence based upon a finding of three prior violent felony convictions, despite the fact that the violent nature of the felonies was neither proven to a jury nor admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">On appeal, Maysonet has challenged the district court\u2019s determination that his prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm was a violent felony, and has argued that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by that determination. As we have explained, the district court did not err in finding three violent felony convictions under \u00a7 924(e)(1) and enhancing Maysonet\u2019s sentence \u00a7 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, Maysonet\u2019s sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-23\">. The information identified the three felony convictions: (1) a conviction in 2002 for be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>ing felon in possession of a firearm and carrying a concealed firearm; (2) a conviction in 2004 for the aggravated battery of a pregnant woman; and (3) convictions in 2004 for, among others, grand theft of a motor vehicle, battery on a law enforcement officer, obstructing or opposing a law enforcement officer with violence, and burglary and trespass of a conveyance. Although the date of the first felony conviction is stated in the information as 1987, the correct date is stated in the Presentence Investigation Report as 2002, and Maysonet has not disputed any of his prior felony convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-13\">. Maysonet had raised a similar argument before the PSI was prepared in his case. In fact, as early as his plea hearing before the magistrate judge in December 2005, Maysonet argued that carrying a concealed firearm was \"not a violent crime.\u201d R2 at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">. Under Florida Law, carrying a concealed weapon is a third degree felony, punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 790.01 and 775.082(3)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a \"crime of violence\u201d is likewise defined to include felonies involving \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">. Nonetheless, Maysonet attempts to argue that <em>Hall </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>have been eroded by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>in which we concluded that possession of a firearm by a felon did not constitute a \"crime of violence\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2), the federal statute addressing the detention of a convicted defendant before sentencing. 399 F.3d 1297, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). <em>Johnson </em>involved a different crime\u2014 possession of a firearm by a felon \u2014 rather than the crime of carrying a concealed firearm at issue in this case. As we made clear in <em>Hall, </em>carrying a concealed weapon poses a greater risk of physical injury than possession, since, by carrying a concealed weapon, \"the person has taken the extra step of having the weapon immediately accessible for use on another.\u201d 77 F.3d at 401. Significantly, <em>Johnson </em>involved neither \u00a7 924(e) nor the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Maysonet also contends that the rationale of <em>Hall </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>has been overruled by <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>where the Supreme Court concluded that a DUI conviction did not constitute a \"crime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u00a7 16(b). 543 U.S. 1, 9-10, 125 S.Ct. 377, 382, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). In deciding what should constitute a \"crime of violence\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), the Court in <em>Leocal </em>drew a distinction between those negligent acts creating only a \"possibility that harm will result from a person\u2019s conduct\u201d and more active conduct creating the risk of the \"use of physical force against another.\u201d 543 U.S. at 10, 125 S.Ct. at 383. The Supreme Court reasoned that the former would not be sufficient to constitute \"crimes of violence,\u201d but that the latter would meet that threshold. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, <em>Leocal </em>bolsters our ruling in <em>Hall, </em>in which we found that carrying a concealed weapon is \u201cactive conduct\u201d that involves the \"extra step of having the weapon immediately accessible for use on another.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>77 F.3d at 401. Moreover, the statutory definition of \"crime of violence\u201d before the Court in <em>Leocal </em>was different from both \u00a7 924(e) and the Sentencing Guidelines, which the Court explicitly recognized. <em>Leocal, </em>543 U.S. 1, 10 n. 7, 125 S.Ct. 377, 383.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
