Felder was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 480 months. Felder has appealed, raising several issues related to his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Felder first contends the district court erred in denying his motion for specific performance of the plea agreement, by which he sought to compel the Government to request a downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2002). The decision to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion is solely within the Government\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, unless the Government has obligated itself in a plea agreement to file a substantial assistance motion, its refusal to do so is not reviewable unless based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The plea agreement provided that the Government would file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion if Felder \u201ccooperate[d] pursuant to the provisions of [the] Plea Agreement, and that cooperation [was] deemed by Attorneys for the Government as providing substantial assistance----\u201d Under the agreement, Felder was required \u201cto be fully truthful and forthright\u201d with the Government regarding his knowledge of, among other crimes, armed robberies and homicides. To test his truthfulness, Felder agreed to not only submit to polygraph examinations but also to pass them \u201cto the Government\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d If he failed to pass a polygraph examination, the Government reserved the right to declare its obligations under the plea agreement \u201cnull and void.\u201d Felder failed a polygraph examination regarding information provided about a case of interest, and the Government refused to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">Felder argues the polygraph provision was unconscionable as a matter of law and therefore evidences the Government\u2019s unconstitutional motive for refusing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The Government, however, asserts it did not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion because Felder failed to substantially assist in its investigation of the only case of interest, namely a grocery store armed robbery and murder. Because the Government retained its discretion to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and Felder has failed to establish that the Government\u2019s refusal to file was based on an unconstitutional motive, we conclude the district court did not err in denying Felder\u2019s motion for specific performance of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">Next, Felder contends the district court erred in denying his motion to require a higher burden of proof at sentencing. Felder asserts he should have been sentenced only on those facts admitted to or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range prescribed thereby as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Further, we have previously noted that sentencing factors should continue to be evaluated based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). As Felder\u2019s sentence was imposed <em>post-Booker, </em>the district court\u2019s use of a preponderance of the evidence standard was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Felder also contends the district court\u2019s application of the murder cross-reference was improper in light of the inconsistent testimony presented during the sentencing hearing. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). After reviewing the materials on appeal, including the district court\u2019s lengthy summation of the evidence and analysis, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the murder cross-reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Finally, Felder contends the district court erred by failing to rule on disputed matters in the revised presentence report as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). However, in denying Felder\u2019s motion to strike the revised presentence report, the court repeatedly stated that it would base its decision on the testimony and evidence presented during the sentencing hearing rather than on the summaries presented in the presentence report. Further, the court made clear that any information included in the report, but not presented during the sentencing hearing, would be given \u201cvery limited weight.\u201d Therefore, we conclude the district court complied with Rule 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Felder\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
