Jones appeals his seventy-one month sentence following his negotiated guilty plea to one count of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344(1) and 2. Upon a thorough review of the record on appeal, including the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea hearing and sentencing transcripts, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), and after consideration of the briefs of the parties to this Court, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">Between May 1998 and April 2001, Jones engaged in a scheme to purchase numerous luxury vehicles and Rolex watches by creating and passing fraudulent certified checks to unsuspecting victims. In one instance, Jones used a fraudulent cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $45,500 to purchase a 1998 Range Rover from a private seller. Jones then sold the vehicle to Carmax for $28,851. In July 2001, Jones was arrested in Virginia after attempting to sell a Porsche Boxster, which he had fraudulently obtained, to an undercover officer. Jones was convicted and remained incarcerated until October 3, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">On or about October 20, 2003, Jones commenced the instant check-kiting offense by opening a new checking account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>via the internet with Net Bank using a forged and non-sufficient-funds check. Jones then opened additional fraudulent accounts with other banks, after which he began kiting checks between the various financial institutions. In August 2004, Jones again attempted to use a fraudulent certified check to purchase a 1991 BMW. Shortly thereafter, Forsyth County police officers obtained an arrest warrant for Jones. While searching Jones\u2019s vehicle and residence, the police discovered business cards in several of Jones\u2019s aliases and twenty-six checks totaling $67,005, and various other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">While committing the instant offense, Jones also fraudulently leased a house in St. Mario Golf and Country Club, Duluth, Georgia. Jones signed the lease in July 2004 and was evicted in September 2004. During that period, Jones attempted to pay the $9,300 in rent due with a series of three fraudulent checks with a total face value of $21,300. The landlord claimed a loss of $11,000 as a result of Jones\u2019s fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On appeal, Jones argues that at sentencing the district court (1) erred by including in its fraud-loss calculation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b) the loss amounts associated with his fraudulent conduct prior to his incarceration in Virginia because those acts were distinct from the instant offense and too temporally remote; (2) erred by including both the $45,500 he used to fraudulently purchase the 1998 Range Rover as well as the $28,851 he later sold the vehicle for to Carmax; (3) erred by including in the total fraud-loss amount the cumulative face value of the fraudulent rent checks that Jones presented to his landlord rather than the rent amount actually due; and (4) plainly erred by including in its fraud-loss calculation outdated checks seized from Jones\u2019s residence and vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines presents a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>326 F.3d 1319, 1326 (11th Cir. 2003). The Court reviews the findings of fact for clear error, and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>The Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact at sentencing regarding the amount of loss for clear error. <em>United States v. Manoocher Nosrati-Shamloo, </em>255 F.3d 1290, 1291 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">1. Pre-Incarceration Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Jones argues that the district court erred by including in its fraud-loss calculation the $160,476.80 loss associated with his fraudulent conduct that occurred before his Virginia incarceration. Jones contends that his pre-incarceration conduct cannot be considered relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2), because it did not involve a common scheme or plan and was not part of the same course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">Under the Guidelines, a district court may hold a defendant accountable \u201cnot just for the \u2018offense of conviction,\u2019 but for all \u2018offense conduct,\u2019 which \u2018refers to the totality of the criminal transaction in which the defendant participated and which gave rise to his indictment, without regard to the particular crimes charged in the indictment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Fuentes, </em>107 F.3d 1515, 1522 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1209 n. 12 (11th Cir.1989)). Section lB1.3(a)(2) of the Guidelines describes what \u201crelevant conduct\u201d must be considered in calculating a defendant\u2019s base offense level, and provides that the defendant must be held accountable for all acts and omissions \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006, 1010 (11th Cir.1994) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2)). Two offenses qualify as the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d if \u201cthey are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(B)). Relevant factors to consider include \u201cthe degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two offenses qualify as a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d if they are \u201csubstantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus operandi.\u201d Id., </em>comment. (n.9(A)). Relevant conduct may include uncharged conduct. <em>Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Jones argues that his pre-incarceration conduct (1) occurred between two-and-a-half and five-and-a-half years before the beginning of the charged check-kiting offenses, (2) involved the dissimilar scheme of acquiring vehicles and watches, and (3) involved a completely different type of victim and <em>modus operandi. </em>Jones argues that the government failed to demonstrate temporal proximity, similarity, or relevancy to the instant scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">At sentencing, the district court stated that Jones\u2019s ongoing fraudulent conduct was only interrupted by his term of incarceration; therefore, the pre-incarceration conduct could be considered relevant conduct under the Guidelines. This Court has not addressed whether an intervening term of incarceration will generally preclude a district court from finding that a defendant\u2019s pre-incarceration conduct was part of the same common scheme or part or the same course of conduct as the offenses of the conviction, because the preincarceration conduct is too temporally remote and did not occur with sufficient regularity. In this particular case, we find that the record demonstrates that Jones committed the extrinsic fraudulent conduct with sufficient regularity and in temporal proximity to the charged offense regardless of his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Between May 1998 and April 2001, Jones engaged in a series of purchases of six luxury vehicles and two Rolex watches using fraudulent certified checks. Jones ultimately was arrested in July 2001 in Virginia after attempting to sell one of the vehicles to an undercover officer. Jones remained incarcerated in Virginia until October 2003. The <em>same month </em>that he was released from incarceration, Jones immediately resumed his fraudulent activities, commencing the instant check-kiting offense. Given that there was no break in the activity outside of the period of incarceration, Jones\u2019s acts of creating and passing fraudulent certified checks represent an \u201congoing series of offenses\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.3. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment. (n.9(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Furthermore, the record demonstrates the Jones\u2019s pre-incarceration fraudulent conduct was sufficiently similar to the charged offense. In evaluating the \u201csimilarity, regularity, and temporal proximity\u201d between the offense of conviction and the extrinsic conduct, this Court has cautioned that it would be improper to find two offenses sufficiently similar just because they are of the same general type. <em>See Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">In <em>Maxwell, </em>this Court rejected the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s distribution of dilaudid was part of the same course of conduct as his distribution of cocaine simply because both schemes involved \u201cdrug distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1011. Unlike the situation in Maxwell, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>trict court in the case before this Court did not conclude that the extrinsic acts and the instant offense were sufficiently similar solely because both offenses generally involved \u201cfraud.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Rather, the facts of this case demonstrate an overlap in the modus operandi and similarity of Jones\u2019s pre- and post-incarceration conduct. The evidence shows that, in both instances, Jones\u2019s <em>modus operandi </em>was to create and use fraudulent certified checks to defraud his victims. While his pre-incarceration conduct involved a scheme to acquire and resell vehicles and jewelry, and his post-incarceration conduct involved check kiting between various financial institutions, the schemes were based on the same method and were sufficiently similar to allow for a finding that they were part of a common scheme or same course of conduct. In addition, the evidence shows that Jones also used the same alias, Jacques Deloach, during both periods. Furthermore, even after his incarceration, Jones engaged in the identical act of using a fraudulent certified check to purchase a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Jones\u2019s pre-and post-incarceration conduct were sufficiently similar and amounted to relevant conduct under \u00a7 IB 1.3, and that the pre-incarceration conduct could be considered in calculating the total loss amount under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">2. Loss Calculation of the Range Rover</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Jones argues that the district court erred by including in its loss calculation both the $45,500 fraudulent check he used to purchase the 1998 Range Rover as well as the $28,851 he received when he sold the vehicle to Carmax. Jones argues that the district court ignored the value of the car that he provided to Carmax, and the court should have given him an offset credit because he did not intend to cause a loss greater than $45,500. Jones contends that the loss amount should have been either $45,500 or $28,851, but not both amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Section 2B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines provides a 14-level enhancement for a fraud offense involving between $400,000 and $1 million in loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) (2004). Application Note 3 to that section provides that the \u201closs is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)). \u201cActual loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)(i)). \u201c \u2018Intended loss\u2019 (I) means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense; and (II) includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)(ii)). The Guidelines also provide for \u201ccredits against loss,\u201d stating that the loss amount shall be reduced by either (1) the fair market value of any property returned to the victim before the offense was detected; or (2) \u201c[i]n a case involving collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant, the amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral, or if the collateral has not been disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(E)(i)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Jones\u2019s initial fraudulent purchase, and then sale of the 1998 Range Rover were separate transactions designed to cause a loss to two distinct victims. The facts of this case demonstrate that Jones used a fraudulent cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $45,500 to purchase a 1998 Range Rover from a private seller. Jones then sold the 1998 Range Rover to Car-max for $28,851. At the time of each transaction, Jones intended to deprive the private seller of the $45,500 value of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>vehicle, as well as to deprive Carmax out of $28,851.00 <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n. 3(A)(ii)). Furthermore, Jones\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a \u201ccredit against loss\u201d for the value of the vehicle is without merit. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(E)(i)(ii)). Jones neither returned the vehicle to the original owner before the offense was detected, nor pledged any collateral to protect either of the two victims. Accordingly, the district court did not err by including both the $45,500 and the $28,851 loss amounts in its fraud-loss calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">3. Loss Calculation of Rent Checks</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Jones argues that the district court erred by using the cumulative face value of the three fraudulent checks he passed to his landlord for payment of rent on his house in St. Mario Golf and Country Club. Jones contends that the actual and intended losses were the same, because his second and third fraudulent checks were only presented to his landlord in order to remedy the problem with his first fraudulent check. Jones notes that his landlord only claimed a loss of $11,000, while the PSI calculated the loss value of $30,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) states that \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a). At sentencing, the district court noted that based on the court\u2019s other rulings as to Jones\u2019s fraud-loss calculation, that Jones\u2019s amended total fraud-loss amount was $425,960. Thus, the $19,600 difference between the $30,600 figure used by the district court and the $11,000 in rent actually owed to Jones\u2019s landlord was insufficient to get Jones below the $400,000 threshold. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). Therefore, even if the district court erred by including the cumulative face value of each of Jones\u2019s fraudulent rent checks in its total fraud-loss calculation, Jones cannot demonstrate that the error affected the calculation of his sentence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">4. Loss Calculation of Outdated Checks</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Finally, Jones argues that the district court plainly erred by including in the loss calculation the value of outdated fraudulent checks seized from his vehicle and residence. Because Jones\u2019s challenge to the inclusion of these checks was not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Cover, </em>199 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2000). To satisfy the plain error standard, we must find that \u201c(1) there was error in the district court\u2019s determination, (2) the error was plain or obvious, and (3) the error \u2018affected substantial rights\u2019 in that the error was prejudicial and not harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 307 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Jones asserts that the seized checks bore dates as far back as June 2000, more than four years before his arrest in the instant case. Jones claims that all but nine of the twenty-six seized checks were dated more than ninety days before his September 3, 2004, arrest, and equated to $58,070 of the $67,005 total used by the district court. Jones contends that the relatively old age of those checks demonstrate that he lacked any intent to utter those checks; therefore, the checks should not have been included in the total fraud-loss calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">In its response, the government asserts that the relative age of the checks and the fact that the checks had not been presented for payment are inconsequential, because the key issue is Jones\u2019s intent to cause loss with the seized checks. The government argues that Jones\u2019s intent to use counterfeit checks to defraud others is apparent from his actions in committing the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Jones does not satisfy his burden under plain-error review. Jones cites no case law to support his assertion that the relative age of the checks evinces a lack of intent to negotiate the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In a similar situation, this Court held that \u201cwhen an individual possesses a stolen check, or a photocopy of a stolen check, for the purpose of counterfeiting, the district court does not clearly err when it uses the full face value of that stolen check in making a reasonable calculation of the intended loss,\u201d even when the copy of the check does not list an amount. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>431 F.3d 760, 764-65 (11th Cir. 2005) (involving a scheme to use photocopied checks to create new fraudulent checks). In <em>Grant, </em>this Court stated that the defendant\u2019s intent is paramount, and that a district court is justified in including a check\u2019s full face value in the loss calculation where the evidence indicates the defendant intended to utilize the full face value of the check. <em>Id. </em>at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In the case before this Court, the scope of Jones\u2019s fraudulent-check activities over the course of a number of years demonstrates that Jones had the intent to cause loss with the checks seized from his vehicle and residence, regardless of the dates listed on those checks. The Guidelines\u2019s definition of \u201cintended loss\u201d includes \u201cintended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(ii)). Therefore, the district court did not plainly err by including in the total fraud-loss amount the value of the twenty-six checks seized from Jones\u2019s vehicle and residence. Accordingly, the district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
