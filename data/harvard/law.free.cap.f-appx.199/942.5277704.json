The petitioners argue that, based on the evidence presented to the IJ, they established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal based on imputed political opinion due to persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, using the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005). To conclude that the IJ should be reversed, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A), INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-12\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). In order to cany this burden, the applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily Usted factor will cause future persecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA, the appUcant must show that his life or freedom would be threatened based on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe burden of proof for withholding of removal, however, is \u2018more Ukely than not,\u2019 and, thus, is \u2018more stringent\u2019 than the standard for asylum reUef.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). An applicant who fails to establish eUgibiUty for asylum on the merits necessarily fails to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The IJ must make an explicit credibility determination. <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the [IJ] with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir. 2004). When only the applicant\u2019s testimony is offered in support of his claim, an adverse credibility determination, by itself, is sufficient to support the denial of asylum. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, if the applicant offers \u201cother evidence of persecution, whatever form it may take, the IJ must consider that evidence, and it is not sufficient ... to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The IJ\u2019s opinion made credibility, either alone or in conjunction with the failure of proof, dispositive of the petitioners\u2019 asylum claim. The IJ stated that, upon review of all of the evidence, the petitioners \u201chave failed to meet their burden of establishing that they suffered past persecution or that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d This statement was followed by the IJ\u2019s finding that Rojas and Abella \u201chave failed to present this Court a credible claim [of] asylum on behalf of themselves and their two children.\u201d The IJ further then stated that it had \u201csubstantial doubts\u201d regarding their credibility, which it would discuss and outline below. The IJ explained that it denied asylum \u201cbased on the substantial and material inconsistencies in the record.\u201d After discussing inconsistencies, omissions, and other concerns it had with the evidence, the IJ stated that, based on the foregoing discussion, it denied asylum \u201cfor failure of proof and for lack of credibility.\u201d Because the petitioners could not meet the burden for establishing asylum, the IJ found that they failed to meet the burden for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The petitioners focus on the IJ\u2019s initial statement, that they did not meet their burden of proof, which they read in isolation from the IJ\u2019s lengthy discussion of their credibility. Even if the petitioners are correct that the evidence they presented compels the conclusion that the threats established past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution and that such persecution was on account of imputed political opinion, they fail to acknowledge the effect of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding on their asylum claim. By failing to present any argument on the issue of credibility, the petitioners have abandoned the issue. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d). As a result, the petitioners cannot meet their burden of demonstrating that the IJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>tioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum on the merits due to their lack of credibility, they necessarily failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"ARg\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-8\">. The petitioners do not argue that the IJ erred in denying relief under the CAT. Accordingly, they have abandoned the issue. <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1007 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-6\">. Even if the petitioners had challenged the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we would lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding because the petitioners failed to raise the issue before the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (\"Thus, if an alien fails to challenge an adverse credibility determination in his appeal to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider such a challenge in his petition for review.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
