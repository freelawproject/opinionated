Gnago challenges the Board\u2019s finding that he failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We have reviewed the evidence of record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and we conclude that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Gnago failed to show past persecution or the well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Moreover, since Gnago cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Gnago fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006). Gnago faded to make the requisite showing before the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
