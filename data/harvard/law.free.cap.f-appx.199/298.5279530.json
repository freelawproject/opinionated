We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this timeliness determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), even in light of the passage of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. <em>See Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 150-54 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, which was dispositive of Pieter\u2019s application for asylum, we cannot review the underlying merits of his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-18\"> Pieter does not challenge the denial of his requests for withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. He has therefore waived appellate review of these claims. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
