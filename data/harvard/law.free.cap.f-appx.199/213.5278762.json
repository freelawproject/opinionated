Dicks seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Dicks that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Dicks failed to object to the ground on which the magistrate judge based his recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-27\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir. 1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Dicks has waived appellate review by failing to specifically object to the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of failure to exhaust administrative remedies after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
