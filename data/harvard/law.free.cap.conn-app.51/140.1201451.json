(Aqua), appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting a motion to dismiss Aqua\u2019s cross complaint against the defendant owners and its third party complaint against the tenant of the subject property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Aqua\u2019s claims were alleged pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-33.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>On appeal, Aqua claims that the trial court improperly (1) granted the motion to dismiss when it ruled that subject matter jurisdiction did not exist, (2) failed to conduct a \u201ctrial-like\u201d hearing on the motion and (3) concluded that all payments were made to the general contractor in good faith prior to the filing of Aqua\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The original action was commenced by the plaintiff, Thomas J. Gill,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a subcontractor, to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien placed on 338-342 Franklin Avenue in Hartford (property). Among the defendants were other subcontractors that had also placed mechanic\u2019s liens on the property, including Aqua; the owners; and the mortgagees of the property, Equity Bank and Hartford Economic Development Corporation. In due course, Aqua filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff and a cross complaint against all of the other defendants. Aqua also moved to implead and file a third party complaint against the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>With respect to the owners and tenant, Aqua alleged that it had provided materials and rendered services in the construction of improvements to the owners\u2019 property pursuant to an agreement with KMR Contractors, Inc. (general contractor). The agreement with the general contractor provided for Aqua to be paid $8582.93, which sum had not yet been paid. To secure payment, Aqua filed a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien on the property in the Hartford land records on March 27, 1996. The complaints further allege that Aqua served written notice of its lien on the owners and tenant, and also identified the encumbrances on the property that were superior and subsequent to Aqua\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The owners and the tenant moved to dismiss Aqua\u2019s cross complaint and third party complaint, respectively, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion to dismiss, which bore the words \u201coral argument requested\u201d and \u201ctestimony required,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was accompanied by a memorandum of law and an affidavit of Nelson Diorio. The owners and tenant asserted that the owners had hired a general contractor, pursuant to an oral agreement, to perform work on the property and that the owners had made full payment to the general contractor prior to the filing of the mechanic\u2019s lien by Aqua. The owners and tenant claimed, therefore, that Aqua did not have standing to allege its claims pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-36 (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Aqua opposed the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>to dismiss arguing that the trial court, as a court of general jurisdiction, had subject matter jurisdiction over the action and that Aqua had standing to press its claim under \u00a7 49-33. Furthermore, Aqua argued that the owners and tenant were using the motion to dismiss to test the validity of the cause of action, which is more properly tested by a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The trial court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss during which it admitted into evidence copies of checks indicating payment by the owners to the general contractor. Aqua did not introduce any evidence at the hearing, failed to request a continuance to marshal evidence and did not raise an objection on the ground of improper foundation to the copies of checks being placed in evidence. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, finding that \u201cthe evidence presented demonstrates that all payments in satisfaction of the contract were made to the general contractor prior to the filing of the lien.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u201cThe conclusions reached by the trial court cannot be disturbed on appeal unless the subordinate facts do not support them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 300, 309, 603 A.2d 1131 (1992). Because a party must have standing to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the court, it is appropriate for a court to evaluate whether a party has made a \u201ccolorable claim\u201d of injury when a motion to dismiss pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-31,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> formerly \u00a7 143, is made.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Sadloski </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Manchester, </em>228 Conn. 79, 83-84, 634 A.2d 888 (1993). \u201c[W]here a statute or court rule sets prerequisites to suit by a particular plaintiff, a plaintiff not meeting the statutory criteria lacks standing and the court is said to lack jurisdiction over the case. <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 492-93, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).\u201d <em>Novicki </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>47 Conn. App. 734, 739, 709 A.2d 2 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u201cStanding is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring suit or is classically aggrieved.\u201d <em>Steeneck </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>235 Conn. 572, 579, 668 A.2d 688 (1995). \u201cWhere a plaintiff lacks standing to sue, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 580. \u201cStanding concerns the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Cable Television Services Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>235 Conn. 334, 345, 663 A.2d 1011 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">To have standing under the statutes addressing mechanic\u2019s liens, particularly \u00a7\u00a7 49-33 and 49-36, the claimant must demonstrate that he or she is in the zone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of interest intended to be protected by those statutes. To fall within that zone of interest protected by \u00a7\u00a7 49-33 and 49-36, Aqua had to demonstrate that (1) the total amount of its lien and other liens did not exceed the contract price for satisfactory completion of the project, plus any damages resulting from the default by the general contractor, and (2) any payments to the general contractor by the owner were not bona fide payments pursuant to \u00a7 49-36. See General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (f). \u201cNo mechanic\u2019s lien may exceed the price which the owner has agreed to pay for the building being erected or improved, and the owner is entitled, furthermore, to credit for payments made in good faith to the original contractor before receipt of notice of such a lien or liens.\u201d <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corp., </em>181 Conn. 592, 596, 436 A.2d 271 (1980). The owners and tenant argue that Aqua does not come within the zone of interest protected by the statutes relating to mechanic\u2019s liens because it cannot satisfy either prong of the test. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The question is not whether the trial court has original jurisdiction to hear such matters as the foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien, but whether Aqua demonstrated, by a showing of predicate jurisdictional facts, its standing to bring its claim. A careful reading of the record demonstrates that once the owners and tenant produced evidence of payments made in excess of the oral contract, Aqua did not provide the subordinate facts necessary to demonstrate a debt owed and thus failed in its burden of proof. Moreover, Aqua had no claim because the amounts paid and damages sustained by the owners, prior to the filing of the mechanic\u2019s lien, far exceeded the amount due to the general contractor under the original oral contract. In the absence of compliance with the authorizing statute, the trial court properly concluded that Aqua lacked standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>On appeal, Aqua also maintains that the trial court failed to afford it procedural due process, improperly \u201cdelved into the merits of the case\u201d and found the payments made by the owners to the general contractor were bona fide. The short answer to these claims is that during the trial court hearing, Aqua failed to preserve any of them for appeal. \u201cOur rules of practice preclude us from considering claims of error unless they are distinctly raised at trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 [60-5, formerly \u00a7 4061].\u201d <em>Abdelsayed </em>v. <em>Narumanchi, </em>39 Conn. App. 778, 785, 668 A.2d 378 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 915, 676 A.2d 397 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">At the hearing, Aqua offered no objection that it was deprived of procedural due process because of the type of hearing conducted by the trial court. On appeal, Aqua does not generate a Golding<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> argument but does fashion a plain error argument. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, formerly \u00a7 4061. Plain error review \u201c \u2018is reserved for those truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u2019 . . . <em>[State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 659-60, 588 A.2d 127 (1991).]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 241, 710 A.2d 732 (1998). This is not such an extraordinary case. Therefore, because Aqua did not raise, at any time during the hearing, its claim that the trial court improperly analyzed the motion to dismiss for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction and considered the merits of the case, the issue was not preserved, and we will not review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Finally, Aqua argues that there were disputed facts regarding whether the payments by the owners to the general contractor were bona fide. The transcript of the hearing demonstrates that only the plaintiff challenged whether the payments were bona fide. Although Aqua objected to the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of payment, Aqua\u2019s counsel failed to articulate the basis for the objection. \u201cOur review of evidentiary rulings made by the trial court is limited to the specific legal ground raised in the objection. . . . The reason for this rule is clear: it is to alert the trial court to an error while there is time to correct it . . . and to give the opposing party an opportunity to argue against the objection at trial.\u201d <em>Remington Investments, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Properties, Inc., </em>49 Conn. App. 789, 801-802, 716 A.2d 141 (1998). Because Aqua failed to articulate the basis of its objection, the claim was not properly preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">As to Aqua\u2019s second objection raised at the hearing, its counsel stated that \u201c[t]hese so-called exhibits were not submitted with the motion to dismiss.\u201d If the basis of the objection was surprise, no request for a continuance was made nor was any evidence of prejudice proffered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>35 Conn. App. 138, 143, 644 A.2d 386, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 913, 648 A.2d 157 (1994) (defendant did not claim surprise at trial or request continuance to respond to any unanticipated evidence). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> The defendant owners are Nelson Diorio, Gracinda Diorio, Jose Cardoso and Emilia Cardoso.
