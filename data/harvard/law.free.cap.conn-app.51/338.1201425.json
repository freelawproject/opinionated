Specifically, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was the operator of the motor vehicle in question. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On August 11,1996, at approximately 1:53 a.m., a limousine occupied by the defendant and a second person, Mark Puckowski, struck two parked cars on Clinic Drive in New Britain and then rolled to a stop. At trial, Michelle Jean, a resident of Clinic Drive, testified that on the night in question, she was watching television in her bedroom when she heard a loud crash. She immediately looked out the window and observed the limousine rolling slowly down the street. After calling 911, she ran outside and, from the front steps of her building, saw that the limousine continued to roll down the street. When the limousine finally came to a stop, she observed the defendant exit from the driver\u2019s seat. A short time later, she observed Puckowski exit the rear of the limousine.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">A second witness, Arthur Warchol, also a resident of Clinic Drive, testified as follows. On the night in question, he was in his apartment talking on the telephone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>After hearing the crash, he looked outside and observed the limousine rolling down the street. He called 911 and immediately ran outside. As Warchol approached the limousine, he observed the defendant crawling out of the driver\u2019s side. He also observed Puckowski inside the limousine in the backseat. He testified further that he saw no one else at the scene at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Scott Roberts, a paramedic who had responded to the scene of the accident, testified that the defendant had an abrasion on his chin and right kneecap and Puckowski was uninjured. On the basis of this evidence, the trial court concluded that the most probable scenario was that the defendant had \u201chit his chin on the steering wheel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court further concluded that Puckowski\u2019s lack of injury was \u201cconsistent with his being in the backseat\u201d of the vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant stipulated that his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit at the time of the accident, and that the accident had occurred on a public highway for purposes of \u00a7 14-227a. The sole issue at trial, therefore, was who was operating the vehicle. The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he, and not Puckowski, was the operator of the limousine. Our review of the record, transcripts and briefs indicates, however, that the trial court, as the finder of facts in this case, acted reasonably, rationally and in accordance with applicable law in finding that the defendant was the operator of the limousine.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>242 Conn. 485, 489, 698 A.2d 898 (1997). \u201c \u2018On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u2019 \u201d Id., 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The evidence presented was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was the operator of the limousine. Both Jean and Warchol testified that they had witnessed the defendant exit from the driver\u2019s side of the limousine and that Puckowski was in the rear of the limousine. Additionally, Roberts testified, and the trial court agreed, that the defendant\u2019s injuries were consistent with his being the driver at the time of the accident. The damage to the interior of the limousine supports this conclusion. While the defendant testified that Puckowski was driving the limousine at the time of the accident, the trial court chose not to credit his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We are guided by the well established principle that \u201c[t]he trier of fact may accept or reject the testimony of any witness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>38 Conn. App. 731, 744, 663 A.2d 1078 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 921, 676 A.2d 1376 [cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1044, 117 S. Ct. 617, 136 L. Ed. 2d 541] (1996). It is the trier of fact\u2019s \u201cexclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>30 Conn. App. 232, 239, 619 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 915, 623 A.2d 1025 (1993). We give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>deference to the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom that support the trial court\u2019s determination of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>46 Conn.
