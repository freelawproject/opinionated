We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The commissioner, through a hearing officer, suspended the plaintiffs license to operate a motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>for ninety days because the plaintiff had failed a breath test after he was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. The plaintiff appealed from that decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. The trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>sustained the appeal and remanded the case to the commissioner to render a new decision that would set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Following the remand, the commissioner, through his hearing officer, rendered a new decision and the plaintiff again appealed to the trial court, <em>DiPentima, J., </em>which dismissed the appeal. The matter now before us concerns only the second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Our examination of the record and briefs persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues regarding the underlying factual disputes were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. <em>Fiolek </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 489, 722 A.2d 1237 (1997). Because that memorandum of decision fully and properly addresses the arguments raised in this appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>us to repeat the decision contained therein. See <em>In re Karrlo K., </em>40 Conn. App. 73, 75, 668 A.2d 1353 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or urine ....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201c(c) If the person arrested . . . submits to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicate that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person is ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, the police officer, acting on behalf of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall immediately revoke and take possession of the motor vehicle operator\u2019s license . . . for a twenty-four-hour period and shall issue a temporary operator\u2019s license or nonresident operating privilege to such person valid for the period commencing twenty-four hours after issuance and ending thirty days after the date such person received notice of his arrest by the police officer. The police officer shall prepare a written report of the incident and shall mail the report together with a copy of the completed temporary license form, any operator\u2019s license taken into possession and a copy of the results of any chemical test or analysis to the Department of Motor Vehicles within three business days. The report shall be made on a form approved by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and shall be subscribed and sworn to under penalty of false statement as provided in section 53a-157b by the arresting officer. . . . The report shall set forth the grounds for the officer\u2019s belief that there was probable cause to arrest such person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . [and] that such person submitted to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicated that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> The trial court stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201cit was incumbent on the hearing officer to write a decision that sets forth specific findings on crucial elements\u2014the time of operation, for a prime example\u2014and explains how he arrived at those findings of fact on the basis of the poorly prepared police documents. The decision that the hearing officer did write in this case does not provide an adequate basis for the court\u2019s review.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly applied the law of the case doctrine contains no analysis of the law or citation to legal authority. Accordingly, we decline to review it. Practice Book \u00a7 67-4, formerly \u00a7 4064C. <em>Krondes </em>v. <em>O\u2019Boy, </em>37 Conn.
