On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 52-231 and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 327,334 (a) and 4059, now \u00a7\u00a7 17-5, 6-1 and 64-1, in the issuance of its judgment, (2) awarded nominal damages in the amount of $1, (3) found that the defendant was not liable under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) found that the defendant did not violate the unlawful entry statutes. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u00a7 47a-16 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. The plaintiff leased a three bedroom apartment from the defendant landlord for several years. During that time, the defendant periodically helped the plaintiff by moving her air conditioner and other heavy items. In February, 1991, the defendant, acting on a reasonable assumption that the plaintiff intended to vacate the apartment, moved the plaintiffs furniture and belongings from the third floor of the apartment to the second floor. The defendant also installed a door in front of the stairwell to the third floor thereby restricting the plaintiffs access to the third floor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the next six months, the plaintiff did not pay rent, causing a total loss to the defendant of $3900. Additionally, the defendant paid the plaintiff the sum of $2000 to be credited to any damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant alleging that he had violated General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>CUTPA and General Statutes 47a-16 et seq. The trial court articulated that it found for the plaintiff under the entry and detainer statute and found for the defendant as to the claimed violations of the unlawful entry statute and CUTPA. The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $1. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court failed to articulate its factual findings and legal conclusions, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-231 and Practice Book \u00a7 327, now \u00a7 17-5. Sections 52-231 and 17-5 require that each court \u201ckeep a record of its proceedings and cause the facts on which it found its final judgments and decrees to appear on the record; and any such finding if requested by any party shall specially set forth such facts.\u201d Further, the plaintiff argues that the identical requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 334A, now \u00a7 6-1, and \u00a7 4059, now \u00a7 64-1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We recognize that \u201c [w]hen a trial court fails to answer a motion for articulation or does so incompletely, the appellant should seek a further articulation.\u201d <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 737, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). \u201cWhen a party is dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation, he [or she] may, and indeed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>appropriate circumstances he [or she] must, seek immediate appeal of the rectification memorandum to this court via a motion for review. . . . <em>Buchetto </em>v. <em>Haggquist, </em>17 Conn. App. 544, 549, 554 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 808, 559 A.2d 1141 (1989); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4054 [now \u00a7 66-7].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Viets </em>v. Viets, 39 Conn. App. 610, 613, 666 A.2d 434 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Here, the plaintiff failed to avail herself of the procedural vehicles available to remedy any deficiencies in the record. The plaintiff did not request a further articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051, now \u00a7 66-5,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> after the trial court issued its articulation. Also, the plaintiff did not attempt to remedy any deficiencies in the record by filing a motion for a special finding,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the purpose of which is to put on the record those facts that are the basis for the judgment. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>125 Conn. 615, 622, 7 A.2d 847 (1939). Further, the plaintiff did not file a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s articulation with this court. Practice Book \u00a7 66-7, formerly \u00a7 4054.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The burden is on the plaintiff to provide this court with an adequate record as to the issues raised by the plaintiff. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The plaintiff urges us to address on direct appeal her concerns that should have been resolved through the use of the proper rules of practice. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly awarded nominal damages under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43, failed to award damages under CUTPA and failed to award damages under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-16 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We recognize that \u201c[t]he trial judge has a broad legal discretion and his action will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse.\u201d <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 166, 175, 530 A.2d 596 (1987). \u201cAs a general rule, the determination of damages involves a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Gerber &amp; Hurley, Inc. </em>v. <em>CCC Corp., </em>36 Conn. App. 539, 545, 651 A.2d 1302 (1995), citing <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>Jalich Homes, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 299, 309-10, 460 A.2d 488 (1983). Thus, we give substantial deference to the trial judge on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">We first address the plaintiffs challenge to the trial court\u2019s award of nominal damages for the defendant\u2019s violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43, the entry and detainer statute. In this case, the trial court found that the plaintiff failed to offer any evidence of actual or emotional damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s actions and therefore awarded nominal damages in the amount of $1.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barbara Weisman, Trustee </em>v. Kaspar, <em>233 </em>Conn. 531, 541, 661 A.2d 530 (1995). \u201cThe appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blancato </em>v. <em>Randino, </em>33 Conn. App. 44, 49, 632 A.2d 1144, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 916, 636 A.2d 846 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">After a review of the record and briefs, and after hearing from the parties at oral argument, we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to make a substantial showing that the trial court findings as to damages were clearly erroneous. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs challenge to the damages award for the defendant\u2019s violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly held that the defendant did not violate CUTPA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Although the plaintiff argues that the trial court incorrectly held that her CUTPA claim could not be brought on the basis of an isolated incident, we need not address that issue here, as the plaintiff does not have a valid CUTPA claim regardless of this issue. CUTPA provides that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). We recognize however, that CUTPA is limited to \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a). \u201cThe plain language of \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a) provides one limitation by requiring that the plaintiff suffer an ascertainable loss that was caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>by the alleged unfair trade practice.\u201d <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223-24, 640 A.2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cA party seeking to recover damages under CUTPA must meet two threshold requirements. First, he [or she] must establish that the conduct at issue constitutes an unfair or deceptive trade practice. . . . Second, he must present evidence providing the court with a basis for a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>42 Conn. App. 124, 130, 679 A.2d 27 (1996), aff'd, 240 Conn. 654, 692 A.2d 809 (1997). The second requirement for a valid CUTPA claim does not necessitate that the actual amount of ascertainable loss be proven. See <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>247 Conn. 48, 78-79, 717 A.2d 724 (1998); <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 614, 440 A.2d 810 (1981), on appeal after remand, 192 Conn. 252, 470 A.2d 1216 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc., </em>our Supreme Court found that, although the amount of damages was not proven to a reasonable certainty, that alone did not dispose of the plaintiffs CUTPA claim. The plaintiff in <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc., </em>failed to prove satisfactorily her damages for lost profits. The court found, however, that that alone should not defeat the plaintiffs CUTPA claim; in that case, the CUTPA claim was dismissed on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Similarly, in <em>Hinchliffe, </em>our Supreme Court found that the consumer\u2019s loss in the case was \u201cascertainable if it is measurable even though the precise amount of the loss is not known.\u201d <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>supra, 184 Conn. 614. The court in <em>Hinchliffe </em>focused on the CUTPA language requiring an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d and found that it does not necessitate proof of a specific amount of damages. Thus, although the court dismissed the CUTPA claim on other grounds, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Hinchliffe </em>court found the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to calculate precisely an amount of loss did not preclude their CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In both <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc., and Hinchliffe, </em>our Supreme Court did not allow the failure to prove the precise amount of damages to thwart the plaintiffs CUTPA claim; however, those cases are not dispositive of the present case. \u201cWhile CUTPA damages need not be proven with absolute precision, <em>the failure to present any evidence </em>concerning the nature and extent of the injury sustained precludes recovery under the statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>A. Secondino &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>LoRicco, </em>215 Conn. 336, 344, 576 A.2d 464 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In the present case, the trial court articulated that the plaintiff <em>\u201cfailed to present any evidence </em>of actual damages as a result of the concededly illegal entry and detainer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is insufficient evidence, in this case, to find an ascertainable loss. As no ascertainable loss can be found, the plaintiff is precluded from recovery under the CUTPA statute. We therefore find that regardless of whether a CUTPA claim can be based on a single incident, the plaintiff, as a matter of law, cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court failed to find a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-16 et seq. We decline to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. . . . This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barbara Weisman, Trustee </em>v. <em>Kaspar, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In the present case, the trial court stated in its articulation, \u201cjudgment for the defendant on count 3.\u201d The record does not provide any additional information concerning the factual basis for the decision. We are therefore unable to determine whether the factual basis for the court\u2019s decision is clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we decline to address the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In this opinion FOTI, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-14\"> General Statutes 8 42-110a et seq.

I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion with regard to the plaintiffs claim under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., because I conclude that the trial court improperly found that an isolated incident could not be the predicate for a violation of CUTPA and that the evidence in the record is sufficient to show that the plaintiff suffered an ascertainable loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s violation of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 (a) (3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Although the majority does not address the issue of whether an isolated incident can be the predicate for a violation of CUTPA, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant on the CUTPA claim because it found that an isolated incident could not be the predicate for a violation of CUTPA. Since the plaintiff raised this issue on appeal, I believe it is appropriate to address whether an isolated incident can be the predicate for a violation of CUTPA. \u201cBecause statutory interpretation is a question of law, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Andover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>Ltd.

[A] violation of CUTPA can be found . . . where the defendant\u2019s actions violate the public policy found in two subdivisions [(3) and (4)] of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43 (a). . . . These provisions of \u00a7 47a-43 uphold the long-standing public policy against proceeding by way of self-help remedies when evicting a tenant .... [T]he subjective good faith of one who has in fact performed an unfair or deceptive act is not a defense to a CUTPA violation . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daddona </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobile Home Sales, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 243, 257-58, 550 A.2d 1061 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Therefore, it is the violation of the public policy underlying \u00a7 47a-43 (a) (3) and (4), and not the number of incidents, that creates the factual predicate for a claim of a CUTPA violation. See id. (violation of CUTPA existed where defendant dismantled plaintiff\u2019s mobile home rather than evict her); see also <em>Gebbie </em>v. <em>Cadle Co., </em>49 Conn. App. 265, 278-80, 714 A.2d 678 (1998) (affirming trial court\u2019s finding that CUTPA violation existed where defendant acknowledged that it was bound by loan restructure agreement but refused to honor it). In this case, the defendant conceded, and the trial court found, that there was an illegal entry and detainer. I conclude that the trial court improperly found that an isolated incident could not be the predicate for a violation of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Because the majority concluded that the plaintiff did not have a valid CUTPA claim in that \u201c[tjhere is insufficient evidence, in this case, to find an ascertainable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>loss,\u201d I will address this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 42-llOg (a) affords a cause of action to [a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>247 Conn. 48, 78-79, 717 A.2d 724 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The trial court found that \u201c[t]he plaintiff . . . failed to present any evidence of <em>actual damages as a result of the concededly illegal entry and </em>detainer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) On the basis of that factual finding, the majority concludes that there is insufficient evidence to find an ascertainable loss. Under CUTPA, however, \u201c[l]oss has a broader meaning than the term damage.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 79. Our Supreme Court has held that to satisfy the ascertainable loss requirement under CUTPA, \u201cthere is no need [for the plaintiff] to allege or prove the amount of the ascertainable loss. <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 614, 440 A.2d 810 (1981), on appeal after remand, 192 Conn. 252, 470 A.2d 1216 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schatz &amp; Schatz, Ribicoff &amp; Kotkin, </em>supra, 247 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>79.

An examination of the record shows that the plaintiff proved that she rented an apartment from the defendant beginning in June, 1983. The apartment consisted of a bathroom, living room, kitchen and small bedroom on the second floor, and a master bedroom, bathroom and two small bedrooms on the third floor. On February 24, 1991, the plaintiff returned to her apartment to find that the defendant had entered her apartment and had moved the furniture from the third floor to the second floor. In addition, the defendant moved a door in the stairway leading from the second floor to the third floor, which prevented the plaintiff from accessing the third floor of her apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That situation remained until April 13, 1991, when the trial court ordered the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>move the furniture back.

In addition, the ascertainable loss issue was not raised or briefed by the parties. \u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). \u201cWe do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported.\u201d Id., 222. Therefore, I believe that it is inappropriate for this court to review this issue on appeal. Since the majority does address this issue, and I disagree that there is insufficient evidence, in this case, to find an ascertainable loss, I address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> The transcript from the April 29, 1994 hearing reveals the following testimony by the plaintiff on direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u201cQ.
