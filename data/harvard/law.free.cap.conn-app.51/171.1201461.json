On March 8, 1994, the New Haven police department was informed that the defendant, for whom the department had an outstanding arrest warrant, was standing at the comer of Chapel and Day Streets in New Haven. The officers had been given a physical description of the defendant, and were warned that he was believed to be armed and dangerous. A number of plainclothes officers converged on the location in two cars. After two officers exited the first car, approached the defendant and identified themselves as police officers, the defendant turned to look at them and then ran east on Chapel Street. The two officers, joined by officers from the second car, ran after the defendant. During the pursuit, Detective-Sergeant Michael Sweeney was the officer closest to the defendant. At some point during the pursuit, the defendant pulled a gun from his waistband and kept it pointed toward the ground. Soon thereafter, the defendant turned to look back at the officers, raised his gun and pointed it at Sweeney. Another detective yelled, \u201cMike, he\u2019s got a gun,\u201d prompting Sweeney to shoot the defendant, who fell to the ground. The police recovered the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>semiautomatic nine millimeter pistol. The hammer was in the firing position with a round in the chamber and a full magazine of ammunition. The defendant was arrested and subsequently convicted of the charges previously enumerated. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court abused its discretion by improperly denying his motion for a mistrial that was precipitated by Sweeney\u2019s testimony about other crimes in which the defendant was a suspect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On direct examination, Sweeney testified that he \u201chad knowledge of the danger involved in the apprehension of [the defendant]\u201d because the police had received telephone calls advising them that the defendant was committing armed robberies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant made a motion for a mistrial and asserted that Sweeney\u2019s testimony about the robberies violated the trial court\u2019s order not to testify about other crimes in which the defendant may have been a suspect. The trial court disagreed that the answer was in violation of the order and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant maintains that this testimony was sufficiently prejudicial to deprive him of his rights to due process and a fair trial in violation of the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u201cWhile the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice it is not favored. [It] should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>[227 Conn. 677, 693-94, 631 A.2d 271 (1993)]. On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>is to assure a fair and just outcome. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 333, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 312, 294 A.2d 312 (1972). <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>46 Conn. App. 131, 136-37, 698 A.2d 908 (1997) . <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>47 Conn. App. 542, 557, 706 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 908, 713 A.2d 829 (1998) .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taveras, </em>49 Conn. App. 639, 652, 716 A.2d 120, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 917, 722 A.2d 809 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 693; see Practice Book \u00a7 42-43, formerly \u00a7 887.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe trial court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion to determine whether a motion for a mistrial should be granted will be reversed on appeal only if that discretion has been abused.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>212 Conn. 351, 364, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989). Thus, we afford \u201cevery reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 660, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>187 Conn. 681, 685, 447 A.2d 1167 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>46 Conn. App. 640, 652, 700 A.2d 710, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 941, 704 A.2d 797 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Here, Sweeney\u2019s statement was entirely responsive to the question asked during the state\u2019s direct examination. Following the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court immediately ordered that the testimony be stricken and instructed the jury to disregard the statement. \u201cIt is to be presumed that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions unless the contrary appears.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rouleau, </em>204 Conn. 240, 254, 528 A.2d 343 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 283, 612 A.2d 45 (1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(\u201ctrial court promptly struck the witness\u2019 response, immediately admonished the jurors to \u2018erase it from your minds\u2019 and told them not to consider the statement in their deliberations\u201d). Under the circumstances here, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The defendant next claims that the jury improperly found him to be a persistent dangerous felony offender and the trial court improperly sentenced him as such. Specifically, the defendant asserts that his conviction of attempt to commit assault in the first degree is not one of the felonies enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (a) (1). The state concedes that the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant is a persistent dangerous felony offender should be vacated.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA persistent dangerous felony offender is a person who (1) stands convicted of . . . assault in the first degree, and (2) has been, prior to the commission of the present crime, convicted of and imprisoned under a sentence to a term of imprisonment of more than one year or of death, in this state or in any other state or in a federal correctional institution, for any of the following crimes: (A) The crimes enumerated in subdivision (1) of this subsection, murder, or an attempt to commit any of said crimes or murder . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself. . . . <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 328, 692 A.2d 713 (1997), citing <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 102, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996). Furthermore, \u201c[b]ecause [\u00a7 53a-40] is a punitive statute, the generally recognized rules of statutory construction normally would require the strictest of interpretations . . . limiting any application of the statute to the words used.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra, 330, citing 3 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7\u00a7 58.02, 59.03, pp. 72, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The plain language of the statute makes clear that attempt crimes are not among those of which a defendant must <em>presently </em>stand convicted to qualify as a persistent dangerous felony offender. Here, the defendant stood convicted of <em>attempted </em>assault in the first degree, which is not a predicate felony enumerated under \u00a7 53a-40 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">We now turn to the question of whether this improper jury finding mandates a new sentencing hearing. The state claims that the trial court did not actually sentence the defendant as a persistent dangerous felony offender because all the sentences imposed were within the statutory limits and not enhanced beyond those limits as is permitted by \u00a7 53a-40 (f).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While the trial court did not sentence in excess of the statutory limits, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>not know whether the improper finding played a role in the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision. The perception of fairness should attend all court proceedings. See <em>State </em>v. Strickland, 243 Conn. 339, 354, 703 A.2d 109 (1997). In the interest of perceived and actual fairness, we vacate the sentence and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to sever or, in the alternative, to bifurcate the trial on the fourth count that alleged criminal possession of a pistol in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Proof of a prior felony conviction is necessary to prove this count, and the defendant asserts that such evidence would have a prejudicial impact on the jury in its consideration of the other counts. The defendant further maintains that any prejudicial impact was increased because the trial court failed to issue any cautionary instruction to the jury and the defendant himself did not testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">At trial, the defendant stipulated that he was previously convicted of a class B felony on July 13, 1990. The trial court reread the criminal possession of a firearm count to the jury and informed it of the stipulation, but did not give a limiting instruction. The defendant was ultimately convicted on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Our rules of practice allow a trial court to order, sua sponte or upon motion of the defendant, a separate trial of two offenses if it appears that the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder of the offenses. See Practice Book \u00a7 41-18, formerly \u00a7 828. \u201cThe question of severance lies within the discretion of the trial court. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s conclusion on the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>absent a clear abuse of discretion. The discretion to sever a trial should be exercised only if a joint trial will substantially prejudice the defendant. Substantial prejudice is more than disadvantage and the formidable task of demonstrating an abuse of discretion and that a joint trial resulted in substantial prejudice falls to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>201 Conn. 659, 669, 519 A.2d 26 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schroff, </em>198 Conn. 405, 408, 503 A.2d 167 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 63, 502 A.2d 360 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>7 Conn. App. 95, 101, 507 A.2d 518 (1986). Simply put, the test to be applied is whether substantial injustice will result if the charges are tried together. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>[187 Conn. 292, 299, 445 A.2d 901 (1982)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>161 Conn. 348, 360-61, 288 A.2d 81 (1971).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>15 Conn. App. 161, 167, 544 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 815, 550 A.2d 1086 (1988), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>10 Conn. App. 503, 506-507, 524 A.2d 648, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 808, 528 A.2d 1155 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The trial court correctly applied <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 161, in its decision not to sever or bifurcate the count at issue. In <em>Banta, </em>the defendants were charged with violating General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and each requested that the trial court sever that count for a separate trial. The trial court denied the motions. The <em>Banta </em>defendants likewise claimed that they were substantially prejudiced because proof of a prior felony conviction was an essential element of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217. In determining whether one of the <em>Banta </em>defendants was so prejudiced, this court set forth five factors to evaluate: (1) the manner in which the evidence entered the case and the extent of the jury\u2019s knowledge of the facts underlying the prior felony conviction, (2) the adequacy of any cautionary instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>given by the court, (3) the use of the prior felony evidence by the prosecution in argument to the jury, (4) the likelihood that the prior felony conviction evidence will inflame the passions of the jurors in light of the nature of the offenses charged and (5) the strength of the evidence against the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>supra, 170-71. We will analyze the defendant\u2019s claim in light of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The first factor requires consideration of the manner in which the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction was entered and how much detail the jury received with respect to this prior conviction. Here, the jury was made aware of the defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction by way of a stipulation through which the jury learned only that the defendant was convicted of a class B felony on July 13, 1990. The jury was not told the nature of the felony or the punishment that the defendant received. This factor does not weigh in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The second factor deals with the adequacy of any cautionary instruction given by the trial court. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court did not give any cautionary instruction; however, this in itself does not necessarily indicate that the defendant suffered substantial prejudice so as to require a separate trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is only one of the five factors to be weighed by this court in determining whether the trial court should have ordered a separate trial. See id., 171. This factor does weigh in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The third factor regards the use of the defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction in the prosecution\u2019s argument to the jury. Here, the prosecutor made a single reference to the conviction during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument. In characterizing Sweeney, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[h]e\u2019s a member of the helping profession. He\u2019s a nurse, he\u2019s a teacher. He\u2019s not a felon with a gun on the street. That\u2019s the stark contrast. You have Sweeney, the teacher, the nurse, the policeman, a member of the helping and healing professions, ladies and gentlemen, and we have the defendant.\u201d During its argument, the prosecutor merely reiterated the bare information that the jury already knew based on the stipulation regarding the defendant\u2019s conviction. Therefore, it is unlikely that this single reference to the defendant\u2019s prior felony status would substantially prejudice the defendant. This factor weighs in favor of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The defendant argues that the evidence of his prior felony conviction was likely to inflame the passions of the jurors in light of the nature of the offenses charged and caused the defendant to be unduly prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">In his brief, the defendant claims that this case was of a \u201chighly inflamed nature\u201d because it \u201cinvolved a chase on foot between an armed defendant and four police officers, one of whom ended up shooting the defendant.\u201d While this presents a violent factual scenario, the jury had evidence that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for the defendant, that the police had received information that the defendant was standing on a street comer armed with a gun and that the defendant aimed this gun at a police officer. In light of the foregoing, it is not likely that the evidence of the class B felony inflamed the passions of the jury. While evidence of a prior felony conviction may ultimately be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>disadvantageous to the defendant, it is an essential element of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217. This factor also weighs in the state\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The last factor to be considered is the strength of the evidence against the defendant. As in <em>Banta, </em>the evidence against the defendant in this case \u201cwas neither sparse nor unconvincing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Banta, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 172. Here, multiple witnesses testified about the event in question, as discussed in section D of this part. Additional testimony demonstrated that the police recovered the defendant\u2019s loaded gun from the scene with the hammer in the firing position and a round in the chamber. In light of this substantial evidence against the defendant, it is highly unlikely that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior unnamed felony conviction prejudiced the jury so as to affect the outcome of the case. This factor does not support the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Applying all five factors to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to sever or bifurcate the criminal possession of a pistol count.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court improperly rendered judgment convicting him of committing of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He specifically claims that this statute is not a separate criminal offense, but rather is a sentence enhancement provision. We agree and vacate the defendant\u2019s conviction, but do not disturb the five year consecutive sentence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>As a preliminary matter, the defendant claims that while this issue was not properly preserved for appellate review, it is nonetheless reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We agree.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has recently held that \u2018\u00a7 53-202k is a sentence enhancement provision and not a separate crime.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 150, 698 A.2d 297 (1997). In <em>Dash, </em>the court recognized that the defendant\u2019s total effective sentence was proper, but modified the judgment to \u2018reflect the fact that \u00a7 53-202k does not constitute a separate offense.\u2019 Id. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to have his conviction under \u00a7 53-202k vacated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>47 Conn. App. 632, 649, 708 A.2d 213, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 909, 713 A.2d 828 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>Dash </em>and its progeny mandate that the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53-202k be vacated, but that the sentence imposed be affirmed. Pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, the trial court properly added the mandatory five year enhancement to the defendant\u2019s total sentence.
