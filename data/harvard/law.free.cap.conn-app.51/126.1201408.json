We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 2:23 a.m. on August 5, 1995, Lieutenant Ronald Doughty of the Coventry police department observed a pickup truck driving through the town of Coventiy at a high rate of speed. Doughty pursued the truck with the intent to pull it over as soon as the hilly, curved road straightened out. As he followed the vehicle through a thirty-five mile per hour zone, he determined its speed to be seventy miles per hour. He also observed the truck weaving in its lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">When Doughty pulled the truck over, he found the defendant at the wheel and smelled a strong odor of alcohol. Doughty observed that the defendant\u2019s eyes were red and glassy, and that he appeared to be confused. The defendant admitted to having consumed \u201cthree beers.\u201d The defendant failed several standard roadside sobriety tests, including the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the walk and turn test, and the one-legged stand test. On the basis of those tests and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>observations, Doughty concluded that the defendant was intoxicated and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">A search incident to the arrest yielded a wooden pipe on the defendant\u2019s person, which was later tested and found to contain marijuana residue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the police station, the defendant consented to providing the police with two urine samples. The samples were taken thirty-four minutes apart. Both tests revealed a blood alcohol content exceeding the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights to trial by an impartial jury by refusing to remove a venireperson, T, for cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Some additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this issue. During voir dire examination, T stated that there was a history of alcoholism in her husband\u2019s family. Specifically, twenty years prior, T\u2019s father-in-law was involved in an automobile accident while driving drunk. Also, her brother-in-law committed suicide while drunk. She said that these incidents made her \u201cconservative\u201d with respect to drinking and driving, and that she would not be the kind of person that she would pick to sit on a jury if she were the defendant. Nonetheless, she affirmed that she could be fair and impartial, and render a verdict based on the evidence and according to the judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">After the venireperson left the courtroom, the defendant asked the court to remove her for cause. Refusing to excuse T for cause, the court found that she would be fair and impartial despite her husband\u2019s family history.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201cJury impartiality is a core requirement of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . The modern jury is regarded as an institution in our justice system that determines the case solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments given [it] in the adversary arena after proper instructions on the law by the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 330, 715 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The integrity of our criminal justice system relies on a fair and impartial jury. \u201c[A]n impartial and fairly chosen jury is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eisenbach </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>45 Conn. App. 165, 172, 694 A.2d 1376, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 926, 696 A.2d 1264 (1997). To this end, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>common law allows parties to challenge the seating of a juror peremptorily or for cause. Having exhausted his peremptory challenges, the defendant raised a challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The challenge for cause exists in two forms, the principal challenge and the challenge to the favor. The principal challenge is based on an inextricably close relation between a prospective juror and a party such that disqualification will be a matter of law. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>St. Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center, </em>216 Conn. 621, 624, 583 A.2d 630 (1990). A challenge to the favor involves a more remote relationship that tends to show bias but does not create a conclusive presumption. Id. The defendant here raises the latter challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u201cThe trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the competency of jurors to serve, and that judgment will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn. 81, 88-89, 523 A.2d 495 (1987). The defendant bears the burden of proving actual bias by showing that the prospective juror\u2019s mind was settled and his opinion fixed so as not to be able to judge the defendant\u2019s guilt impartially. <em>Eisenbach </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The voir dire examination of T did not establish bias or prejudice on her part. Quite the contrary, T\u2019s responses to the voir dire examination indicated that her mind and opinion would be fixed only by the evidence presented at trial and the instructions of the judge. T unambiguously stated that despite her family history, she could and would fairly and impartially judge the defendant\u2019s guilt according to the law. The defendant has failed to show that T\u2019s general aversion to drinking and driving created any particularized prejudice to him or influenced her ability fairly to weigh the evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>We conclude that the trial court acted within its broad discretion in refusing to excuse T for cause, the defendant having not established actual bias on her part.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The defendant next claims that the results of his urinalyses should have been excluded because they failed to meet the admissibility requirements of <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on evidence and its rulings will be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>36 Conn. App. 76, 82, 647 A.2d 1021 (1994), appeal dismissed, 233 Conn. 302, 659 A.2d 706 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">After the trial court denied the motion to suppress the test results, which the defendant based on the tests\u2019 alleged failure to meet the statutory requirements for admission of a chemical test, the defendant orally moved to suppress the test results on <em>Frye </em>grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The defendant\u2019s chief complaint is that the test results are inaccurate and unreliable because he was not allowed to void his bladder prior to giving each urine sample. The state contends that Connecticut\u2019s two test requirement alleviates the problem because the first sample effectively selves as a void for the second sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Our examination of the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s admission of the test results essentially rests on its finding that the state had met the requirements of \u00a7 14-227a (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have previously noted that \u201c[t]he admissibility of chemical analyses is controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c), which lists six factors that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>must be met before such evidence is deemed admissible and competent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>30 Conn. App. 428, 438-39, 620 A.2d 822 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 228, 640 A.2d 61 (1994). On the basis of the factual allegations, the trial court found that the statutory criteria were met. Because \u00a7 14-227a provides the exclusive grounds for admission of chemical analyses, the trial court properly admitted the test results when it determined that those criteria had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Even if \u00a7 14-227a were not the only condition for admission, the trial court properly admitted the urinalysis results under the <em>Frye </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Under the <em>Frye </em>test for admissibility, the scientific basis for certain evidence must be \u201csufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 293 F. 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">During a brief <em>Frye </em>hearing, the trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s objections went to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence and refused to exclude the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The factual determination of whether scientific evidence meets the <em>Frye </em>standard is properly the trial court\u2019s province. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zollo, </em>36 Conn. App. 718, 726, 654 A.2d 359, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 906, 660 A.2d 859 (1995). \u201cAlthough we will review a trial court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>as to whether a <em>Frye </em>finding must be made, we will not conduct an appellate level review of the facts relating to a <em>Frye </em>finding.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The facts asserted during the hearing provide adequate support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia and improperly held that the screenless wooden pipe found on his person constituted drug paraphernalia as defined by statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">This issue presents a question of statutory interpretation and is therefore subject to our plenary review. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Incident to a lawful arrest, the police searched the defendant and seized a wooden pipe on his person. Although a trained and experienced police officer indicated that the pipe appeared to be a marijuana \u201cbowl,\u201d and although laboratory tests confirmed that the pipe was used to smoke marijuana, the defendant maintains that the pipe falls outside the statutory definition of drug paraphernalia because it lacks a screen. Because the statute explicitly lists only \u201cpipes with screens,\u201d the defendant argues that a pipe without a screen is not drug paraphernalia even if that pipe is used to consume drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">General Statutes \u00a7 21a-240 (20) (A) provides the operative definition, which uses the phrase \u201cpipes with screens.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>definition comprises only those pipes that have screens and excludes all other pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">A primaiy rule of statutory construction is that when the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous they should be given full effect. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). This statute uses expansive words of inclusion. Drug paraphernalia comprises \u201cequipment, products and materials of any kind . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 21a-240 (20) (A). The definition also uses \u201csuch as\u201d and \u201cincluding, but not limited to . . . .\u201d Id. These phrases convey a clear intention that the items listed in the definition do not constitute an exhaustive or exclusive list.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Although \u201cincluding\u201d has been found to be ambiguous by itself, other language may remove the ambiguity, as in this case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 422-23, 528 A.2d 811 (1987). By adding the phrase, \u201cbut not limited to,\u201d the statute clearly indicates that \u201cincluding\u201d is meant as a term of expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Several other tenets of statutory construction are instructive here. Courts must give effect to a statute such that its purpose is not frustrated and the results are not absurd. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 437-38, 668 A.2d 348 (1995). The defendant\u2019s pipe was used to smoke marijuana. The legislature clearly did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>not intend that a possessor of a marijuana pipe be able to escape liability by merely removing a screen, which does not apparently affect its use in any way. It simply makes no sense that the legislature would outlaw apipe with a screen but not a screenless pipe unless the screen was essential to the pipe. No one here has suggested that the absence of a screen renders a pipe ineffective for smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The doctrine of ejusdem generis also supports the trial court\u2019s determination. \u201cAccording to this doctrine, unless a contrary intent appears, where general terms are followed by specific terms in a statute, the general terms will be construed to embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 438. A wooden pipe used for smoking marijuana most certainly falls within the same class as the other listed items.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The trial court properly found the defendant\u2019s pipe to be within the purview of the statute. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court improperly denied his application to participate in a community service program.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Several additional facts are necessary to understand our disposition of this issue. On February 7, 1997, the state filed an amended information charging the defendant with the additional charge of possession of a controlled substance. On February 13, 1997, the defendant moved to strike the added count of the information on the grounds of prejudice. The court denied the motion to strike. The prosecution offered its toxicology report on February 14, 1993. On February 21, 1997, after the evidentiary phase of the trial had closed, the defendant applied for the community service order.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39c<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> establishes a community service program for persons charged with violations of \u00a7 2 la-279. Applications for this program are left to the discretion of the trial court. We review the trial court\u2019s decision under an abuse of discretion standard, and we conclude that the trial court did act within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant\u2019s application was made after the evidence had been heard and after the trial was nearly complete. Although the defendant\u2019s timing does not automatically disqualify him from participation in the program, it does provide the trial court with ample justification for denying his application. The language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of the statute makes clear that the community service program is intended to avoid unnecessary trials and expenditures of resources. The trial court, having found that all parties had made a substantial investment in the trial, acted well within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides: \u201cNoperson shall operateamotor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.

She wasn\u2019t even equivocal about it. She said she would. . . . The fact that she may be conservative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>about the issue is basically telling us that she\u2019s a law-abiding person. I think most people would say, if you asked them, that they approve of the law that says you shouldn\u2019t drink and drive a motor vehicle after you\u2019ve been under the influence. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2014every citizen would probably say that, everybody that comes through here would say that, and I don\u2019t think that the fact that she has those experiences, unless those experiences make us think that she can\u2019t be fair or impartial, but it\u2019s just the opposite. She said she has those experiences, but she could be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I think by implication she told us that she can\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t choose herself, and based on those experiences. I mean, true, a lot of people come here with conservative attitudes with respect to alcohol and drugs, and there isn\u2019t any problem whatsoever with that, but not everybody comes here with a father-in-law who was involved in a drunken driving accident and a brother-in-law who committed suicide while drinking. I mean, I think that\u2019s a rarity with respect to personal experiences, and I think those are pretty heavy personal experiences, and here\u2019s a case that involves exactly that. I mean it involves the allegation of driving while under the influence of alcohol. So, I just think that by implication when she answered that question she wouldn\u2019t choose herself, she\u2019s telling us that.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I think what she meant when she said that was she said she\u2019s conservative. She would probably rather have somebody more liberal than she on the jury to make that determination, but she didn\u2019t say she wouldn\u2019t\u2014that she would be unfair at all. She said just the opposite. She would be fair. She\u2019d listen to the case, she would follow the judge\u2019s instructions. I\u2019m going to decline your request to excuse her.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b155-14\"> \u201cJust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define.
