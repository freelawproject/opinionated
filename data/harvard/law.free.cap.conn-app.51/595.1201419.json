The respondent claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to make a finding that the petitioner had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or, alternatively, that the respondent was unwilling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>or unable to benefit from such reunification efforts, (2) found that no ongoing parent-child relationship existed between the respondent and the children, (3) found that the children had been harmed as a result of the respondent\u2019s acts of omission or commission, (4) found that the respondent had failed to achieve personal rehabilitation, and (5) denied the respondent\u2019s motion to stay the petitioner\u2019s decision to end visits without allowing testimony or argument. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The respondent is the mother of six children, including Tabitha and Christina. She first married before she was sixteen. She had two children prior to her divorce in 1977. She then had two sons by another man. In 1987, she married the father of Tabitha and Christina, who were born in 1986 and 1988, respectively. She and the father are now divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The respondent has a history of personal and mental health problems. As a child, she was sexually abused by her father. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She has also been hospitalized for suicide attempts, including a 1994 incident in which she attempted to drown herself. She has been evicted four times and suffered three house fires. She has voluntarily requested placement by the department for each of her six children on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">In August, 1996, Bruce Freedman, a psychologist who had been appointed by the court to evaluate the respondent and the two girls, reported that the respondent had not been adequately rehabilitated, had received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>poor marks from her parenting skills instructor, and was incapable of handling Tabitha or Christina. Freedman also reported the lack of a normal parent-child relationship and that both girls wanted not to return to their mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Both Tabitha and Christina were sexually abused by their brothers. When their father lived with them, he physically abused both girls and sexually abused Christina. Both girls now suffer from mental disorders. Prior to her placement, Tabitha wet and soiled her clothes. She was diagnosed as learning disabled. Also, the respondent\u2019s needs and inabilities have resulted in an unhealthy \u201cparentification\u201d of Tabitha. Christina was diagnosed as suffering from reactive attachment disorder and exhibits sexualized behavior that has concerned her counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On January 31,1995, Tabitha and Christina were adjudicated neglected and committed to the care of the department of children and families. On June 26, 1996, the department petitioned the court for the termination of parental rights with respect to the girls. The court ordered the termination of parental rights on October 23, 1997, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\u201cThe hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. See Practice Book \u00a7 1042.1 et seq. [now \u00a7 33-1 et seq.]. In the adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether the statutory ground for termination of parental rights exists by clear and convincing evidence. If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court determines whether the termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. <em>In re Maximina V., </em>44 Conn. App. 80, 82-83, 686 A.2d 1005 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u201cOn appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached . . . nor do we retry the case or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, on review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . [W]e will disturb the findings of the trial court in both the adjudication and disposition phases only if they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\u201d <em>In re Drew R., </em>47 Conn. App. 124, 127-28, 702 A.2d 647 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The respondent first claims that the trial court failed in the adjudicatory phase to find that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the family. Alternatively, the respondent claims that the court improperly found that she was unable to benefit from reunification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">As part of the adjudication process, \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (1) requires that the court find by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cBefore a termination of parental rights can be granted, the trial court must be convinced that the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the child with his or her family. The term \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 was recently addressed by this court: \u2018Turning to the statutory scheme encompassing the termination of the parental rights of a child committed to the department, the statute imposes on the department the duty, inter alia, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department\u2019s efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word \u201creasonable\u201d nor the word \u201cefforts\u201d is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\u2019 <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn. App. 290, 311-12, 710 A.2d 771, cert. granted on other grounds, 245 Conn. 917, 717 A.2d 234 (1998). The trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue should not be disturbed on appeal unless, in light of the evidence in the entire record, it is clearly erroneous. <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>39 Conn. App. 353, 361, 664 A.2d 1168 (1995).\u201d <em>In re Jessica B., </em>50 Conn. App. 554, 565-66, 718 A.2d 997 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In light of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision and subsequent articulation, we are not persuaded either that the trial court failed to consider whether reasonable efforts had been made or that its conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the department had made reasonable efforts to reunite the family was clearly erroneous. The trial court\u2019s articulation of June 17, 1998, provides a list of the services provided to the respondent, including psychiatric hospitalization, individual counseling, parenting classes, visitation and transportation. Foster care, visitation and counseling were also provided to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The respondent next claims that the court improperly found that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\u201cSection 17a-112 (b) (4) [now \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (D)] provides for the termination of parental rights if, upon clear and convincing evidence, it is proved that no ongoing parent-child relationship has existed in excess of one year. This part of the statute requires the trial court to undertake a two-pronged analysis. First, there must be a determination that no parent-child relationship exists, and second, the court must look into the future and determine whether it would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest to allow time for such a relationship to develop. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>[177 Conn. 648, 670, 420 A.2d 875 (1979)]; <em>In re Michael M., </em>[29 Conn. App. 112, 128, 614 A.2d 832 (1992)]; <em>In re Megan M., </em>[24 Conn. App. 338, 340, 588 A.2d 239 (1991)]; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-6), </em>2 Conn. App. 705, 708, 483 A.2d 1101 (1984), cert. denied, 195 Conn. 801, 487 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 477, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u201cIt is reasonable to read the language of no ongoing parent-child relationship to contemplate a situation in which, regardless of fault, a child either has never known his or her parents, so that no relationship has ever developed between them, or has definitively lost that relationship, so that despite its former existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>it has now been completely displaced. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>[supra, 177 Conn. 670]; <em>In re Jessica M., </em>217 Conn. 459, 470, 586 A.2d 597 (1991); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-6), </em>supra, [2 Conn. App.] 708-709. In considering whether an ongoing parent-child relationship exists, the feelings of the child are of paramount importance. See <em>In re Michael M., </em>[supra, 29 Conn. App. 129]; <em>In re Megan M., </em>[supra, 24 Conn. App. 341]. The ultimate question is whether the child has no present memories or feelings for the natural parent. <em>In re Jessica M., </em>supra, 468; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-6), </em>supra, 709. Feelings for the natural parent connotes feelings of a positive nature only. <em>In re Jessica M., </em>supra, 469; <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-6), supra.\u201dIn re Kezia M., </em>33 Conn. App. 12, 20-21, 632 A.2d 1122, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 915, 636 A.2d 847 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The court-appointed evaluator, Freedman, reported that \u201c[t]he girls showed concern for their mother . . . but they did not show normal parent-child relationships.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[b]oth girls made it clear that they did not wish to return to mother\u2019s care, now or in the future.\u201d We cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The respondent claims that the trial court improperly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that she had failed to achieve sufficient rehabilitation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Section 17a-112 \u201crequires the trial court to analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. ... A determination by the trial court . . . that the evidence is clear and convincing that the parent has not rehabilitated herself will be disturbed only if that finding is not supported by the evidence and [is], in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Christina V., </em>38 Conn. App. 214, 221, 660 A.2d 863 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The record clearly supports the trial court\u2019s finding. Contrary to the respondent\u2019s assertions, she did not meet the expectations set by the court in its January, 1995 neglect hearing with respect to the girls. Betty Gorman, an employee of the department of children and families, testified that the respondent attended individual therapy only sporadically, lapsed in her medication regime \u201cmany times,\u201d sometimes acted inappropriately during visits with the children, and failed to secure and maintain housing \u201cfor quite a period of time.\u201d Although another department worker, Paulette Marquis, testified that the respondent had largely complied with the court\u2019s expectations over the past nine months, Freedman noted that her efforts were \u201cfar from effective, adequate rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">On the basis of our review of the record, we are not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s determination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The respondent claims that the trial court improperly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Tabitha and Christina had been harmed as a result of the respondent\u2019s acts of omission or commission. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">On the basis of our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. While the children were in the respondent\u2019s care, the respondent failed to protect them from sexual abuse by their older brothers. At one point, the respondent specifically told Tabitha not to disclose to therapist Martha Roberts anything about the sexual abuse or any other goings on of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Finally, the respondent claims that the court improperly denied her motion \u201cto stay the [department\u2019s] decision to end visits without allowing argument or testimony.\u201d She offers no analysis or authority to support this claim. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 44-45, 699 A.2d 101 (1997). Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Twin Tool Mfg. Co., </em>40 Conn. App. 36, 45, 668 A.2d 1346 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>47 Conn. App. 542, 558, 706 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 908, 713 A.2d 829 (1998). We, therefore, decline to review her claim as inadequately briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 was amended both in 1995; Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3; and in 1996.

General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3, provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) The superior court upon hearing and notice . . . may grant such petition [for termination of parental rights] if it finds that the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent and, upon clear and convincing evidence, that the termination is in the best interest of the child . . . .\u201d That statute was further amended by Public Acts 1996, No. 96-246, \u00a7 18.

The trial on the petitions in this case took place during 1997, and the trial court\u2019s references to \u00a7 17a-112 are to the revision of 1997. In this opinion, we also refer to \u00a7 17a-112 as codified in the revision to 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> With regard to petitions filed prior to October 1, 1996, the court was required to find that the department \u201cmade reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent\u201d unless \u201csuch reasonable efforts at reunification were not possible. . .

Because the petitions in this case were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>filed prior to October 1, 1996, the court\u2019s finding that the respondent was unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts would not have excused the department\u2019s failure to make such efforts. Because we hold, however, that the trial court correctly found that the department did malee reasonable efforts to reunite the family, we need not consider whether the court correctly made the alternative finding\u2014that the parent is unable to benefit from reunification. We note, however, that the record indicates that the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent was unable to benefit from reunification was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
