The principal issue on appeal is whether the trial judge was required to recuse himself, sua sponte, from the March 4, 1996 revocation proceeding because he had heard the defendant admit in open court on January 31, 1996, that the defendant had failed two drug tests while on probation. Because the defendant failed to preserve the issue for appeal and because we find no plain error, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>In an information dated August 9, 1993, the state charged the defendant with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53U-70.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded not guilty and elected a jury trial. On August 5, 1994, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge of sexual assault under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Kulawiz, J., </em>committed the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a term of twelve years, execution suspended after sixteen months, and three years of probation with special conditions, primarily sex offender counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On the basis of a warrant affidavit sworn out by the defendant\u2019s probation officer, Eduardo Palmieri, stating that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation, the state filed an information dated November 20, 1995, charging the defendant with violation of probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>was arrested, and a denial of the charge was entered on December 26, 1995. On the same date, the trial court appointed a public defender for the probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">On January 31,1996, the state informed the trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>that it had been unable to reach an agreement with the defendant and asked that the case be set down for a probation revocation hearing. The defendant\u2019s attorney, when asked if he wanted to be heard, replied that he did not at that time, but indicated that his client wanted to address the court. The defendant then admitted that he had violated the conditions of his probation by using illegal drugs. The defendant stated: \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m guilty of these dirty urines and as a result I\u2019m trying to gethelp. DayTop [asubstance abuse program] has accepted me, willing to take me in that program upon Your Honor granting it.\u201d The court then responded: \u201cMr. McDuffie, you got into the program before you got the dirty urines. I\u2019m not going to put you in a program. You\u2019re going to have a hearing on March 4, [1996], okay. You should have gone into the program before you got the dirty urines.\u201d This statement by the court is the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">On March 4, 1996, an evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Damiani pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32 to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>whether the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. The trial court heard testimony from Palmieri regarding the defendant\u2019s conditions of probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Palmieri also testified that the defendant missed several appointments with his probation officer, missed appointments at his required sexual offender counseling and had used illegal substances in violation of his probation conditions. The defendant offered no testimony or evidence on his own behalf. On the basis of Palmieri\u2019s uncontroverted testimony, the trial court held that the defendant wilfully and intentionally violated the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">After the trial court found that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation, defense counsel moved for a continuance to prepare additional information, which the trial court could consider in sentencing the defendant. The trial court initially denied the motion, but then reconsidered. The following colloquy took place between defense counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, the mere fact that the court has discretion in imposing the sentence on a violation of probation indicates that the legislature anticipated that the court could take into consideration not only the fact that there was a violation, but other information as well. I would like the opportunity to prepare that information so I could present it to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cThe Court: . . . Fine, I\u2019ll give you time. All I can tell you is that my view is that a person who receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>a sentence and gets the luxury of going on probation, I\u2019ll listen to you, but I can only tell you it\u2019s an uphill battle on your part. What date would you like?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">At the sentencing hearing, in addition to arguments from the state and defense counsel, the trial court allowed the defendant to speak on his own behalf. The defendant again admitted that he had violated the conditions of his probation. At the close of arguments, the trial court stated that the defendant was \u201cnot amenable to further probation.\u201d The trial court then opened and revoked the original sentence, and committed the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a period of 114 months, approximately 90 percent of the defendant\u2019s outstanding sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The defendant claims that the statements by the trial judge during the January 31, 1996 hearing \u201ccast serious doubt on his impartiality [and] that he committed plain error in not recusing himself prior to the revocation hearing.\u201d The defendant also claims that the judge violated canon 3 (c) (1) (A)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>of the Code of Judicial Conduct by not recusing himself. The defendant failed to raise either claim at the hearing.\u00ae He now seeks review based on the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We will address the claims together.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 1-22 and 1-23, formerly \u00a7\u00a7 996 and 997, clearly provide that a motion for recusal shall be made prior to the trial or hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cIt is well settled that courts will not review a claim of judicial bias on appeal unless that claim was properly presented to the trial court through a motion for disqualification or a motion for mistrial. See <em>Knock </em>v. <em>Knock, </em>224 Conn. 776, 792, 621 A.2d 267 (1993); <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>214 Conn. 336, 343, 572 A.2d 323 (1990); <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). . . . Absent plain error, a claim of judicial bias cannot be reviewed on appeal unless preserved in the trial court. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>supra, 168.\u201d <em>Small </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>42 Conn. App. 660, 663, 680 A.2d 344 (1996).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cTo prevail under the plain error doctrine, the defendant must demonstrate that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice. . . . This doctrine is not implicated and review of the claimed error is not undertaken unless the error is so obvious that it affects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lindstrom, </em>46 Conn. App. 810, 817, 702 A.2d 410, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 947, 704 A.2d 802 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s statement at the January 31,1996 hearing \u201cconstituted a prejudgment opinion and decision that he would never at any time consider the sentencing option of continuing the defendant on intensive probation . . . .\u201d \u201cBecause the court, rather than a jury, sits as the trier of fact in a probation revocation hearing, \u2018we presume, absent an affirmative showing to the contrary, that the . . . court can put aside whatever impressions [it] may have about the [defendant] and grant him a fair hearing.\u2019 <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 414, 559 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 107 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>42 Conn. App. 768, 776, 682 A.2d 521 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 243 Conn. 339, 703 A.2d 109 (1997). We decline to review this claim under the plain error doctrine because we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s conduct did not affect the fairness or integrity of the proceedings, nor did it result in manifest injustice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). A defendant who pleads guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine does not admit guilt, but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 359 n.1, 497 A.2d 402 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 169 n.3, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge, or may issue a notice to appear to answer to a charge of such violation, which notice shall be personally served upon the defendant. Any such warrant shall authorize all officers named therein to return the defendant to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court. . . . Thereupon, or upon an arrest by warrant as herein provided, the court shall cause the defendant to be brought before it without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the violation charges. At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which he is alleged to have violated the conditions of his probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the court that he has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201c(b) If such violation is established, the court may: (1) Continue the sentence of probation or conditional discharge; (2) modify or enlarge the conditions of probation or conditional discharge; (3) extend the period of probation or conditional discharge, provided the original period with any extensions shall not exceed the periods authorized by section 53a-29; or (4) revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge. If such sentence is revoked, the court shall require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. No such revocation shall be ordered, except upon consideration of the whole record and unless such violation is established by the introduction of reliable and probative evidence and by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\"> The relevant conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation are as follows: \u201c1.

Submit to any medical and/or psychological examination, urinalysis, and/or counseling sessions as required by the court and submit to any alcohol and/or drug testing required by the probation officer. \u201d Additionally, the trial court entered the special condition that the defendant attend a sex offender treatment program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\"> Canon 3 provides in relevant part: \u201c(c) Disqualification.
