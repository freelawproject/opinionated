The convictions were based on the defendant\u2019s conditional plea of nolo contendere and written reservation entered into pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a and Practice Book \u00a7 61-6. Pursuant to those provisions, the defendant reserved for review his motions to dismiss, which challenged the constitutionality of the automatic transfer provision of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The defendant presents two claims on appeal. The first challenges the constitutionality of the automatic transfer provision of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (a). Our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Angel C., </em>245 Conn. 93, 715 A.2d 652 (1998), is controlling with regard to that issue and requires affirmance of the trial court\u2019s decision. The second claim is that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the defendant\u2019s application for youthful offender status under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-76b through 54-76o. As the defendant conceded at oral argument, his appeal is limited by the conditional plea and written reservation. Neither General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a nor Practice Book \u00a7 61-6 encompasses the claim regarding the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in denying youthful offender status to the defendant. Accordingly, this claim is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
