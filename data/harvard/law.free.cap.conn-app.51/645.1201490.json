Peterson, appeals from the judgments rendered following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) rejected his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without holding an evidentiary hearing and (2) advised him of the minimum sentences for the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The following facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this appeal. The defendant was arrested on two separate occasions and charged each time with sexual assault in the first degree for forcing two different women to submit to sexual intercourse at knifepoint. On October 26, 1994, the defendant failed to appear for the scheduled court date for the first case. The defendant was subsequently apprehended and arraigned on December 13, 1995. On August 16, 1996, the parties entered into a plea agreement for two counts of first degree sexual assault and one count of failure to appear in the first degree. The defendant entered a guilty plea to those counts under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Subsequently, the defendant attempted to withdraw his guilty plea through a letter addressed to the trial court claiming, inter alia, that his attorney (1) had failed to inform him about evidence, (2) had failed to visit him in prison and (3) had not allowed him to consult with his family before entering his plea. In his letter, the defendant also requested new counsel. The defendant made a second attempt to withdraw his guilty plea through a letter to the court clerk, dated September 3, 1996, giving as a reason that he was on medication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>at the time he entered into the plea agreement. On September 18, 1996, the defendant\u2019s attorney withdrew from the case, with the court\u2019s permission, after the defendant filed a grievance against him; thereafter, a new special public defender was appointed to represent the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">On September 27, 1996, the trial court treated the defendant\u2019s second letter requesting a withdrawal from the plea agreement as a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and the defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement. Also, that same day, the trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twenty-five years, execution suspended after fourteen years, and five years probation. This appeal followed. Other facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without affording him an evidentiary hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">We must first address whether this unpreserved claim is reviewable. The defendant\u2019s letter, treated by the court as a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea, did not request an evidentiary hearing. Prior to the commencement of the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the trial court addressed the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The defendant was represented at this hearing by counsel. No request for an evidentiary hearing, however, was made by the defendant or his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">On appeal, the issue of whether the trial court acted within its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea is reviewable despite the defendant\u2019s fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ure to request an evidentiary hearing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 612, 504 A.2d 497 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>22 Conn. App. 531, 534, 578 A.2d 152, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 823, 581 A.2d 1057 (1990). <em>In Safford, </em>we rejected the state\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing was not reviewable because the defendant did not request an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea. <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>supra, 534. In <em>Safford, </em>the state cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 598, as support for its argument that the issue is not reviewable. We found the state\u2019s argument in <em>Safford </em>to be meritless because <em>Watson </em>\u201ccan be read to suggest no more than that the defendant\u2019s failure to request an evidentiary hearing is a consideration to be weighed by the reviewing court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>supra, 534. In <em>Safford, </em>we reviewed the defendant\u2019s claim because the defendant \u201cpreserved this claim by moving to withdraw the plea, and adequately briefed the issue in this court.\u201d Id. Similarly, in this case, even though the defendant did not request an evidentiary hearing, because the defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea and adequately briefed this issue on appeal, the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We next turn to whether the trial court\u2019s failure to provide the defendant with an evidentiary hearing constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Prior to the acceptance of a guilty plea, a defendant may withdraw it as a matter of right. Practice Book \u00a7 39-26.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a plea has been accepted by the trial court, but before the defendant\u2019s sentencing, the trial court is obligated to permit the defendant to withdraw a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>plea only upon proof of one of the grounds set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 39-27.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201cWhere the record of the plea proceeding and other information in the court file conclusively establish that the motion is without merit, the trial court may dispose of the motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980), citing <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 213, 215, 93 S. Ct. 1461, 36 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1973); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>20 Conn. App. 630, 633, 569 A.2d 1140 [cert. denied, 215 Conn. 818, 576 A.2d 547] (1990).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>supra, 22 Conn. App. 534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In the present case, the defendant, in moving to withdraw his plea, alleged that he \u201cwas coerced by [his attorney]\u201d and that he \u201cwas on medication\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t actually in [his] right mind\u201d when he made his plea agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant, through his new counsel, asserted that due to the effects of the medication that he had been prescribed in relation to a hernia operation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>he did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently enter into the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw, the trial court relied on the defendant\u2019s responses during his plea canvass.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, in its memorandum of decision, the trial court reasoned that the defendant\u2019s plea agreement was voluntary on the basis of \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s responses to the court\u2019s questions during the plea canvass that occurred on August 16, 1996,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) counsels\u2019 statements on the record that there was no reason why the plea should not be accepted<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the trial court\u2019s observations of the defendant during the plea canvass.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[i]n considering whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea the court may disregard any allegations of fact, whether contained in the motion or made in an offer of proof, which are either conclusory, vague or oblique.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 185. In the present case, the defendant failed to offer any factual support for his allegation that he was under the influence of medicine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant\u2019s allegations that he was under the influence of drugs and involuntarily entered into the plea agreement were conclusory and not supported by specific facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cbare assertion that he was using drugs and that he therefore did not understand the questions asked or the nature of the plea was insufficient for the court to have ordered an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>199 Conn. 359, 363, 507 A.2d 992 (1986). In the present case, no evidence was offered to the trial court to support the defendant\u2019s allegations; the trial court was offered only the defendant\u2019s bare assertion that he was using drugs at the time of his plea agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>After reviewing the record of the plea canvass and the proceedings on the motion to withdraw the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in not holding an evidentiary hearing before ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The defendant\u2019s allegations that he was under the influence of drugs and involuntarily entered into the plea agreements are conclusory and are not supported by specific facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court inadequately advised the defendant as to the minimum sentences for the charges to which he pleaded guilty. The defendant argues that his plea agreement was not knowingly and voluntarily made and, therefore, he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to inform him that the one year mandatory minimum sentence that accompanied the crime of sexual assault in the first degree was not suspendable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, the defendant argues that the trial court tailed to inform him that the failure to appear charge to which he pleaded guilty required the imposition of a one year sentence.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that this claim is not properly preserved for appellate review and seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\u201cThe <em>Golding </em>court held that when a defendant fails to preserve his claim at trial he can prevail on that claim only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . When any one of these conditions is not met, the defendant cannot prevail.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <em>omitted.) State v. Velez, </em>30 Conn. App. 9, 20-21, 618 A.2d 1362, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 907, 621 A.2d 289 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u201cThe first two questions relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Manfredi, </em>17 Conn. App. 602, 621, 555 A.2d 436 (1989), aff'd, 213 Conn. 500, 569 A.2d 506, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 818, 111 S. Ct. 62, 112 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1990). In this case, the first prong of <em>Golding </em>is satisfied, as the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The defendant\u2019s claim that his plea agreement was not knowingly and voluntarily made because of the trial court\u2019s failure to advise him properly of mandatory minimum sentences is an appropriate claim for constitutional review pursuant to the <em>Golding </em>doctrine. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Domian, </em>35 Conn. App. 714, 719, 646 A.2d 940 (1994), aff'd, 235 Conn. 679, 668 A.2d 1333 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 119, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983). Because the defendant\u2019s claim is of constitutional magnitude and the record is adequate for review, we will review the claim. The defendant\u2019s claim, however, fails under the third requirement of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\u201cA guilty plea is itself a conviction; <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>203 Conn. 484, 489, 525 A.2d 1315 (1987); and a defendant, when entering such a plea, waives several constitutional rights. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra [489]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>[202 Conn. 369, 381, 521 A.2d 547 (1987)]. First is the privilege against self-incrimination, second is the right to a jury trial, and third is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra [243]; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra [466]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 381 n.14. To ensure that a defendant is accorded due process, [therefore] the plea must be voluntarily and intelligently entered. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 243 n.5; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra [466]; <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra [489]; <em>Oppel </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>200 Conn. 553, 556, 512 A.2d 888 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>[200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>197 Conn. 337, 341-42, 497 A.2d 390 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 287, 542 A.2d 299 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Domian, </em>235 Conn. 679, 686, 668 A.2d 1333 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">\u201cBecause it cannot be presumed from a silent record that the decision to plead guilty was the product of the defendant\u2019s \u2018full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence\u2019; <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 243-44; \u2018the federal constitution requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that the record of the plea canvass indicate the voluntariness of any waiver of the three core constitutional rights [implicated by the guilty plea].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 418. To ensure that this constitutional requirement is satisfied, the trial court is obliged to comply with the dictates of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7711 [now \u00a7 39-19] and 712 [now \u00a7 39-20],<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which enumerate the responsibilities of the court in conducting the plea canvass. However, because the \u2018determination as to whether a plea has been knowingly and voluntarily entered entails an examination of all of the relevant circumstances\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 287; the plea may satisfy constitutional requirements even in the absence of \u2018literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 [now \u00a7 39-19] and 712 [now \u00a7 39-20].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 418.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Domian, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Thus, to discern whether the defendant\u2019s claims are sufficient to satisfy the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>we must determine \u201cwhether the defendant was aware of actual sentencing possibilities, and, if not, whether accurate information would have made any difference in his decision to enter a [guilty] plea.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 688. The defendant first claims that failure of the trial court to inform him that the one year minimum sentence for sexual assault could not be suspended interfered with the knowing nature of his plea. The defendant further maintains that the failure of the trial court to inform him of the one year mandatory minimum sentence for the failure to appear charge also interfered with the knowing nature of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">At his plea canvass hearing, the trial court ensured that the defendant\u2019s plea was voluntary by personally addressing the defendant to ascertain whether he was under the influence of drugs or medication.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Next, the trial court ensured that the defendant had sufficient time to talk with his lawyer and to think about his decision to plead guilty. The trial court then informed the defendant of the elements of the crimes of sexual assault and failure to appear.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court enumer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ated the rights that the defendant was giving up by pleading guilty to the charges and ensured that the guilty plea was of the defendant\u2019s own free will. The trial court also advised the defendant that \u201con these three charges, you could face as long as forty-five years imprisonment, one year of which would be mandatory . . . .\u201d The trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s plea as knowing and voluntary, and found the plea to be supported by a factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We conclude that, even though the defendant was not specifically apprised of the mandatory minimum sentence for his failure to appear charge, nothing in the record or trial court proceedings suggests that the defendant was unaware of the actual sentencing possibilities in his case. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that any possible ambiguity in the record prejudiced the defendant. We conclude, therefore, that more information concerning the nonsuspendable one year minimum sentence for sexual assault and the one year minimum sentence for failure to appear would not have made any difference in the defendant\u2019s decision to enter a guilty plea. Therefore, we conclude that the alleged constitutional violation did not clearly exist and did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We next consider whether these issues are entitled to review under the plain error doctrine. The defendant argues, in the alternative to review under <em>Golding, </em>that plain error review is warranted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\u201cWhere a trial court\u2019s action does not result in any manifest injustice, a defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine does not warrant review. . . . Such review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 692. Plain error review is not warranted here because the defendant has failed to show that his guilty plea was not entered knowingly or voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"><em> North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). \u201cA defendant pleading under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine neither admits his guilt nor protests his innocence. Instead, a defendant merely acknowledges that the state has evidence sufficient to obtain a conviction and therefore chooses to plead guilty in order to avoid the imposition of a possibly more serious punishment after trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ells, </em>39 Conn.

And I was on medication and I brought the records right here from the facility. I had an operation prior to that date and I was prescribed medication. So I wasn\u2019t actually in my right mind when I took the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Although the defendant asserted that he was in possession of \u201crecords from the facility,\u201d no records of any kind were offered into evidence to support the defendant\u2019s claim.

That offense is a class B felony and it carries a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment, one year of which is mandatory, and a maximum fine of up to $15,000. Failure to appear in the first degree prohibits someone from willingly failing to come to court when they are charged with (he commission of a felony. A felony is an offense that carries a penalty of greater than one year and so the sexual assault in the first degree charge would qualify under a penally under Connecticut law as wilfully failing to appear in court. When you\u2019re charged with a felony that is a class D felony which carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and or a fine of up to $5000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
