We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On September 15, 1994, the trial court issued a search and seizure warrant to search the first floor apartment at 54 Crown Street in Waterbury after determining that probable cause existed. The defendant\u2019s arrest stemmed from the seizure of a handgun, ammunition, bloody clothing, photographs and a wallet from the apartment following the execution of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a revolver, a brown bloodstained sweatshirt with the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cBrowns\u201d printed in orange letters, photographs of the interior of the apartment and a black wallet containing personal papers belonging to the defendant that the state argued was seized under the plain view doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion to suppress as to the gun, ammunition and bloody clothing, but granted it as to the wallet and its contents because the plain view doctrine was inapplicable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that \u201cthe affidavit by the police officers plus the reasonable inferences necessarily drawn by the magistrate furnished a substantial factual basis for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed to search for the gun, ammunition and bloody clothing.\u201d Other facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the sweatshirt seized within the apartment. Specifically, the defendant claims that the affidavit in support of the search warrant (1) failed to establish probable cause and (2), in the alternative, was based on \u201cstale\u201d information.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The warrant application affidavit set forth the following facts. On September 14, 1994, an investigation led the police to the Crown Street apartment, the possible location of robbery suspects. After the police discovered that one of the residents, Demarise Williams, fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the description of one of the robbery suspects, Williams was arrested under a valid arrest warrant for a separate incident. When questioned, Williams told police that he had knowledge of a recent homicide and robbery, and detailed the events that transpired on September 12, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Williams revealed that on September 12, 1994, at approximately 10 p.m., the defendant came into the apartment in Waterbury where Williams and his girlfriend, Darlene Saunders, were watching television. The defendant told Williams that he wanted Williams to go with him to rob a man who was sitting on the wall by a nearby church. Williams noticed that the defendant was in possession of a gun. The defendant and Williams walked to the church wall, which was located at the corner of Beacon and Crown Streets, a short distance from the apartment. Williams walked part of the way across the street with the defendant. The defendant walked up to the victim, stood directly in front of him and told him to take everything out of his pockets. When the victim failed to follow the directions, the defendant shot him twice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Williams ran back to the apartment where he met Saunders. The defendant followed Williams to the apartment, where he talked and laughed about the shooting to Williams. The defendant then remained at the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The affidavit also contained information provided by Saunders regarding the defendant\u2019s presence in the apartment prior to and after the shooting. Saunders reported that upon the defendant\u2019s return to the apartment after the shooting, the defendant told her that he had shot a man six times in the chest. Although the victim had claimed to have no money, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>told Saunders that he knew that the victim had money by the way he was patting his pockets. Saunders informed the defendant that she was going to see if anyone was hurt and then contact the police. The defendant told Saunders that if she informed the police, she would not leave the apartment alive. The following morning, on September 13, 1994, Saunders notified the defendant that the man he had shot the night before had died. The defendant left the apartment in the early afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Initially, the defendant claims that the affidavit failed to set forth facts supporting a finding of probable cause for the seizure of the sweatshirt because there was no \u201ccredible or reliable information for the issuing magistrate to conclude there was a fair probability that bloody clothing would be found at that location.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the affidavit failed (1) to establish the defendant\u2019s relationship to the apartment, other than the fact that Williams lived there and that the defendant went there after the shooting, and (2) to provide any information indicating that the defendant was so close to the victim when he shot the gun that blood would be found on his clothing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>[219 Conn. 529, 544, 594 A.2d 917 (1991)], our Supreme Court adopted the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 standard for determining probable cause used by the federal courts pursuant to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Illinois </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>42 Conn. App. 1, 5, 679 A.2d 367, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 912, 682 A.2d 1010 (1996). \u201cUnder this [standard], in determining the existence of probable cause to search, the issuing judge must make a \u2018practical, nontechnical decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the warrant affidavit, including the \u201cveracity\u201d and the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>219 Conn. 557, 563, 594 A.2d 933 (1991).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 134-35, 613 A.2d 211 (1992). Therefore, \u201c \u2018[i]f the warrant affidavit fails to state in specific terms how the informant gained his knowledge or why the police believe the information to be trustworthy . . . the magistrate can also consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit to determine whether, despite these deficiencies, other objective indicia of reliability reasonably establish that probable cause to search exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Marsala, </em>supra, 6, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201c[0]ne of the most common factors used to evaluate the reliability of an informant\u2019s information is the corroboration of the information by the police. . . . The theory of corroboration is that a statement [that] has been shown true in some respects is remarkably likely to be true in the remaining respects.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 230-31, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990). \u201c \u2018When a magistrate has determined that the warrant affidavit presents sufficient objective indicia of reliability to justify a search and has issued a warrant, a court reviewing that warrant at a subsequent suppression hearing should defer to the reasonable inferences drawn by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>magistrate.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 6, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u201cProbable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred. . . . Probable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with criminal activity; and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the items named will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 6, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 548. \u201cFurthermore, it is axiomatic that [a] significantly lower quantum of proof is required to establish probable cause than guilt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>229 Conn. 164, [172], 640 A.2d 94 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 232, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u201cThis court\u2019s scope of review, in evaluating the existence of probable cause, is limited to the facts that appear [within] the four comers of the affidavit or facts that may be properly inferred from those facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 536, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985). In so doing, we must use common sense; <em>State </em>v. <em>Castano, </em>25 Conn. App. 99, 101, 592 A.2d 977 (1991) ; and defer to the reasonable inferences drawn by the [issuing] magistrate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 544-45. Our role is to determine whether the affidavit at issue presented a substantial factual basis for the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 565. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Anziano, </em>[26 Conn. App. 667, 672, 603 A.2d 415 (1992) ].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 7. \u201c[T]he resolution of doubtful or marginal cases . . . should be largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 552. Furthermore, \u201c[a] reviewing court should not invalidate a warrant as long as the inferences drawn by the issuing magistrate are reasonable under all of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit regardless of whether that court would have drawn the same inferences.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 9, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In the present case, the magistrate reasonably could have inferred that the information provided by Williams and Saunders was reliable. First, the warrant affidavit indicates that the investigation led the police to obtain information from Saunders that corroborated the information provided by Williams. With respect to Saunders, a citizen informant is \u201cconsidered more deserving of credibility than are underworld informers, and courts have accordingly tended to examine the basis and sufficiency of a citizen informer\u2019s information more closely than his credibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 542 n.10; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>189 Conn. 717, 723-24, 458 A.2d 1147 (1983). Second, the informants, Williams and Saunders, were not anonymous. \u201cBecause [their] identity was known to the police, the informants] could expect adverse consequences if the information that [they] provided was erroneous.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 550. In Williams\u2019 case, his statement indicating his involvement in the events that transpired that evening constituted a declaration against penal interest. \u201cAdmissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility\u2014sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to search. . . . Although the informant\u2019s motive may be no loftier than the hope of leniency on other charges . . . courts have thought that one who knows the police are already in a position to charge him with a serious crime will not lightly undertake to divert the police down blind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>alleys.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Even if we assume, arguendo, that the police investigation did not provide any corroboration of Williams\u2019 statement because, as the defendant claims, Williams\u2019 information was corroborated by Saunders, Williams\u2019 girlfriend. Because Saunders\u2019 motive to shift blame to the defendant categorizes her as being between a first time informant and a citizen informant, the magistrate could still reasonably have inferred that their statements were credible. While the affiants could have strengthened the warrant application through independent corroboration of some of the details contained within the affidavit, the affidavit sufficiently set forth underlying factual circumstances from which the police could have concluded that the informants were credible or that the information was reliable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 551. A review of the facts contained within the four comers of the affidavit indicates that the defendant was at the apartment with a gun before the shooting, was positioned directly in front of the victim when he shot him, returned to the apartment immediately after the shooting and remained at the apartment until the following afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201cThe nexus between the items sought and the place to be searched may be inferred from the type of crime, the nature of the evidence, the extent of an opportunity for concealment and normal inferences as to where a criminal would likely hide the item. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>30 Conn. App. 249, 257, 620 A.2d 152 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 164, 640 A.2d 94 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>37 Conn. App. 40, 46, 654 A.2d 789, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 906, 659 A.2d 1209 (1995). Although this could be considered a marginal case if we accept the defendant\u2019s argument that the information came from informants who were motivated to shift the blame to him and that there was a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>police corroboration,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the issuing magistrate reasonably could still have inferred that probable cause existed to issue the warrant. Specifically, the magistrate reasonably could have inferred that because the defendant shot the victim at close range, there was a fan-probability that traces of blood would be on the clothing that the defendant was wearing that evening. Furthermore, because the defendant had remained in the apartment until the following afternoon, the magistrate reasonably could have inferred that there was a fair probability that the defendant normally spent time at this apartment and, therefore, that the clothing that the defendant had worn the previous day would be found within the apartment. After considering the search warrant affidavit under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances test,\u201d we conclude that the affidavit presented a substantial basis to support the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that the affidavit adequately described the basis of the informants\u2019 knowledge, as well as permitted a reasonable inference that the information was reliable. Accordingly, probable cause existed to search the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The defendant claims in the alternative that even if the information in the affidavit is found to provide a substantial basis for believing that bloody clothing would be found at the apartment, the information was stale and, consequently, could not provide probable cause. The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved at trial. The defendant maintains, however, that his claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We will review this claim because the record is adequate for review, and the defendant alleges the violation of his \u201cfundamental constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches unless supported by probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>MacNeil, </em>28 Conn. App. 508, 519, 613 A.2d 296, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 901, 615 A.2d 1044 (1992). The defendant\u2019s claim, however, fails because the alleged constitutional violation did not clearly exist and did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the determination of probable cause to conduct a search depends in part on the finding of facts so closely related to the time of the issuance of the warrant as to justify a belief in the continued existence of probable cause at that time. . . . Although it is reasonable to infer that probable cause dwindles as time passes, no single rule can be applied to determine when information has become too old to be rehable. The likelihood that the evidence sought is still in place is a function not simply of watch and calendar but of variables that do not punch a clock: the character of the crime (chance encounter in the night or regenerating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>conspiracy?), of the criminal (nomadic or entrenched?), of the thing to be seized (perishable and easily transferable or of enduring utility to its holder?), of the place to be searched (mere criminal forum of convenience or secure operational base?) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u201cConsequently, whether a reasonable likelihood exists that evidence identified in the warrant affidavit will be found on the subject premises is a determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, we have refused to adopt an arbitrary cutoff date, expressed ... in days, weeks or months, beyond which probable cause ceases to exist. . . . Moreover, we have recognized that [i]f items of property are innocuous in themselves or not particularly incriminating and are likely to remain on the premises, that fact is an important factor to be considered in determining the staleness of a warrant.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In this case, the crimes occurred on September 12, 1994, the information was obtained from Williams and Saunders on September 14, 1994, and the search warrant was obtained on September 15, 1994. In that short period of time, it was not unreasonable for the magistrate to infer from the defendant\u2019s remaining at the apartment and warning Saunders that she would not leave the apartment alive if she contacted the police that he was comfortable remaining there and felt it was a safe place and, therefore, that the apartment was a logical place for the defendant to conceal anything connected to the crimes. \u201cSuch an inference is not certainty, but a certainty is not required.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 544.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are of the opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>because it was reasonable for the magistrate to infer that the defendant\u2019s clothing may have contained traces of blood, but not necessarily to the point where it was inherently incriminating, the clothing had lasting value and was likely to remain in the apartment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 47 (probable cause dissipates less rapidly when item seized not \u201cconsumable or inherently incriminating\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The issuing magistrate, therefore, reasonably could have inferred that it was likely that the sweatshirt was in the apartment. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the three days between the night of the shooting and the challenged search did not render the information stale so as to preclude a finding that probable cause existed to issue a warrant. As a result, there was no clear constitutional violation, and the defendant was not clearly deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The defendant finally claims that the trial court abused its discretion by (1) permitting the state to present the testimony of Chris Lovejoy when it was irrelevant and highly prejudicial and (2) admitting the testimony of a criminalist regarding the presence of blood and gunpowder residue on the sweatshirt because it was irrelevant and prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">After Williams testified that the defendant was about four feet in front of the victim when he fired the gun and was wearing the Browns sweatshirt at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>murder,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a state criminalist, Patricia Johannes, testified regarding evidence found on the sweatshirt.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Johannes testified that a stain on the left cuff of the sweatshirt tested positive for blood but was inconclusive as to the blood type, and that both cuffs and the front waistband area of the sweatshirt tested positive for nitrates and nitrites, thereby indicating gunpowder residue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Love-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>joy later testified<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that on the day before the murder, September 11, 1994, he saw the defendant on Beacon Street wearing a Cleveland Browns sweatshirt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 801, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). \u201cEvidence is considered relevant when it tends to establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>37 Conn. App. 619, 634, 657 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 917, 661 A.2d 97 (1995).

Ed. 2d 909 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the state to present the testimony of Lovejoy because it was irrelevant and prejudicial to the defendant. Specifically, the defendant claims that the testimony was irrelevant because it was not connected to the issue of whether the defendant shot the victim on September 12, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Lovejoy\u2019s testimony tended to support or corroborate the existence of other direct evidence in the case supplied by Williams and Saunders that the defendant wore a Browns sweatshirt on the evening of September 12, 1994. As such, it was relevant and properly admissible. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the state to present Lovejoy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of Johannes because it was irrelevant and prejudicial. Specifically, the defendant argues that the testimony lacked a sufficient connection to the crimes or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 704-705, the defendant argued that a urine stained blouse should have been excluded as irrelevant because the state criminalist\u2019s testimony did not exclude the possibility that the urine was from a source other than the defendant. The defendant argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>214 Conn. 616, 573 A.2d 716 (1990), rather than <em>Jeffrey, </em>controls this case. In <em>Jeffrey, </em>our Supreme Court distinguished <em>Moody, </em>as we do in this case, because in <em>Moody </em>it could not be determined whether a stain on the defendant\u2019s shoe was blood. The <em>Jeffrey </em>court held that \u201c[t]he uncontroverted evidence of urine, not just something that might or might not have been urine, distinguishes this case from <em>Moody </em>and leads us to conclude that the shirt and test results were properly admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>supra, 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">In this case, while the findings were inconclusive as to the blood type, Johannes was able positively to identify human blood in the stain on the sweatshirt. Furthermore, while it is true that evidence of human blood on the sweatshirt does not by itself indicate that the defendant caused the stain or exclude other possible explanations for its presence, these objections do not require its exclusion because \u201cevidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclusion, even to a slight degree.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
