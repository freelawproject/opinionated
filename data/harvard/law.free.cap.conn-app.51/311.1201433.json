We conclude that it did not and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">On July 18, 1997, a default judgment was rendered in this marital dissolution action dissolving the marriage of the plaintiff and defendant, awarding $1 per year in alimony to the plaintiff and ordering the marital home transferred to the plaintiff by judicial decree. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>court also issued a restraining order against the defendant. On September 17, 1997, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-212,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant filed a motion to open the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim before the trial court was that he was not served process and that the sheriff had, instead, served the wrong person. Following a hearing, the trial court found that although the defendant was not actually served at his usual place of abode, a neighbor had delivered a copy of the writ, summons and complaint to him after the neighbor had been given the papers by the sheriff. The trial court also noted that the defendant had admitted to having possession of the papers at one point before \u201closing them.\u201d The trial court determined, therefore, that \u201cthe defendant had actual notice of the pendency of the dissolution action.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the trial court did not credit the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of the action and concluded \u201cthat the defendant [had] not met his burden of proving that he \u2018was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from prosecuting the action or making the defense.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 52-212.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In this case, the defendant did not file his motion to open or an appeal from the underlying judgment within the twenty day appeal period. See Practice Book \u00a7 63-1, formerly \u00a7 4009. The defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion to open, therefore, \u201ccan test only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to open the judgment and not the propriety of the merits of the underlying judgment.\u201d <em>Altberg </em>v. <em>Paul Kovacs Tire Shop, Inc., </em>31 Conn. App. 634, 640, 626 A.2d 804 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to open a judgment is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and this decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless it was unreasonable and a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Id., 640. Practice Book \u00a7 17-43, formerly \u00a7 377, provides that a default judgment may be set aside by \u201cshowing reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action or defense in whole or in part existed at the time of the rendition of such judgment . . . and that . . . the defendant was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from . . . appearing to make the same. . . .\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 52-212.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings were not unreasonable. \u201cIn determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, [we] must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 169, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992). We conclude that the defendant failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to open.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 (a) provides: \u201cAnyjudgmentrendered or decree passed upon a default or nonsuit in the Superior Court may be set aside, within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed, and the case reinstated on the docket, on such terms in respect to costs as the court deems reasonable, upon the complaint or written motion of any party or person prejudiced thereby, showing reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action or defense in whole or in part existed at the time of the rendition of the judgment or the passage of the decree, and that the plaintiff or defendant was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from prosecuting the action or making the defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
