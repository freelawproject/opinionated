The plaintiff brought this mandamus action alleging that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-66h (a), the defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is required to enter into a trust agreement with each willing indigenous Indian tribe. The plaintiff alleged that in March, 1991, it informed the defendant of its willingness to enter into a trust agreement pursuant to \u00a7 47-66h (a). The plaintiff further alleged that at all times since March, 1991, the defendant has refused to enter into a trust agreement or to institute a process of dialogue and negotiation leading to a trust agreement. The plaintiff claimed that it was therefore deprived of a clear legal right, and sought a writ of mandamus ordering the defendant \u201cto begin negotiation of a trust agreement with the plaintiff [Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians] as mandated by \u00a7 47-66h.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The defendant filed an answer and three special defenses. The trial court, in denying the request for mandamus, considered only the third special defense, that is, that the Indian Affairs Task Force (task force) failed to issue a final report containing trust agreement recommendations, a condition precedent to the defendant\u2019s entering into a trust agreement according to \u00a7 47-66h.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant concluding, in light of the statute, its legislative history and other extrinsic evidence, that (1) the 1991 report of the task force was the final report, (2) this final report did not contain any recommendations as to trust agreements as required by \u00a7 47-66h and (3) a writ of mandamus could not issue in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>trust agreement recommendations in the final report. It is from that judgment that the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Before turning to the specific issues involved, it is important to note that \u201c[a] party seeking a writ of mandamus must establish: (1) that the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the performance of a duty by the defendant; (2) that the defendant has no discretion with respect to performance of that duty; and (3) that the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. . . . Even satisfaction of this demanding test does not, however, automatically compel issuance of the requested writ of mandamus. ... In deciding the propriety of a writ of mandamus, the trial court exercises discretion rooted in the principles of equity.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>213 Conn. 656, 659, 569 A.2d 1122 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u201cEven [if] the plaintiff has a legal right to the matter sought, the writ will not issue if that right be nothing more than a naked right. In addition to a bare legal right, he must have a proper interest in, and a proper purpose to be served by, the doing of the act sought to be ordered. ... If the right sought to be enforced is or has become a mere abstract right, the enforcement of which will be of no substantial or practical benefit to the petitioner, the writ will not issue though otherwise the applicant would be entitled to it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sotire </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>19 Conn. App. 505, 514, 563 A.2d 1021, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 805, 567 A.2d 835 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Section 47-66h (a) provides that the governor shall enter into a trust agreement with each willing indigenous Indian tribe, and that any such trust agreement <em>\u201cshall be consistent with recommendations on trust agreements contained in the final report of the Indian AJfairs Task Force made pursuant to special act 87-103.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is important to understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the history of this statute and the task force prior to analyzing the claim of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In 1987, the task force was established \u201cto review existing statutes, budgets, agencies and programs affecting Connecticut Indians.\u201d Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103. The task force was given a nonexclusive list of topics for study and recommendation, and was directed to submit a report to the governor and General Assembly on or before January 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In 1989, the task force submitted its first report to the General Assembly. The report recommended, in part, that \u201cthe Governor shall pursue a trust agreement with each willing indigenous Tribe; such trust agreement shall define the special nature of the state\u2019s relationship with each particular tribe.\u201d The report also recommended an extension of the task force\u2019s authorization for an additional thirteen months, until February 1, 1990, for further study of several topics including \u201c[fjurther description and review of trust agreements.\u201d By Public Acts 1989, No. 89-368, \u00a7 28, the legislature amended Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103, by extending the period for the report of the task force until February 1, 1990. It also added \u201cdescription and review of trust agreements\u201d to the list of topics for the task force to consider. Section 17 of Public Acts 1989, No. 89-368, was the genesis of \u00a7 47-66h,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> presently at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In 1990, the task force submitted its second report to the General Assembly. In the section entitled \u201cRecommendations, 1990,\u201d the task force suggested, \u201c[tjhat the language of 17 (a) requiring tribal-state trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>agreements to be consistent with recommendations developed by the Indian Affairs Task Force be deleted as a potentially unconstitutional delegation of power and an interference with state and tribal sovereignty.\u201d Under the section entitled \u201cDiscussion of Issues,\u201d a subsection entitled \u201cWhat is a trust agreement?\u201d includes a \u201cpartial list of matters which might be negotiated in trust agreements.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In another subsection entitled \u201cFiscal Impact of Trust Agreements,\u201d the task force concluded that because only the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe had expressed readiness to enter into a trust agreement, the part-time efforts of one representative of the state would be fully adequate to negotiate such agreements. The 1990 report concluded by requesting another extension of the task force to consider outstanding issues. In this section of the report, the task force noted that \u201cuseful insights may be gained through review of the initial steps of the trust agreement process and that these might be incorporated in future legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">By Special Acts 1990, No. 90-25, the legislature extended the reporting period of the task force until February 1, 1991. Special Acts 1990, No. 90-25, did not change the requirement that trust agreements be consistent with any trust agreement recommendations contained in the final report of the task force. The act specifically provided that \u201creview and analysis of the trust agreement process\u201d be one of the items for the task force to study and make recommendations. In 1991, the task force issued its final report, which did not include any trust agreement recommendations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We first consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the 1991 report constituted the final report of the task force, and that this final report did not contain trust agreement recommendations as required by \u00a7 47-66h. The plaintiff contends that the legislative intent would best be served by finding that the necessary recommendations were contained in the 1989 report and were supplemented in the 1990 report and that, therefore, the 1990 report constituted the \u201cfinal report\u201d on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In support of its argument, the plaintiff notes that the legislature allowed for serial reporting by the task force. Specifically, although Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103, provided that the task force was to submit its report to the governor and General Assembly on or before January 1, 1989, the act further stated that \u201c[t]he task force may report recommendations, in whole or in part, at any time prior to said date.\u201d This language is reiterated in \u00a7 28 (c) of Public Acts, 1989, No. 89-368, which extended the reporting period of the task force until February 1, 1990, and subsection (c) of Special Acts 1990, No. 90-25, which extended the reporting period until February 1, 1991. We disagree with the plaintiff, however, and conclude that the statutory language, the legislative history and the factual record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the final report for proposes of \u00a7 47-66h was the report issued in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">As previously noted, \u00a7 47-66h provides that a trust agreement \u201cshall be consistent with recommendations . . . contained in the <em>final report\u201d </em>of the task force. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The task force issued three reports, in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The first report, in 1989, recommended that the governor enter into a trust agreement with each willing indigenous tribe. It also requested an extension until February 1,1990, for the study of several topics including \u201cfurther description and review of trust agreements.\u201d The 1990 report contained a section about trust agreements, including a \u201cpartial list of subjects which might be negotiated in trust agreements.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It did not, however, contain any specific recommendations regarding trust agreements as required by \u00a7 47-66h.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The 1990 report requested that the task force be extended again, noting that it believed that \u201cuseful insights may be gained through review of the initial steps of the trust agreement process and that these might be incorporated in future legislation.\u201d This language supports the inference that the task force did not view its work as complete with regard to trust agreements. Special Acts 1990, No. 90-25, again extended the life of the task force until February 1, 1991. Pursuant to this act, among the topics that the task force was to continue to study was the \u201creview and analysis of the trust agreement process.\u201d As the trial court noted, this language supports the inference that the work of the task force was not yet complete as far as trust agreements were concerned. The legislative history of Special Acts 1990, No. 90-25, further supports this conclusion. Specifically, the Senate proceedings reflect that in addition to extending the life of the task force, one of the purposes of the act was to enable the task force to continue to study certain issues, including trust agreements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly relied on evidence outside of the legislative record in support of its conclusion that the final report was the 1991 report. Specifically, the trial court relied on a series of internal task force documents from the summer and fall of 1991 that discuss the continuing need for a final report. Further, in a July 20, 1990 memorandum from Senior Attorney David Keith Leff of the office of legislative research to Representative John W. Thompson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>chairman of the task force, responding to the question of when trust agreements may be negotiated, Leff concluded that there was no final report.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court also relied on the plaintiffs responses to interrogatories, in which the plaintiff stated that the final report of the task force was not submitted to the governor and General Assembly until November 21, 1991. The plaintiff does not claim that these materials were irrelevant, only that it was not necessary for the court to consider them. The plaintiff cites no authority in support of this proposition and we conclude that the court properly considered these items in arriving at its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The trial court correctly determined that the final report of the task force was the 1991 report, and that this report did not contain any trust agreement recommendations. Even if we were to agree that all of the reports collectively constitute the final report, our conclusion that the task force failed to issue a final report containing trust agreement recommendations would remain unchanged. In so ruling, we disagree with the plaintiff that the trial court should have given greater weight to a letter dated February 22, 1991, from Representative Thompson to Governor Weicker.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>indicated, in part, that a final report would be forthcoming. It specifically stated that the task force had not changed its previous recommendations, and therefore did not see a need to restate them. The trial court provided several reasons why it deemed this letter insufficient to prove that \u201cfinal\u201d as used in \u00a7 47-66h denotes \u201cdecisive\u201d or \u201cconclusive\u201d as the plaintiff had argued.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s ruling in this regard is fully supported by the other evidence that it considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Having concluded that the task force did not issue recommendations regarding trust agreements in its final report, we next consider whether the trial court properly denied the plaintiffs request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">As previously noted, a writ of mandamus will not issue for the enforcement of a naked or abstract right. See <em>Sotire </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 514. According to \u00a7 47-66h, any trust agreement entered into between the governor and a willing indigenous Indian tribe shall be consistent with recommendations of the task force regarding trust agreements. Because the task <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>force did not issue a final report containing trust agreement recommendations, the plaintiff possesses a mere naked or abstract right. As such, the trial court properly concluded that the writ of mandamus could not lie because the enforcement of the right to have the defendant enter into negotiations would be of no substantial or practical benefit to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-66h (a) provides: \u201cEffective October 1, 1990, the Governor shall enter into a trust agreement with each willing indigenous Indian tribe. Any such trust agreement shall define the powers and duties possessed by the tribe that is party to the agreement and shall be consistent with recommendations on trust agreements contained in the final report of the Indian Affairs Task Force made pursuant to special act 87-103.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\"> The complaint originally named Governor Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., as the defendant. The plaintiff filed its second amended complaint on May 31, 1996, naming Governor John G. Rowland as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> The defendant also asserted as special defenses that (1) \u00a7 47-66h is unconstitutional and (2) \u00a7 47-66h violates the principle of separation of powers and improperly interferes with the executive branch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> Public Acts 1989, No. 89-368, \u00a7 17 (a) provides: \u201cEffective October 1, 1990, the governor shall enter into a trust agreement with each willing indigenous Indian tribe. Any such trust agreement shall define the powers and duties possessed by the tribe that is party to the agreement and shall be consistent with recommendations on trust agreements contained in the final report of the Indian Affairs Task Force made pursuant to special act 87-103, as amended by section 28 of this act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\"> See footnote 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\"><em> </em>The final report states: \u201cThe Task Force concluded that Public Act 89-368 has important implications and far-reaching legislative concerns with respect to the relationship between the State of Connecticut and its indigenous Native American Tribes. The Task Force also concluded that more time is needed to fully assess the short and long term effectiveness of P.A. 89-368. A1 this time the Task Force on Indian Affairs has decided not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>initiate any new remedial legislation. The final recommendation of the Task Force was to request that the Program Review Committee undertake a review of the Connecticut Indian Affairs Council.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b581-4\"> The section of the 1990 report entitled \u201cWhat is a trust agreement?\u201d states: \u201cUnder P.A. 89-368 \u00a7 17 (a) and Raised Bill No. 6000 \u00a7 8 (a) &amp; (c), the Task Force on Indian Affairs has provided that each indigenous Indian tribe may enter into a trust agreement with the state which shall define \u2018the mutual obligations of the tribe and the state of Connecticut in relation to each other.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\u201cThese trust agreements may involve the whole range of governmental duties and actions and will cover subjects that are of particular concern to the tribes and the state or its subdivisions. A partial list of matters which might be negotiated in trust agreements would include: 1) services the state will provide to the tribe, e.g., maintenance of roads, provision of signs or boundary fences, surveying, expert advice on forestry, environmental protection, sanitation or building codes, stocking of fish, or provision of fish and game officers; 2) tribal duties in return for services, e.g., following state regulations on lumbering, protection of wetlands, or bag and season limits on hunting and fishing or developing its own regulations in cooperation with state agencies; 3) provisions for law enforcement on the reservation of major crimes and those committed by non Indians, by state police or municipal police or, someday, in cooperation with tribal deputies; 4) the applicability or not of state taxes to transactions involving the reservation; 5) the possible provision by the state of assistance in developing tribal governmental structures and codes or in planning for tribal economic development; and 6) the funding of such services the state may undertake to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\u201cThe trust agreement provision is designed to create a method for sorting out the present confusion on the part of the state and the tribes regarding what governmental actions are allowable by each or are required by each in a way that will be sensitive to the individual circumstances and needs of each tribe. It is hoped that trust agreements can fill the gaps existing in the absence of federal involvement with Connecticut tribes and that the state and tribal governments can use these negotiated agreements to meet the needs and concerns of both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> Senator Steven Spellman stated: \u201cBasically, this bill does two things. ... It extends the life of the Task Force on Indian Affairs in regard to their reporting date from February 1, 1990 to February 1, 1991, and it <em>increases their areas of concern to address </em>tribal funds, Indians who are not indigenous tribes in Connecticut, the issue of sovereignty, <em>review and analysis of the trust agreement process </em>and also the definition of \u2018care and management of reservation lands.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 S. Proa, Pt. 10, 1990 Sess., p. 3270, remarks of Senator Steven Spellman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\"> The memorandum states: \u201cThe law requires that these [trust] agreements define the powers and duties possessed by the tribe and be consistent with recommendations on trust agreements contained in the final report of the Indian Affairs Task Force. Although the 1990 task force report discussed in general what might be included in a trust agreement, there have been no official recommendations on the subject (Legislative Task Force on Indian Affairs, Report to General Assembly, 2/90, at 11 and 12). Furthermore, with the extension of the task force until February 1, 1991, including a mandate to review and analyze the trust agreement process, there is no final report.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> The letter states: \u201cI am pleased to inform you that the Indian Affairs Task Force completed its duties on the evening of January 31, 1991. A small subcommittee of the Task Force has been delegated to draft a brief report for your consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">\u201cThe task force believes that Public Act 89-368 was important and far-reaching legislation concerned with relationships between the State of Connecticut. and its indigenous Native American tribes. As a consequence, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>issues that were referred to us were discussed, but at this time the Task Force has decided not to initiate any new or remedial legislation. Instead, the Task Force will recommend to the Program Review Committee that it undertake a review of the Connecticut Indian Affairs Council. The task force has not changed its previous recommendations on the other matters referred to us, and therefore did not see a need to restate them. Those recommendations will need further deliberation by committees of cognizance in the General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\"> The reasons stated by the trial court were: \u201c(1) [The letter] relies on Representative Thompson\u2019s belief that the task force can incoiporate the recommendations as to trust agreements contained in the 1990 report into the 1991 report, yet there is no statutory basis for this belief; (2) the letter states the opinion of Representative Thompson alone without any indicia that the letter or its contents were adopted by the entire task force . . . and (3) the actual 1991 report does <em>not </em>state that it incorporates by reference the recommendations of the 1990 report, despite the sentiment shared by Representative Thompson in [the letter].\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b585-17\"> Because we conclude that the writ would not lie in any event as it seeks the enforcement of a naked or abstract right, it is unnecessary to consider the plaintiffs argument that recommendations of the task force are not a condition precedent to the defendant's entering into a trust agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
