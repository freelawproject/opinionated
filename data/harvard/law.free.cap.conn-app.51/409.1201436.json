We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 1, 1993, the victim, Anibal Torres, and his brother drove his girlfriend, Christine Barker, and her two year old daughter, Emily, to 63 Winthrop Avenue in New Haven where the defendant lived with his parents and five brothers. The defendant is Emily\u2019s father. Barker was bringing Emily to visit with her grandmother, the defendant\u2019s mother. Barker was romantically involved with the defendant previously, but after Emily was bom she had left the defendant to date the victim. She resumed her relationship with the defendant, however, while pregnant with the victim\u2019s son, but returned to the victim after the birth of his son. The victim and the defendant had been on poor terms since Barker had broken up with the defendant and became pregnant by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The victim parked his car across the street from the defendant\u2019s home on Winthrop Avenue, and he and his brother remained in the car. Barker got out of the car with Emily, crossed Winthrop Avenue and knocked on the front door, which was answered by Emily\u2019s grandmother. At that time, the defendant, his brothers Frank Cepeda and Luis Cepeda, his uncle and another individual went across Winthrop Avenue toward the car in which the victim was sitting. The victim testified that they said that they were \u201cgoing to fight me.\u201d The victim got out of his car and a fight started. The victim hit the defendant, who fell down, and all of the men started fighting in the street. The defendant \u201cscreamed\u201d for someone \u201cto get the gun.\u201d The defendant\u2019s uncle went into the house, came out with a small grayish-black handgun and fired a shot toward the victim. During this melee, the uncle approached the victim\u2019s brother, who was being held down on the ground by the defendant\u2019s brothers Frank and Luis, and pointed the gun at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>head. Barker moved into the street, and pushed the uncle with the gun away from the victim\u2019s brother. As she did so, the \u201cgun went off and nothing came out,\u201d having apparently jammed. The defendant then obtained the handgun from his uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The victim\u2019s brother stabbed the defendant\u2019s brother, Frank Cepeda, in the leg with a knife, which caused a minor wound to his thigh. The victim ran toward his car and, as he was attempting to get in, the defendant fired at least two shots at the victim. Two bullets struck the victim. One bullet passed through his left arm and another penetrated his chest fracturing his fourth thoracic vertebra.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Two brothers, Demetrius Coban and Joel Coban, who had been walking their dog in the area, witnessed the incident. They each saw the defendant point the handgun toward the victim and fire two shots. The victim\u2019s brother and Barker helped him into the car and drove him to Yale-New Haven Hospital.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The jury heard and observed fourteen witnesses called by the state and seven witnesses called by the defense. The state also called another witness on rebuttal. The defendant did not take the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">The defendant claims that his federal and state<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> constitutional rights were violated when the trial court declined to let him cross-examine the victim, Barker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Demetrius Coban and Joel Coban on whether these eyewitnesses had seen the victim\u2019s brother stab Frank Cepeda in the leg. He claimed that he was entitled to do so to impeach their credibility, to test their powers of recollection and abilities to observe and to set out a time continuum of events. The defendant made essentially the same claim several times as the state presented each of these eyewitnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">This issue requires the recital of certain additional facts. After the victim had testified on cross-examination that he had not seen \u201cany knives,\u201d the defendant, in the absence of the jury, first made his claim that he be permitted to cross-examine the victim on the basis already stated. The state objected on relevancy grounds, claiming that such an inquiry would be a collateral issue. The trial court ruled that while it arguably might have some relevance, allowing the requested inquiry could rapidly develop into collateral issues and tend to confuse the jury. The trial court pointed out that the defendant would have ample opportunity to cross-examine the victim to test and explore his powers of recollection and observation. It did, however, state that it would allow the defendant to ask the victim if he saw anyone with a knife, but precluded him from asking the victim if he had actually seen the stabbing incident. Thereafter, in the presence of the jury and upon further cross-examination, the victim stated that he had not seen anyone with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Again, upon cross-examination of Demetrius Coban, Joel Coban and Barker, defense counsel, asserting the same grounds, pressed his claim to cross-examine each concerning the stabbing. The state again objected, arguing that the issue involved was whether the defendant shot, attempted to shoot or assisted another person in shooting the victim, and that the matter of the stabbing incident claimed between the victim\u2019s brother and Frank Cepeda was a collateral issue. In the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>pressing his request to the court, defense counsel stated that he anticipated presenting testimony from individuals, including Prank Cepeda, as to how he was stabbed and the surrounding circumstances. He argued that this was relevant to impeaching the witnesses\u2019 credibility and their powers of recollection and observation. The state maintained that the defendant\u2019s argument was based on his assumption that, if that inquiry was allowed, the state\u2019s eyewitnesses would testify that they did not see the stabbing. The trial court again precluded defense counsel from cross-examining these witnesses about the stabbing. Thereafter, defense counsel, in cross-examining the witnesses, did not ask if they had seen a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim of improper restriction of his right of cross-examination is guided by familiar constitutional principles relevant to cross-examination by a defendant in a criminal trial. \u201cIt is axiomatic that the defendant is entitled fairly and fully to confront and to cross-examine the witnesses against him. U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV . . . <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294, 93 S.

In order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>[supra, 318]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>supra, 482. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>237 Conn. 576, 584-85, 678 A.2d 924 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The United States Supreme Court has said: \u201cGenerally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.

The <em>Beliveau </em>court also said: \u201cThe confrontation clause does not, however, suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>21 Conn.

The court determines whether the evidence sought on cross-examination is relevant by determining whether that evidence renders the existence of [other facts] either certain or more probable. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 376, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 562, 643 A.2d 854 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination.

We must, therefore, conduct a two-step analysis, determining first whether the cross-examination permitted to defense counsel comported with sixth amendment standards; see <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 308; and second whether the trial court abused its discretion in restricting the scope of that cross-examination. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>supra, 510; <em>State v. Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 424, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 111, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>28 Conn. App. 231, 235-36, 611 A.2d 902, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 922, 614 A.2d 827 (1992). \u201cThe constitutional standard is met when defense counsel is \u2018permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>reliability of the witness.\u2019 <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>supra, 318; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vasilios, </em>[598 F.2d 387, 389 (5th Cir. 1979)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>supra, 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u201cTo establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>571 F.2d 880, 909 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>438 F.2d 858, 865 (5th Cir. 1971). <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>supra, [182 Conn. 510]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>195 Conn. 128, 141, 486 A.2d 637 (1985). Once it is established that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the scope of cross-examination is not constitutionally defective, this court will apply [e]very reasonable presumption ... in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 Conn. 328, 333, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 862 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>supra, 196 Conn. 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Initially, we determine that as to the evidence of the stabbing, which the defendant argues was an \u201cintegral\u201d part of the melee and that he endeavored to elicit from the state\u2019s eyewitnesses, the trial court correctly ruled that the evidence was irrelevant and that its admission would tend to confuse the jury with collateral issues. \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 788, 699 A.2d 91 (1997), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 305, 664 A.2d 743 (1995). The crucial issue in this case was whether the defendant shot, attempted to shoot or assisted another person in shooting the victim. The issue of who might have done the stabbing was collateral. Not only did the stabbing not implicate the victim or the defendant, but defense counsel specifically agreed at trial that the victim did not in any way participate in the stabbing. In addition, as the state argues, the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>not called upon to decide whether other parties in the melee were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The trial court\u2019s precluding the defense from cross-examining the state\u2019s eyewitnesses about the stabbing did not completely bar the defense from exposing facts to the jury to permit it to assess and draw inferences concerning the reliability of these eyewitnesses. We are aware that the defense argued that it should be permitted to do so because it would serve to impeach the state\u2019s eyewitnesses\u2019 credibility and power of recollection and observation, as well as to establish a time continuum of events. Our examination of the trial transcript discloses that the trial court carefully considered and weighed the necessary elements when ruling as to all of the state\u2019s eyewitnesses. Even if, as the state argues, it is assumed that the state\u2019s eyewitnesses would have testified that they had not seen the stabbing, that evidence would not have impeached their credibility or their power to recollect and observe events. In that regard, it is fair to say that none of these eyewitnesses testified on direct examination that they witnessed the melee in its entirety. The victim said that he was preoccupied with the defendant and the defendant\u2019s uncle and that he did not even see Demetrius Coban and Joel Coban, both of whom he knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Ruth Pelletier, a neighbor who was an eyewitness, testified that she heard a \u201cloud noise outside\u201d her house. Barker did see the defendant and those with him approach the victim\u2019s car, but did not see the victim exit his car because she was on the front porch of the Cepeda home talking with the defendant\u2019s mother. She said things happened \u201cvery fast\u201d and when she heard shots she saw her daughter in the middle of the street and \u201cran for her\u201d and that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be worried about what was going on with anybody else.\u201d Under these circumstances, we agree that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that testimony from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>these eyewitnesses, as sought by the defendant, would not reasonably undermine their credibility or their ability to observe and recollect the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the stabbing incident was \u201cintegral\u201d and would have been \u201cparticularly memorable\u201d for the victim and the other state eyewitnesses to recall is not persuasive. Here, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly excised an \u201cintegral\u201d portion of this melee by its limitation of the cross-examination of the state\u2019s eyewitnesses. He, therefore, requested that he be permitted to elicit from his own eyewitnesses that during the melee, someone yelled for a knife and that the victim\u2019s brother stabbed Frank Cepeda, causing him to retreat from the melee. Defense counsel argued that such evidence was relevant because it tended to contradict the state\u2019s claims that the defendant yelled for a gun and that Frank Cepeda participated in holding the victim\u2019s brother on the ground. The state objected arguing that it was not relevant or necessary and that it was prejudicial. The trial court opined that this was \u201ca different context from my prior rulings\u201d and that it would allow the defendant to elicit testimony that Frank Cepeda was involved in a fight and that he was injured<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, because of that injury, withdrew from the fighting. The defendant\u2019s \u201cintegral\u201d claim, however, is undermined by the fact that he did <em>no t </em>question three of these four witnesses about the stabbing. Frank Cepeda was the only eyewitness who testified that he had been stabbed. Given the trial court\u2019s ruling that allowed the eliciting of such evidence and the defendant\u2019s use of that opportunity, he can hardly argue persuasively that the stabbing was \u201cintegral\u201d to the shooting and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>stabbing would have been \u201cparticularly memorable\u201d to the witnesses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We cannot say that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right of confrontation was improperly restricted as claimed. Defense counsel was amply permitted to expose to the jury facts from the state\u2019s eyewitnesses from which the jury as the sole trier of fact and credibility could properly draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witnesses. Despite the defendant\u2019s claim, the trial court extended broad latitude to the defense in the cross-examination of the state\u2019s eyewitnesses in the defendant\u2019s efforts to impeach their credibility and to explore their ability to obseive and recollect. Defense counsel fully and incisively did so in pursuing its trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The trial court correctly ruled that it was irrelevant to explore the stabbing incident as the defense proposed. It correctly ruled that the stabbing incident was not a relevant matter for inquiry and that it would be collateral. \u201c \u2018[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 789. \u201cA matter is considered collateral if the matter itself is not relevant in the litigation to establish a fact of consequence. . . . <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beauchamp, </em>986 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 45, at 169 (4th ed. 1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Andujar, </em>49 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 1995). In view of what we have said, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>did not abuse its broad discretion in ruling on the defendant\u2019s cross-examination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court should have conducted a <em>Batson </em>hearing when the state exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse Quadry Harris, an African-American venireperson, on the basis of race. The defendant claims that the failure to conduct a \u201cfull hearing\u201d under <em>Batson </em>violated the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 20, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The portions of the voir dire relevant to this issue disclose the following. At the time of trial, Harris had been employed as a supervising social worker for the department of children and families (DCF), supervising individuals investigating child abuse, and had dealt with situations involving domestic violence. During his ten years with DCF, Harris had a high degree of interaction with the police until he became a supervisor. His experience with the police has been both positive and negative and most of this contact has been through his work with DCF. Some years ago, however, while a student, he had a problem with his landlord over his security deposit. Harris called the landlord \u201ctoo many times\u201d trying to get his deposit back. The landlord said Harris was harassing him and Harris was arrested on a harassment charge. Harris never recovered his security deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The defendant accepted Harris as a juror, but the state excused him by exercising a peremptory challenge. The defendant, at that point, stated: \u201cI would ask for <em>Batson </em>reasons on this individual, Your Honor.\u201d The trial court then called on the state, which stated that it had challenged Harris because he was a social worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and had earlier been arrested for harassment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that the state had a racially neutral justification for peremptorily challenging Harris, and in doing so stated that there had \u201ccertainly . . . been no pattern of exclusion in this case . . . that there had been black jurors excused by both the state and the defense . . . .\u201d The trial court also observed that it had not seen \u201cany significant difference in the questions asked of Mr. Harris as opposed to the other witnesses. I think the state\u2019s format has been fairly consistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In <em>Batson </em>v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), the United States Supreme Court held that, in a criminal trial, the state\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors on the basis of race violates the equal protection clause of the United States constitution. Under <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S. Ct. 824, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1965), a precursor of <em>Batson, </em>a defendant was required to prove a systematic exclusion of members of a racial group from the petit jury to establish a constitutional violation. <em>Batson </em>modified that burden of proof and the defendant is no longer required to prove that peremptory challenges are used to deny equal protection in case after case, but now he may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in the selection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\u2019s trial. See <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 96; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 395, 538 A.2d 210 (1988). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 645-46, 553 A.2d 166, cert denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989), our Supreme Court, knowing that in the federal courts a defendant must make a prima facie showing of discrimination before the burden shifts to the state to provide a neutral explanation for the peremptory challenge, dispensed with the need for a defendant to make a prima facie case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A neutral explanation means an explanation based on something other than the race of the juror. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>50 Conn. App. 369, 377, 717 A.2d 828, cert. granted on other grounds, 247 Conn. 935, 722 A.2d 1217 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In <em>Thomas, </em>we said: \u201cIn <em>Holloway, </em>our Supreme Court departed from <em>Batson </em>to the extent that it held that an accused does not have to first make out a prima facie case to be entitled to an explanation from the state. The court in <em>Holloway </em>stated that rather than deciding, based on the existence of a prima facie case, whether an accused is entitled to an explanation of the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges, the better course to follow would be to hold a <em>Batson </em>hearing on the defendant\u2019s request whenever the defendant is a member of a cognizable racial group and the prosecutor exercises peremptory challenges to remove members of the defendant\u2019s race from the venire.\u201d Id., 375. \u201cA defendant who alleges that he has been the victim of purposeful racial discrimination in the use of a peremptory challenge carries the ultimate burden of persuasion. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 94 n.18.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 374-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim on this issue is that \u201cthe trial court should have conducted a full hearing into the reasons for this exclusion [of Harris by the state].\u201d The state contends that there was no need for a \u201cfull hearing\u201d as it maintained that Harris was challenged because he was a social worker and also had an arrest record. It is significant to recognize that both of those reasons were generated by Harris\u2019 own testimony on his voir dire examination. Our Supreme Court has said: \u201cWe decline to ascribe a racial animus to the state\u2019s excusal of a venireperson with an arrest record simply because that venireperson was black. We agree with courts in other jurisdictions that this concern constitutes a neutral ground for the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge to excuse a black venireperson. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Thompson, 516 So. 2d 349, 354 (La. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 871, 109 S. Ct. 180, 102 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>438 N.W.2d 101, 107 (Minn. 1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 14, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992). Courts have also held that \u201c[a] person\u2019s employment or lack of employment may, in an appropriate case, constitute a legitimate race-neutral reason for exclusion (see, Colbert, <em>Challenging the Challenge: Thirteenth Amendment as a Prohibition Against the Racial Use of Peremptory Challenges, </em>76 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 97-98 [1990]) . . . .\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>177 App. Div. 2d 187, 194, 582 N.Y.S.2d 847 (1992). Peremptory challenges based on employment reasons have been upheld. Some courts have done so in cases involving social workers. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wint, </em>237 App. Div. 2d 195, 197, 655 N.Y.S.2d 469 (1997) (sustaining challenge to venireperson who was social worker on assumption she might be unduly sympathetic to criminal defendant); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>951 F.2d 22, 24-25 (2d Cir. 1991) (sustaining challenge where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>venireperson was social worker); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>32 F.3d 921, 925 (5th Cir. 1994) (sustaining challenge because venireperson was social worker and recognizing that as race neutral reason and nonpretextual); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>507 N.E.2d 997, 999 (Ind. App. 1987) (sustaining challenge against venireperson who was counselor at family and children\u2019s center because she might take liberal view of sexual behavior, in instant rape case, and because of her employment as social worker).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">After the state had provided its race neutral reasons, the defendant did not challenge them nor did he thereafter address the court. Specifically, he never requested, as he now argues, a \u201cfull hearing.\u201d Moreover, we recognize that, once the state has articulated its racially neutral explanation, the defendant should have the opportunity to rebut with his own interpretation and to demonstrate whether those reasons are pretextual or insufficient. See <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98 n.21; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 375; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1121, 1124 (8th Cir. 1989). At this point, we note that the defendant\u2019s brief states that \u201cthe court accepted the state\u2019s proffered neutral reasons and declined to allow defense counsel an opportunity to rebut them.\u201d An examination of the trial transcript discloses that after defense counsel asked \u201cfor <em>Batson </em>reasons,\u201d he never, thereafter, addressed the court, even though the court made its ruling immediately after the state proffered its <em>\u201cBatson </em>reasons.\u201d The defendant said <em>nothing-, </em>the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>however, did not \u201cdecline\u201d him the opportunity as claimed. In any event, our courts have held, as to the opportunity aspect, that a defendant himself or through counsel may waive \u201cpart of the process intended to protect his equal protection right.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 376; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 393, 645 A.2d 535 (1994), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996). Under the circumstances, we conclude that such a waiver occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In ruling as it did, the trial court considered the requisite circumstances. The proffered race neutral reasons each had a valid basis, supported by authorities, for sustaining the peremptory challenge to Harris and were neither pretextual nor insufficient. Its ruling is also entitled to \u201cappropriate deference.\u201d <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98 n.21; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 395. The defendant has not maintained his burden of proof on this issue and his claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of two prior incidents of uncharged misconduct that involved threats by the defendant to shoot the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The state offered this evidence on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent and his motive. The defendant argued that this evidence was highly prejudicial and not probative. After a lengthy argument and an offer of proof, the trial court found that the probative value of the proffered evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect and admitted the evidence on the issue of intent and motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The factual background of the two incidents of uncharged misconduct admitted was as follows: The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>first incident occurred on April 11,1992.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On that date, Michael Chance and his girlfriend gave the defendant a ride to the victim\u2019s home on Tyler Street in New Haven. Upon arrival, the defendant exited the car. An argument ensued in front of the victim\u2019s house as the defendant started arguing with Barker. Upon hearing the argument, the victim came out of his house and began arguing with the defendant. The victim\u2019s father intervened before there was any physical contact between the victim and the defendant. As the defendant was leaving, he said to the victim: \u201cI\u2019m going to get mine.\u201d The victim understood that to mean that the defendant was going to get a \u201c[w]eapon to come back . . . to get me.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant left with his friends who, at his request, drove him to his home on Winthrop Avenue. In the meantime, the victim\u2019s mother called the police. The victim and Barker told Peter A. Beck-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>with, the police officer who had responded, of the defendant\u2019s threat. Beckwith, believing that the defendant might return with a gun, positioned his cruiser at the end of Tyler Street with the lights off.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the meantime, the defendant returned to his home on Winthrop Avenue and obtained a sawed-off shotgun. The defendant returned to Tyler Street in the backseat of his friend\u2019s car. Beckwith ordered the car to pull over and he obtained the consent of the owner and operator of the car to search it. In the back, where the defendant had been seated, he found a twelve gauge sawed-off shotgun. He also found one live twelve gauge shotgun shell on the defendant\u2019s person. Beckwith arrested the defendant for possession of the shotgun.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The second incident of prior misconduct admitted by the trial court took place about two or three months before the victim was shot by the defendant on August 1, 1993. On that occasion, the victim had driven Barker and her daughter Emily to the Cepeda home on Winthrop Avenue to drop Emily off to visit her grandmother, the defendant\u2019s mother. The defendant grabbed Barker and then the victim got out of his car and he and the defendant were about to fight when the defendant told his younger brother David to go into the house and \u201cget his steel.\u201d Barker went back into the victim\u2019s car with Emily. David came back out of the house with a nickel-plated .22 or .25 caliber handgun. The defendant pointed the gun at the victim and said, \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d When a neighbor threatened to call the police, the defendant went into his house and the victim drove away in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201cIt is well settled that evidence of prior misconduct is admissible for the limited purposes of showing intent, an element in the crime, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal design.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Taylor, 239 Conn. 481, 501, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 161-62, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 60-61, 644 A.2d 887 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>43 Conn. App. 458, 463, 684 A.2d 720, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 954, 688 A.2d 326 (1996). The test is two-pronged. \u201cFirst, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. . . . Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 162; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 61. \u201cThe primary responsibility for conducting the prejudicial-probative balancing test rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 162; <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>41 Conn. App. 169, 177, 674 A.2d 862 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>38 Conn. App. 125, 132, 659 A.2d 1211, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 903, 665 A.2d 904 (1995). \u201cWe note that [bjecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process . . . every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoravali, </em>34 Conn. App. 428, 436, 641 A.2d 796, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 921 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Madore, </em>45 Conn. App. 512, 520, 696 A.2d 1293 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 162; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>supra, 463. Evidence of prior threats by a defendant directed to his victim has been held relevant to the issues of intent and motive. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Veal, </em>201 Conn. 368, 375, 517 A.2d 615 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The evidence of the two incidents of prior misconduct admitted was clearly relevant to the issues of intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and motive that were central issues in this case. The two incidents also were reasonably similar to the factual allegations surrounding the August 1, 1993 shooting, including that both showed the defendant\u2019s animus toward the victim for taking away Barker as his girlfriend. In determining which of the proffered prior misconduct evidence it might admit, the trial court, before doing so, conducted a lengthy hearing, listened to evidence of an offer of proof and explicated on what it deemed the applicable decisional law. The transcript demonstr ates that once the trial court decided to admit the two incidents on the issues of intent and motive, it appreciated the delicate balancing test of probative value as against the prejudicial effect of such evidence. In addition, the trial court lessened the potential effect of such prejudice by repeatedly giving the jury limiting instructions that the evidence was to be considered only on the issues of motive and intent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 663, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wild, </em>supra, 43 Conn. App. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The defendant, however, claims that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of the sawed-off shotgun and the nickel-plated pistol evidence \u201cbecause the instrumentalities used in these offenses . . . were not the same as the small black handgun used in the [August 1, 1993] assault\u201d of which he stood accused. He asserts that our courts have held that evidence of prior misconduct \u201cnot using the same instrumentality or method\u201d is inadmissible under the general exception to the general rule against allowing the evidence. In support of his position, he cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>35 Conn. App. 279, 282, 646 A.2d 213, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 928, 648 A.2d 879 (1994), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>31 Conn. App. 58, 66, 623 A.2d 506, cert denied, 226 Conn. 908, 625 A.2d 1379 (1993). The state disagrees and argues that these cases are distinguishable and do not support the defendant\u2019s claim. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In <em>Coleman, </em>the defendant was charged with burglary in the first degree, assault in the first degree and attempted robbery in the first degree as the result of an early morning break-in of the victim\u2019s apartment. The victim was awakened by the touch of a knife on her throat wielded by the defendant. In the ensuing struggle, she sustained several lacerations. About two weeks later, the police seized three knives from the defendant\u2019s car, pursuant to a search warrant. At the trial, the state offered the knives to show that because the defendant possessed the knives, he possessed the means of committing the crimes charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 286. This court found that the knives were improperly admitted because the state had failed to establish a nexus between those knives and the crime charged. Id., 287. <em>Coleman </em>involved a different issue than that present in this case. Here, the state did not offer the challenged evidence of prior threats to show that the defendant earlier possessed a weapon that may have been used by him when he shot the victim on August 1, 1993. Rather, that evidence was offered for a limited purpose on the issue of the defendant\u2019s motive vis-a-vis his shooting of the victim. <em>Coleman </em>does not avail the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In <em>Weber, </em>the defendant was charged with assault in the second degree as a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree. After the state completed the presentation of its case-in-chief, the defendant made an offer of proof as to ten separate acts involving Mason, the other party involved, to determine whether any of Mason\u2019s convictions or acts of prior misconduct involving violence would be admissible, on the issue of initial aggressor, in connection with the defendant\u2019s claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>self-defense. The trial court excluded all but three of these acts. It permitted the defendant to use the three acts as evidence of three unnamed felony convictions for impeachment purposes. We ruled in <em>Weber, </em>however, that the trial court had not abused its discretion in precluding the state from inquiring into the underlying acts of these three convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In the present case, the state did not ask for the admission of the prior threats to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility, but only on the limited issue of motive and intent. Unlike the defendant in <em>Weber </em>who testified, the defendant in this case did not, and so there was no real opportunity for the state to directly attack his credibility. <em>Weber </em>does not, under the circumstances, support the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">We must reject the defendant\u2019s claim on the admitted prior misconduct evidence. The trial court properly decided that the evidence of prior threats was relevant to the issues of motive and intent and it reasonably could have concluded that the probative value of such evidence outweighed its prejudicial tendency. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Next, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to order the state to produce notes taken by the prosecutor during an interview with the state\u2019s witness, Joel Coban. The defendant argues that the notes fall within the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>contained in Practice Book \u00a7 40-15, formerly \u00a7 749,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that he was entitled to production of the notes pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The state objected arguing that the notes belonged to the state, that they did not constitute a \u201cstatement\u201d under law or the rules of practice, that the state did not show them to the witness and that the state did not read them back to the witness in a narrative form and that the witness did not adopt them. Essentially, the state\u2019s position was that the notes were not a \u201cstatement\u201d of the witness. Thereafter, the trial court examined these notes in camera and then questioned Coban concerning the notes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>On the basis of Coban\u2019s testimony about the notes and the notes themselves, the trial court concluded that the notes did not constitute a \u201cstatement\u201d because there was insufficient evidence that the witness ratified or adopted the notes, and that the \u201ccontext of the notes themselves are not conducive to a read back adoption based on the use of isolated words, incomplete sentences, partial sentences and [the notes] also contain a diagram which was never discussed in the testimony of the witnesses, nor asked about.\u201d The defendant now argues that the notes were a \u201cstatement\u201d because the state read back to Coban the notes it had taken \u201cto see if they were correct\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and that Coban adopted and ratified them.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in determining what constitutes a statement that must be disclosed, and its findings will be disturbed only if they are clearly erroneous.

During voir dire, Coban testified that the prosecutor did not read back \u201ceverything\u201d that he had written down. The trial court inquired about Coban\u2019s use of the word \u201ceverything\u201d and asked whether the prosecutor was asking him questions about what the witness had said or was \u201che actually reading what he had written down to you?\u201d The witness replied: \u201cHe was asking me what I said.\u201d It is fair to say that adoption or approval can be shown by demonstrating that the interviewer read back to the witness what he wrote and that the witness affirmatively stated his approval. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>798 F.2d 985, 996 (7th Cir. 1986). It should be noted, however, \u201c[a] general affirmation by a witness that the interviewer\u2019s notes capture the basic gist of their conversation, in the absence of a showing that the witness read or was read what the interviewer has written, does not constitute adoption or approval of the notes.

App. 241, 245, 579 A.2d 1107, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 827, 582 A.2d 204 (1990). We note that the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d found in our rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>practice was modeled after the definition set out in the federal Jencks Act, 18U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. See <em>State v. Wityak, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 463. Keeping in mind that the reason the Jencks Act requires the witness to sign or otherwise approve the statement involved is that the witness may be impeached by this evidence. If the witness has not expressly approved the statement, it clearly would be unfair to use such evidence to impeach him. <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>796 F.2d 891, 900 (7th Cir. 1986). Such an approval serves to attain the utmost fairness to a criminal defendant. The defendant\u2019s claim here must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court should not have allowed the rebuttal testimony of Joseph Lawlor, a state inspector, because it did not contradict the testimony of the eyewitness John Pelletier. The state claims that this is not supported by the record. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">This issue requires setting out certain additional facts. Pelletier lived at 65 Winthrop Avenue, next door to the Cepedas. He testified that late in the afternoon of August 1, 1993, he was outside his house and witnessed the victim, whom Pelletier knew, arguing and then fighting with someone behind the victim\u2019s car. He saw a male go in and come out of the Cepeda house. After the fighting had stopped, Pelletier saw this male point a gun and shoot three or four times into the victim\u2019s car. He said that he did not know this male but did see that he had a \u201clarger like Afro hair style.\u201d Pelletier also said on direct examination that as the shots were fired, he went behind a \u201clittle wall and I kept still looking.\u201d He was \u201clooking at the gentleman with the gun\u201d when he heard the first shot fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">During cross examination of this witness, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now, isn\u2019t it true that you told me when I was at your house with Inspector Lawlor that you didn\u2019t see anybody shoot a gun, and as soon as you heard the gun fire you went and hid behind the porto-let. Isn\u2019t that what you told me when I was at your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: That\u2019s not what you told me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Your Honor. Let him finish the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201cThe Court: Let him finish the question. . . . [Y]ou asked\u2014asked if he told\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Calls for yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">\u201cThe Court: Have the court reporter read the question back. You can answer that question yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">\u201c[Last question read back.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: So that\u2019s not what you told me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: No, it was not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">Thereafter, on rebuttal, Lawlor testified that on February 28, 1996, he had accompanied the prosecutor to the Pelletier home on Winthrop Avenue. At that time, Lawlor testified that Pelletier was asked whether \u201che had seen anything in respect to the [August 1, 1993 incident]?\u201d The inspector testified that \u201c[Pelletier] said, no, he didn\u2019t. When he heard shots he took shelter behind a house there.\u201d Pelletier was then asked if he was \u201csure about that\u201d and he replied that \u201che was quite sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Lawlor\u2019s rebuttal testimony \u201cbecause Pelletier did in fact testify that he did not see the shooter.\u201d The defendant further argues that Pelletier testified that \u201che saw a dark skinned Hispanic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>male go into the house and get a gun and that he heard shots, but he did not testify that he saw this man actually shoot the gun.\u201d Therefore, he claims that because Lawlor\u2019s testimony did not contradict Pelletier\u2019s testimony, the trial court should not have allowed the rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u201c[R]ebuttal evidence is that which refutes the evidence presented by the defense, rather than that which merely bolsters the state\u2019s case .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 698, 539 A.2d 561 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisella, </em>187 Conn. 335, 337, 445 A.2d 922 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>29 Conn.

Rebuttal evidence is usually confined to testimony which is directed at refuting the evidence given by the defendant ... or is in general contradiction of the testimony given by the defendant .... The admission of rebuttal evidence is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 715-16, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 697-98. A trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>202 Conn. 629, 648-49, 522 A.2d 795 (1987). Further, every reasonable presumption will be given in favor of upholding the court\u2019s ruling when ascertaining if the ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>28 Conn.
