Record Journal first appealed to the city\u2019s tax review board, which affirmed certain assessments that the city had issued, and then to the trial court. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of Record Journal and found that Record Journal (1) did not omit personal property in the form of computer software from its tax returns for the years 1991-1994 and (2) sustained its burden of proof that an illegal tax was imposed. On appeal, the city contends that the trial court (1) incorrectly determined that the city had received notice of a tax exemption of computer software that was already loaded into Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment, (2) improperly applied General Statutes \u00a7 12-71 (e) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in concluding that Record Journal\u2019s computer software was exempt from taxation as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>intangible personal property, (3) incorrectly concluded that Record Journal had sustained its burden of proof in establishing that an illegal tax was imposed by the city and (4) incorrectly determined that Record Journal did not omit its computer software from the disputed grand lists. This appeal followed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. Record Journal commenced the underlying action after the city issued changes of assessment on Record Journal\u2019s personal property that was listed on the city\u2019s grand lists for 1991-1994 following an audit of Record Journal\u2019s personal property declarations for those years. Except for the city\u2019s additional 25 percent assessment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-53,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Record Journal has paid all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>taxes and interest due on its computer equipment pursuant to the reassessment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">On the basis of advice from a consulting firm that was hired to evaluate Record Journal\u2019s tax liability, Record Journal allocated 20 percent of the value of the computer equipment at issue in the years 1991-1993 to software that was already installed into the computer. Record Journal utilized this approach from 1985 until the audit. The consulting firm\u2019s advice was in an opinion letter and indicated that Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment could be valued with a 20 percent allowance for tax exempt miscellaneous software costs. Record Journal never advised the city of the letter, and the city never received or reviewed this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Record Journal has listed its computer equipment on the grand lists for all tax years since 1985, and specifically for the years 1991-1993. Additionally, Record Journal has paid personal property taxes on the computer equipment for each year that it was listed on the grand lists. The city disagreed with Record Journal\u2019s valuation of its computer equipment and reassessed the equipment at a higher value for the period 1991-1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The city first claims that the trial court, contrary to the joint stipulation of facts, improperly determined that the city received notice of a tax exemption of computer software that was already loaded into Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u201c \u2018The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole .... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>24 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Leggett Street Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Beacon Industries, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 284, 301, 685 A.2d 305 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated that \u201c[b]ased on the advice [of a consulting firm, Record Journal] included in its valuation a 20 percent tax exemption for miscellaneous software costs, giving notice to the city of the exemption claimed as early as 1985. Thereafter, the exemption continued to be claimed and taxes paid, presumably without objection, until an audit having reference to the grand lists in dispute (1991-1994).\u201d The parties stipulated that the city neither received nor reviewed the letter that Record Journal received from its consulting firm relating to the valuation of the computer equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that whether the city received notice of the exemption claimed is not pertinent to the resolution of the ultimate issues that were before the trial court. Specifically, the trial court determined that \u201c[w]hile a 20 percent reduction may have resulted in an undervaluation of the overall equipment,\u201d the controlling aspect was that the 25 percent additional assessment \u201capplies only to omitted property, not all property reassessed pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b). <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 457 n.24, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).\u201d Accordingly, even if the trial court improperly found that the city had notice, the finding was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The city also asserts that the trial court improperly determined that Record Journal had claimed a tax exemption for the computer software and that when the city learned of the exemption it did not object. After reviewing the record, we agree that there is nothing in the joint stipulation of facts indicating that Record Journal ever claimed a tax exemption. Whether Record Journal claimed an exemption and whether the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>objected are not relevant to the resolution of the ultimate issues that were before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The city next claims that the trial court improperly applied \u00a7 12-71 (e) (1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in concluding that Record Journal\u2019s computer software was exempt from taxation as intangible personal property. Specifically, the city contends that Record Journal\u2019s computer software was personal property subject to taxation pursuant to \u00a7 12-71 (e) (1), and that the 20 percent reduction of the cost of the computer equipment was not justified. Record Journal agrees with the city that the software is taxable and it has paid all taxes and interest due. The applicability of \u00a7 12-71 (e) (1) is not at issue. Indeed, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision states that \u201cthe only issue before the court . . . [was] whether \u00a7 12-53 . . . authorizes the city of Meriden to penalize [Record Journal] by imposing an additional 25 percent assessment against the company\u2019s computer equipment.\u201d Accordingly, we need not address this claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The city next claims that the trial court improperly concluded that Record Journal had sustained its burden of proof in establishing that an illegal tax was imposed by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u201c \u2018The scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.

Thus, the record before the trial court was identical to the record before this court. \u201cIn these circumstances, the legal inferences properly to be drawn from the parties\u2019 definitive stipulation of facts raise questions of law rather than of fact. . . . Accordingly, our review of the ruling of the trial court in this case is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b), omitted taxable property discovered by the town assessor and not listed by the owner as required by law, shall be added to the owner\u2019s property tax list at a percentage of its actual valuation, as determined by the assessor in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 12-71 and 25 percent of such assessment will also be added to the actual valuation. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cthere is no statutory authority for the levy of a penalty assessment for understating the value of assessable property. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 12-53 authorizes a penalty only for property <em>omitted </em>from a list.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 651, 563 A.2d 688 (1989). Furthermore, in <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 452-53 n.21, our Supreme Court quoted the Handbook for Connecticut Assessors, which states that when declared property \u201c \u2018is found to have been under-reported (i.e., the cost was understated), the assessment may be increased but no penalty can be applied.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The parties have stipulated that the software at issue was loaded into Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment and that the company has listed the computer equipment for all of the tax years in question. The software was thus part of the property that Record Journal declared on its property tax declarations as computer equipment. For each of the tax years at issue, Record Journal declared its computer equipment, valued it at 80 percent of its value, allocating the remaining 20 percent to the software that was loaded into the equipment. The city disagreed with this valuation of the computer equipment and reassessed the tax based on a higher value. At that time, the city also assessed the 25 percent additional assessment. The city asserts that by omitting the value of the software, Record Journal omitted the software itself from its property declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The city did not claim that Record Journal omitted the software from its declaration, a claim that it could hardly maintain in light of the stipulation that the software was loaded into the computer equipment and the computer equipment was listed for all years since 1985. Instead, the city asserts, and Record Journal concedes, that the reduction in the value of the computer equipment by the value of the loaded software was an omission of the <em>value </em>of the loaded software. The city claims that the omission of the value of the software amounted to an omission of the software.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We agree with the trial court that the computer equipment as a whole was merely undervalued and that the software was not omitted from the tax declarations. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 651, and <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 452-53 n.21, the 25 percent additional assessment on Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment was not authorized by \u00a7 12-53 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The city finally claims that the trial court improperly determined that Record Journal did not omit its computer software from the disputed grand lists. As discussed in part III, we conclude that Record Journal undervalued, rather than omitted, its computer equipment from its property tax declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In this opinion O\u2019CONNELL, C.

On the basis of that advice, it included in its valuation a 20 percent tax exemption for miscellaneous software costs, <em>giving notice to the city of the exemption </em>claimed as early as 1985. Thereafter, <em>the exemption continued to be claimed </em>and taxes paid presumably without objection until an audit .... The parties have entered into a \u2018joint stipulation of fact\u2019 which includes those facts above mentioned . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The parties, however, stipulated to the following facts: \u201cBased on the advice of a consulting firm that Record Journal had hired to evaluate its tax liability . . . Record Journal allocated 20 percent of the value of the computer equipment ... to software already loaded onto the computer equipment. Record Journal undertook this approach . . . pursuant to advice contained in an opinion letter from [the consultant] that indicated that Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment could be valued with a 20 percent allowance for tax-exempt miscellaneous software costs. . . . <em>The city never received nor did it ever review the letter </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">There is nothing in the stipulated facts indicating that the city had notice of Record Journal\u2019s method of reducing the total value of the computer equipment, for tax liability purposes, by 20 percent because of its receipt of erroneous advice from a consultant that indicated that this method was appropriate because computer software is tax exempt. It was after the city\u2019s audit that the city issued a change of assessment for years 1991-1994 because of this reduction by Record Journal. The trial court\u2019s finding of fact, therefore, has no support in the record and is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Unlike the majority, I do not conclude that this error is harmless.

What is controlling in the instant context is that \u2018[t]he 25 percent penalty only applies to omitted property, not to all property reassessed pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">While I agree that Record Journal\u2019s computer \u201cequipment\u201d was undervalued, the computer \u201cequipment\u201d was undervalued by the omission of the \u201csoftware.\u201d It is the computer software and not the computer equipment that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The trial court and the majority cite <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 457 n.24, 692 A.2d 742 (1997), and <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 651, for the proposition that the 25 percent additional assessment on Record Journal\u2019s computer equipment was not authorized by either \u00a7 12-53 (b) or the applicable case law. These cases do state that the 25 percent penalty can be applied only to omitted property and not to understated or underreported property. These cases, however, are not dispositive of the issue of what is \u201comitted\u201d property under \u00a7 12-53.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Record Journal estimated the cost of software already loaded into the computer hardware at 20 percent of the value of the computer equipment on the basis of the advice of a consultant. Record Journal then reduced the value of its computer equipment by 20 percent, the exact amount at which the software was estimated. Section 12-71 (e) (1), however, indicates that computer software, which is included in the cost of the hardware and is not separately stated, is taxable personal property. Both parties agree that the software in this case is taxable. The computer software, however, was not separately stated, nor was it included in the value of the computer hardware. Under these circumstances, I believe that the computer software was omitted and not listed as required by \u00a7 12-53. On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Record Journal did not omit its software is not legally or logically correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Because I believe that the trial court improperly found that the city had notice of Record Journal\u2019s claimed tax exemption for computer software, misapplied \u00a7 12-71, and improperly held that Record Journal did not omit its software, I conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that Record Journal sustained its burden of proof that an illegal penalty was imposed was not legally or logically correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I would reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> In addition to \u00a7 12-71 (e) (1), the trial court cited <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 563 A.2d 688 (1989), for support, that computer software is intangible personal property not subject to taxation. The trial court\u2019s reliance on this case is misplaced. In <em>Northeast Datacom, </em>Inc., our Supreme Court held that computer software was intangible personal property not subject to taxation under \u00a7 12-71, however, the court did not mention \u00a7 12-71 (e) (1), the section of the statute applicable to computer software. Although our Supreme Court decided the issue of whether \u201ccomputer software constitutes personal property subject to municipal taxation under General Statutes \u00a7 12-71\u201d in <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 640, on August 15, 1989, after the effective date of the amendment to the statute that added subsection (e), the language applicable to computer software; see Public Acts 1989, No. 89-251, \u00a7 193 (adding subsection [e]); the taxation at issue in that case occurred in years before \u00a7 12-71 (e) (1) took effect. In addition, the computer software at issue in <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra, 642, was \u201c \u2018canned software purchased by [the plaintiff], software customized by outside contractors for [the plaintiff], and custom software developed by [the plaintiff] itself \u201d and, therefore, was not software that was already loaded into the computer hardware.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\"> The trial court reasoned that \u201c[a] penalty of 25 percent is authorized only in those instances where the property in question was omitted from the grand list. . . . There is no statutory authority for the levy of a penalty assessment for understating the value of assessable property. . . . The court finds that the plaintiff did not omit the computer software from the grand list in dispute. Rather, on the advice of its consultant it allocated 20 percent of the value of the computer equipment to software. . . . Since computer software is deemed intangible personal property not subject to tax, the allocation of a percentage reduction was justified. . . . While a 20 percent reduction may have resulted in an undervaluation of the overall equipment, this fact is not controlling. What is controlling in the instant context is that [t]he 25 percent penalty only applies to omitted property, not to all property reassessed pursuant to \u00a7 12-53 (a) and (b).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\"> See footnote 1.
