THE CENTRAL PARK, NORTH AND EAST RIVER RAILROAD COMPANY, Defendants and Respondents.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b404-7\">It is the duty of. a passenger, upon getting on a city railroad car, to place himself in as safe a position thereon as he is able to obtain, and it is no excuse on his part for placing himself in an unsafe one, that the persons in charge know that he is unsafe and do not drive him therefrom, when the danger is equally well known to him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b404-8\">Although standing upon the platform of a car is not negligence <em>per se, </em>but open to explanation, yet, where a passenger stood upon the very edge of the platform, without holding on to anything, and with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>knowledge of the bad condition of the street and track caused by accumulations of ice and snow, and maintained such position after an opportunity had been given to him to exchange it for a place of comparative safety, until thown off by a jerk of the car occasioned by the said bad condition of such street and <em>track,\u2014Held, </em>that he was guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury, and could not recover against the railroad company, notwithstanding the latter were also negligent.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b405-5\">Before Barbour, Ch. J., and Freedman and Spencer, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b405-6\"><em>Decided July </em>1, 1871.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">Appeal from judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">The action was brought to recover damages for injuries sustained by plaintiff, a printer by trade, while riding upon one of defendants\u2019 cars, on the ground that such injuries resulted from the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">The defendants, by their answer, denied negligence on their part, and averred that the injuries sustained by plaintiff, if any, were caused wholly through his own carelessness and negligence, and not through the carelessness or negligence of the defendants, their agents or servants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">Upon the trial the plaintiff testified that in the month of January 1867, at the corner of Lewis and Seventh-streets, in the city of \u00a1New York, he got on board of one of defendants\u2019 cars, which was running south. The seats were all occupied, and in the centre of the car was a line of passengers holding on by the straps. While standing on the rear platform, the conductor came and collected the fare. Plaintiff thereupon, at the request of the conductor, stepped a little aside to allow the conductor to enter into the car. He stepped to the right, and found no place to stand .upon except on the edge of the platform. There was a passenger before him who held on to the iron rod which protected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>window, and another behind him, resting against the back part of the platform, and plaintiff stood between them, without having hold of anything,- At the corner of Sixth-street the car stopped to take up two more passengers.' The rear platform was so crowded that there was no room for them to get up. At the request of the conductor plaintiff got off, and then stood on a block or chunk of ice, until the said two passengers had safely got aboard, and then got up again into the car, and stepped back into the same position between the two passengers first spoken of, which he had occupied before. The car drove on quite rapidly for about two blocks, when a jolt or jerk of the car threw the plaintiff off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">It also appeared by plaintiff\u2019s testimony, that it had been snowing three or four days before, that the snow had got frozen, that on the day in question there we;re large chunks of ice along- the track that had not been cleared off, and that the whole street, through which the track runs, was in a very bad condition in consequence of the accumulations of ice and snow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">Upon the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendants\u2019 counsel moved for a nonsuit, upon the grounds,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-7\">1. That the plaintiff had contributed, by his own negligence, to the accident, and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\"><em>2. </em>That no negligence was shown on the part of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">The court granted the motion, and plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">The defendants entered judgment, and plaintiff appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-11\"><em>Henry L. </em>Clinton, counsel for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-12\"><em>A. J. </em>Vanderpoel, counsel for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-13\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAv\">The only question of law . which is before us, arises upon the exception'of plaintiff to the nonsuit ordered by the court. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>was no request to be permitted to go to the jury, and no motion has been made for a new trial. The evidence, which is uncontradicted, presents two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">First; Was the plaintiff free \u2022 from contributory negligence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Second: Were the defendants guilty of negligence on the occasion in question <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">To justify the nonsuit, one of these questions must be held against the plaintiff, and so clearly, that there is no room for doubt. On a question of nonsuit, all disputed facts are to be decided in favor of the plaintiff, and all presumptions and inferences, which he had a right to ask from the jury, are to be conceded to him (Cook v. N. Y. Central R. R. Co., 3 <em>Trans. App. </em>8).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In Clark <em>v. </em>Eighth-avenue R. R. Co., 36 <em>N. Y. </em>135, the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court, laid down the doctrine, that whenever it appears that a passenger is riding in a car in a place of hazard or danger, his negligence is <em>jprima facie </em>proved, and the onus is upon him to rebut the presumption. Although this proposition may not be regarded as an authoritative decision by the court of appeals, it has been expressly laid down as the law of this court, in Solomon v. The Central Park, N. &amp; E. R. R. Co., 1 Sweeny, 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The presumption may be overcome by proof that the passenger could not get any safer place. Thus, in Hardencamp <em>v. </em>The Second-avenue E. E. Co., reported in the <em>Transcript </em>of March 22, 1870, it appeared by uncontradicted evidence, that both platforms and the inside of the car were so full, that the plaintiff, having got upon the front platform, could not get any safer place. In Clark <em>v. </em>The Eighth-avenue R. R. Co., 36 <em>N. Y. </em>135, it seems to have been conceded, that there was no other room for plaintiff, except upon the steps, where the conductor called upon him for, and received from him his fare. In Sheridan <em>v. </em>The Brooklyn &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Newtown R. R. Co., 36 N. <em>Y. </em>39, the evidence showed that the conductor forced the boy, against his remonstrance, to give up an inside seat, and to occupy a place on the platform. In each of these cases, a recovery by plaintiff was upheld, but at the same time, the principle fully recognized, that it is the duty of a passenger, upon getting on board of a car, not only to use ordinary care and attention to protect himself while there, but also to place himself in as safe a position therein as he is able to obtain, and that it is ho excuse on his part for placing himself in an unsafe one, that the persons in charge know that he is unsafe, and do not drive him therefrom, when the danger is equally well known to such passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The application of this rule to the uncontroverted facts of this case is fatal to the plaintiff, even if we assume, without inquiry, that the defendants, who are bound to use all the care and prudence which human sagacity and foresight can suggest, for the purpose of preventing injury to their passengers, carried in the way in which they undertake to carry them, were guilty of negligence in the performance of their duty towards the plaintiff. According to the latter\u2019s own showing, there was no necessity for him to stand, as he did. He could have got inside in place of the conductor, and in point of fact, did get in, after the injury, without any one having left the car to make room for him. Again: he could have occupied part of the place which the two passengers assumed, who got upon the car after him, and for whom he stepped aside. He was under no obligation to do so. He seems to have been fully cognizant of the bad condition in which the street and the track were in, at that particular time and place, in consequence of the accumulations of snow and ice. To every passenger of his age, intelligence and experience, observing ordinary caution, that condition must have been suggestive, not only of the possi* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>bility, but the extreme probability of the car receiving just such a jolt-. or jerk, as that which subsequently occurred, and which resulted in plaintiff\u2019s injuries. To stand, under such circumstances, upon the very edge of the platform, without holding on to anything, and to maintain such position after an opportunity had been had to exchange it for a place of comparative safety, was, therefore, negligence on the part of the plaintiff, which contributed to the injury, and debars him from a recovery, no matter how negligent the defendants may have been. The mere request by the conductor, to step aside for a moment and allow two other passengers to get on, is no sufficient excuse for the plaintiff under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
