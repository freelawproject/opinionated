SANDS, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b523-8\">The statute under which this action is brought requires every com pany that is formed under its provisions to make, publish,\u2019and file annually, within twenty days from the first day of January, a report of its condition, which report shall be signed by the president and a majority of the trustees, and shall be verified by the oath of the president or the secretary of the company. And it is further provided that if any of said companies shall fail so to do, all the trustees of the company shall be jointly and severally liable for <em>all </em>the debts of the company then existing, and for all that shall be contracted before such report shall be made (Act for the Formation of Corporations for Mining, &amp;c., \u00a7 13). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Under the decisions of the courts of this State, upon questions arising upon this section of the statute, the following propositions may be considered and regarded as the law of this state:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-5\">I. Upon the default of the company to report, all the trustees then in office are jointly and severally liable for <em>all the debts </em>of the company, whether contracted by them (trustees) or their predecessors, and for all that may be subsequently contracted during their continuance in office, until such report is made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-6\">II. Trustees who, during such default, retire from office, are liable for all debts of the company then existing (at the time of their withdrawal), but for no subsequent debts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-7\">HI. Their successors, by promptly obeying the requirements of the statute, may escape all personal liability for the debts existing at the time they take office, but if they continue the default until the next January ensuing, they are liable for the debts contracted during their administration up to that time, and for no other, unless they then make default in reporting, and in such case they become liable for all the debts of the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-8\">IV. Thus the successive members of successive boards of trustees may become liable for the same debts, by reason of successive defaults in reporting.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-9\">A default of a company to report that takes place after the expiration of the term of office of a trustee (his place not being filled by an election), cannot be charged upon such a trustee, from the simple fact of his place not being filled, and that he <em>may </em>hold over. It must appear that he continued to act as trustee and assumed to perform the duties of the office.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b524-10\">Is a judgment recovered against a company evidence of a debt of said company, in an action brought subsequently against a trustee to enforce this liability under the statute ?</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b524-11\">Before Barbour, Ch.

He also averred payment, and the recovery of a judgment by plaintiff against Bamford, a stockholder, for one thousand and twenty-six dollars and two cents upon the same demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">Upon the trial plaintiff proved, among other things, his employment by the company, through one Lestrade, the superintendent of the company, the services rendered by him, the terms on which he was employed, his account as certified by the superintendent of the company, the recovery on the 18th of May, 1868, of judgment, upon the merits, after trial, against the company, the judgment roll and execution and return <em>nulla bona. </em>Also, the election of the defendant as . trustee on the 25th of July, 1866, and his acceptance of the trust at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-8\">Also, that between the 11th of February, 1865, and the 30th of January, 1869, no annual report had been filed, as required by law, except one on the 19th of January, 1866, which was signed by three trustees other than the defendant, and verified by the secretary, and another on the. 14th of January, 1867, which was signed and verified by the secretary alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-9\">After plaintiff had rested, the defendant moved for a dismissal of the complaint, on the grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-10\"><em>First. </em>That the plaintiff had shown no authority on the part of Mr. Lestrade to appoint him on behalf of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Second. </em>That the defendant was not Hable, a report having been filed with the county clerk and published during the time he was trustee, showing the condition of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\"><em>Third. </em>That reports having been filed within twenty days after the' first days of January, 1866 and 1867, though informal, were a sufficient compliance with the law, the statute being directory merely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\"><em>Fourth. </em>A trustee who has neglected to report; is personally liable only for those debts which were contracted while he was in office, and not for those contracted before a default had been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">Motion denied.

That the organization of the company was a mere formal matter ; that it never had'any property or business, and, therefore, there was never any necessity for filing and publishing the annual statement required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-10\"><em>2. </em>That the plaintiff having already recovered judgment against Bamford, a stockholder, his claim against the defendant is merged in that judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-11\">Motion denied, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-12\">The defendant, thereupon, requested the court to direct the jury that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for his services, for which he recovered judgment in the suit against Bamford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-13\">The court declined, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The defendant finally requested the court to charge that if the plaintiff could recover at all from the defendant, he could only recover for that portion of his services which were rendered during the time the defendant was a trustee of the company, which was about seven months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">The court refused so to charge, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">The court held the reports filed to be insufficient, and submitted to the jury the question whether the services were performed by the plaintiff, and if so, whether they were performed for the company or for Mr. Lestrade individually, charging them, if the work was done for the company, to return a verdict for the plaintiff <em>for whatever sum, in their judgment, his services were worth; </em>but'if the work was done for Lestrade, to return a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">At the conclusion of the charge plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggested that if plaintiff is entitled to anything he is entitled to the amount of his certified bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\"><em>The </em>Court.\u2014-I think he is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\"><em>Mr. Waite, </em>one of the counsel for defendant, excepted to this remark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\"><em>Mr. Cook, </em>associate counsel for defendant, excepted to that part of the charge in which the court had said that if the jury found that the work was done for the company they must find a verdict against the defendant for the <em>value </em>of the labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-11\">The jury retired, and afterwards returned a verdict for the plaintiff for four thousand five hundred and eighty-six dollars and seventy-five cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-12\">Defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon moved for a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes, which motion was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-13\">After entry of judgment, defendant appealed from the judgment, and also from the order denying defendant\u2019 s motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Robert N.

And it is further provided that if any of said companies shall fail so to do, all the trustees of the company shall be jointly and severally liable for all the debts of the company then existing, and for all that shall be contracted before such report shall be made (Act of 1848, <em>\u00a712 ; 2 Rev. Stat. </em>5 ed. 661, \u00a7 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">These provisions are enacted on grounds of public policy for the protection of creditors and the prevention of frauds upon the public in respect to the financial condition of such corporations. It is clear that the liability of the trustees is not imposed as an indemnity, because it has no relation to the actual loss or injury sustained by the party in whose favor the action is given (Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bliss, 35 <em>N. Y. </em>416, affirming S. C., <em>21 How. </em>365, and 13 <em>Abb. Pr. 225).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">It is in the nature of a penalty for misconduct in office (Dabney <em>v. </em>Stevens, 40 <em>How. </em>345).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">To escape this liability the trustees must comply with the conditions prescribed. The statute requires \u00e1 report within the first .twenty days of the month of January in each year after the formation of the company, and without reference to the time the company has come into existence. Being a penal statute, however, it is tobe strictly construed. Whenever the penalty is sought to be enforced, and to prevent the injustice which a strict literal interpretation would have worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>in many instances, the courts have invariably so construed it as to hold trustees only liable for their own default or misconduct, and not for the default or misconduct of their predecessors or successors in office. The following four propositions, it seems to me, may now be regarded as the law of this State:</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">1. Upon the default of the company to report, all the trustees then in office are jointly and severally liable for <em>all </em>the debts of the company then existing, whether contracted by them or their predecessors, and for all that may be subsequently contracted during their continuance in office until such report is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>2. </em>Trustees who, upon such default, retire from office, are liable for <em>all </em>debts of the company <em>then </em>existing, but for no subsequent ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">3. Their successors, by promptly obeying the requirements of the statute, may escape all liability; but if they continue the default until the next January they are liable for the debts contracted during their administration up to that time, and for no other, unless they then and there make default, in which latter case they become liable for <em>all </em>debts then existing.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">4. Thus, the members of successive boards of trustees may become liable for the <em>same </em>debts by reason of successive defaults (Boughton <em>v. </em>Otis, 21 <em>N. Y. </em>261 ; Shaler and Hall Quarry Co. <em>v. </em>Bliss,, <em>27 N. Y. </em>297, affirming 34 <em>Barb. </em>309, and 12 <em>Abb. </em>470 ; Garrison v<em>. </em>Howe, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>458 ; Miller <em>v. </em>White, 57 <em>Barb. </em>504 ; Nimmons <em>v. </em>Hennion, <em>Transcript of May </em>27, 1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">This court has further held that a default of a company, happening after. the expiration of the term of office of a trustee, cannot, for want of a subsequent election to fill his place, be charged upon such trustee except by proof of his continuance in office by his afterwards assuming to act, and acting as such trustee (Deming <em>v. </em>Puleston, decided April 1, 1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Whether a judgment recovered against a company is evidence of the indebtedness of said company in a subsequent action brought against a trustee, is a question which has produced much conflict of authority. In McHarg <em>v. </em>Eastman, 35 <em>How. </em>205, this court held that it is not. The supreme court, on the other hand, decided, in 1870, in Miller <em>v. </em>White, 57 <em>Barb. </em>504, that it is; holding, aft\u00e9r a review of many conflicting decisions upon this point, that the rule, that the judgment is evidence, is supported by such a preponderance of authority that it should be left to the court of last resort to change it, if a change be desirable. Certain it is, that to charge a trustee the statute does not require, as a preliminary step, the recovery of a j udgment against the corporation, which is necessary to fix the liability of stockholders, in certain cases, hi or does it forbid such judgment. The liability imposed upon a trustee is for certain debts, which must either be due and capable of enforcement against the corporation at the time of the alleged misconduct or default of said trustee, or have been contracted while he continued or acted as such, after default. In the case at bar the j udgment. against the corporation was admitted in evidence, against defendant\u2019s objection upon the ground of immateriality, but at the same time the debt was proven by other evidence. In looking over the said evidence I am satisfied that the plaintiff sufficiently proved, to be entitled to go to the jury at least, not only the rendition of the services and their price, but also his employment by the superintendent of the company within the apparent scope of the latter\u2019s authority, and a ratification of such employment and acceptance of the benefits accruing therefrom by the company. The question whether the services were performed by the plaintiff, and if so, whether they were performed for the company or for the superintendent individually was distinctly submitted to the jury, who were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>structed to render a verdict for the defendant, in case they should find .that the work was done for the superintendent individually. It was not necessary to prove a special authority on the part of the superintendent to employ plaintiff. The defendant might have requested that the questions of implied authority and subsequent ratification be submitted, as distinct questions of fact, to the j ury under proper instructions. Having failed to do so, and acquiesced in that part of the charge which necessarily involved these questions, he cannot, upon appeal, be permitted to argue for the first time that they should have been so submitted (Schroff v. Bauer, decided by this court April 1, 1871, and authorities there cited). There being sufficient evidence, beyond the judgment, to sustain the finding of the jury, it is unnecessary to express an opinion as to whether the judgment was or was not evidence against the defendant, and the latter having based his objection to its admission solely upon the ground of its immateriality, the exception taken to its reception cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Heither of the reports filed in the office of the county clerk conformed to the statutory requirements. The statute demands that the report shall be signed by the <em>president </em>and a majority of the trustees, and verified by the president on secretary, which was never done. The report made in January, 1866, which was signed by three of the trustees and verified by the secretary, may at least be regarded as an attempt at substantial compliance. But even if the statute can be satisfied with anything short of full performance, it seems too clear for argument, at least to me, that the report filed in 1867, which was signed and verified by the secretary exclusively, can have no force whatever to protect any of the trustees, whose duty it was to see it made, published and filed in the manner prescribed by the statute. The argument advanced, that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>fendant should not be made liable for a fault that he could not control, can have no weight in the face of the positive language of the statute. At any rate, whatever force there might have been .in the suggestion, if defendant had in point of fact made a report, so far as in his power, is wholly lost by reason of the fact that defendant took no step whatever towards procuring a report. According to the proof, he was elected trustee on the 35th July, 1866, for the year then ensuing, and commenced to act as such next day. Whether or not' he became liable, simply by acting as such after and during the continuance of the default of the company in that year, for any of the services rendered by plaintiff during any part of that year, it is hardly necessary to discuss. The company failing to make and file a report, as required bylaw, in 1867, the defendant be-, came liable, by reason of such default, for plaintiff\u2019s' claim up to December 31,-1866, and, as no report was subsequently made, he continued liable for plaintiff\u2019s subsequent services, so long as he continued a trustee. Plaintiff\u2019s claim extends to the first day of July, 1867, on which day he left the company\u2019s employ. That being within the year for which defendant was' elected, he became liable for the whole debt due to the plaintiff by the company at that time, and the plaintiff, therefore, if entitled to recover anything, was entitled, as the evidence stood, to recover the balance of his bill, certified as correct by the superintendent of the company. The testimony of the plaintiff being uncontradicted on this point, the result will be the same, whether the action be considered as brought to recover the value of the services or the contract price per month as testified by him to have been agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The recovery of a judgment of one thousand and twenty-six dollars and two cents by plaintiff against Bamford, cannot in any way affect this cas\u00e9. The liability of Bamford depends upon an entirely distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>state of facts and upon a different statutory provision, by which an additional right of action is given. He was sued as a stockholder under that section of the statute which makes the stockholders of a company jointly and severally individually liable for debts due and owing to their laborers, servants and apprentices, for services performed for such corporation. As such stockholder Bamford is liable only to a limited extent, but that limit does not apply to trustees. The mere recovery of said judgment, without payment, is, therefore, no more a bar or merger than the recovery of the judgment against the corporation. In the case of <em>joint wrongdoers a </em>plea of a former recovery against one, to be good, must also aver actual satisfaction. And in the case of <em>joint debtors </em>the rule that a judgment obtained against one bars a suit against all others, applies only where the judgment is based upon the same matter, cause and thing, for which the second suit is brought (2 <em>Phil. on Ev. </em>5 Ed. 114 [*134] ; Wies <em>v. </em>Fanning, 9 <em>How. </em>546).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The 'statute referred to gives not only a right of action against trustees for certain reasons, and another against stockholders for other reasons, but expressly provides, in addition, that in the first case the said trustees, and in the second case the said stockholders shall <em>be jointly </em>and <em>severally </em>liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be severally affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Barboub, Ch. J., and Spences, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
