This question was fully and fairly submitted by the court to the jury, who found, by their verdict, that no such disobedience took place. There is no exception to the charge of the court upon this branch of the case. But the appellant insists that the court erred in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>allow the defendant to prove that plaintiff, <em>after </em>he had been discharged, sent notices to customers whose names he had drawn off the patterns. This evidence, being wholly irrelevant to the issue, was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The evidence relied on to establish that plaintiff had acted in a manner derogatory to the interests of his employer, showed, that on April 24, 1868, plaintiff committed, in defendant\u2019s store, during defendant's absence therefrom, an assault and battery upon Craney, another employee of defendant. It also appeared that defendant retained plaintiff in his employ for eleven or twelve days after knowledge of the occurrence, and until the determination of a criminal prosecution instituted against plaintiff by Craney. The learned judge below, therefore, very properly submitted to the jury the question, whether under all the circumstances the defendant should or should not be -considered as having waived the previous transgression on April 24, provided they found, that there was a transgression on that day, of the duty which plaintiff owed to defendant. The jury had previously been instructed that the fact of plaintiff\u2019s conviction by the magistrate (of which there was no proof), had no weight and was not sufficient per <em>se </em>to justify plaintiff\u2019s dismissal, but that the dismissal must be justified out of the occurrences out of which the conviction arose. Ho objection was made to these latter remarks, and the defendant contented himself with taking a general exception to that portion of the charge which related to the question of waiver, but in the points submitted by the appellant the same has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the court below erred in rejecting the offer made by defendant to prove by the witness Craney, \u201cthatthe said witness made a charge against the plaintiff before a police magistrate, which was tried, and that after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>decision of the magistrate, Mr. Bell discharged the plaintiff,\u201d to which rejection defendant took an exception. Now, if the defendant had, prior to such offer, testified, as his counsel subsequently merely argued, that he, defendant, was unable at the time to determine upon the conflicting statements of fellow workmen as to whether Craney or plaintiff was the real aggressor or otherwise at fault, and for that reason determined to and did await the decision of the magistrate before discharging either, the proposed evidence, If offered to sustain such theory, would have been admissible upon the question of waiver already referred to, and its retion, under such circumstances, would probably have been error. But it was not offered for any such purpose. The very first witness called on defendant\u2019s side was Craney, and after he had given his version of the assault, defendant\u2019s counsel offered to prove by <em>Ms </em>testimony, that a criminal charge had been made, that a trial had been had, and that plaintiff was discharged by defendant after the rendition of the magistrate\u2019s decision upon such trial. No foundation, therefore, had been laid for the introduction of such evidence, even if otherwise competent, nor was it pointed out to the court in what aspect of the case it might become material. When subsequently the defendant went upon the stand, as a witness on his own behalf, the offer was not only not repeated, but the defendant wholly failed to testify to any fact or circumstance which might have had a tendency to render the said rejected evidence material. No error was consequently committed by its exclusion at the time and under the circumstances referred to, for it is a well settled rule, under the English practice as well as our own, that an offer of evidence must be made in such terms as to leave no room for doubt as to its competency and materiality under a proper definition of the law applicable thereto, and if not so made, a. general exception to its exclusion will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>not be available unless it appears plainly that the court understood the ground which in law might have justified its reception.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The appeal in this case being from the judgment merely, the only questions open to review are questions of law arising upon the exceptions presented by appel-. lant\u2019s points, and such exceptions having been found to be untenable, the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
