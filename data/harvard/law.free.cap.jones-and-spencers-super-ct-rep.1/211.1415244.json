Because by the statutes the defendants were the mere servants of the commissioners of emigration, and could not be made liable for any baggage delivered into Castle Garden until it was checked by the railroads represented by the agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-11\">II. Because the complaint alleged a delivery to defendants on board of the vessel, which had not been proved, and such allegation could not be sustained by proof of delivery in the Garden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-12\">III. That, if these defendants were liable at all, it was a joint liability which could not be severed, and all must be sued and served, or the action could not be maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-13\">IY. That, by statute, these defendants could not be made liable for any city baggage not intended for inland transportation, this baggage being under the sole control of .the commissioners of emigration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The court denied the motion, to which defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">The evidence thereupon introduced showed that at the time alleged, to wit, May 34, 1867, the defendants, McDonald, Van Hess and Daly, were jointly engaged in a kind of business in the interior of Castle Carden, which appears to have been as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">McDonald represented the Pennsylvania Railroad, Van Hess the Erie, and Daly the Hew York Central. For the benefit of those roads in soliciting travel, and their convenience in booking passengers and receiving and checking their baggage, these parties,, known as the railroad agency, were admitted into Gfastle Carden for that'purpose, to the exclusion of all other parties. These railroad agents (the defendants), derived a profit by way of a commission or allowance upon the tickets sold by them. It appeared that the commissioners of emigration allotted to these agents a portion of their premises, in which to transact then- business, and imposed upon them as a condition of the privileges accorded to them, the duty of receiving, taking charge of and delivering_the baggage and 'effects of the immigrants who intendecTtcTremhiri'ih the city, as well as of those who purchased tickets- Tor-rthose railroads; and the commissioners \"aBowed the defendants to charge ten cents for each package.-which remained in their custody over forty-eight hours, according to one witness, or twenty-four hours according to the defendants\u2019 testimony. The money thus received went to the individual benefit of the defendants, and made part of a general fund, which, - after paying the expenses of labor, &amp;c., was divided among them. If the expenses had exceeded the profits, the defendants would have had to pay them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">It also appeared that under another regulation made by the commissioners of emigration, it was the duty of one Captain Hall to convey the baggage of the immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>grants from the steamer to Castle Garden, and that the employees of Captain Hall checked the baggage before it was taken from the steamer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">After the close of the evidence on both sides plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to strike out the name of Nicholas Muller in the complaint as he had put it in on the information that he was one of the railroad agents at the time the baggage was lost, and it appeared from the testimony in the case that he was not an agent at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">The court granted the motion, to which defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">The defendants\u2019 counsel then requested the court to dismiss the complaint and to direct a verdict for the defendants, for the reasons urged by him on the motion for the nonsuit, and for the additional reason :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">V. That it appeared from the evidence that defendants were the mere agents in all cases of either the railroad companies they represented, or the commissioners of emigration, and could not be personally charged in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">The court refused so to do, to which defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">The court, on motion of the counsel for plaintiff, directed the jury to find a verdict for plaintiff against the defendants John McDonald, Cornelius Van Ness and John Daly; and the jury, thereupon, under the direction of the court, rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed the damages at eight hundred and seventy-nine dollars.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-11\">The court then ordered that the exceptions taken by the defendants be heard at the general term of this court in the first instance, and that judgment in the mean time be suspended.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-12\"><em>Malcolm </em>Campbell, attorney for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-13\"><em>Charles C. </em>Bigelow, attorney for defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">Under the statutes in force at the time of the commencement of this action, the commissioners of emigration were public officers of the State government, whose powers and duties were strictly defined by law. Aq such officers, they had no power to make any contract for tBe acceptanc\u00e9pi\u00e1fe-keeping or return of the baggage of any person. The rules and regulations prescribed by them, pursuant to the authority conferred upon them by statute, for the landing of immigrants and their baggage, must be deemed to have been established for the general good and better protection of immigrants arriving at the port of New York ; but if such rules and regulations have failed to protect the plaintiff, it is a misfortune; for which he has no remedy against the State or against the commissioners in their official character, for the assumption by the government of control over such matters cannot be held to operate as a contract of general indemnity (Murphy <em>v. </em>The Commissioners, &amp;c., 28 <em>N. Y. </em>134.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">To enumerate the instances in which the commissioners, or any of them, might become individually liable, would, in the present case, be a work of supererogation. Nor is it necessary to discuss how far and under what circumstances the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>should be applied to the several railroad companies who are represented at Castle Garden by the defendants; the only question to be determined in this case being whether the verdict directed against the defendants named can be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Passing over the questions arising from the change and substitution of parties, and the non-service of process upon two of the defendants, who were brought into court in a summary way, I shall at once proceed to examine, whether, upon the proofs adduced in support of the allegations of the complaint, a personal liability has been established on the part of the defendants ; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>for the purposes of such examination I will assume, without further inquiry, that in consequence of the manner in which they transacted their business at Castle Garden as the so-called railroad agency, they were personally responsible, to some extent at least, for the safety of baggage coming into their possession and belonging to immigrants who intended to remain in the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">By the complaint, defendants stand charged as carriers, who, against plaintiff\u2019s consent, had taken possession of his baggage and assumed the duty of safely carrying and keeping the same. Proof of a compulsory taking of the baggage from plaintiff\u2019s possession by the defendants, and a refusal on their part to restore it, would consequently have been sufficient, without any proof of its subsequent fate, to enable plaintiff to recover. But plainiiff\u2019s evidence \u25a0 wholly failed in this respect, for it showed, that if there was any compulsory taking at all, it was done by Captain Hall* whose duty it was to convey the baggage to Castle Garden, and who, in the performance of such duty, acted under the regulations established by the commissioners, and not under any authority, express or implied, from defendants. If there was no compulsory taking, the action, being in \"the form of trover for a conversion, and not for a mere negligent loss, will not lie against a carrier or even a bailee, except upon proof of an absolute appropriation of the property by the carrier or bailee to his own use, or, what is equivalent, parting with it to others without authority from the owner (Devereux <em>v. </em>Barclay, 2 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>702 ; Stephenson v. Hart, 4 <em>Bing. </em>476 ; Youl <em>v. </em>Harbottle, <em>Peake\u2019s Cas. </em>49 ; Sublock <em>v. </em>Inglis, 1 <em>Stark. </em>154). For mere negligent loss the only forms of remedy formerly were either a special action on the case for a breach of the public duty of carrying and delivering safely, or of assumpsit for a breach of the undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>so to carry and deliver (Ross <em>v. </em>Johnson, 5 <em>Burr. </em>2825 ; Anon., 2 <em>Salk. </em>665). In Tolano <em>v. </em>The National Steam Navigation Co. (5 <em>Robt. </em>326), this was held by this court to constitute a substantial difference in the cause of action, which a plaintiff is bound to observe in the statement of facts constituting the complaint <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 142, subd. 2), if he seek to recover for mere non-delivery or loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">If this doctrine is sound law under our present practice, there was, at the time plaintiff rested his case, a total failure of proof as regards the cause of action alleged in the complaint, and the motion for a nonsuit should have been granted, especially as no motion was made by plaintiff for leave to amend. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">But aside from this objection, which may be open-to the criticism of being of a technical nature, the evidence appears to be altogether insufficient to fasten any liability upon the defendants. If, in consequence of the ' manner in which, and the circumstances under wliich, they transacted their business at Castle Garden, they are to be -considered as bailees without hire of the city baggage of immigrants, they can be held liable only upon proof of want of ordinary care in keeping it, or of an actual subsequent appropriation of it to their own use. But in either case it is absolutely nece\u00e1\\ / sary to establish, as the foundation of the liability, J and by competent proof in the first instance, that the . baggage_came into their possession for.the purpose of 5 being kept by them subject to the call of the owner. \u25a0Upon this point the evidence shows, that plaintiff saw .the missing box checkecTby sorifiTperson unknown to f him on boardTofUrhFvessET^S^vKich he arrived, and that he received a check therefor. But he was unable to state whether or not the check Jhus received was a duplicate of the strap check, which he saw attached to the box. There was also some evidence which had a tendency to show that a mistake occurred in the check<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing of this box. Plaintiff testified that he saw all his pieces landed by a lighter (commanded by Captain Hall) upon a wharf inside of Castle Harden, over which it appeared, the commissioners of emigration had control, and to which <em>all </em>their employees, who were quite numerous, as well as the defendants, had free access ; but that he did not count his pieces after they had been discharged from the lighter, although he was positive that all the large boxes and trunks (which included the box in question) went into Castle Harden. Edward Murphy, called as a witness on the part of plaintiff, testified that he was employed by the railroad agency as baggage master, and as such, had charge of the whole baggage, which included railroad as well as city baggage; that he presumed he was on the wharf when the baggage came in from th'e vessel, on which plaintiff had arrived, but that he ngmc_saw plaintiff\u2019s missing box. It also appeared that plaintiff did not discover his loss for ten or twelve days. All these facts, taken and weighed together and considered in connection with the Castle Harden regulations, so far as they were made to appear, fall very much short of establishing that there was, in point of fact, such a delivery by Captain_Hall_to the defendants, andrina acceptance on their part of the box in question, as is necessary for the creation of a legal liability founded thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Defendants\u2019 exceptions to the refusal of the court to dismiss the complaint, and to the directions of the verdict, should be sustained, and a new. trial ordered, with costs to the defendants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
