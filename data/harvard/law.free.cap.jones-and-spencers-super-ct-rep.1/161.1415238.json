Which premises the defendants were in possession of and wrongfully withheld from the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">The defendants\u2019 answer was a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">The action was tried before Mr. Justice Spekcer and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">The plaintiffs itntroduced a deed from Margaret S. Rutgers to Jeremiah L. Knapp, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, dated April 14, 1845, conveying certain premises by the following description, viz: \u201c All that certain lot of ground situated in the Fourteenth (late Eighth) Ward of the city of New York, distinguished \u25a0on a map made of the lands of Nicholas Bayard, Esq.., by lot No. 1,155, fronting on Crosby street, and in length on each side one hundred feet, be the same more or less, and in breadth front and rear twenty-five feet, be the same more or less.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-8\">They then proved ownership in the plaintiffs derived under the deed, and introduced a survey made in 1859, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>by Edwin Smith, city surveyor, of what was claimed to be the lot conveyed by the Rutgers deed, and which showed that the northerly line of that lot in possession of the defendants, encroached upon the plaintiffs\u2019 lot, from three inches in front, to fourteen inches in the rear, for a distance of about fifty-eight feet from the front.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">The plaintiffs also introduced another survey made in 1869 by James E. Serrell, also a city surveyor, of the same lot, with substantially the same result as the survey of Smith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">Serrell, who was examined as a witness, testified that he knew the map of the Bayard farm, and made Ms survey on the basis of that map. That\u00b0he found such map on file in the register\u2019s office, and recorded as map Ho. 386. That the map there recorded was not the original but a copy, or what purported to be a copy of the original. The witness further testified that there were two Bayard maps, so called, one of the west and one of the east farm ; that map 386 was a copy of the east farm map. He said he thought he had seen the original map of the east farm, and had compared the copy map in the register\u2019s office with the extracts he had made from such original map, and that they corresponded. He said he did not know what had become of the original map, and believed it was lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">He further testified that he was confident that the lot Ho. 1,155 was lot Ho. 1,155 on the original Bayard map, and said he saw the original map as far back as 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">There was undisputed evidence that the premises in dispute had been in possession of the defendants, or of those through whom they claimed, for more than twenty years. This was established by the evidence of Samuel Knapp, one of the plaintiffs, who testified, that the buildings on the defendants\u2019 lot, which it was claimed encroached upon the plaintiffs\u2019 property,, were' there in 1845, when the plaintiffs\u2019 ancestor bought, and are there now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court granted the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">The plaintiffs excepted, and appealed from the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-6\"><em>Mr. J. E. </em>Burrill, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-7\"><em>Mr. Geo. C. </em>Barrett, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-8\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgP\">It is understood that the complaint in this case was dismissed, on the ground of insufficiency of proof of the plaintiff\u2019s title to the disputed lands, and not on the ground that the, evidence had established an adverse possession in the defendants, and the,former was the only point argued on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The only evidence which went to establish title, was that of the witness Serrell, who testified to a survey made by himself, upon the basis of the Bayard \u2019East farm map. That survey shows an encroachment by the defendants upon the plaintiff\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">In both deeds, as well the defendant\u2019s as the plaintiff\u2019s, the lots are described by certain numbers upon the map of the lands of Nicholas Bayard, the plaintiff\u2019s lot being No. 1,156, and the defendant\u2019s No. 1,155, upon such map. And the lots then designated, are supposed to be of the diminsions of twenty-five feet wide and one hundred feet deep.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The accuracy of the survey made by Mr. Serrell depends upon whether the map now on file in the register\u2019s office, and designated as Map No. 386, is a correct j copy of the original East farm of the Bayard estate.! If it is, then the evidence and survey of Serrell made <em>\\ </em>out a <em>prima facie </em>case for the plaintiffs. '(</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">Mr. Serrell testified that he had surveyed the two lots upon the basis of the Map No. 386, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>true line between the lots of the plaintiffs and the defendants was shown upon the diagram of his survey, by the dark line drawn between the lots. And the present possession of the defendants also appearing upon such survey and diagram, and designated by the faint lines, it appears that such possession encroaches upon the plaintiff\u2019s lot to the extent claimed in the complaint, unless it can be accounted for by what Mr. Serrell calls \u201csurplus\u201d land.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The real difficulty, however, was in establishing that Map No. 386 was a copy of the Bayard East farm map. The evidence on that subject was very slight. Mr. Serrell, who was the only witness examined in regard to it, did not make it very clear. At first he said he had never seen the <em>original </em>map. Subsequently, upon being recalled, he said he thought he had seen the true East farm map, and that upon making a survey some twenty years since, he made extracts from it, which he had compared with the copy now on file, and that they corresponded. Afterwards he said, he would swear that he had seen an original map of the Bayard farm, as far back as the year 1845.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">He further testified that the copy Map No. 386, in the register\u2019s office, had for many years been the standard for surveys by city surveyors.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Upon all the testimony, if the jury had found that the lines indicated upon Mr. Serrell\u2019s diagram of his survey, were the correct line between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s lots, I do not think the court would have set it aside, as being unsupported by, or against the clear weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">We think, therefore, that there was enough to have carried the case to the jury, and to have put the defendants upon their defense..</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
