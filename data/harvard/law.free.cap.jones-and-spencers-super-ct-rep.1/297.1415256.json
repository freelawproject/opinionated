White &amp; Co., but the consideration mentioned became a debt due to that firm to be applied to the payment of debts due by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s rights, as copartner in the firm of George W. White <em>&amp; </em>Co., attached to that debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">The two instruments above referred to did not affect the debts due to that firm, nor the real estate belonging to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">As regards this real estate and these debts, including the one due for the purchase of the stock and fixtures, the partnership still continues for the purpose of liquidation, and each member of the firm has all the rights, privileges and remedies in respect thereto which the law accords to partners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">One of these remedies is, that if the partners cannot agree as to the mode of liquidation, or one of them becomes dissatisfied with the doings of the others, the court will, as a matter of course, appoint a receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">Has the plaintiff done any act which will deprive him of the remedies he would otherwise have <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-10\">It is claimed that the agreement entered into by him in relation to the collection of the debts due the firm has such an effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-11\">It is clear that by the agreement he does not part with his interest as a partner in those debts or in its real estate; therefore, if it interferes with rights which he would otherwise have, it must be on some ground other than that of his having parted with his interest therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-12\">It is then suggested as a proposition of law, that upon the dissolution of a solvent firm, the partners can make such arrangements for winding up the affairs of the concern as seem to them meet; and in the exercise of this right may select one or more of the mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>bers of the firm to wind up the partnership affairs, to call in the debts due, and convert into cash the assets belonging to the firm, to pay therewith the debts due by the firm, and distribute the surplus among its members, and if they do make such a selection, a court of equity will not interfere and appoint a receiver, unless the parties prove recreant to the trust reposed in them; and upon this proposition it is argued that whatever cause of complaint existed against those selected in this case arose from mere inattention, and have been, or are ready to be, removed, and therefore the receiver should not be continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">I think that the proposition of law is not strictly accurate. I am inclined to think that all the members of the firm are entitled to have a supervision over the acts of those selected, to receive all information from them respecting the collections made, to ask for and have imparted the reasons why collections are not pressed, and to have access to the books of the firm ; and if those selected deny this right or unreasonably interfere with its exercise, or, even, if the relations of the parties have so changed that the exercise of this right would reasonably be expected to be attended with unpleasantness and embarrasment, the court will appoint a receiver. It is unnecessary to determine whether this right of supervision attaches unless it is expressly reserved in the agreement, for in this case it is expressly reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">The litigation between these parties, already, shows that there has been a great change in the relations of thes\u00e9 parties. A feeling of great friendliness has changed into one of bitter enmity. Indeed this is asserted in the affidavits on both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">It would be unreasonable to anticipate that the plaintiff\u2019s right of supervision, &amp;c., could any longer be exercised without great unpleasantness and embarrasment, if indeed it could be exercised at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The fact that he has already been refused access to the books is a strong indication that such denial will continue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">For these reasons I think the receivership should be Continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">1 am aware that the complaint does not ask for a receiver on these grounds, and it could not well do so, for they did not exist at the time the action was commenced. I should not therefore continue the receiver were it not for the reasons I am now about to advert to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">At the time of the commencement of this action defendants had undeniably broke their agreement in two respects, viz: they had procured the extension of the time for the payment of a debt due Abernethy, o\u00ed about four thousand dollars, beyond July 1, 1870, giving the note of George W. White &amp; Co. on such extension, instead of applying sufficient of the sum of sixty-one thousand dollars agreed to be paid for the stock to that purpose; and they had not extinguished the debt of about' thirty-four thousand dollars due from George W. White <em>&amp; </em>Co. to Lester White-man <em>&amp; </em>Co., by applying thereto sufficient of said sum of sixty-one thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-8\">The non-compliance in these particulars afforded a sufficient ground for the appointment of a receiver. After the action was commenced and a receiver appointed, the defendants took up the notes of George W. White &amp; Co., which had been given to Abernethy, and substituted other paper, thereby relieving the firm of George W. White &amp; \"Co. from any liability for that \u25a0 debt; they also offered, on the argument of the motion to discharge the receiver, to give to George W. White &amp; Co. a discharge of the debt due Lester Whitman &amp; Co. Upon this action of theirs done since the commencement of this suit and the appointment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of the receiver, they ask that the receivership should not be continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">The appointment and continuance of a receiver <em>pendente </em>lite, rests in the sound legal discretion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">In the exercise of this discretion, I have no doubt that if since the commencement of the action, the causes for which the receiver was appointed have been obviated so as to place the parties in the same attitude with regard t\u00f3 each other, and to the subject of the action, as they occupied before, then the receiver should be withdrawn ; <em>per </em>contra, when a defendant by his acts has given rise to causes for the appointment of a receiver, and an action has been commenced, based on such causes, and a receiver appointed therein, and the effect of the commencement of such action and such appointment has been, either to give rise to other causes calling for a receiver, then such subsequent causes are to be regarded as the effects of the original causes, and unless the obviating of the original causes also destroys the effects of them, the party plaintiff should be entitled to retain the receivership. The defendant cannot be heard to say: \u201c True, I committed a wrong upon you which justified you in obtaining a receiver; and because you did obtain a receiver, I committed further violation of your rights which also justify a receiver; now I will, under your compulsion, remove the first wrongs, thereby throw you out of court, and compel you to bring another action for the appointment of a receiver, in consequence of the subsequent wrongs, which are the effect and result of the first ones.\u201d This will not be permitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">Although, if after the appointment of a receiver, the defendant removes the causes for which he was appointed, the court may discharge the receiver, yet it is not bound to do so, and will not do so if it is apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that these original canses have been productive of others which have not been, or cannot be removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">In this case, the breach of their agreement by the defendants, led to the institution of this action by the plaintiff for the protection of his rights; the suit thus incited by the acts of the defendants, together with other causes, has led to an exceedingly hostile feeling between the parties, and under its influence the defendants have further violated the rights of the plaintiff, by refusing him access to the books.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">A suggestion has been made, that the plaintiff has so far overdrawn his individual account, as that he not only has no interest in the surplus to be derived from the collection of the debts due to the firm and the sale of the real estate, but on the contrary, to be indebted to the firm. I have not deemed it necessary to decide how the facts may be, for even if such be the case, still he has an interest in having the agreement concerning the collection of the debts due to the firm, and the application of such collections to the payment of debts due by the firm, carried out according to its spirit and tenor, so that he may be relieved from his liability for the debts due by the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">A great portion of the papers used on the motion before me, consists of criminations and recriminations, concerning matters in relation to the sale of the stock of George W. White &amp; Co. to defendant, Whitman, and the dissolution of the firm of George W. White &amp; Co. ; but as neither side seeks to have that sale and dissolution rescinded, those matters, as far as they can have any bearing in this action, relate only to an accounting, and in the view above expressed, do not affect the question of a receivership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">It is proper to state, in conclusion, that there is nothing in the papers indicating in the slightest degree that the present firm of Colfax &amp; Overton is not perfectly solvent, and fully worthy of trust and credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The receiver is retained solely for the purpose of collecting the debts due to the firm of George W. White &amp; Co.; converting into money the-real estate belonging to that firm; applying the collections and money realized to the payment of the debts due by that firm, and distributiiig the surplus among the partners of that firm according to their respective rights. And this has become necessary.solely by reason of contentions and hostile feelings arising since Colfax <em>&amp; </em>Over-ton were selected by the firm of George W. White &amp; Co. to wind up its affairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">Motion to vacate the injunction and discharge the receiver denied ; but if the order of injunction and the order appointing the receiver do not conform with the above views, they must be modified in accordance therewith.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">From, the order denying the motion to vacate the order of receivership and injunction, and modifying the same, defendant appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-7\">Wm. <em>H. </em>Leonard, of counsel for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-8\"><em>John B. </em>Panner, attorney for respondents</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-9\"><em>G. A. C. </em>Barnett, counsel for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-10\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ami\">The order appealed from by the defendants contains such a modification of the injunction, and of the powers and duties of the receiver, that I think they ought to have rested satisfied ; and instead of subjecting themselves to the expense and delay of an appeal, should have at once gone into an accounting with the plaintiff, to the end, that his interest in the partnership assets might have been ascertained, and he relieved from liability for the partnership debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The debt due from Whitman was nearly sufficient to liquidate the partnership debts; and as that debt, by the terms of the agreement,, was to be paid, from time to time, as needed to meet the accruing liabilities of the firm, and all to be paid by July 1, 1870, it is evident that the parties expected to, and therefore did, fix upon that time as the limit, for the settlement of the partnership affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Yet, as late as the last of April, 1870, the defendants took this appeal from an order, which did not in any manner interrupt or interfere with the business in which they became engaged on the dissolution of the previous firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">But upon the merits. The receivership and injunction as an <em>ad interim </em>relief, to protect such rights and interests as the plaintiff has, under the articles of dissolution, were properly continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The plaintiff had been very careful to preserve to himself the right to require the whole assets of the firm to be applied to the payment of the firm debts. And although, by the sale, he parted with all legal title to the partnership property, he yet retained an equity, to enforce the covenants of the remaining partners, and compel them to pay, with such property, the firm\u2019s liabilities. And he had a further right, namely, to his proportion of any surplus there might be, after the liquidation of the debts. The principles applicable to this case, were fully examined in the case of <em>Cory v. </em>Long, decided by this court in June last, but not yet reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">When a retiring partner transfers the whole partnership property to the remaining partners, merely reserving to himself the equity I have alluded to, the court will be very jealous of his rights, and will not require a very strong case of breach of contract or other misconduct, to authorize it to interfere in his behalf. And it is but fair, that those who have the legal title and the exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>give custody of the means for paying the debts, should be held to a strict performance of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The incurring of a new obligation by indorsing the note to Abernethy &amp; Co. was a violation of the defendants\u2019 agreement, in two senses. First, it was not a payment of the firm debt, but merely an extension of the time of payment beyond the period fixed by the articles of dissolution. And second, and in a more important sense, as the first was afterwards removed, it was an unauthorized extension of payment to Whitman.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Another violation of the plaintiff \u2019 s rights was, in denying to him such access to the books, as, under the articles of dissolution, I think he was entitled to. His right to inspect the books of the firm, from time to time, is co-equal with that of the defendants\u2019, and when he became deprived of that right by the defendants, the court must help him.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">But there is another reason which, perhaps of itself, would be sufficient to authorize the court to take upon itself the adjustment of these partnership differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">As was very correctly said by the learned justice at special term, that from the embittered feeling existing among the parties, \u201c it would be unreasonable to anticipate, that the plaintiff\u2019s right of supervision, could any longer be exercised, without great unpleasantness and embarrassment, if, indeed, it could be done at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Under such a state of things, it is highly proper that the court, acting impartially between them, should, through its officers, wind up the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The right of the defendants, to the custody of the partnership property, was absolute so long only as they faithfully observed their agreement. When they failed in that particular, the right of the plaintiff was revived, and the court will do no more than to see that such right is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The reasons stated by the learned justice at the special term for his modification of the receivership and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>injunction are satisfactory to me, and, for these reasons, and suchas I have herein expressed, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs to abide the final adjustment of costs in the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
