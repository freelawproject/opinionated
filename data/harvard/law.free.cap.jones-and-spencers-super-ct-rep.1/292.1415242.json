On the trial of the case at bar, the plaintiff, being on cross-examination, was questioned in regard to new matter by defendant (and which was afterwards held to be merely collateral by the court) and made answer thereto.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-6\">Afterwards, the defendant called a witness to contradict the testimony and statements of the plaintiff, wherein defendant had made plaintiff his witness. On objection the court below held that the matter being merely collateral, plaintiff\u2019s testimony could not be impeached by such proofs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-7\">Held, that the first witness being \"a party to the action and the question propounded being of a character that allowed of an answer that might contain some admission or declaration of the defendant, that was pertinent and material to the issues, it was error in the court below to rule that the question should not be answered.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b305-8\">Before Monell, McCunn, and Freedman, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b305-9\"><em>Decided April </em>1, 1871.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-10\">The action was to recover first the snm of five hundred dollars, for extra work done and performed by the plaintiff for the defendants, and second, upon a special contract made by the defendants to pay the plaintiff one hundred dollars a week, during the time the work in the defendants\u2019 distillery was suspended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-11\">Bice was the only defendant served. He specifically denied the alleged partnership between himself and the other defendant Loeb, and he also generally denied all the allegations in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-12\">On the trial before Mr. Justice Spencer, and a jury, the plaintiff, who was examined as a witness on- his own behalf, testified upon his cross-examination as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Agl\">Q. From the time you left the distillery in Hovem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ber, when they ceased work, did you ask anybody for work <em>\\</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">A. I didn\u2019t ask anybody for work, because I was there, and I would stand where they promised me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">Q. Do you know the gentleman standing up there \u2014Weinfeldt?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-7\">A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-8\">Q. Did you ask him for work <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-9\">A. No, sir, never in my life (a person in the court room arises by request).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-10\">Q. Do you know this man <em>\\</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-11\">A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-12\">Q. Did you ever ask him for work during-that time <em>\\</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-13\">A. No, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-14\">Q. During all that time, you say, you did nothing at all from November until Mr. Briggs came <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-15\">A. I did not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-16\">Weinfeldt, when examined as a witness by the defendant, was asked the following question :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-17\">Q. During the time that distillery was not at work, do you remember whether Mr. Green called on you for any purpose ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-18\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the question was to collateral matter absolutely, and as collateral matter, the question having been asked the plaintiff, the defendants had made him their witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-19\">Defendant\u2019s counsel said, the question was also to affect the credibility of the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-20\">The court sustained the objection and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-21\">The plaintiff had a verdict, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-22\">The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-23\">A motion was made at special term for a new trial, on the ground of surprise and newly discovered evidence, and denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">The two appeals were heard together.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-7\">Mr. <em>O. L. Stewart, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-8\"><em>Mr. S. Hirsch, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b307-9\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-N\">The ground of the objection to the question put to the witness Weinfeldt, was, that it was to collateral matter, which had been elicited from the plaintiff, upon his cross-examination by the defendant, whereby the defendant had made the plaintiff his witness, and therefore, as must follow, although not so stated in the objection, could not impeach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">It is not necessary, perhaps, to define precisely what is meant by the statute which subjects the examination of a part) as a witness in his own behalf, <em>to the same rules of examination as any other witness. </em>In a general sense, the examination must be conducted as in other cases, and <em>it is possible, </em>that whenever the adverse party, by the nature of the cross-examination, has made the party examined his witness, as he would have done in the case of any other witness, the same rule applies, and the examined party cannot be impeached as to such testimony. So that if a party is interrogated and gives evidence on a cross-examination as to a merely collateral matter, he cannot <em>be impeached </em>by proof of declarations inconsistent with such evidence. So far, I think, the rules regulating the examination, are alike, and the learned justice regarding the matter which had been elicited upon the cross-examination of the plaintiff as collateral, and therefore, immaterial, would not allow any impeaching testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Had the witness not been a party to the action, I should have no difficulty in sustaining the decision. The . plaintiff had sued on a special contract, whereby he was to receive one hundred dollars a week, for all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>time the business of the distillery was suspended ; under such a contract he was not bound to <em>seelc </em>other employment, and any evidence that he did not seek other employment, was wholly immaterial, unless he succeeded, when the defendants might be entitled to a credit for the amount he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">But this was a case of a <em>party </em>under examination, * and the question propounded to the witness allowed of an answer containing an admission or declaration of a party to the action, and as such, it was clearly, I think, a proper question. It is always competent to prove the declarations of a party as to any thing pertinent to the issue ; and when a question put to a party calls by its answer for an admission, it is not to be affected by any of the rules relating to the impeachment of witnesses. It is impossible to say what would have been the answer to the question put to the witness in this case, but it is easy to see, that the answer to that and another question which might have followed it, if the first had been allowed to be answered, might have contained a material and important declaration of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">But without speculating upon what might have been the answer, it is enough that the question was proper, as proving or tending to prove a declaration of the party, the materiality of which could only be ascertained by the witness\u2019 answer, and upon the exception to the decision of the learned justice, we must hold it to have been erroneously excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">For this reason the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The motion for a new trial on the ground of surprise and newly discovered evidence, was properly disposed of at the special term. The evidence claimed to be newly discovered was cumulative, and the grounds of the alleged surprise not sufficient to authorize us to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>That order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b309-6\">Freedman, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Aix\">The question put to the witness Weinfeldt, was not only irrelevant to the issues framed by the pleadings, but so broad, that its exclusion did not, in my opinion, constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">If, as my learned brethren have conceded, the materiality of the evidence sought to be elicited could only be ascertained by the answer of the witness, it was the duty of defendant\u2019s counsel to apprise the court of what he intended to prove, and the precise ground upon which he claimed the evidence to be material, which he failed to do. An exception to the exclusion of a single question, so broad and general that its materiality could not be readily seen, and which was not followed up, should never be held error sufficient, <em>per se, to </em>work the reversal of a judgment, on appeal, unless it most clearly appears that the court below understood the ground upon which the question might have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
