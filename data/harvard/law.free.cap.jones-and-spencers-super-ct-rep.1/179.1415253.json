In that case, a demand and refusal must be proved, as evidence of a wrongful detention, but need not be averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">It is otherwise with the allegation of ownership, or, what is its equivalent, a right to the possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Ownership, or a right to the possession of the property claimed, must be averred, as well as proved. Such is the text of the elementary writers <em>(Grah. Pr. 2 </em>ed. 879 ; <em>2 Burr. Pr. 2 </em>ed. 13) ; and the books of precedents conform to the text writers. See, also, Prosser <em>v. </em>Woodward (21 <em>Wend. 205).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The <em>affidavit </em>which the Code requires, to obtain a delivery of personal property, must contain an averment that the plaintiff is the owner, or is lawfully entitled to the possession of the property. And it seems to me a complaint would be insufficient within a similar averment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">It was contended by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the allegation detains <em>from the plaintiff </em>\u201d was sufficient as a pleading, and would let in <em>proof </em>of ownership. It might, perhaps, be <em>implied </em>from such an' averment, that it was the plaintiff\u2019s property ; as otherwise it could not be <em>wrongfully, </em>detained from him. But facts so essential should not be left for implication; and it would form a bad precedent to allow such loose pleading to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The plaintiff could have brought another action, or perhaps have obtained leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The omission in it was fatal as it stood, and the judgment dismissing it- must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
