Such a policy by its terms prohibits the assured from traveling or residing in any part of the United States south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, between the first day of July and the first day of November, of any year during the life of the policy, and if assured violates its provision or prohibition, the penalty is that the policy ceases to be valid.,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b466-10\">At the time the assured made his application, and before the policy issued, the insurance company issued to the assured a stipulation * or permit as follows:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201c It is understood and agreed that said George B.

The application being formally completed about the 22nd day of October, 1863, said Waldron paid to defendants\u2019 agent in New York the sum of two hundred and seventy-nine dollars and seventy-five cents, and received a receipt, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-5\">Exhibit \u201c F\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">\u201cThe Royal Insurance Company of Liverpool, \u201cNew York Agency, 22d October, 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">t \u00ab j gt^ I \u2018 \u2018 Received from George Buckmaster Wald-|canceled, f r0I1) Esq., the sum of two hundred and seventy-nine xV-g- dollars, premium on a proposal of assurance for fifteen thousand dollars, on his own life, which is to be forwarded immediately to the head office at Liverpool, England, for acceptance.

At the time the receipt was made and delivered Waldron executed and left with Williams an assignment of the policy to George S. Rainsford, and which was afterwards, on the receipt of the policy, delivered with the foregoing receipt and permission to said G. S. Rainsford by Williams, as directed by Waldron. The policy was duly issued by defendants, delivered to and accepted by Williams, as the agent of Waldron, and, as before stated, delivered to Rainsford, of whose estate plaintiff is administratrix, about December 1863. Waldron sailed on October 24, 1863, and after his arrival he continued to reside there, until August 23, 1864, when he sailed for Mew York by the steamer Yazoo, arriving August 31, 1864. In the latter part of September or first of October, 1864, Waldron called upon the agent of the defendants at the office of the company in Mew York for the purpose of making the policy good, and was informed by the agent that the company considered the policy vitiated by his continued residence in the South, that' before the company should make it good they should require a new examination by its medical examiner, and a large extra premium, for his residence at the South during the summer months. About the same time a Mr. Speir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>called in behalf of the plaintiff upon the defendants, and offered to pay any extra premium if any there was on the policy, in order to keep it good. Defendants\u2019 agent informed him that the company considered the policy as vitiated by Mr. Waldron living south beyond the time allowed by the policy, and refused to do anything until Waldron had been examined, and declined to receive any premium on that ground. Afterwards, and in October, 1864, plaintiff tendered to the agent of .the defendants three hundred dollars, as and for any premium due on the policy. The tender was refused on the grounds of the policy being vitiated by the residence of Waldron south.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\">Waldron died at Stonington, Conn., February 18, 1865, from disease of the brain, which first showed its commencement November 1, 1864.

McDonald, Esq., Agent.\u201d After stating the terms of the assurance, there follows in the body of the policy a condition or provision that the policy and assurance shall be subject and liable to the several conditions, restrictions, and stipulations indorsed thereon in the same manner as if they were incorporated in the body of the policy. Then follows several conditions and provisions united in one paragraph, one of which, separated from the others, is as follows: \u201c Provided also that in case the said assured shall at any time or times depart beyond the limits of Europe, without the previous consent of the said company, from time to time duly signified by indorsement hereon, then this policy shall cease and be void to all intents and purposes whatsoever, and all premiums or moneys which shall have been paid in respect thereof shall be forfeited to the use of the said company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">The following memorandum is printed on the policy immediately after the signatures of the directors, and may be properly termed an indorsement on the policy, the date and signature of the agent being written in. said printed memorandum, all of which was indorsed upon said policy when the same was issued :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">\u201cMemorandum, 28th November, 1863 : It is hereby agreed that the life assured by this policy shall have permission to reside in any part of North America to the northward of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes of north latitude, but not to the westward of the Rocky Mountains, and likewise, from the first day of No vena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ber to the first day of July, to travel and reside in any place in the United States south of the above limits, but not to the westward of the Rocky Mountains ; also, to pass in decked vessels, in time of peace, from any one port of Europe to another, from any part of North America to another, within the above limits, and between any European port and any North American port within the said limits, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">\u201cBy order of the Committee,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">\u201c J. H. F. \u201c A. B. McDonald, Agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">The judge, before whom this case was tried, found for the defendants. One of his findings in the case was as follows: \u201c6th. That one of the terms and conditions of said\u2019 policy was and is, that the said Waldron should not travel or reside in any place in the United States south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, from July 1st to November 1st.\u201d To this finding no exception was taken as appears in the case, nor was there any taken to that part of the 10th finding, in which the judge found that Waldron resided south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes from July 1st to August 23rd, 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-8\">The judge also found that Waldron was told at the time of the negotation for the assurance, by Williams, his agent in the premises, that under the policy to be issued, he (the said Waldron) could not reside or travel south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, north latitude, between 1st July and 1st November without the permission of the company ; also, that the permission to go to New Orleans, dated October 22, 1863, was obtained by Williams at the request of Waldron, after the application for assurance had been made and the receipt of the same and the money paid as premium given ; also, that the residence in New Orleans, from July 1st to August 23rd, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>1864, was not under nor authorized by said permission; and to these latter findings exceptions were duly taken by plaintiff s attorneys.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-5\"><em>Weeks &amp; </em>Forster, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-6\"><em>Barlow, Larocque &amp; </em>Macfarland, attorneys, and <em>W.

That by its terms as compared with the agreement between the parties at the time and the contract as made by the issue and acceptance of the policy, this permission was not intended by the parties to be incorporated into the policy ; it was a temporary condition or permission made for the convenience and benefit of the assured, to enable him to travel, between October 22nd and November 1st, 1863, south of the line, that he and his agent and defendant\u2019s agent believed and assumed would be proscribed by the policy when it issued. The policy is dated of the 28th of November, 1863, and could not be affected by this permission, except by the literal terms of the same, which included no permission to reside at, but only u to proceed to New Orleans.\u201d No reasonable construction of this permission would extend it as a permission to reside south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, even if held to apply to the policy. Its utmost limit of construction would only permit the assured to proceed to New Orleans after its date, and return north of the proscribed line, <em>, </em>before July 1st of the next year. Therefore the conclusion of the learned justice, that the interpolation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the same in the policy conld not benefit the plaintiff, was correct; and his refusal to reform the policy so as to include it forms no basis for the reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">After a full consideration of all the exceptions of the plaintiff to the rulings of the court below, I find nothing in the caise to justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Upon the argument of this appeal the question was raised by the learned chief justice, \u201cWhether the policy itself, in its several terms and conditions, contained any prohibition against the assured residing south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude at any portion of the year. The question appeared to be one that had not been considered nor acted upon by either party prior to the argument. I think this is the only serious question in the case, and the only one I propose to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">From a full review of the case, I conclude no such question arose before the judgeupon the trial. N\"o one suggested any doubt as to the effect of the agreement or contract of assurance as contained in the policy. Plaintiff sought to overcome an assumed prohibition, by proof of this consent or permission, and of the terms of assurance made between the parties prior to the issue of the policy, and sought a reformation of the policy so as to conform the same to the conditions of the application. The judge, in his findings, states this prohibition as existing in the policy, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney finds no fault with nor takes exception to the same. So much for the views and actions of the parties, and of the court below. I consider this policy as a very imperfect instrument, so far as expressing clearly the prohibition claimed, and which seems to have been understood by the parties-.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The defendants appear to be an English company, doing business at Liverpool, but their policy is dated and apparently issued at New York, and assures the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>life of a citizen of New York who pays the premium or consideration of assurance to their New York agent. It contains a condition in the body of the policy, that if the assured, departs beyond the limits of Europe, without the consent of the' company indorsed on the policy, that the policy shall cease and be void. If there were no terms nor conditions subsequently expressed, that changed or affected this condition, I should hold that the policy was void on its face, because of the contradiction of its terms or the impossibility of the same being fulfilled by the assured, or reconciled with the status of the parties at the time of its execution. But the wisdom of the directors, of counsel of defendants, have sought a remedy for these things, and have caused a memorandum to be indorsed on the policy which allows the assured to reside and travel beyond the limits of Europe, and to travel and reside in any place in the United States south of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, from November 1st to July 1st. If the prohibition contained in the body of the policy and the exception or conditions in the memorandum are to be read and construed together, then the policy contains the desired prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">I-am satisfied, if the policy alone was before us, that we should have great doubt as to the intention of the parties in regard to any prohibition being contained in the policy itself; yet I think it is one of those contracts where the meaning of the words or terms used are of that doubtful or unintelligible character, that parol testimony should be admitted to explain the same. With the whole evidence in this case before us, especially this written permission, I am satisfied that a just and reasonable construction of this contract would cause the condition in the body of the policy, and in the memorandum indorsed thereon, to be read and construed together, and that the prohibition assumed and understood by both parties exists, and has force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>thereby. I hold, therefore, that this policy is to be considered in this review on appeal, as if the condition in the body of the policy read as follows: \u201c Provided also that <em>in case' the said assured shall at any time depart beyond the limits of Europe, excepting in traveling or residing in any part of the United States to the northward of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north </em>latitude, <em>and in any pari south of that line be-the first day of November and the first day of July, then and in such case this policy shall cease and be void,\u201d &amp;c. </em>This construction of the policy admits the prohibition, and therefore, the residence of the assured in the South, during the year 1864, against the terms thereof, released the defendants from the conditions of assurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">I conclude,this judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
