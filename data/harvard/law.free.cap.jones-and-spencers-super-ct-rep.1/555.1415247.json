The second transaction as to the substitution of the Hicks Engine Company notes being vitiated by fraud, the order is sustainable on the first fraud (Murphy v. Fernandez, 11 <em>Bosw. </em>665).</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-6\">II. The three affidavits, on which the order of arrest was granted, fully conform to the practice laid down in a recent opinion in Smith <em>v. </em>Jones (4 <em>Robt. </em>656). It appears therein : 1. That goods were sold and credits given to the defendant; that the indebtedness is unpaid, and plaintiff is owner of demand. 3. That the credits were given at defendant\u2019s request. 3. That the defendant represented himself as \u201cnot only solvent but wealthy,\u201d and worth'\u201c over two hundred thousand dollars over and above his obligations.\u201d 4. Plaintiff\u2019s belief and reliance upon the representations. 5. The falsity of defendant\u2019s representations as to his own solvency, by these facts : (1.).During eight months he was unable to meet a note for five thousand five hundred and fifty-five dollars, one-fortieth part only of his pretended resources. (3.) On the settlement, July, 1867, only eight months from the time of the represenations, he is unable to pay sixteen thousand dollars, or any part of his indebtedness, but attempts to pay them with notes of the company. (3.) By fraud he induces plaintiff to accept those worthless notes of the company, thus fraudulently procuring an extension of time on his own indebtedness. (4.) He admits after^ wards that at the time of the representations as to his own condition, he had no property other than what was in his wife\u2019s name. 6. The falsity of Duncan\u2019s representations as to the solvency of the company in July, 1867. Duncan had himself, as president of company, confessed judgment for over ten thousand dollars in favor of company\u2019s creditors, and for twelve thousand dollars at about the same time ; and execution had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>issued thereon ; the company a few weeks afterwards was declared bankrupt; see affidavit of Sharp, vice-president of company. It distinctly appears by the whole testimony that the Budd &amp; Sharp indebtedness was in reality credit given to the defendant himself, and at his request. 2. The defendant did represent himself as wealthy and solvent in the first transaction. This is partly admitted by defendant; but the real character of the representations and their utter falsity is fully proven by plaintiff\u2019s and Sharp\u2019s affidavits and defendant\u2019s schedules in bankruptcy. It appears that defendant represented himself as owning certain parcels of real estate and other property; his owni rship, in the absence of proof of alienation, will be presumed to have continued (Flanders <em>v. </em>Merritt, 3 <em>Barb. </em>201. The ownership of a newspaper was presumed for two years (Fry <em>v. </em>Bennett, 28 N. <em>Y. </em>330). 3. Defendant does not deny the falsity of the representations as to the condition of' the Hicks Engine Company, at the time of the second transaction, but tries to throw the whole responsibility for the representations upon Mr. Sharp. It is fully proved that defendant knew of all the affairs of the company, that the second fraud was deliberate and intentional\u2014a well contrived scheme. 4. That on the exchange of the notes, defendant did represent the company as good and solvent. 5. The defendant stands entirely impeached as a witness, by the facts sworn to in the affidavits of Galway, Sharp, Marsh and Davis, all disinterested witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-5\">III. The court had no power on the motion of the defendant alone to exonerate the bail, or to discharge them from liability, until the final determination of the litigation, in which their principal must be successful <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 191 ; Von Gerarde <em>v. </em>Lighte, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>103 : Bank of Geneva <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 12 <em>Id. </em>81, note). A judgment alone is the final determination of the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the parties (Mott <em>v. </em>Union Bank of the City of New York, 38 <em>N. Y. </em>18.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-5\">\u2022<em>Thomas L. Snead, </em>attorney for respondent, and <em>Roger A. Pryor, </em>of counsel,\u2014urged :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">I. It is the obvious policy of the legislature to mitigate the harshness of the remedy by arrest <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 186, Amendment' 1870). Such, also, is the disposition of the courts. Hence an order of arrest is not a matter of absolute right, but is subject to the discretion of the court (Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Ecclesine, 6 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>9), and so far within the discretion of the judge that his decision is not appealable (National Bank of the Commonwealth v. Temple, 39 <em>How. </em>432). Hence, too, the duty of the courts to resist applications for provisional remedies (Skiff <em>v. </em>Stewart, 39 <em>Mow. </em>385).</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-7\">II. In determining this appeal, it is essential to distinguish the specific cause of action (National Bank of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Temple, 39 <em>How. </em>432 ; <em>Code of Procedure, </em>\u00a7 179 ; Townsend <em>v. </em>Herricks, 39 <em>How. </em>477).</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-8\">III. (1.) The summons and complaint disclose clearly the character of the action. The summons is in the form prescribed by sub. 1, section 129, of the Code. If the complaint were ambiguous, the summons would discriminate the nature of the action (Chambers <em>v. </em>Lewis, 10 <em>Abb. </em>207). But in fact, the complaint conforms to the summons, and exhibits an action for money demand on contract. (2.) If this were an action of d\u00e9ceit, or for fraud, the summons would be for <em>relief; </em>the specific cause of complaint would be the alleged fraud, and the prayer would be for unliquidated damages. The action would belong to the class <em>ex delicto. </em>But here the summons is for \u201c money demand. on contract.\u201d The gist of the complaint is the <em>indebtedness </em>of the defendant for goods, wares and mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>chandise, and for money paid, laid out and expended; and the recovery claimed is a snm certain alleged to be due, as a balance on an accounting. Plainly, this action is not in <em>tort, </em>is not to recover damages for fraud, but is <em>assumpsit </em>for a definite amount. (3.) While the complaint purports to set out all the facts of the case, it is evident enough that the specific ground of action is the original indebtedness of the defendants for money advanced and goods sold and delivered. The action is not founded on the securities given by the Hicks Steam Engine Company ; else the Hicks Steam Engine Company, and not Blanton Duncan, would be the defendant. The facts of the substitution of the company paper for the individual notes of the defendant are stated in anticipation, to obviate a plea of the surrender and cancellation of the defendant\u2019s notes, by showing such surrender and cancellation to be void by reason of fraud. The object and office of this part of the complaint is to re-establish the original indebtedness of the defendant, and to leave that indebtedness unimpaired and operative as a ground of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">IV. This being an action upon contract to recover sixteen thousand and twenty-two dollars and forty-seven cents, alleged to be due for goods sold and delivered, and money paid, laid out and expended, the inquiry, and the only inquiry, is, was the defendant \u201cguilty of fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the obligation \u201d which is the foundation df the action ? \u00a1N o independent or incidental fraud of the defendant\u2014 no fraud which was not present and operative in contracting the debt for which the action is brought, is available to support the order of arrest. The language of the Code is explicit to this effect (Sec. 179, subd. 4). So are the decisions. In Wallace <em>v. </em>Murphy, 22 <em>How. </em>416, Ch. J. Robinson said: \u201c The statute intends that any fraud <em>committed in making the contract </em>shall subject the offender to arrest.\u201d In Oatley <em>v. </em>Lewin, 47</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Barb. </em>21, the supreme court, at general term, vacated an order of arrest, on the specific objection that, although the defendant was guilty of a fraudulent representation, <em>yet the representation had no connection with the obligation upon which the action was brought </em>(Merchants\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Dwight, 13 <em>How. </em>366 ; Alliance Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Cleveland, 14 <em>How. </em>405).</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-5\">V. Conceding for argument, that defendant\u2019s representation as to the solvency of the Hicks Company was false and fraudulent; still, as that representation was subsequent to the contracting the debt for which plaintiff sues, and was made with the view, not of incurring an obligation by the defendant, but of imposing an obligation on the Hicks Company, which obligation plaintiff repudiates, and stands on the original indebtedness of defendant\u2014this representation being subsequent to and wholly apart from the contracting the debt in litigation, is not available to support the order of arrest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">YI. The only fraud appropriate and effectual to support the arrest is defendant\u2019s alleged false and fraudulent representation as to his solvency and sufficiency. 1. To constitute a false representation, available either as a cause of action or of arrest, these three circumstances must concur and characterize the representation : 1st. It must be false (Stewart v. Patten, 37 <em>How. </em>68). 2nd. It must be fraudulent, i <em>e., </em>known to be false (Taylor v. Scoville, 54 <em>Barb. </em>37 ; Marsh <em>v. </em>Falker, 40 <em>N. Y. </em>562; Kelsey <em>v. </em>Oil Company, 54 <em>Barb. </em>112). Indeed in some cases it is held that an actual intent to defraud must be fixed on the defendant (Claflin <em>v. </em>Frank, 8 <em>Abb. </em>412; Birchell <em>v. </em>Strauss, 28 <em>Barb. </em>293). By all authorities, if the defendant believe the representation to be true, be it ever so false in fact, he is not guilty of fraud nor liable to arrest (Gafney <em>v. </em>Burton, 12 <em>How. </em>516 ; Birchell <em>v. </em>Strauss, <em>supra; </em>Claflin v. Frank, <em>supra; </em>Stewart <em>v. </em>Patten, <em>supra; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Marshall <em>v. </em>Gray, 39 <em>How. 172). </em>3rd. The fraudulent-representation must be productive of damage to the plaintiff. Here, as in every other occasion of legal intervention, there must be the <em>damnum </em>as well as the <em>injuria </em>(Taylor <em>v. </em>Scoville ; Marsh <em>v. </em>Falker ; Kelsey <em>v. </em>Oil Company, <em>supra). </em>In Taylor <em>v. </em>Scoville the court ruled that though the defendant misrepresent his ability, either by general exaggeration or by a claim of specific property not his own, yet, if he have means sufficient to discharge the debt fraudulently contracted, he does the plaintiff no damage, and is not guilty of legal fraud. <em>2. </em>Admitting defendant represented his ability as imputed, it is evident, first, that the representation was true ; second, that, if not true, defendant believed it to be true ; third, that if not as rich as he pretended, defendant had ample property to pay the debt for which this action is brought, and which he is charged to have fraudulently contracted. 1st. Plaintiff says, defendant represented himself to be worth two hundred thousand dollars. Was he not worth that <em>amount\u00cd (a.) </em>Plaintiff concedes in his complaint that of an aggregate indebtedness of sixty thousand dollars incurred by defendant he paid forty-four thousand dollars. (5.) Duncan swears that he contributed fifty thousand dollars to the Hicks Steam Engine Company, and his testimony is corroborated by the affidavits of Bayard and Whitely. (c.)' Bullitt, Thompson, and Duncan swear that defendant\u2019s property, then under seizure by the government, was of the value, at least, of one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars. Here is an aggregate of two hundred thousand dollars available to defendant. But he had other property. His property in Louisville alone was worth one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars at the lowest figure, whereas the debt he is charged to have contracted by a fraudulent exaggeration of his sufficiency, is only sixteen thousand dollars. Under the rule propounded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Taylor v. Scoville, here is plainly no damage to the plaintiff. We say the representation, even as imputed by the plaintiff, is literally trae, and there is nothing whatever in the plaintiffs affidavits to impeach its accuracy. 2nd. Whether the representation was true-or not, defendant believed it, and that was sufficient to avoid the arrest. Defendant had means in hand to pay, and did pay plaintiff and the Hicks Company ninety-four thousand dollars. He had property locked up by the confiscation acts to the amount of one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars. Thompson and Bullitt swear defendant always believed he would recover this property, and they advised he would recover it. In point of fact, he did recover it, and by the decision of the court it was adjudicated that the property was his, notwithstanding the seizure\u2014was his at the time of the representation. When he made the representation and contracted the debt, defendant had been pardoned by the president ; had been advised by the attorney general that the pardon operated a restoration of his property ; himself believed he would recover his property ; and in fact did recover it. That defendant did not conceal his difficulties and the embarrassments o\u00ed his property, is disclosed by plaintiff\u2019s letter of 6th July, 1867. 3. What if -defendant did misrepresent his ability <em>% </em>For the truth of the representation, he referred plaintiff to \u201csome of the first banking houses in the city.\u201d This reference plainly shows defendant\u2019s good faith. If plaintiff had made the inquiries suggested by defendant, he would have got the truth. He could not willfully neglect the opportunity of information put within his reach, and then pretend he had been deceived. It is a familiar rule that the means of knowledge is equivalent to knowledge. It was plaintiff\u2019s own fault and folly to rely on defendant\u2019s unsupported statements when he had the means of verifying or discrediting them. 4. Wherefore, it appearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the representation of the defendant, by which the debt in suit was contracted, was true literally and to its full extent; or, if not true literally and to its full extent, was true to this extent, that the defendant owned property equivalent many times over to the debt contracted ; or, if not true at all, the defendant believed it to be true, nay, had reason so to believe ; or, if not true at all nor believed by defendant, it was plaintiff\u2019s own wrong to rely upon it\u2014the order of arrest was properly set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">VII. It has been already shown that the alleged fraud of defendant in procuring the surrender of his notes, and the substitution of the Hicks Company securities, is irrelevant and unavailable to sustain the order of arrest. But, was defendant guilty of fraud in procuring this substitution <em>\\ </em>The plaintiff so swears ; but, 1st. It is apparent, by the plaintiff\u2019s own letter,. that he himself solicited the substitution of the Hicks Company securities, and that they were not imposed upon him by the fraud of the defendant. Plaintiff not only solicited the substitution, but gave a reason for the substitution which excludes any inference of fraud on the part of the defendant.. 2nd. Even if defendant was guilty of a false representation as to the solvency of the Hicks Company, the plaintiff sustained no damage; and so the representation was immaterial. The only effect of the representation\u2014in truth it had no effect at all, since the substitution was the consequence of the plaintiffs own solicitation\u2014the only effect, if any, of the representation was, the substitution of the Hicks Company securities for defendant\u2019s individual notes. But, plaintiff says defendant was at that time insolvent; how then was plaintiff harmed <em>% </em>3rd. It is abundantly evident that the Hicks Company was not then insolvent. In any event defendant believed it to be solvent. Sharp told him it was solvent, and defendant\u2019s faith was so strong, that he invested fifty thousand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>dollars in the company. 4th. The plaintiff presents no evidence whatever of the insolvency of the Hicks Company ; bnt on the contrary, his own chief witness swore the company was not only solvent, but prosperous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">VIII. The alleged confession of defendant, \u201cthat he had no property other than what was held in his wife\u2019s name,\u201d is not at all inconsistent with his statement of his circumstances. The admission rather implies that defendant was the owner of property; and as <em>cestui que trust </em>he might be worth two hundred thousand dollars, or a.ny other amount. And mark; this is the only evidence in the case of the untruth of defendant's representation. The statements of the-plaintiff in his rebutting affidavit are irrelevant and immaterial, because, 1st. These statements are all hearsay and pretend to give the substance of an official record in the affiant\u2019s possession. 2nd. They purport to give the financial condition of defendant, not at the time of the representation, but more than two years afterward. 3rd. If plaintiff failed to show good ground of arrest in the first instance, he cannot repair the omission by supplementary affidavits. Defendant explicitly denies the admission ; and, in the absence of corroborative evidence, the plaintiff fails to exhibit that preponderance of proof essential to the support of an arrest (Mulrey <em>v. </em>Evelett, 3 <em>Robt. </em>716 ; Smith <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 <em>Robt. </em>656 ; Draper <em>v. </em>Beers, 17 <em>Abb. </em>163).</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">IX. Fraud is never presumed, but must be established by affirmative prove\u2014\u201c by proof \u2018 strong and direct\u201d Nichols <em>v. </em>Pinner, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>300). Now. in view of the whole transaction, it is perfectly apparent, that Colonel Duncan\u2019s conduct throughout, was characterized by an unreserved and ingenuous candor. 1st. On his introduction to the plaintiff, he said, in effect, \u201cDon\u2019t rely on my representation, but inquire of the gentlemen I name, who are among the first bankers of the city.\u201d 2nd. He frankly disclosed his difficulties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the plaintiff, in so far as to engage his sympathies. 3rd. On discovering the embarrassments of the Hicks Company, he promptly communicated with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\"><em>X. </em>We submit, that on the uncontradicted facts of the case, the order vacating the arrest was right and proper, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b589-6\">By the Court.\u2014Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">Under the present exceedingly liberal rule of construction of pleadings, this action, to speak in the former technical language of the law, might be regarded either as an action in assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, or an action on the case for deceit arising out of fraud in procuring credit for the price of the goods, or an action on the case for deceit in falsely representing the credit of the Hicks Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The principles which govern this court (Lorillard Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Meshural, 7 <em>Robt. </em>308), in disposing of motions to vacate orders of arrest where the facts on which the order issued are those which constitute the cause of action, are different from those which obtain, when the order is granted on facts which are extrinsic to those constituting the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In the first class of cases, as the controverted facts \u2022 must necessarily be passed on by the jury, and as on a judgment entered on a verdict for the plaintiff, he would, as matter of course, be entitled to an execution against the body, if an' execution against the property should be returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the court will not on motion infringe on the province of the jury, and render a decision on the facts which may possibly affect the jury in their deliberations, and which, if they should arrive at a conclusion different from the court, would deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the security taken on the arrest. In this case, therefore, the court will not vacate on motion, unless on conceded facts the law is against the plaintiff, or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>proof is of such nature as, if it were adduced on the trial, the court would be obliged to either nonsuit or direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In the other class of cases, as the disputed facts cannot be submitted to the jury, the court is necessarily called upon to pass on them on the motion, and to make up its determination on those principles which appertain to the decision of questions of fact on a trial thereof by jury, or referee or the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">It becomes necessary then, on motions of this character, to determine to which class the action belongs. If, in arriving at the determination, any doubt arises, the leaning of the court should be in favor of personal liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">If then the plaintiff inserts in his complaint such allegations as to render it uncertain to which class the action belongs, and as to whether the jury will be called on to pass upon the matters authorizing an arrest, the court, on a motion to vacate an order of arrest, will construe the pleading to contain a cause of action founded solely on matters which do not authorize an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">In this view the present action must, on this motion, be considered as an action in assumpsit for goods sold and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Therefore the averments of the representations on which the plaintiffs were induced to sell the goods on credit, are to be regarded as surplusage, and not issuable ; while the averments of those representations on which the plaintiff, as alleged, was induced to substitute the company in the place of the defendant as their creditor, must be deemed as inserted to avoid an anticipated defense, and not as forming any part of the cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Regarding this, then, for the purpose of this motion, as a simple action for goods sold and delivered, it devolved on the court to pass on the question as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>whether there was fraud in obtaining the goods, &amp;c., on credit or not, on the merits; and in passing on that, the principles which obtain in the above mentioned second class of cases are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The only direct proof on the subject of the representations made at the time of the opening the account, is that furnished by the parties themselves\u2014the plaintiff on the one side and the defendant on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The plaintiff first swears in effect that defendant represented that he had two hundred thousand dollars, over and above all his obligations; and then, after reading defendant\u2019s affidavit, admits that defendant did state that some of his property was confiscated, but swears that defendant stated that he had two hundred thousand dollars of available means without reference to the confiscated property. 0</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Defendant, on the other hand, swears that the only representation that he made was that he was solvent, that he would have a large amount of available means as soon the government should restore his property, that he bad been pardoned, and had been informed by the attorney-general and others that the effect of said pardon would be the immediate restoration of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">This first question is, which is correct in his version of the conversation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The affirmative rests on the plaintiff to maintain, by preponderating evidence, his allegation of fraudulent representation. Unless he derives from the other evidence, facts and circumstances appearing on the motion, more support than the defendant, he must fail on this point, for in that event the proof would be either balanced or the preponderance would be in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">All the affidavits (including those relating solely to the representations alleged to have been made in re-respect to the company) have been carefully scrutinized to ascertain whether anything therein contained lends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>more support to the plaintiff than to defendant, and the conclusion arrived at is that there is-not.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">But there .are some matters -which render it more probable that the defendant is correct, and the plaintiff wrong. About three months before the representation he wrote to plaintiff\u2019s witness a business letter from London, in which he gave a specific enumeration of what his property will consist of, as well as his estimated value of it upon a pardon being granted. This letter was shown to plaintiff. Again: Budd (Sharp\u2019s partner) testified that in all defendant\u2019s dealings with that firm he found defendant straightforward and manly, which evidence is corroborated by the above letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">It is not probable that a man of such a character, should, in the short space of three months, make to a person to whom Sharpe introduced him, and with whom he knew Sharpe had business transactions, representations for the purpose of advancing the very business in reference to which said letter was written (and in reference to which it was -shown to plaintiff), other than such as were consistent with that letter; but it is probable that under such circumstances his representations would be consistent with the facts in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Again: in a conversation had with Sharpe a short time after the alleged representation, he stated to him that he told plaintiff he had ample means to carry on the business. This evidence was introduced by the plaintiff ; its effect is, while it does not impugn defendant\u2019s version as to the rest of the conversation had with plaintiff, to justify to some extent his statement that no amount was mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">It would seem that the plaintiff\u2019s version is rather the result of his reasoning upon his recollection of the contents of the letter, and the statements of the defendant, than a statement of the substance of the conversation. His recollection of the letter was that it showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>defendant to be worth over two hundred thousand dollars, if a pardon was granted, and coupling that with the statement that a pardon had been obtained, and that its effect would be an immediate restoration of the property, his mind instantly reached the conclusion that the defendant was then worth, in immediately available means, over two hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The result thus reached was more firmly fixed in his mind than the conversation itself, and it is not surprising, that after the lapse of one year and nine months, he should give the result thus arrived atas the substance of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The statement in his subsequent' affidavit can have, under the circumstances, but little weight attached to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The next question is, whether the representation testified to by defendant is substantially true.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">He had at that time property to the</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">amount of...................... $50,000 and over</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">since paid into the Hicks Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Real estate to the amount of....... 100,000 and over</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">then under confiscation. ' .\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Accrued rents under confiscation, say 8,000</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">Other property, as shown8 by bankruptcy proceedings, valued at.... 22,000</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">$180,000</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">By the bankruptcy proceedings it appears that on December 7, 1868, the defendant, besides the indebtedness to plaintiff, was only in-</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">debted to his father in.......... $12,000</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">James Hoy, in.................... 500</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">But it nowhere appears that this indebtedness existed at the time of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-20\">It also appears that he had at that time his pardon, and had been advised that the effect thereof was to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>mediately restore his property, which advice was subsequently confirmed by the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">It is suggested that in the bankruptcy proceeding no mention is made of any real estate as belonging to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">This may be accounted for by the fact that at time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the decision of the district court holding that the pardon of the president did not restore the property, was in full force and unreversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The facts in this case indicate pretty clearly that defendant\u2019s financial embarrassments and inability to successfully carry on the business of the company (in which event this suit would not, in all probability, have been instituted), arose out of the refusal by the authorities to restore his property, and the adverse decision of the district court, all of which was contrary to the confident expectation and belief of the defendant, and to the legal advice given him, and, indeed, contrary to the law and his just rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Such refusal and adverse decision must, of necessity, have seriously interfered with his command of money, or realizing on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The decision vacating the order of arrest was correct. The exoneration of the bail follows, of course, from the vacating the order of arrest, subject to be revived if the vacatur be reversed..</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">The order below should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">THE END.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
