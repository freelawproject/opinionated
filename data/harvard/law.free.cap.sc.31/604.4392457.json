The undertaking was filed, but no answer or amended answer was served. Eight months afterwards plaintiff served on defendant\u2019s attorney a reply to the counter-claim contained in the answer of defendant, attached to the motion papers. This reply was promptly returned as not served in time. The Circuit Judge (Fraser) ruled that the reply was not served in time, and therefore that the counter-claim was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">On appeal by plaintiff, Mr. Justice McGowan held that the-answer as served with the motion papers having been ordered to stand as defendant\u2019s answer, no further service was required, and therefore the ruling of Judge Fraser was correct. Mr. Ci-iiee Justice Simpson concurred in the result. Mr. Justice Mc-Iver dissented from the view taken in the opinion, and thought the answer should have been served, but concurred in the result upon the ground \u201cthat the judgment now appealed from has already been affirmed by this court under a previous appeal, in which the question now presented might have been made.\u201d See <em>Sanders </em>v. Sanders, 30 S. C., 207. Judgment affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
