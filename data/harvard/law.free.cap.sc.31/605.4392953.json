An oral demurrer was interposed at the hearing, that the facts stated did not constitute a cause of action. The Circuit Judge (Norton) overruled this demurrer, and defendant appealed. <em>Held, </em>that the demurrer was well taken, as the statement of indebtedness was a mere conclusion of law, and that no breach of the bond, either in a failure to make the returns or in the nonpayment of the royalty, was alleged in the complaint. Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
