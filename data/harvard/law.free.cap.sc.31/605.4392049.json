The testimony was taken by a referee, upon which the Circuit Judge (Hudson) dismissed the complaint. Upon appeal by plaintiffs, raising only questions of fact, the Circuit decree was affirmed, this court saying : \u201cThe questions raised by this appeal being solely questions of fact, under the well settled rule, it is incumbent on the appellants to show that the conclusions reached by the Circuit Judge are without any testimony to support them, or are contrary to the manifest weight of the testimony. This the appellants have wholly failed to do; and, on the contrary, the conclusions reached below are, in our judgment, well sustained by the evidence. * * * It is quite certain that the testimony is conflicting as to the material facts upon which appellants\u2019 case rests; and when that is the case, this court rarely, if ever, feels warranted in disturbing the conclusions reached by the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
