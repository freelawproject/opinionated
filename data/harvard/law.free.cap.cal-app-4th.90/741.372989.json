The information was amended on December 30, 1999, to allege that Mario had a prior felony conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)(1). Appellants pled not guilty to all counts and Mario denied the enhancement allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Trial began on January 3, 2000, and the jury returned its verdicts on February 2, 2000. Mario was found guilty of the first degree burglary charged in count 1, the felonious assault count, and the two counts of misdemeanor vandalism. Tyrone was found guilty of the first degree burglary charged in count 1 and the misdemeanor vandalism charged in count 7. Mario waived jury trial on the enhancement allegations and, on February 8, 2000, the trial court found not true all special allegations against Mario, except for one prior prison term enhancement allegation under section 667.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">On March 6, 2000, Mario was sentenced to state prison for a total term of seven years on account of the felonies, plus a consecutive year for the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>prison term enhancement, and an additional 150 days in county jail on account of the misdemeanors. On March 15, 2000, the trial court sentenced Tyrone to a term of six years in state prison, suspended, with a grant of probation for a period of five years on the condition that he serve one year in the county jail, on account of the felony, and an additional 30 days on account of the misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Appellants filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>The People\u2019s Case.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>4</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Sometime in September of 1999, appellants and Willis (Trey) Allcut brought three large trash bags full of marijuana to the home of Trey\u2019s girlfriend, Libby Brown, where they hung it to dry. On the morning of September 24, 1999, Trey instructed Libby\u2019s roommate, Cassidy Hess, to call appellants and tell them that the drug task force had seized the marijuana in a raid and that Libby had been arrested. Trey and Libby then took the marijuana to someone else\u2019s house, without informing appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">As instructed by Trey, Cassidy called Tyrone and told him the fabrication regarding the police raid on Libby\u2019s house. About 20 minutes later, Tyrone came to the house with his girlfriend, Jennifer, who informed Cassidy that they did not believe her story. Tyrone and Jennifer left after about 10 minutes and, approximately 15- minutes later, Mario arrived at the house, which he proceeded to ransack in search of the marijuana. While there, Mario had an angry telephone conversation with Trey regarding the whereabouts of the marijuana. After Mario left the house, Cassidy went to a neighbor\u2019s house, where she made arrangements for Libby to pick up her and her children. Libby and Cassidy then proceeded to the Discovery Inn where they rented a motel room. Two of Cassidy\u2019s friends came to the motel room\u2014one borrowed her car and the other drove Cassidy and her children to another town. When Cassidy eventually recovered her car, two of its tires had been \u201cpopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Later, Libby\u2019s friend, Stephanie Roberts, came to the motel room and offered to let Libby stay at her apartment. The two drove each other\u2019s cars to Stephanie\u2019s apartment and parked them in the lot adjacent thereto. About an hour after arriving at Stephanie\u2019s apartment, Stephanie heard voices outside the apartment and heard someone say, \u201cOpen the door bitch.\u201d Appellants then entered the apartment through the front door, which was unlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>When appellants entered the apartment, one of them took some keys off a hook in the living room and Mario tore some pages out of Stephanie\u2019s day planner. Mario then proceeded to the bathroom and asked Libby where Trey was. When Libby denied knowledge of Trey\u2019s whereabouts, Mario shoved Libby against the wall and threatened to restrain her with duct tape, which he had in his possession. Tyrone, who was carrying a piece of metal resembling a tire iron, blocked Stephanie from proceeding toward the bathroom. When Mario came out of the bathroom with Libby, Stephanie attempted to calm him down, but he grabbed her, threw her against the wall and threatened to throw her out the window. Stephanie then offered to help appellants locate Trey.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">When Trey did not return their attempts to page him, appellants ordered Stephanie and Libby to leave with them in Stephanie\u2019s car. As the group walked by Libby\u2019s car, Mario told Libby to look at her tires. Stephanie remembered one of the appellants saying to Libby, \u201c[Y]our tires don\u2019t look so good.\u201d When Libby asked what had happened to the tires, appellants just laughed. The group then left in Stephanie\u2019s car, with Stephanie driving to various places directed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">One of the group\u2019s first stops was at a house where a woman named Tia lived. Once there, appellants hid behind Stephanie\u2019s car and directed Libby to determine whether Trey was in the house. While waiting for Libby to return, Stephanie saw Mario kneel down beside Cassidy\u2019s car, which was parked out front. Mario later said that he had slashed Cassidy\u2019s tires. Although Trey was present in Tia\u2019s house, Tia\u2019s husband and Libby both told appellants that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Appellants, Libby, and Stephanie subsequently proceeded to an apartment occupied by Amber Brannon and Tiffany Menniweathers. In response to his inquiries, Tiffany told Mario that she did not know where Trey was. When another individual subsequently informed Mario that Tiffany did know Trey\u2019s whereabouts, the foursome returned to her apartment, where Mario fought with Tiffany and struck her several times. Amber called 911 as a result of the incident, but appellants had departed with Libby and Stephanie prior to the arrival of the police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Based on Amber\u2019s identification, the investigating police officer, Peter Cress, was able to locate appellants, Libby, and Stephanie approximately a half an hour later at a gas station, where the group had stopped to buy some beer. At that time, Stephanie told Officer Cress that she was not driving appellants around \u201cof her own free will.\u201d She also showed the officer the roll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of duct tape and told him that appellants had threatened to restrain her and Libby with it if they did not help them. She further informed him that appellants had come to her apartment, pushed Libby against the wall and threatened to push Stephanie out of her second-story window. Stephanie and Libby refused, however, to go to the police station to give statements, and Officer Cress allowed the women to leave with the car and appellants to leave on foot. After departing from the gas station, Stephanie and Libby found appellants and let them back in the car out of fear that appellants would otherwise try to hurt them or their family.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The foursome then proceeded to the previously rented motel room, where appellants searched for the marijuana. From there, Stephanie paged Trey, who responded with a telephone call. Mario got on the telephone and began arguing with Trey about the marijuana. Mario told Trey they could meet and \u201cgo at it with fists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Thereafter, the group returned to Stephanie\u2019s apartment. After stating that they were going to look for Trey until they found him, appellants left Stephanie at her apartment and drove to their house with Libby in Mario\u2019s truck. At 3:21 a.m. on September 25, 1999, Officer Cress went to Stephanie\u2019s apartment where he found her hysterically muttering, \u201cThey took Libby. They took Libby.\u201d Later that morning, Officer Cress found Libby in Mario\u2019s bedroom at his mother\u2019s house. When he asked Libby whether she was \u201cdoing this against [her] will,\u201d Libby started crying and shook her head in the affirmative. Appellants were then arrested. When Libby picked up her car the next day it had four flat tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">When interviewed by Detective Lawson following his arrest, Mario conceded that he had been looking for Trey the previous day, but claimed that it was because Trey owed him money.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also claimed that he had not been inside Libby\u2019s house or Stephanie\u2019s house on the day in question. After the interview, Detective Lawson overheard Mario tell Tyrone what he had said during the interview and warn him, \u201cDon\u2019t go into details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Following his arrest, Tyrone was twice interviewed by Detective Lawson.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During the interviews, Tyrone conceded that he and his brother had been looking for Trey, but claimed it was because he owed them money. He initially denied going to Libby\u2019s house, but later admitted it, claiming that nothing unusual had occurred there. He also admitted that he had been carrying a \u201cnail puller\u201d with him during the evening in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">I. <em>The Trial Court Properly Instructed the Jury Regarding the Elements of Burglary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The trial court instructed the jury under CALJIC No. 14.50 as follows: \u201cEvery person who enters any building with a specific intent to steal, take and carry away the personal property of another of any value and with the further specific intent to deprive the owner permanently of that property or with the specific intent to commit false imprisonment by violence or menace or assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, felonies, is guilty of the crime of burglary in violation of Penal Code section 459.\u201d Appellants contend that, because the jury could have erroneously inferred the satisfaction of the burglary intent element from their alleged intent to find and assault Trey at a place and time separate and distinct from Stephanie\u2019s apartment, the trial court had a sua sponte duty to additionally instruct the jury on the legal principle that they must have intended to commit the offense within, or in the immediate vicinity of, Stephanie\u2019s apartment. Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Kwok </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1246-1247 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 40] <em>(Kwok), </em>respondent contends that the trial court had no duty to provide the additional instruction claimed necessary by appellants, because burglary does not require spacial and temporal proximity where, as in this case, entry is made to facilitate the commission of a subsequent crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The trial court\u2019s instruction under CALJIC No. 14.50 generally tracked the language of section 459. It is well established that the court need only use the statutory language in instructing the jury on the elements of the offense, as long there is no basis to conclude that jurors would have difficulty understanding the elements under the facts of the case. <em>(People v. Failla </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 560, 565 [51 Cal.Rptr. 103, 414 P.2d 39] <em>(Failla); </em>see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Montoya </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1027, 1047 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 128, 874 P.2d 903] [the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law which are \u201cclosely and openly connected to the facts before the court and that are necessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the case\u201d].) Appellants do not dispute this principle, but argue that a clarifying instruction was necessary under the facts of this case to prevent the jury from erroneously basing their finding of felonious intent on evidence that they intended to commit assault on Trey at a separate place and time. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Section 459 does not require that a burglar intend to commit the target crime in the premises entered. <em>(Kwok, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1246-1247; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortega </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 691, 694 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>246] <em>(Ortega); People v. Wright </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 184, 191 [23 Cal.Rptr. 734].) In <em>Wright </em>at page 191, the court held that a burglary is committed \u201cif the intent at the time of entry is to commit the offense <em>in the immediate vicinity of the place entered </em>by defendant; if the entry is made as a means of <em>facilitating </em>the commission of the theft or felony; and if the two places are so <em>closely connected </em>that intent and consummation of the crime would constitute a single and practically <em>continuous </em>transaction.\u201d (Italics added.) Appellants interpret the <em>Wright </em>holding as establishing three criteria necessary for a burglary conviction when the target crime is not intended to be committed in the entered premises. Two subsequent appellate decisions have rejected appellants\u2019 interpretation of <em>Wright. </em>(See <em>Kwok, supra, </em>at pp. 1246-1247; <em>Ortega, supra, </em>at p. 694.) In <em>Ortega </em>at pages 695-696, the court ignored the <em>Wright </em>factors of spatial and temporal proximity and held that a clarifying burglary instruction was not necessary where the entry was \u201cclosely connected\u201d with the intended crime of extortion. In <em>Kwok </em>at pages 1246-1248, this court followed the <em>Ortega </em>court\u2019s rejection of temporal and spatial proximity as <em>elements </em>of burglary, noting that \u201cthe \u2018continuous transaction test\u2019 and the \u2018immediate vicinity test\u2019 ... are artifacts of the particular factual contexts of <em>Wright </em>[and other cases ascribing thereto].\u201d Finding \u201cno principled way to distinguish extortion from other felonies or from larceny [in the context of an intent to burglarize],\u201d we held that a burglary may be found \u201cif the facts and circumstances of the case permit a reasonable inference that the entry was made <em>in order to facilitate commission of the subsequent crime, </em>even though the entry and the subsequent crime \u2018may not share the attributes of proximity in time and place.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kwok, supra, </em>at p. 1247, italics added, quoting <em>Ortega, supra, </em>at p. 695.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Appellants urge us to not to apply the <em>Ortega </em>and <em>Kwok </em>holdings to the facts of this case, arguing that their application herein would mean that \u201cany entry into a structure while harboring an intent to commit a crime somewhere, at some time in the future is sufficient to meet the requirements of burglary.\u201d Again, we disagree. While <em>Kwok </em>and <em>Ortega </em>have dispensed with the <em>elemental </em>requirements of spatial and temporal proximity, they have done so only where the subject entry is \u201cclosely connected\u201d with, and is made in order to facilitate, the intended crime. (But see <em>People v. Wright, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.2d at p. 188 [entry merely to rest in preparation for a felony to be perpetrated elsewhere not sufficiently connected with offense to constitute burglary].) The evidence in the instant case showed that, although they did not know where they would ultimately find him, appellants entered Stephanie\u2019s apartment for the specific purpose of tracking down Trey in order to assault him. Thus, their entry into the apartment could reasonably be considered closely connected with and made in order to facilitate the intended crime of assaulting Trey. Under <em>Kwok </em>and <em>Ortega, </em>such circumstances are sufficient to satisfy the elements of a burglary, which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>adequately communicated to the jury by the court\u2019s provision of CALJIC No. 14.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">II. <em>A Unanimity Instruction Was Not Required in This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">As discussed above, the jury was instructed that appellants were guilty of burglary if they entered a building with the specific intent to steal, to commit false imprisonment by violence or menace, or to commit assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. The court did not instruct the jury that it needed to agree on the basis of the intent in order to return a guilty verdict. Mario contends that, because the specific intent harbored by a defendant when he enters a dwelling is an element of burglary, the court had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree as to the intent Mario had when he entered Stephanie\u2019s apartment. Relying on <em>Failla, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d 560, respondent argues that no unanimity instruction was required because the alternative bases of intent merely constituted alternative means of committing the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The California Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to a unanimous jury. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; <em>People v. Jones </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 321 [270 Cal.Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643]; <em>People v. Sutherland </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 602, 611 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 752].) It has long been the general rule in California, however, that when a single crime can be committed in various ways, jurors are not required to unanimously agree upon the <em>mode </em>of commission. <em>(Sutherland, supra, </em>at p. 612, citing <em>People v. Sullivan </em>(1903) 173 N.Y. 122 [65 N.E. 989], <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 656, 671-672 [234 P.2d 632]; and see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 249 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 636, 833 P.2d 643].) \u201cIt follows that even though the evidence establishes that the defendant employed two or more of the prescribed alternate means, and the jury disagrees on the manner of the offense, there is no infirmity in the unanimous determination that the defendant is guilty of the charged offense.\u201d <em>(Sutherland, supra, </em>at p. 613.) Specifically with respect to the crime of burglary, our high court has determined that \u201cjurors need not be instructed that to return a verdict of guilty they must all agree on the specific \u2018theory\u2019 of the entry\u2014i.e., what particular felony or felonies the defendant intended at the time\u2014provided they are told they must be unanimous in finding that a felonious entry took place.\u201d <em>(Failla, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 569.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Mario argues that we should not follow our state Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Failla, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d 560, because (1) it does not meet the federal due process requirements as established in the subsequent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Schad v. Arizona </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 624 [111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555] <em>(Schad); </em>(2) it erroneously characterizes alternative intents as different legal \u201ctheories\u201d; and (3) it is distinguishable from the instant case because it did not involve an intent to steal as an alternative to an intent to commit a specific felony. We disagree in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In <em>Schad, supra, </em>501 U.S. at page 645 [111 S.Ct. at page 2504], the Supreme Court held that due process did not require the jury, in convicting the defendant of first degree murder, to agree on one of the alternative statutory theories of premeditated or felony murder. While a majority of the court agreed that due process imposes some limits on the degree to which different states of mind may be considered merely alternative means of committing a single offense, the court could not agree on the extent of those due process limitations or how they should be applied. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 632, 651, 656 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2497-2498, 2507, 2509-2510].) In delivering the plurality opinion of the court, Justice Souter explained that there can be no single test for determining when two means are so disparate as to exemplify two inherently separate offenses. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 633-637, 643 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2498-2500, 2503].) Based on the principle that \u201cStates must be permitted a degree of flexibility in determining the \u2018fact[s] necessary to constitute the crime\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 638 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2500]), Justice Souter concluded that \u201c[w]here a State\u2019s particular way of defining a crime has a long history, or is in widespread use, it is unlikely that a defendant will be able to demonstrate that the State has . . . defined as a single crime multiple offenses that are inherently separate\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 640 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2501]). Finding, however, that history and widespread practice are not dispositive of the due process issue, Justice Souter then proceeded to address the level of culpability involved in the alternative mental states for first degree murder. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 642-644 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2502-2503].) As Justice Souter explained, \u201cWhether or not everyone would agree that the mental state that precipitates death in the course of robbery is the moral equivalent of premeditation, it is clear that such equivalence <em>could reasonably be found, </em>which is enough to rule out the argument that this moral disparity bars treating them as alternative means to satisfy the mental element of a single offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 644 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2503-2504], italics added.) Thus, the court held that federal due process did not require the jury to unanimously agree on one of the statutory theories of premeditated or felony murder. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 645 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2504].)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">While our high court\u2019s decision in <em>Failla, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d 560, did not address the burglary unanimity issue in the context of federal due process, we find no basis to conclude that its holding has been invalidated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Schad, supra, </em>501 U.S. 624. On the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the <em>Failla </em>holding is fully supported by the reasoning of the <em>Schad </em>plurality. Just like Arizona\u2019s manner of defining the crime of first degree murder, there can be no dispute that the California\u2019s manner of defining burglary, including its alternative bases for the element of intent, has a long history and is in widespread use.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the <em>Failla </em>court\u2019s reference to the alternative bases for intent as \u201ctheories\u201d of guilt mirrors that of the <em>Schad </em>court. In any event, this characterization is largely irrelevant, because the real issue , is whether the jury\u2019s alternatives for finding intent are \u201cso disparate as to exemplify two [or more] inherently separate offenses.\u201d <em>(Schad, supra, </em>at p. 643 [111 S.Ct. at p. 2503].) While, as Mario argues, the alternative bases of intent presented to the jury in this case could be considered \u201cquite disparate,\u201d if premeditation and felony murder can reasonably be considered moral equivalents, so too can intent to steal, intent to assault by means likely to result in great bodily harm and intent to falsely imprison, at least to the extent that their moral disparity does not bar \u201ctreating them as alternative means to satisfy the mental element of a single offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 644 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 2503-2504].) Thus, the fact that <em>Failla </em>did not involve theft as an alternative theory of guilt does not provide a meaningful basis to distinguish it from the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Based on the foregoing, we find our high court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Failla, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d 560, dispositive of Mario\u2019s juror-unanimity claim and hold that the trial court did not err in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">III., IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">McGuiness, P.
