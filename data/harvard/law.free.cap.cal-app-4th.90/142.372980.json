J.</author>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\"> Respondent Dana Commercial Credit Corporation (Dana) seeks sanctions for a frivolous motion by appellants Ferns &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Ferns, Barry Ferns and Karen Ragland (hereafter appellants) to recall the remittitur, which issued after dismissal of the appeal became final.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The essential issue presented is whether this court has the inherent authority to impose sanctions for the making of a frivolous <em>motion </em>on appeal, as contrasted with sanctions for the prosecution of a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">This court has inherent powers requisite to its proper functioning, including the power to preserve order in its proceedings. Consequently, this court has the inherent power to impose sanctions for the filing of a frivolous motion in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">1. <em>Prior proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">On November 14, 1997, Dana filed a legal malpractice action against appellants. Thereafter, Ferns, Garwacki &amp; Adams was substituted in as Doe 1. On May 7, 1999, following the issuance of evidentiary and issue preclusion sanctions against appellants (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2023, subd. (b)),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court entered a judgment in favor of Dana in the sum of $159,805. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">On June 19, 2000, Dana filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, or in the alternative, to strike the appellant\u2019s brief. The motion was made on the grounds that, in addition to submitting a brief nearly devoid of legal authority, appellants had failed to procure a clerk\u2019s transcript or create an appellant\u2019s transcript, and had failed to cite to the record, with the exception of a few references to the reporter\u2019s transcript. Dana emphasized appellants \u201chave had nine months to procure a record and to draft a brief conforming to the Rules of Court. Despite many chances given by this Court to Appellants, they still refuse to abide by the Rules . . . .\u201d (Italics deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>On July 11, 2000, this court granted the dismissal motion, ruling: \u201cThe record in this matter demonstrates, and appellants have made no attempt to dispute, a flagrant disregard of the rules relevant to the preparation and timely filing of a record. This Court has on several occasions relieved appellants from repeated procedural defaults. Further consideration of appellants\u2019 inability or unwillingness to comply with the rules serves no legitimate purpose, is unfair to respondent and improperly burdens this Court. For all of the reasons outlined in respondent\u2019s uncontested motion, the appeal should be and is hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">On July 27, 2000, appellants filed a motion to vacate the dismissal. The motion was denied. The remittitur issued on September 22, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The day the remittitur issued, appellants filed a motion to recall the \u201e remittitur, vacate the dismissal and reinstate the appeal. On November 1, 2000, this court denied appellants\u2019 motion to recall the remittitur. Thereafter, appellants filed a petition for review, which was denied by the Supreme Court on January 17, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">2. <em>The second motion to recall the remittitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">On March 28, 2001, appellants filed another motion to recall the remitti-tur, claiming Dana had procured the dismissal through fraud, in that the <em>cover </em>of the dismissal motion served on appellants\u2019 counsel was captioned \u201cMotion for an Extension of Time to File Respondent\u2019s Brief,\u201d and because appellants did not oppose an extension of time, they did not respond to said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Dana filed an opposition, urging denial of the motion and requesting $13,812 in sanctions. Dana pointed out that appellants\u2019 petition for review, filed December 11, 2000, contended: \u201cAppellants did not realize that [Dana] had filed a Motion to Dismiss, as the [cover] of the Motion refers to a Motion for an Extension of time, which the Appellants did not oppose.\u201d As indicated, the Supreme Court denied the petition for review. Thus, this \u201cfraud\u201d claim, based on an inconsistency between the caption and contents of Dana\u2019s motion to dismiss, had previously been raised and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">On April 16, 2001, we summarily denied the motion to recall the remit-titur, and pursuant to rule 41(b), we placed the motion for sanctions on calendar for hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The essential issue presented is this court\u2019s authority to impose sanctions for the filing of a frivolous <em>motion </em>on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">1. <em>This court has the inherent power to impose sanctions for the filing of a frivolous motion on appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Section 907 states: \u201cWhen it appears to the reviewing court that the <em>appeal </em>was frivolous or taken solely for delay, it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as may be just.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rule 26(a)(2) likewise authorizes this court to impose sanctions \u201c[i]f the <em>appeal </em>is frivolous or taken solely for the purpose of delay or if any party . . . has been guilty of any other unreasonable infraction of the rules governing appeals . . . (Italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, these provisions pertain to the imposition of sanctions for either a frivolous <em>appeal </em>or a specific violation of the appellate rules. Likewise, the leading case of <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179] addresses the court\u2019s power to impose sanctions for the prosecution of frivolous <em>appeals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">With respect to sanctions for frivolous motions, section 128.5, subdivision (a), states in relevant part: \u201cEvery trial court may order a party, the party\u2019s attorney, or both to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">However, section 128.5 pertains to <em>trial court proceedings', </em>it does not speak to an appellate court\u2019s power to impose sanctions for frivolous motions. Nonetheless, the statute\u2019s rationale, to compensate the prevailing party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>as well as to control burdensome and unnecessary legal tactics <em>(Pacific Trends Lamp &amp; Lighting Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. White, Inc. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 918]), is equally applicable to appellate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">A similar issue was presented in <em>Warren v. Schecter </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1189, 1198 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 573], wherein the respondent sought calendar preference on appeal due to her medical condition. We noted the circumstances fit most closely within section 36, dealing with trial setting preference, which provides, inter alia, for preference where a party suffers from an illness or condition raising substantial medical doubt of survival beyond six months. (\u00a7 36, subd. (d); <em>Warren v. Schecter, supra, </em>at p. 1199.) However, section 36 does not speak to calendar preference on appeal, only to trial setting preference. <em>(Warren v. Schecter, supra, </em>at p. 1199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Nonetheless, we granted the request for preference, reasoning: \u201c[T]he statute\u2019s rationale for granting calendar preference to certain litigants is equally applicable to appellate proceedings, [f] \u2018It is beyond dispute that \u201cCourts have inherent power, as well as power under section 187 of the Code of Civil Procedure, [fn. omitted] to adopt any suitable method of practice, both in ordinary actions and special proceedings, if the procedure is not specified by statute or by rules adopted by the Judicial Council.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Warren v. Schecter, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 1199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">By a parity of reasoning, in view of this court\u2019s inherent power to control its own proceedings, we conclude our sanctions authority is not limited to frivolous appeals. \u201c[E]very court of record has powers requisite to its proper functioning as an independent constitutional department of government [citations] including the power ... to preserve order in the court . . . .\u201d <em>(Bloniarz v. Roloson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 143, 147-148 [74 Cal.Rptr. 285, 449 P.2d 221].) Consequently, this court has the inherent authority to impose sanctions for the filing of a frivolous <em>motion </em>on appeal, and will exercise its discretion to do so upon an appropriate showing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The motion for sanctions is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"Avo\">Croskey, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Prior to oral argument, the parties reached a settlement and stipulated to take the hearing on the request for sanctions off calendar, rendering the matter moot. However, \u201c \u2018[i]t is now established law that where . . . issues on appeal affect the general public interest. . . , and there is reasonable probability that the same questions will again be litigated and appealed, an appellate court may, although the appeal be subject to dismissal, nevertheless adjudicate the issues involved.

The argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>meritless. Appellants invoked the jurisdiction of this court in moving to recall the remittitur. Thus, this court had jurisdiction to entertain the motion to recall the remittitur, as well as the motion by Dana for sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b118-14\">Section 907 is also made applicable to original proceedings by section 1109. <em>(Coast Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1494, 1495, fn. 1 [232 Cal.Rptr. 483].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b118-16\">Rule 26 also has been construed to extend to writ petitions \u201cin light of the express language of rule 53 applying the rules to \u2018original proceedings\u2019 in the Courts of Appeal and directing that they \u2018be liberally construed to secure the just and speedy determination of appeals, transfers and original proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jones v.
