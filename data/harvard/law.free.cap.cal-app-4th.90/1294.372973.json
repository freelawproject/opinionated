J.</author>\n<p id=\"avi-dedup-0\">Over the past several years, this court has seen a number of cases where trial judges have attempted to streamline trial proceedings by adjudicating a case from the bench based on offers of proof. (E.g., <em>Stein-Brief Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Indemnity Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 364, 369 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 3]; cf. <em>Lokeijak v. City of Irvine </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 341, 343, fn. 2 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 429] [trial court suggested \u201cmini-trial\u201d as alternative to summary judgment].) The appeal before us illustrates how such an \u201cunusual and unorthodox procedure\u201d <em>(Stein-Brief Group, Inc. v. Home Indemnity Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 369) may result\u2014unless certain precautions are taken\u2014in an unnecessary reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, because the Court of Appeal must treat the case as if it were the product of a motion for nonsuit after an opening statement. <em>(Ibid.) </em>That means that all the inferences and conflicts in the evidence must be resolved, on appeal, in favor of the losing party, i.e., against the judgment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Had the court simply taken the time to hold a real trial on any disputed issues of fact, or had the parties agreed to have a court trial by submitting evidence (including conflicting evidence) to the judge, the ensuing judgment would be entitled to the usual presumptions, and all factual inferences would be resolved in favor of the winning party, i.e., the judgment of the trial court. The moral to the story is that haste makes for a lower affirmance rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">Ronald and Patty P\u00e1nico, owners of Travis Electronics, made a claim to Truck Insurance Exchange for the loss of various items of Travis\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>that ensued after rain came through the roof and entered the company\u2019s storeroom. Truck Insurance denied the claim on the ground that Travis\u2019s policy only covered the loss if it was precipitated by the \u201ccollapse of a building or any part of a building.\u201d The P\u00e1nicos then instituted this lawsuit, including bad faith claims, and sought a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">A successful motion for summary judgment in March 1998 eliminated any claims by the P\u00e1nicos personally (as distinct from Travis Electronics, a corporation), and a separate judgment of dismissal was filed as to them. Travis\u2019s claims were scheduled for trial in August 1998. But in a chambers conference before trial was to start, the court invited the attorney for Travis to \u201cmake what amounts to its best case factual presentation.\u201d The court was then to decide \u201cif those facts were proven\u201d whether there would be, as Truck Insurance contended, \u201cno coverage under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Travis\u2019s attorney then gave a statement, the salient part of which is this: That after four days of rain in November 1994, employees came to work one morning, and \u201cnoticed that in their store room, which is located on the second floor of a two-story building, four or five ceiling tiles, acoustical tiles, which I think we can agree were each two by two, had fallen. Some witnesses would say four, some would say six, it\u2019s in that range, leaving an opening in the ceiling through which the roof was visible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The offer of proof continued to the effect that Patty P\u00e1nico would testify that \u201cshe measured that hole in the roof by holding her thumb and forefinger approximately half an inch apart, and holding them up to the ceiling in the room where her deposition was taken as a means of estimating the size of the hole in the roof.\u201d P\u00e1nico \u201cwould further testify she saw water coming in through the area where the tiles had been ... it seemed to her that the water had been pouring through that hole in the ceiling earlier, and it also seemed to her that the source of the water that poured through the hole in the ceiling was the hole in the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">Travis\u2019s attorney finished his remarks by noting that the court had \u201cinformally\u201d ruled in chambers that \u201ceven if all those facts were proven under the policy in question the structural integrity of the building not having been either imminently nor actually threatened by the hole in the roof or the hole in the ceiling, there would be no coverage under the subject policy for the ensuing property personal business property damage loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Counsel for Truck Insurance made a formal \u201cmotion to dismiss based upon improper facts,\u201d which the trial court immediately granted. The judge then offered this explanation: \u201cThe only testimony before the court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>respect to the structure of the roof is plaintiff\u2019s observation, ftl] The court feels comfortable concluding as a matter of law that in light of the Doheny West case <em>[Doheny West Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 400 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 260]] that observation does not and cannot establish the sort of structural defect that would be consistent with the concept of imminent collapse. [1\u00a1] And I believe that\u2019s the burden under the Doheny case that plaintiff needs to meet to show that in order to collect under the policy that the roof\u2014she needed to establish that the roof was in danger of imminent collapse not actual collapse. It\u2019s either actual or imminent in California as I understand it, and the offer of proof fails to meet that burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Counsel for Truck Insurance then suggested that the procedure the court had just followed \u201cbe appropriately termed a motion for judgment or a motion for non-suit or directed verdict alternatively.\u201d The trial judge quickly corrected him. \u201cIt\u2019s not directed verdict,\u201d and counsel for Truck Insurance summed it up as a \u201cmotion for judgment or motion for non-suit.\u201d Counsel for Travis said \u201cI\u2019ll waive any objection to the label of a judgment.\u201d The court added, \u201cI said motion to dismiss,\u201d and the final substantive word on the characterization came from Travis\u2019s counsel (apparently alluding to <em>Stein-Brief Group, Inc. v. Home Indemnity Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 364) \u201cthe appellate court said it was akin to motion for judgment on the opening statement and that\u2019s close enough.\u201d The P\u00e1nicos and Travis together filed one notice of appeal, designating both the judgment regarding the P\u00e1nicos and the judgment regarding Travis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\"><em>Doheny West </em>is indeed the fountainhead California case for an exposition of what \u201ccollapse\u201d means in the context of an insurance policy. (The insurance contract in <em>Doheny West </em>was identical in relevant part to the one before us now). The case arose because a structural engineer came to the conclusion that a parking structure for a West Hollywood condominium building with a swimming pool, hot tub and pool room on top was so structurally unsound that the swimming pool was in <em>danger </em>of collapse in the next earthquake. (See <em>Doheny West Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins. Co., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 402-403.) The homeowners association made the appropriate repairs, billed the insurance company, which then turned their claim down, and the appellate court was eventually confronted with the question of whether the word \u201ccollapse\u201d could include \u201cmere impairment of structural integrity\u201d as well as \u201cactual collapse.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 405-406.) The answer was no, though the court added that \u201cimminent\u201d collapse would qualify. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 406, 408.) And as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>to whether the homeowners had a claim for imminent collapse, the appellate court ruled that they didn\u2019t. After a proper trial in which both sides submitted conflicting evidence on the degree of damage sustained by the building, the trial court had believed the insurer\u2019s experts and found that collapse was indeed not imminent. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 409-410.) The conflict in the evidence was of course resolved in favor of the judgment, which was accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><em>Doheny West, </em>however, can take a court only so far in the context of an insurance claim like the one before us, where the issue is not whether collapse is threatened, but whether there has been any actual collapse at all, or at least, as Travis reminds us, whether there has been any actual collapse of \u201cany part\u201d of the building, including the roof or ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Well, did at least a part of Travis\u2019s building actually collapse? Or did it just leak? This is where the standard of review and the procedures used by the trial court require reversal. We cannot save the judgment by saying this case was the equivalent of a court trial on stipulated facts, or even a nonsuit motion made after the close of evidence in a court trial (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 631.8) and thereby read all inferences in favor of the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dialogue in the record is inescapable that both parties and the trial judge understood the procedure to be the functional equivalent of a motion for nonsuit in a jury trial based on plaintiff\u2019s opening statement. And that subjects any ensuing judgment to an extremely strict standard of review: Not only must all reasonable inferences be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, but that party must be given the opportunity to amend the opening statement so as to correct its supposed defects. (See <em>John Norton Farms, Inc. v. Todagco </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 149, 161 [177 Cal.Rptr. 215] [\u201csince the motion for nonsuit is designed to call attention to correctable defects, granting such a motion after the plaintiff\u2019s opening statement can be upheld only where it is clear that counsel has stated all the facts\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>According to the opening statement, a trier of fact could have found that as many as six 2-by-2 ceiling tiles had fallen. There was also a hole in the roof above, of indeterminate size: The record here, with its allusion to Patty P\u00e1nico\u2019s thumb and forefinger, is not at all clear as to the hole\u2019s actual size, and, more importantly, its size in comparison to the roof as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">One tile of many, dislodged from a roof and leaving a relatively small opening in it, does not a \u201ccollapse\u201d make. On the other hand, when a substantial part of any structure falls under the weight of water, surely the ordinary person would think there has been a collapse. We don\u2019t know the exact size of the \u201chole\u201d in the roof, but <em>on this record </em>it is reasonable to infer\u2014particularly from the fact that it may have let in enough water to cause up to six ceiling tiles to fall\u2014that it was substantial enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Additionally, ceiling tiles are certainly \u201cpart\u201d of a building, even if only an interior part (a ceiling beneath a roof). All one has to do is look up at a ceiling in a room (particularly a small room or office) with 2-by-2 tiles and imagine what it would be like if six of them were missing to realize that if six of them were to\u2014shall we say \u201cfall down\u201d\u2014that the event could be reasonably characterized as a \u201ccollapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The trial court appears to have been misled by the absence of any offer of proof of \u201cstructural defect that would be consistent with the concept of imminent collapse.\u201d But <em>Doheny West </em>should not be read to require that element in all cases. The need for a \u201cstructural defect\u201d only governs cases where there has been no actual collapse at all, and the question is the imminency of any collapse. It doesn\u2019t control cases where something has fallen in, yet there remains a dispute over whether the \u201cfalling in\u201d was big enough to rate the appellation \u201ccollapse.\u201d The trial court thus erred in granting the motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">We are required to dismiss the appeal from the judgment dismissing the P\u00e1nicos\u2019 individual claims. There was separate judgment of dismissal filed March 24, 1998, and notice of entry of that judgment was served April 2, 1998. Because the judgment disposed of all causes of actions in which the Panicos were plaintiffs, it was separately appealable. (See <em>Justus v. Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 568 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122] [judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>against plaintiff husbands were immediately appealable even though remaining plaintiff wives joined in same causes of action as plaintiff husbands].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The combined notice of appeal that included the appeal from the March 24, 1998 judgment wasn\u2019t filed, however, until October 30, 1998. While the notice of appeal was timely as to the judgment concerning Travis\u2019s claims (notice of entry was not served on that one until September 3, 1998), the notice of appeal as to the earlier judgment was most certainly untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The judgment concerning the claims of Travis is reversed. The appeal concerning the claims of Ronald and Patty P\u00e1nico is dismissed. In the interests of justice the parties will bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Rylaarsdam, J., and Bedsworth, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">In <em>Lokeijak, </em>a trial court policy memorandum suggested that a \u201cmini-trial\u201d conducted on \u201cstipulated facts, declarations, or live testimony\u2014perhaps even before a jury\u201d was a useful alternative to a formal summary judgment motion. (See <em>Lokeijak v. City of Irvine, supra, 65 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 343, fn. 2.) Of course, in cases of a \u201cmini-trial\u201d in front of a jury there is no problem: There has clearly been a resolution of the facts by a trier of fact. But there is a risk in other such procedures, particularly adjudication after counsel provides competing offers of proof\u2014namely that the Court of Appeal would be bound to construe the procedure as the functional equivalent of either a motion for nonsuit or summary judgment, and apply a standard of review where the inferences would be drawn <em>against </em>the judgment. The net result is that time is not saved: Judgments that might otherwise be routinely affirmed must be reversed because of some inference that could be drawn from the losing party\u2019s facts. The solution for harried trial judges who, we recognize, are under pressure to move tremendous case loads along expeditiously, is for the record to clearly show that the parties have actually agreed to have a trial\u2014even if only on stipulated facts, declarations, or offers of proof\u2014 before the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\"><em>Ochoa v.
