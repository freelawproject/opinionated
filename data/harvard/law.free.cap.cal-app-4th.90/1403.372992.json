J.</author>\n<p id=\"ayx-dedup-1\">A clause in a husband\u2019s testamentary trust gives his wife the net income for life, but only if she does not remarry or live with a man as though married. Here we conclude that the clause is void as a restraint on marriage. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">Petitioner Darlene Guidotti appeals an order by the probate court denying a petition to reform the will of her deceased husband, Earl Guidotti, to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code concerning the marital deduction and the charitable deduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">On March 13, 1999, Earl Guidotti died. His last will and testament dated November 19, 1993, created a testamentary trust for the benefit of his wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>Darlene. The trust generally provided for Darlene during her lifetime and upon her death, provided for distribution to \u201ccharitable 501 (c)(3) organizations\u201d within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. The trust granted Darlene the power to appoint the charitable beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The trust gave Darlene the right to live in the family residence during her lifetime, rent-free. In the event she moved from the residence or was absent for more than 60 continuous days, without an intent to return, Darlene forfeited the right to live in the residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The trust also provided that Darlene would receive the net income for her lifetime. However, \u201c[i]n the event [she] should remarry, or, live with a man as though they were husband and wife, even though not married, all income payments to her shall immediately stop . . . .\u201d The trust also permitted an invasion of the trust principal as necessary for Darlene\u2019s proper health, maintenance, and support. The power to invade principal, however, ceased in the event of Darlene\u2019s remarriage or cohabitation \u201cwith a man as though they were husband and wife, even though not married.\u201d During the probate proceedings, Darlene expressly disclaimed any interest in the trust principal by filing a written disclaimer pursuant to Probate Code section 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">On March 13, 2000, Darlene filed a petition to reform the will in order to meet the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the marital and charitable deductions. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17200, subd. (a)(14), (15), 15409; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2055(e).) Darlene asserted that the clause that terminated her income interest upon remarriage or cohabitation precluded the federal estate tax marital deduction and also prevented the charitable tax deduction because the remainder interest passing to charity would be uncertain. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2055, 2056.) She argued that the clause regarding her remarriage or cohabitation with a man was void as a restraint on marriage. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 710.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">In support of the reformation petition, Darlene offered a declaration by the attorney who drafted Earl\u2019s will and testamentary trust. The attorney declared that Earl was \u201cextremely jealous\u201d of Darlene and \u201cdid not want Darlene to remarry nor live with another man as if married\u201d after Earl\u2019s death. Earl instructed him to draft the will \u201cin such a manner that Darlene would be severely penalized in the event she remarried or lived with another man as if married.\u201d The attorney stated: \u201c[Earl] intended and specifically directed me to draft provisions which would prevent, in so far as he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>control, the remarriage of Darlene or her living with another man as if married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">According to the attorney\u2019s declaration, Earl also hoped to obtain a marital deduction and a charitable deduction for federal estate tax purposes. The attorney stated: \u201c[Earl] wished to [accomplish the estate plan] without payment of state or federal death taxes, [ft) He wanted there to be no federal or state estate taxes at his death.\u201d Indeed, the trust empowered the personal representative \u201cto elect qualified terminable interest treatment [regarding the marital deduction] for all or for any portion\u201d of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The probate court considered the petition for reformation and determined that the clause regarding remarriage or cohabitation was not a restraint on marriage because it fell under the exception of Civil Code section 710, \u201cwhere the intent was not to forbid marriage, but only to give the use until marriage.\u201d The trial court reasoned that the clause was \u201charsh, unwise and somewhat punitive\u201d but \u201calso\u201d reflected an intent that any new partner provide for Darlene\u2019s support. The court therefore refused to declare the clause void and reform the will to comply with federal estate tax requirements for favorable tax treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Darlene appeals and contends that the clause restraining marriage is against public policy and void. Her appeal is unopposed by the Attorney General, who represents the yet unnamed charitable beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">The interpretation of a written instrument, including a will, is a judicial function. <em>(Parsons v. Bristol Development Co. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839].) A reviewing court may exercise its independent judgment in interpreting an instrument provided that extrinsic evidence regarding interpretation is not conflicting. <em>(Estate of Edwards </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1366, 1371 [250 Cal.Rptr. 779].) \u201cThe reviewing court has the duty to independently interpret the will when ... the credibility of extrinsic evidence or the resolution of a conflict in the evidence\u201d is not in issue. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the reviewing court must exercise independent judgment to interpret a will where, as here, conflicting inferences may be drawn from uncontroverted evidence. <em>(Morey </em>v. <em>Vannucci </em>(1995) 64 Cal.App.4th 904, 913 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 573] [appellate court not bound by trial court\u2019s interpretation of written instrument where extrinsic evidence regarding interpretation does not conflict]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, \u00a7 681, pp. 615-616 [trial court\u2019s inferences drawn from uncontradicted extrinsic evidence are not binding on reviewing court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>Probate Code section 21102, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cThe intention of the transferor as expressed in the instrument controls the legal effect of the dispositions made in the instrument.\u201d  Thus, the paramount rule in the construction of a will is the determination of the testator\u2019s intent. <em>(Estate of Edwards, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 1366, 1371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Civil Code section 710 provides: \u201cConditions imposing restraints upon marriage ... are void; but this does not affect limitations where the intent was not to forbid marriage, but only to give the use until marriage.\u201d Our Supreme Court has invalidated clauses in wills that either restrain marriage generally or marriage to a particular person. <em>(Estate of Duffill </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 748, 752-754 [183 P. 337] [testatrix\u2019s will reduced gift to son if he married \u201cMrs. Alice McNamara\u201d]; <em>Estate of Scott </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 65, 66 [148 P. 221] [testator\u2019s will limited wife\u2019s bequest if she \u201c[s]hould . . . wish to marrie agane\u201d].) Forfeiture of a bequest if the beneficiary remarries may, depending upon the words used, be a restraint of marriage and \u201ctherefore absolutely void\u201d under Civil Code section 710. <em>(Estate of Scott, supra, </em>170 Cal. 65, 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Here Earl\u2019s will terminates payment of all trust income to Darlene \u201c[i]n the event [she] should remarry, or, live with a man as though they were husband and wife.\u201d The declaration of the attorney who drafted the will states that Earl was jealous of Darlene and wanted to preclude her remarrying or living with another man. <em>(Estate of Huntington </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 197, 205 [129 Cal.Rptr. 787] [in interpreting a will, court may consider circumstances surrounding its execution].) Indeed, the attorney states that he counseled Earl that a clause restraining her remarriage \u201cmight be unenforceable as against public policy.\u201d Our review of the wording of the will and more importantly, the evidence surrounding its execution shows that Earl intended to restrain Darlene\u2019s relationships or remarriage in violation of Civil Code section 710. His intent was not to provide for her until such time as she formed another relationship. <em>(Estate of Fitzgerald </em>(1911) 161 Cal. 319, 322 [119 P. 96] [testator left estate to wife, but \u201cin the event\u201d she remarried, her gift was divided with testator\u2019s son unless he died without issue].) Unlike the circumstances in <em>Estate of Fitzgerald, supra, </em>161 Cal. 319, 322, we cannot say there is \u201cnot the slightest indication that there was any design on [the testator\u2019s] part to deter his wife from contracting another marriage, or that he had any objection whatever to her so doing.\u201d We draw the reasonable inference from the declaration of the drafting attorney that Earl intended to restrict Darlene from remarrying or living with a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>The order is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings concerning reformation of the will and the charitable bequests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Appellant shall bear costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">Yegan, J., and Perren, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">We refer to the parties by their first names not from disrespect but to ease the reader\u2019s task.
