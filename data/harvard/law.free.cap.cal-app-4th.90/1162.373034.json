This program replaced an interim code enforcement program the city adopted the previous year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the enactment of these \u201cproactive\u201d code enforcement programs, rental property was inspected only when the city received a complaint. (Under the permanent code enforcement program, the city will still respond to complaints.)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Petitioners appeared before the city council in opposition to the permanent code enforcement program. They took issue with the city\u2019s position the permanent program would not have a significant impact on the environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>and, therefore, an environmental impact report (EIR) was not required prior to adoption of the program. In support of their argument the program could have a significant effect on the environment, petitioners submitted declarations from two urban planners, Sims and Silvern, who had not testified concerning the interim code enforcement program. Petitioners\u2019 experts explained why, in their view, the code enforcement program was likely to \u201ccreate significant environmental impacts within the meaning of [CEQA] by adversely affecting the city\u2019s affordable rental housing stock and ultimately the environmental setting of the city\u2019s neighborhoods.\u201d In summary, Sims concluded the program \u201ccould cause widespread foreclosure, abandonment and removal of affordable rental housing in the City of Los Angeles.\u201d Silvern concluded the volume of repair activity which would be generated by the program could significantly affect the environment through the transportation, use and disturbance \u201cof potentially toxic and/or hazardous materials (e.g., pesticides, asbestos and lead paint,\u201d by permanently or temporarily displacing tenants, and by causing \u201cchanges to buildings that are of historic value.\u201d For these reasons, petitioners argued to the council, an EIR should be prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Notwithstanding petitioners\u2019 objections, the city approved the permanent code enforcement program after concluding it was exempt from the requirements for an \u201cinitial study\u201d and EIR under CEQA. As it did with the interim program, the city filed a \u201cnotice of exemption\u201d with respect to the permanent program.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Following adoption of the ordinance creating the permanent code enforcement program, petitioners filed a timely petition in the superior court for a writ of mandate nullifying the ordinance. The petition challenged the city\u2019s finding the code enforcement program was exempt from environmental study under CEQA. Petitioners contended the program had the potential for significant environmental consequences and the city\u2019s finding to the contrary was not supported by substantial evidence or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The trial court disagreed with petitioners. The court noted the current program was virtually \u201cthe same project\u201d as the interim program and that it had upheld the city\u2019s finding the interim program was exempt from CEQA review in an action by these same petitioners raising the same issues. Because the two programs were virtually the same, the court held, an EIR was not required as to the current program unless \u201cnew information of substantial importance, which could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time of the previous [finding] is discovered.\u201d The declarations by the urban planners, Sims and Silvern, were not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>before the city council, the court ruled, because there was no showing why they could not have been produced at the time the council considered the interim program. Therefore, the court found petitioners failed to produce any \u201cnew\u201d evidence in opposition to the program. The court further held even if the experts\u2019 declarations were considered, the record contained substantial evidence to support the city\u2019s determination the project was exempt from CEQA review.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The trial court entered an order denying the petition for writ of mandate and petitioners filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">I. <em>Background: CEQA\u2019s Three-tiered Structure for Environmental Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">An explanation of CEQA\u2019s three-tiered structure for environmental review will aid in understanding the issues raised by the petitioners in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">If a project falls within a category exempted from environmental review by statute or administrative regulation, no further agency evaluation is required.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the project is not categorically exempt, the agency undertakes an \u201cinitial study\u201d of the project.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If this study demonstrates the project will not have a significant effect on the environment, the agency makes a \u201cnegative declaration\u201d to that effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the \u201cinitial study\u201d determines the project may have a significant effect on the environment, an EIR is required.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">In the present case, the city council determined the permanent code enforcement program was categorically exempt from environmental review under the state and city CEQA guidelines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the motion adopting the permanent program the council found: \u201c[Tjhis project ... is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Article VII, Section 1, Class 1, Category 4 of the City\u2019s CEQA Guidelines because the effect of the project is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>restoration or rehabilitation of deteriorated or damaged structures, facilities or mechanical equipment or systems to meet current standards of public health, safety or environmental protection[.]\u201d The council further found the project is exempt under class 9, category 2 of the city\u2019s CEQA guidelines \u201cbecause the project would allow a City department to inspect the quality, health or safety of a project[.]\u201d And, finally, the council found \u201cthe project is exempt under Class 21, Category (a) of the State CEQA Guidelines because it is the enforcement of a law administered or adopted by the regulatory agency[.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Having found the project exempt from further review, the city did not undertake an \u201cinitial study\u201d or issue a negative declaration or EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">II. <em>The Judgment Rejecting Petitioners\u2019 Challenge to the Interim Code Enforcement Program Does Not Preclude Their Challenge to the Permanent Program.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Initially, the city argues the judgment on the merits denying petitioners\u2019 challenge to the interim code enforcement program precludes their challenge to the permanent program under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The trial court took a slightly different approach holding petitioners could challenge the permanent program but not on the basis of their experts\u2019 declarations. We disagree with the city and the trial court as to the preclusive effect of the failed challenge to the interim program.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">The doctrine of res judicata precludes the parties from relitigating a cause of action which has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the doctrine, an issue necessarily decided in such prior litigation is conclusively determined as to the parties if it is involved in a subsequent lawsuit on a different cause of action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   Here the parties are the same but the cause of action is different because the present suit arises out of the city\u2019s adoption of a new, permanent code enforcement program to replace the interim program.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">The city contends the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars petitioners\u2019 attack on the permanent code enforcement program because the permanent program \u201cis for all intents and purposes the same as the [interim program]\u201d and the issues raised with respect to the permanent program were considered and rejected in the prior litigation challenging the interim program. We find the programs and the issues are not the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>Under CEQA, a \u201cproject\u201d is \u201can activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and which is any of the following: [^] (a) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ordinances passed by cities are clearly activities undertaken by a public agency and thus \u201cprojects\u201d under CEQA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, the interim and permanent code enforcement programs, adopted under separate ordinances, are not the same for purposes of CEQA because they are separate \u201cprojects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Furthermore, a comparison of the interim and permanent programs shows they are not the same. The very fact one was temporary and the other is permanent is enough to distinguish them because the environmental impact of a short-term program may be much less significant than a program of indefinite duration.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There are other differences: the permanent program is broader in scope than the interim program,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it specifies a covered rental property is to be inspected at least once every three years, adds new provisions regarding rent increases and rent withholding, and sets inspection fees and penalties for nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Because the programs are not the same, neither are the issues. While the issue in petitioners\u2019 previous action was whether the <em>interim </em>code enforcement program was exempt from environmental review under CEQA the issue in the present action is whether the <em>permanent </em>code enforcement program is exempt from such review.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">The situation here is much like the one in <em>Chamberlin. </em>There the petitioner contended a city ordinance enacting a traffic control plan was invalid because the city had not filed an EIR. This writ petition was Chamberlin\u2019s second challenge to the traffic plan; his first petition filed eight months earlier had raised a similar objection to the city\u2019s adoption of the plan on a trial basis. The first petition was denied and the appeal dismissed as moot when the city adopted a permanent plan. The trial court dismissed Chamber-lin\u2019s writ petition challenging the subsequent permanent plan on the ground the petition was barred by collateral estoppel. The Court of Appeal reversed. Explaining its decision, the court stated: \u201c[T]he issues presented in the second action are not entirely the same as those raised by the first, for the reason that the first action concerned the trial plan while the second challenged the permanent plan. There are differences, albeit minor, between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>configurations of the two plans. . . . Collateral estoppel does not apply where the issue previously litigated was not identical.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court also rejected the city\u2019s argument the permanent plan was not a separate \u201cproject\u201d under CEQA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude the petition before us is not barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The trial court took a different, but equally mistaken, approach to limiting petitioners\u2019 challenge to the permanent code enforcement program. The court concluded petitioners could challenge the new, permanent program but held the declarations of petitioners\u2019 experts were not properly before the city council and therefore would not be considered by the court in ruling on the writ petition.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">The reasoning which led the trial court to this ruling was as follows. First, the court found the interim and permanent code enforcement programs were the \u201csame project.\u201d Next, equating the city\u2019s \u201cnotice of exemption\u201d to a \u201cnegative declaration,\u201d the court found the city could not be required to prepare an FIR for the permanent program unless substantial changes were proposed in the project or new evidence came to light which could not have been known with reasonable diligence at the time a negative declaration was prepared regarding the interim program.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court then concluded that because the city proposed no substantial changes from the interim program and because petitioners failed to show their experts\u2019 declarations could not, with reasonable diligence, have been obtained and presented to the city council at the time it considered the interim program, the experts\u2019 declarations could not be considered in determining whether an environmental review was required for the permanent program.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">We explained above why the interim and permanent code enforcement programs are not \u201cthe same project.\u201d The trial court also erred in equating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>the city\u2019s notice of exemption to a negative declaration and then applying the rules regarding the need for an EIR subsequent to a negative declaration.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">A notice of exemption is a notice filed \u201c[w]hen a public agency decides that a project is <em>exempt </em>from CEQA[.]\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Filing a notice of exemption triggers a 35-day limitations period on legal challenges to the agency\u2019s decision the project is exempt. If no notice of exemption is filed, a 180-day limitations period applies.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A notice of exemption has no significance other than to trigger the running of the limitations period.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">A negative declaration, on the other hand, is a \u201cwritten statement briefly describing the reasons that a proposed project will not have a significant effect on the environment and does not require the preparation of an environmental impact report.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A negative declaration is only applicable in the case of a project which is <em>not </em>exempt from environmental study under CEQA.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As our Supreme Court explained in the <em>No Oil </em>case, \u201cIf a project falls within a category exempt by administrative regulation ... or \u2018it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect on the environment\u2019 <em>... no further agency evaluation is required.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">In the present case, the city found the permanent code enforcement program was categorically exempt from environmental review under the city\u2019s CEQA guidelines. Because the city treated the permanent program as categorically exempt from environmental review, it did not prepare a negative declaration or an EIR. Thus the regulation relied on by the trial court,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which limits the circumstances in which new evidence can be considered after the certification of an EIR or the adoption of a negative declaration, is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">In summary, the issue presented in this case is whether the city properly exempted the permanent code enforcement program from environmental review under CEQA. Petitioners are not estopped from raising this issue by reason of the judgment against them in their challenge to the interim program and the evidence in their experts\u2019 declarations was properly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>the city council and should be considered in reviewing the council\u2019s exemption decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">III. <em>The City Was Not Required to Conduct an \u201cInitial Study\u201d to Determine Whether the Code Enforcement Program Was Categorically Exempt from CEQA Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">In reviewing the city\u2019s determination a project falls within a categorical exemption the trial court\u2019s task, and ours, is to determine whether the city proceeded in a lawful manner and its findings are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">On the first issue, petitioners contend the city did not proceed in the manner required by law because a finding a project is exempt from CEQA review requires an \u201cinitial study\u201d to determine its environmental effects as we held in <em>East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In making this argument, petitioners rely on our statement in <em>East Peninsula </em>\u201cthe amount of analysis and study involved at the preliminary review stage of determination of whether a project is exempt from CEQA may be similar to that involved at the \u2018second\u2019 stage where the agency conducts an initial study to determine whether the project has a significant effect on the environment [citation].\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Contrary to petitioners\u2019 interpretation, we did not hold in <em>East Peninsula </em>an agency always must conduct an \u201cinitial study\u201d before declaring a project exempt from CEQA review. Such a holding would run counter to the three-tiered structure of CEQA review under which, if a project is categorically exempt \u201cno further agency evaluation is required\u201d and no \u201cinitial study\u201d takes place.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>East Peninsula </em>was decided on the' basis of the unique provision in section 21080.18, which states CEQA does not apply to the closing of a public school or the transfer of its students \u201cif the only physical changes involved are categorically exempt under [regulations adopted by the Secretary of Resources].\u201d We interpreted this statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>language to incorporate not only the regulatory exemptions but the regulatory <em>exceptions </em>to the exemptions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> One such exception applies \u201cwhen the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Thus, in determining whether a school closure was exempt from CEQA review we held the school board was required to determine whether the cumulative impacts from the closing of the school and the transfer of its students would have a significant effect on the environment.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We also noted the school board was well aware of numerous negative impacts on the environment which would result from closing the school in question, and it was also aware future school closings would probably have to occur in the not-too-distant future. It would exalt form over substance, we observed, to allow the school board to proceed with the closing based on mere technical compliance with the exemption statute and ignore potentially significant environmental consequences.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The present case does not involve the statutory school closing exception. Therefore, the kind of second tier analysis, or \u201cinitial study,\u201d we required in <em>East Peninsula </em>does not apply here. However, even if such an analysis was required the requirement was satisfied by the city\u2019s study and report on the interim code enforcement program which we discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">IV. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the City\u2019s Finding the Permanent Code Enforcement Program Is Categorically Exempt from CEQA Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">The city found the permanent code enforcement program was exempt from CEQA review under the city\u2019s CEQA guideline, article VII, section 1, class 1, subdivision 4.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Substantial evidence supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Article VII, section 1 exempts certain projects from CEQA review \u201cprovided such categorical exemptions are not used for projects where it can be readily perceived that such projects may have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d Class 1 applies to existing facilities and consists of projects involving \u201cthe operation, repair, maintenance or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that previously existing.\u201d Subdivision 4 of class 1 exempts projects consisting of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>\u201c[Restoration or rehabilitation of deteriorated or damaged structures, facilities or mechanical equipment systems to meet current standards of public health, safety and environmental protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">From our review of the record, the permanent code enforcement program is a project designed to accomplish the \u201crestoration or rehabilitation of deteriorated or damaged structures\u201d by bringing those structures up to code standards for the health, safety and protection of all the residents of Los Angeles. The project accomplishes this goal through routine inspection of the majority of Los Angeles rental housing, requests for voluntary compliance and criminal, civil or administrative penalties and fines if compliance is not forthcoming. Thus, the program on its face appears to fall within the class 1(4) exemption quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Petitioners argue, however, appearances can be deceiving and the permanent program does not fit within the class 1(4) exemption, nor is there sufficient evidence the program will \u201chave [no] significant effect on the environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">In petitioners\u2019 view, the city is taking a wide-ranging \u201cproactive\u201d code enforcement program involving the inspection and rehabilitation of 750,000 rental units and the demolition of some and attempting to squeeze it into a categorical exemption intended for occasional, owner-initiated \u201cminor alterations\u201d to existing structures to bring them up to current code standards. The class 1(4) exemption, petitioners contend, was not intended to cover the wide-scale demolition and removal of rental units and the massive displacement of tenants who occupy these structures which will result from the permanent code enforcement program adopted by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Petitioners base this argument on the analysis of the <em>interim </em>code enforcement program prepared by their expert, Sims. Sims predicted many owners of buildings cited for code violations would not be able to afford to make the mandated repairs and instead would abandon their properties or remove them from the rental market thereby depleting the supply of affordable housing in Los Angeles and displacing a great many tenants from their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">The city\u2019s study of what actually occurred under the interim program contradicted'Sims\u2019s predictions. Seven thousand two hundred rental properties consisting of 99,000 units were inspected during the first 14 months the interim program was in effect. Of these 7,200 properties orders of abatement were issued to 269 (approximately 4 percent). Of the 269 properties, 100 had been brought into compliance at the time of the study. Approximately 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>tenants were displaced from their rental units out of the 99,000 units inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We see nothing in the changes incorporated into the permanent program to suggest its results will be markedly different from the interim program nor have petitioners submitted any evidence, expert or otherwise, that this would be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">It is also worth noting petitioner AAGLA, which claims it has \u201cthousands of members who own and/or operate residential rental property in the City\u201d failed to submit a single declaration from a member who claimed the interim enforcement program forced her to abandon her property or withdraw it from the rental market or that the interim program imposed a financial hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Petitioners next argue even if there is substantial evidence the permanent code enforcement program comes within the class 1(4) exemption, \u201c[a]n agency must next determine whether the project falls under one or more of the applicable exceptions to the categorical exemptions.\u201d We reject this argument for two reasons. Petitioners, not the city, have the burden of proving by substantial evidence an exception to the exemption applies. Petitioners failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Once an agency determines based on substantial evidence in the record that the project falls within a categorical exemption, as the city did here, the burden shifts to the challenging party to \u201cproduce substantial evidence that the project has the potential for a substantial adverse environmental impact.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Petitioners produced no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">We explained above why petitioners failed to produce substantial evidence of a significant environmental impact from the abandonment or withdrawal of rental housing. We now consider petitioners\u2019 second argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">According to petitioners\u2019 expert, Silvern, the three-year code enforcement cycle will require landlords to undertake construction or repair activities \u201cin <em>potentially </em>tens of thousands of apartment and other buildings throughout Los Angeles each year.\u201d This will have a significant effect on the environment because these construction and repair projects will involve \u201cuse [of] hazardous chemicals to control pests and rodents, and <em>potentially </em>disturb hazardous building materials (e.g., asbestos and lead paint) in older structures.\u201d Silvern goes on to state, \u201cThis construction and repair activity <em>may </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number><em>occur, </em>to one degree or another\u201d in every rental unit subject to inspection each year and <em>\u201cit is reasonable to </em>assume\u201d this construction and repair will occur in units needing \u201cmajor repair\u201d or which have \u201csevere\u201d physical problems which he estimates as approximately 100,000 rental units in the city of Los Angeles. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">We do not believe an expert\u2019s opinion which says nothing more than \u201cit is reasonable to assume\u201d that something \u201cpotentially . . . may occur\u201d constitutes the substantial evidence necessary to invoke an exception to a categorical exemption. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is defined in the CEQA guidelines to include \u201cexpert opinion supported by facts.\u201d It does not include \u201c[ajrgument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof an exemption trumps the city\u2019s finding of a categorical exception to CEQA review.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Lillie, P.
