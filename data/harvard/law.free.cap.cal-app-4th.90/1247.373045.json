Ahles, to reconsider an earlier order sustaining a demurrer to Ahles\u2019s complaint without leave to amend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Ahles had filed a complaint against 20th Century for breach of a contract of insurance, tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (bad faith) and fraud. The trial court\u2019s mling, which allowed her to go forward with her action and required 20th Century to file an answer, was based on the Legislature\u2019s enactment of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.9 (hereafter section 340.9).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This new statute, which became effective on January 1, 2001, revives, subject to certain conditions and limitations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>insurance claims <em>\u201carising out of </em>the Northridge earthquake of 1994\u201d that previously had been barred by \u201cthe applicable <em>statute </em>of limitations.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The trial court\u2019s application of section 340.9 to restore legal vitality to Ahles\u2019s complaint raises a number of important questions which we must address. After a review of this record, the legislative history of section 340.9, including the significant public policies it seeks to serve, and the relevant case law, we are persuaded that the new statute (1) does not impermissibly impair 20th Century\u2019s right of contract or deny it substantive due process by the destruction of vested contract rights, (2) embraces and applies to the 12-month \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations period included in 20th Century\u2019s policy as mandated by Insurance Code section 2071, (3) applies to all cases \u201cpending\u201d on the date the statute became effective, and (4) extends to Ahles\u2019s tort claim for bad faith, as well as her breach of contract cause of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In view of these conclusions, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s order of December 5, 2000, and deny 20th Century\u2019s writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">On January 17, 1994, Ahles was the owner of the residential property at 10727 Garfield Avenue in Culver City, California. She had a homeowners insurance policy issued by 20th Century (policy No. H07066432) which included, by endorsement, coverage for loss and damage caused by earthquake. The policy covered her home and other structures on the property. On January 17, a large earthquake, commonly known as the Northridge earthquake, struck Southern California and caused extensive damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">On or about May 1, 1994, Ahles reported to 20th Century that she had observed damage to her property which she believed was attributable to the Northridge earthquake. Three weeks later, 20th Century sent an adjuster to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>inspect the property and evaluate the damage. In July, 20th Century sent an engineer to further inspect the property, including Ahles\u2019s attic and the crawl space underneath her home. Based on those inspections, 20th Century determined the amount of damage to Ahles\u2019s home was less than the amount of her $11,100 deductible. It therefore made no payment to her for that damage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Approximately four years later, on August 27, 1998, Ahles had her home inspected for termites. According to Ahles\u2019s allegations, the termite inspector observed earthquake damage in the crawl space under her house. On or about September 15, 1998, she filed a supplemental claim for earthquake damage with 20th Century. In that claim, Ahles asserted that her home had sustained earthquake damage that had neither been discovered nor considered during 20th Century\u2019s adjustment of her original claim. Almost one year later, on July 15, 1999, 20th Century sent an adjuster to inspect Ahles\u2019s home and to investigate her new claim. The adjuster concluded that the damage claimed by Ahles was not caused by the earthquake. On that ground, and because Ahles had submitted her supplemental claim more than four years after the earthquake and the adjustment on her initial claim, 20th Century denied it. Ahles responded to this denial on August 26, 1999, by filing a complaint against 20th Century, alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">20th Century then sent engineers to inspect Ahles\u2019s house on October 26, 1999. The engineer\u2019s report apparently acknowledged that Ahles\u2019s home had sustained considerable damage, but blamed it on causes other than the earthquake. The report, however, also noted that the initial engineer\u2019s report had been incomplete in that it had failed to identify damage to the foundation and stucco, as well as other \u201cnon-earthquake\u201d problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">At proceedings held on March 23, 2000, the trial court sustained 20th Century\u2019s demurrer, but granted Ahles leave to amend her complaint. She did so, and added as an allegation in her first amended complaint a cause of action for fraud. When 20th Century again successfully demurred, Ahles was once more granted leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">After Ahles filed her second amended complaint on July 17, 2000, 20th Century again demurred. As one ground, 20th Century argued that Ahles\u2019s \u201centire action [was] barred by the one-year statute of limitations contained in the insurance policy.\u201d 20th Century\u2019s policy issued to Ahles contained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>provision stating that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought unless there has been compliance with the policy provisions and <em>the action is started within one year after the occurrence causing the loss or </em>damage(Italics added.) 20th Century contended, pursuant to this clause, that Ahles had only one year from denial of her 1994 claim to file suit. Her entire action was therefore untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">In response, Ahles asserted that in 1994 she was assured by three different 20th Century representatives that there had been no structural damage to her home and that if she discovered damage which exceeded her deductible, she could reopen her claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ahles argued she reasonably relied on these representations and, in 1998, when the termite inspector informed her of the damage under her house, Ahles believed she could make a claim. Ahles further alleged that \u201c20th Century\u2019s claims handling practices were improper, so much so that the Department of Insurance audit . . . found 75% of the Northridge earthquake claims were mishandled.\u201d Finally, Ahles alleged 20th Century had been guilty of bad faith and fraud in that it knowingly \u201clowball[ed],\u201d mishandled and improperly denied hers and numerous other claims pertaining to the Northridge earthquake. Under these circumstances, she contended, 20th Century waived and was estopped from asserting the one-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>At the hearing held on September 29, 2000, following which the trial court sustained 20th Century\u2019s demurrer to her second amended complaint without leave to amend, Ahles asked the court to take judicial notice of Senate Bill No. 1899 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.), a bill which had been passed by the California Legislature and was then awaiting the Governor\u2019s signature. The bill had been drafted to add section 340.9 to the Code of Civil Procedure. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">The trial court, recognizing that the Governor had not yet signed the bill, indicated the case was therefore controlled by the one-year limitations period in the insurance contract. Ahles had timely filed her 1994 claim and, although she argued her claim of delayed discovery of further earthquake damage was excusable, the court indicated that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the delay was justified.\u201d The trial court held that Ahles\u2019s complaint was time-barred and sustained 20th Century\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. In concluding the proceedings, however, the trial court stated, \u201cAnd of course, ... if the Governor signs a bill that is enacted into law, that is a ground for reconsideration under 1008 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">According to 20th Century, it served notice of the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining its demurrer without leave to amend and entering a judgment of dismissal on October 3, 2000. Ahles, however, asserts 20th Century never served her with a signed, file-stamped copy of the dismissal. The only copies received by Ahles were \u201cblank.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">On November 28, 2000, 56 days after the judgment of dismissal, Ahles made an ex parte application for a special setting of a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s October 3, 2000, ruling and \u201cto vacate\u201d that decision. Ahles indicated that \u201cunknown to . . . counsel and the court, the law [Senate Bill No. 1899] had . . . been signed into law on September 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>2000.\u201d Ahles brought the motion for reconsideration and to vacate judgment \u201cbased upon [the] new law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">On December 5, 2000, following a hearing, the trial court granted Ahles\u2019s motion for reconsideration pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, section 1008, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When 20th Century argued that Senate Bill No. 1899 would not be in effect until January of 2001, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019ll put it over to January . . . , conditionally granting the motion and overruling the demurrer on the statute of limitations ground, unless prior to January . . . 2001, that law is in some way effectively altered by way of amendment, ... or whatever other statutory or constitutional[] event may occur to nullify that law.\u201d The court set dates for hearings, a status conference and trial; Before the end of the hearing, counsel for 20th Century stated, \u201cA point of clarification, your honor. As I understand, the court\u2019s ruling is reviving the second amended complaint <em>in total. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) The trial court responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">20th Century\u2019s response to this ruling was to file the within petition seeking writ relief. It argues (both in its petition and in a subsequent brief filed in response to amicus briefing) that the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant reconsideration because (1) Ahles\u2019s application was not timely, (2) a judgment had been entered and (3) the time for appeal therefrom had expired. 20th Century also contends that the trial court\u2019s basis for granting relief to Ahles was flawed in that Senate Bill No. 1899 (\u00a7 340.9) (1) did not become law until <em>after </em>the trial court had ruled and thus could not serve as a basis for the court\u2019s ruling, (2) did not apply since Ahles\u2019s claim had already been \u201clitigated to finality,\u201d (3) is unconstitutional as an impermissible impairment of contract and constitutes destruction of \u201cvested\u201d contract rights in violation of the due process clause and, in any event, (4) does not apply to tori , claims asserted by an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">On February 28, 2001, we stayed all further proceedings in the trial court, issued an order to show cause and set the matter on calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Before turning to the critical questions concerning the proper construction, application and constitutional vitality of section 340.9, we must first address 20th Century\u2019s jurisdictional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>1. <em>The Trial Court Had Jurisdiction to Consider and Rule upon Ahles\u2019s Motion to Reconsider and to Vacate the Court\u2019s Order of September 29, 2000, and the Judgment of October 3, 2000</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">a. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Grant of Reconsideration After Entry of Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">20th Century first argues the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant Ahles\u2019s motion for reconsideration because judgment had been entered in the matter on October 3, 2000. 20th Century contends that, once a final judgment has been entered, a motion for reconsideration may not be entertained. In making this argument, 20th Century relies on the court\u2019s decision in <em>APRI Ins. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 171]. In <em>APRI, </em>the trial court signed an order granting a motion to quash and dismissing APRI from the action. It then granted a motion for reconsideration of the ruling on the motion to quash. APRI contended this was error and the appellate court agreed. The matter had been dismissed within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 581d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Once the dismissal was entered, the trial court had no jurisdiction to reconsider the motion to quash. The <em>APRI </em>court stated, \u201cThe trial court failed to observe the critical distinction between an order of dismissal, which is a judgment, and other orders. \u2018A court may reconsider its order granting or denying a motion and may even reconsider or alter its judgment so long as judgment has not yet been entered. Once judgment has been entered, however, the trial court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the judgment. It may correct judicial error only through certain limited procedures such as motions for new trial and motions to vacate the judgment. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d (76 Cal.App.4th at p. 181.) Here, 20th Century has provided a copy of a judgment of dismissal bearing an October 3, 2000 superior court file stamp and the trial judge\u2019s signature.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since it appears a final (i.e., appealable) judgment had been entered, we conclude the trial court could not grant Ahles\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The trial court, however, could have properly granted a motion for a new trial and, under certain circumstances, a motion to reconsider may be construed as one for a new trial. In <em>Passavanti </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1602 [275 Cal.Rptr. 887], the appellant argued that his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>for reconsideration should have been construed as a motion for a new trial or to vacate the judgment for purposes of determining when the time to file a notice of appeal had begun to run. The appellate court determined it was \u201ccompelled to treat the motion for reconsideration as a motion for new trial\u201d because two of its prior decisions had indicated such a procedure was appropriate. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1610.) The court stated, \u201cBecause of those decisions, we believe that good cause exists and fairness requires us to construe plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration in this case to be a motion for new trial or a motion to vacate the judgment . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although the <em>Passavanti </em>court indicated that, absent a showing of \u201cextremely good cause,\u201d it was \u201cdisinclined to engage in the practice of \u2018construing\u2019 motions and [would] hold counsel to the label they attach to their motions,\u201d it concluded such good cause had been shown. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">In the present case, Ahles designated her motion as one for \u201creconsideration and to <em>vacate </em>the decision of 10/3/00.\u201d (Italics added.)  However, as 20th Century has pointed out, a motion to vacate a judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 663 \u201c \u2018. . . does not contemplate merely the setting aside of the judgment, as does a motion for new trial or a motion for relief from default under C.C.P. 473. It expressly provides for <em>vacating the judgment and entering of another judgment. </em>Hence an order of vacation, without directing entry of a new judgment, is void\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ramirez v. Moran </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 431, 435 [247 Cal.Rptr. 117], original italics.)  Here, the trial court granted Ahles\u2019s motion, but failed to enter a new judgment. Moreover, under the circumstances presented, it would have been inappropriate to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Although Ahles labeled her motion as one for reconsideration or to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment of October 3, 2000, Ahles\u2019s purpose in making the motion was to restore the action to the trial court\u2019s calendar. In essence, Ahles made a motion for a new trial pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 657. Under that section, a \u201cverdict may be vacated and <em>any other decision may be modified or vacated, </em>in whole or in part, and a new or further trial granted on all or part of the issues, on the application of the party aggrieved, for any of the following causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of such party: HQ . . . [*[[] 7. Error in law, occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.\u201d (Italics added.) Here, it is arguable the trial court\u2019s decision (or entry of judgment) was based on an incorrect or erroneous understanding of the law; the court apparently believed it had the right to reconsider its October 3d ruling granting 20th Century\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. In addition, the trial court could arguably have relied on the pendency of Senate Bill No. 1899 to at least continue the matter until the statute became effective. (See \u00a7 340.9, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>We note that Ahles may properly bring a motion for new trial from a judgment of dismissal resulting from the sustaining of a demurrer. <em>(Carney v. Simmonds </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 84, 88, 90-91 [315 P.2d 305]; see <em>Finnie v. District No. 1 - Pacific Coast Dist. etc. Assn. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1315-1316 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 348].) Further, when treated as a motion for new trial, Ahles\u2019s motion is timely.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">Although we are, as was the court in <em>Passavanti, </em>generally disinclined to construe a motion as other than that which it has been labeled, \u201cextremely good cause\u201d exists for treating Ahles\u2019s motion as one for a new trial. <em>(Passavanti </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d at p. 1610.) At the proceedings held on September 29, 2000, after the trial court determined Ahles complaint was time-barred, it specifically stated that, should the Governor sign Senate Bill No. 1899, \u201cthat [would be] a ground for reconsideration under 1008 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d Notions of fairness indicate Ahles should be allowed to pursue her claim in view of the trial court\u2019s attitude and comments regarding the case; the trial court <em>invited </em>Ahles to make a motion for reconsideration if and when the Governor signed Senate Bill No. 1899. This invitation indicates the trial court considered its ruling to be subject to later modification. (Cf. <em>APRI Ins. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 185 [nothing in the record indicated the trial court\u2019s dismissal entered in favor of APRI was intended to be <em>without </em>prejudice].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Finally, had the trial court neither invited nor granted Ahles\u2019s motion, it is clear from the record before us that Ahles\u2019s would have filed a notice of appeal from the October 3, 2000 judgment. Had she done so, we would have had to consider, given the retroactive provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.9, subdivision (b) (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>the present questions by way of appeal. Instead, since the trial court\u2019s order necessarily precluded the filing of a notice of appeal, we may properly consider the issues raised by way of 20th Century\u2019s petition for a writ. The result of this case, however, will be no different simply because we review the matter on a writ rather than on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>b. <em>California Rules of Court, rule 2(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">20th Century next argues that, if notice of the judgment was served on October 3, 2000, then December 4 was the last day to file a notice of appeal and the last day the trial court had jurisdiction to grant any motion Ahles might have brought. \u201c[Wjhen a judgment becomes final by lapse of the time for appeal, the court [generally] has no further jurisdiction of the subject matter . . . .\u201d <em>(Mason &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Guarantee Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 132, 133 [74 Cal.Rptr. 669].) Accordingly, 20th Century argues, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2(a), that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion on December 5, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">California Rules of Court, rule 2(a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 870 or other statute or rule 3, a notice of appeal from a judgment shall be filed on or before the earliest of the following dates: (1) 60 days after the date of mailing by the clerk of the court of a document entitled \u2018notice of entry\u2019 of judgment; (2) 60 days after the date of service of a document entitled \u2018notice of entry\u2019 of judgment by any party upon the party filing the notice of appeal, or by the party filing the notice of appeal; or (3) <em>180 days after the date of entry of the </em>judgment.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">As we have already noted (see fn. 9, <em>ante), </em>20th Century has failed to establish that it served on Ahles a copy of the notice of entry of judgment before December 29, 2000, and there is no evidence in the exhibits to indicate the clerk mailed a copy of the notice of entry of judgment. Under these circumstances, the trial court had jurisdiction to consider Ahles\u2019s motion up to 180 days after October 3, 2000.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">2. <em>Section 340.9 Justified the Trial Court\u2019s Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"Azx\">a. <em>The Legislature\u2019s Power to Revive Barred Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">We begin our consideration of 20th Century\u2019s attack on section 340.9 by recognizing a well established principle of law. The Legislature is constitutionally free to revive a civil cause of action that has become time-barred under a former statute of limitations. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1885) 115 U.S. 620, 629-630 [6 S.Ct. 209, 214, 29 L.Ed. 483] [a law removing the bar of a statutory limitations defense <em>after </em>it has- been perfected is not unconstitutional]; see also <em>Chase Securities Corp. v.

In a case which rejected a due process challenge to a statute that retroactively extended the criminal statute of limitations for certain sex crimes, the <em>Frazer </em>court stated: \u201cThe holding of Chase\u2014that no constitutionally protected interest arises once a statute of limitations has run, and that such protection can be retroactively withdrawn consistent with due process\u2014has been reaffirmed by the high court in subsequent cases.

[A]s a supplier of a public service rather than a manufactured product, the obligations of insurers go beyond meeting reasonable expectations of coverage. The obligations of good faith and fair dealing encompass qualities of decency and humanity inherent in the responsibilities of a fiduciary. Insurers hold themselves out as fiduciaries, and with the public\u2019s trust must go private responsibility consonant with that trust.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Egan </em>v. <em>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 809, 820 [169 Cal.Rptr. 691, 620 P.2d 141], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>The <em>Egan </em>court recognized that the unequal relationship between the insured and insurers demanded special remedies for breach of that public trust, such as tort remedies for the failure to perform obligations promised in a policy and punitive damages. The court explained: \u201c[T]he relationship of insurer and insured is inherently unbalanced; the adhesive nature of insurance contracts places the insurer in a superior bargaining position. The availability of punitive damages is thus compatible with recognition of insurers\u2019 underlying public obligations and reflects an attempt to restore balance in the contractual relationship.\u201d <em>(Egan v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The significant public interest in the special relationship between the insured and insurer justifies the availability of tort remedies, and distinguishes insurance contracts from other types of contracts. Tort remedies remain unavailable in noninsurance contract cases. (See, e.g., <em>Cates Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Talbot Partners </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 28, 46 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 980 P.2d 407] [availability of tort remedies for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing not extended to noninsurance contracts since \u201cthe insurance policy cases represent \u2018a major departure from traditional principles of contract law\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Foley v.

So too, statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>which affect existing insurance contracts, enacted to promote the public interest, are invariably upheld as a reasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police power. (See, e.g., <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins.

It is clear that the state\u2019s significant public policy concerns for the less powerful insureds, which bolster its power to regulate this \u201cquasi-public\u201d business of insurance, also prompted the enactment of section 340.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">(2) <em>Legislative History of Section 340.9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">As the legislative history of section 340.9 underscores, the Legislature enacted section 340.9 to promote an important public policy: \u201cto bring needed relief to the victims of the Northridge earthquake.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1899 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 23, 2000, p. 2.) The committee found compelling reports of rampant mishandling of insurance claims by insurers, and the unavailability of relief from the former administration of the Department of Insurance: \u201cProponents contend that there are strong public policy reasons to protect quake victims under the circumstances of this bill. They state that thousands of people who suffered damage to their homes did not receive the benefit of their insurance contracts because of the insurance companies\u2019 conduct. They further assert that ample evidence exists to show that insurers handling Northridge earthquake claims engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent of damage to their homes. Later, when it became clear that the problems were indeed significant, proponents assert that the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become time-barred.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5.) \u201cTo compound problems, proponents note that when homeowners complained to the Department of Insurance to obtain relief, the department afforded no help. Thus, based on the circumstances surrounding the Northridge earthquake, proponents argue that there are sufficient public policy reasons to extend the statute of limitations and allow the homeowners to seek justice on their insurance claims.\u201d (Sen.

Although the language of both contracts clauses is facially absolute, it has been determined that their \u201cprohibition^] must be accommodated to the inherent police power of the State \u2018to safeguard the vital interests of its people.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Energy Reserves Group v.

In California, the insurance business \u201cis a highly regulated industry, and one in which further regulation can reasonably be anticipated.\u201d <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 805, 830; see fn. 19, <em>ante.) </em>The <em>Calfarm </em>court noted that by at least 1988, \u201cinsurers were well aware of the possibility that initiatives or ordinary legislation might be enacted that would affect existing policies.\u201d <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co., </em>at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In light of its past extensive exercise of legislative power over the insurance industry to help victimized insureds, insurers should reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>have expected the California Legislature to enact legislation designed to help insureds affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The court in <em>Wolfe v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 554 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 878], acknowledged as much when it dismissed an individual\u2019s injunctive relief action against insurers based on their refusal to sell any new homeowners policies in order to avoid providing earthquake coverage, deferring to the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent to deal with problems arising from the 1994 earthquake \u201cboth now and in the future.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 568.) The Legislature\u2019s enactment of section 340.9 to correct insurers\u2019 wrongful processing of Northridge earthquake claims should, have been reasonably expected, rendering the insurers\u2019 policies susceptible to alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The revival of barred claims for one year fails to rise to the level of an impairment of a contract, because it merely affects the remedy for the violation of the contract, not the obligations contained within it. (See <em>Home Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. v. Blaisdell </em>(1934) 290 U.S. 398, 445-448 [54 S.Ct. 231, 242-243, 78 L.Ed. 413, 88 A.L.R. 1481]; <em>Lincoln v. Superior Court </em>(1934) 2 Cal.2d 127, 129 [39 P.2d 405].) This is also true of section 340.9. It simply affects a remedy; it does not create or destroy any substantive rights.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court opined in <em>Campbell v. Holt, supra, </em>115 U.S. at page 628 [6 S.Ct. at page 213], the defense of the limitations bar is not a \u201cvested right,\u201d and a statute which revived a <em>contractual right </em>to payment which had already lapsed did not violate the contract clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Similarly, application of section 340.9 to settlement agreements entered into without California counsel does not substantially impair such contracts. The statute on its face does not declare the agreements null or void; it simply revives barred claims so that they can be further addressed. Indeed, the statute\u2019s reference to settlement agreements serves only to describe one of the circumstances where section 340.9 will <em>not </em>apply. The ultimate viability of those settlement agreements is not \u201cimpaired.\u201d Moreover, even if section 340.9 could be said to \u201csubstantially impair\u201d existing insurance contracts and settlement agreements, it may constitutionally do so to address a legitimate public purpose appropriately adjusted to the rights and responsibilities of the affected parties. <em>(Energy Reserves, supra, </em>459 U.S. 400, 411-413 [103 S.Ct. 406, 704-705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">For example, former Civil Code section 5124 (repealed effective Jan. 1, 1986) indisputably, yet legitimately, impaired final community property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>settlement agreements, judgments or decrees, to include a division of military retirement benefits. In <em>In re Marriage of Potter </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 73 [224 Cal.Rptr. 312], the court rejected due process and contract clause challenges to application of section 5124 to a final judgment previously stipulated to by the parties in light of \u201c[t]he \u2018paramount interest\u2019 of this state in the equitable distribution of marital property upon dissolution of marriage.\u201d (179 Cal.App.3d at p. 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">In <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371], the Supreme Court retroactively applied amended former Civil Code section 5118 to an existing interlocutory judgment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That section changed the husband\u2019s earnings and accumulations while living apart from community property to separate property. Acknowledging the statute, as amended, impaired the wife\u2019s <em>vested </em>property rights, acquired prior to the date of the amendment, the Supreme Court nonetheless concluded that \u201cthis use of the police power to abrogate rights in marital property that derived from the patently unfair former law\u201d justified the impairment. (16 Cal.3d at p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Legitimate state interest also may change contract provisions. For example, the <em>Energy Reserves </em>court upheld a Kansas act, which regulated prices in already existing contracts, as a reasonable exercise of its police power to \u201cprotect consumers from the escalation of natural gas prices caused by deregulation,\u201d observing that \u201chigher gas prices have caused and will cause hardship among those who use gas heat but must exist on limited fixed incomes.\u201d <em>(Energy Reserves, supra, </em>459 U.S. at pp. 416-417 [703 S.Ct. at p. 707].) In California, the Supreme Court in <em>Calf arm </em>upheld provisions of Proposition 103, which altered the terms of existing insurance policies so as only to allow cancellation of those contracts on certain, specified conditions, in order to continue to make insurance \u201c \u2018available\u2019 \u201d to Californians and avoid a potential crisis. <em>(Calfarm Ins. v. Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">The Legislature enacted section 340.9 to alleviate a broad and significant problem caused by the insurers\u2019 conduct; to help thousands of policyholders who were misled by the insurers into waiving their right to make claims in a timely manner. This purpose is backed by the power of the Legislature to protect California\u2019s citizens and provide for their general welfare and justifies any potential impairment of contract provisions. (See <em>Home Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, supra, </em>290 U.S. at p. 444 [54 S.Ct. at p. 242] [statute extending time for redemption from mortgage foreclosure sales was held to constitute a legitimate and substantial legislative purpose].)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>Finally, the revival of the statutory remedy is appropriately limited in time and application. Section 340.9 is only operative for the period of one year, and is limited to claims where the insurers had already been contacted prior to January 1, 2000, to claims not finally litigated, and to claims not settled through a California attorney. Special deference is granted to temporary statutes. (See <em>Home Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. &amp;. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, supra, </em>290 U.S. at p. 445 [54 S.Ct. at pp. 242-243].) When viewed with the proper legislative deference, this legislation does not impermissibly impair 20th Century\u2019s contract rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">(2) <em>No \u201cVested Contract Rights\u201d Are Destroyed in Violation of the Due Process Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">According to 20th Century, the retroactive application of section 340.9, subdivision (b), destroys its vested contractual right to repose following expiration of the contractual one-year limitations period. This argument, however, ignores what appears to be settled law. The \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations period in 20th Century\u2019s policy is mandated by statute (Ins. Code, \u00a7 2071). It is therefore properly treated as a <em>statute </em>of limitations which does <em>not, </em>upon its expiration, endow in the defendant a \u201cvested right.\u201d Insurance Code section 207l\u2019s mandated provisions are treated identically to statutes of limitations. (See <em>California Union Ins. Co. v. Poppy Ridge Partners </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 897, 903 [274 Cal.Rptr. 191].)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In <em>California Union, </em>the insurer failed to plead the one-year limitations period as an affirmative defense and argued that it was sufficient to claim that the insured had failed to satisfy the provisions of the contract. The court disagreed, explaining the insurer had \u201cadvanced no substantive, convincing reason for distinguishing [the contractual limitations period] from a statutory limitations period which is a personal privilege affecting the remedy only and waivable in advance, by contract, or by failure to plead it. . . For some purposes contractual and statutory limitations periods have been treated similarly. [Citation.] [The court] conclude[d] the contractual limitations period should be treated the same as a statutory one, as an affirmative defense that must be pled as such or is waived.\u201d <em>(California Union Ins.

(See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Flintkote Co. </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 727, 733 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>[218 Cal.Rptr. 562].) The <em>Nelson </em>court held a personal injury action could not be automatically extinguished by the mere passage of time, but rather that the \u201cstatute of limitations is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded by a defendant and ruled on by a court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 732.) In <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1375 [246 Cal.Rptr. 587], the court stated, \u201c[a] potential defendant has no vested right in the sense of repose conferred by his knowledge a lawsuit against him appears to be barred.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1383.) In other words, because the limitations period operates as an affirmative defense which is inoperative until certain conditions are met (i.e., it is properly plead and accepted by a court) it cannot be deemed a vested right. (See <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 583, 591, fn. 7, [\u201cW]e use the word vested here to describe property rights that are not subject to a condition precedent.\u201d].)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Second, even if the running of the limitations period created a vested right in defendant, such a right yields to important state interests, without any violation of due process. In <em>Addison v. Addison </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 558, 566 [43 Cal.Rptr. 97, 399 P.2d 897, 14 A.L.R.3d 391] the court indicated that: \u201c \u2018Vested rights, of course, may be impaired \u201cwith due process of law\u201d under many circumstances. The state\u2019s inherent sovereign power includes the so called \u201cpolice power\u201d right to interfere with vested property rights whenever reasonably necessary to the protection of the health, safety, morals, and general well being of the people. The annals of constitutional law are replete with decisions approving, as constitutionally proper, the impairing of, and even the complete confiscation of, property rights when compelling public interest justified it. HQ . . . HQ <em>The constitutional question, on principle, therefore, would seem to be, not whether a vested right is impaired by a marital property law change, but whether such a change reasonably could be believed to be sufficiently necessary to the public welfare as to justify the </em>impairment.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) The <em>Addison </em>court easily permitted impairment of vested property rights by the retroactive application of quasi-community legislation where it was justified by overriding societal concerns. In <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 583, 594, the court also upheld the impairment of a spouse\u2019s vested property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>rights by a community property statute retroactively applied due to the Legislature\u2019s intent to correct \u201crank injustice of . . . former law.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Similarly, in <em>Battle v. Kessler </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 853, 860 [197 Cal.Rptr. 170], the court permitted an amended statute to apply retroactively to previously barred claims, for the period of one year, because the Legislature acted \u201cto right a wrong.\u201d (See also <em>Lent, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1177 [applied Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 340.1 to previously barred claims.]; <em>Liebig, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 834 [applied newly enacted \u00a7 340.1, which extended the statute of limitations for child molestation cases to previously barred causes of action, because \u201cthe law is clear that vested rights are not immune from retroactive laws when an important state interest is at stake\u201d]; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Flintkote Co., supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">In enacting section 340.9, the Legislature took action to advance the public interest in protecting insureds mistreated by their insurers at a time when the insureds were most vulnerable. Section 340.9\u2019s protection of insureds reflects well-established legislative and judicial policy, and is buttressed by the Legislature\u2019s unique power to regulate the \u201cquasi-public\u201d business of insurance. Such legislative action is propelled by an \u201cimportant state interest\u201d and is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">d. <em>The Term \u201cStatute of Limitations\u201d as Used in Section 340.9, Embraces the Contractual Limitations Period Included in 20th Century\u2019s Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">An examination of Insurance Code section 2071 reflects that the Legislature, in statutorily dictating policy terms, has effectively changed the four-year limitations period which would otherwise apply to a suit on an insurance contract (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 337, subd. (1)). Because this statutory dictate results in a contractual provision, it is not incorrect to refer to it as the articulation of a \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations period. Accordingly, 20th Century argues that, because section 340.9 refers only to the \u201capplicable <em>statute </em>of limitations,\u201d it does not apply to the statutorily mandated \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations period included in its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>In the context of applying section 340.9, however, this is a thin semantical reed on which to hang the conclusion that the phrase used in that section, \u201capplicable <em>statute </em>of limitations\u201d (italics added) does not also include the statutorily mandated \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations period. To the contrary, it seems clear to us that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201capplicable statute of limitations\u201d to embrace the mandated contractual period. Indeed, that is the only limitations period applicable to the claims asserted by policyholders to which the statute is addressed. Since the obvious legislative purpose behind the enactment of section 340.9 was to bring relief to policyholders with claims under policies, <em>all of which contain the contractual limitations provision, </em>it would be absurd for us to adopt 20th Century\u2019s construction of this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">\u201cWhile it is not the prerogative of the judiciary to rewrite legislation to conform to a <em>presumed </em>intent [citation] the [California] Supreme Court reminds us that the primary purpose of statutory construction is for the courts to determine and effectuate the purpose of the law as enacted: \u2018The fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] In order to determine this intent, we begin by examining the language of the statute. [Citations.] But \u201c[i]t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u201d [Citations.] Thus, \u201c[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u201d [Citation.] Finally, we do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u201cwith reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McLaughlin v.

State Bd. of Education, supra, </em>75 Cl.App.4th 196 the court was called upon to interpret Proposition 227, the \u201c \u2018English Language in Public Schools\u2019 \u201d initiative statute. (75 Cal.App.4th 196 at p. 201.) The initiative enacted a statutory scheme which required California public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>schools to teach children with limited English proficiency only in English. The <em>McLaughlin </em>court was asked to determine, in view of the fact that Proposition 227 was silent on the matter, whether the initiative was subject to a provision in Education Code section 33050, which generally allows schools to apply for waivers from such program requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">After thoroughly reviewing the history of both Proposition 227 and Education Code section 33050, the court concluded that the respondent school boards could not, under section 33050, apply for waivers from the requirements of the statutory scheme enacted by Proposition 227. <em>(McLaughlin </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Education, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 202.) The court determined that \u201c[t]o the extent there [was] any ambiguity as to the intent of Proposition 227, the legislative history clarifie[d] that the Chapter was designed to wrest from school boards and administrators decisionmaking authority for selecting between [limited English proficiency] educational options, and repose this power exclusively in parents of [limited English proficiency] students.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">In the present case, our review of the legislative history makes it clear that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201capplicable statute of limitations\u201d to embrace the mandated contractual period. During the legislative process, Senate Bill No. 1899 was amended to provide, \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law <em>or contract, . . . </em>,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Clearly, the Legislature sought to revive the time bar created by the one-year limitations period contained in policies providing insurance coverage for the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Given the obvious and universally appreciated fact that every claimant to be benefited by section 340.9 has a one-year limitations period in his or her insurance policy, and it was the bar created by that one-year clause (upon which insurers had relied in denying claims) that the Legislature sought to address, it would be folly to conclude that the Legislature intended to make a distinction between \u201cstatutory\u201d and \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations periods when it enacted section 340.9. In this context, the use of the term, \u201capplicable <em>statute of </em>limitations\u201d was simply a generic reference to the limitations period that the Legislature intended to reach by its enactment of section 340.9. Such generic use of the term was no different than the \u201clawyer\u2019s shorthand\u201d utilized by 20th Century itself when it demurred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>Ahles\u2019s pleadings on the ground that the <em>\u201cstatute </em>of limitations <em>contained in the insurance </em>policy\u201d had expired.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Any other interpretation would not only fail to conform to the spirit of section 340.9, but would lead to an absurd result. The legislative history of section 340.9 indicates the statute was enacted to \u201cbring needed relief to the victims of the Northridge earthquake.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1988 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 23, 2000, p. 2.) Since all the victims\u2019 policies contain the one-year <em>contractual </em>limitations period, to interpret section 340.9 as not applying to that limitations period would, in effect, completely nullify the statute. Accordingly, we conclude the Legislature\u2019s failure to refer to a \u201ccontractual\u201d limitations period can only be attributed to \u201c \u2018drafters\u2019 oversight.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McLaughlin v. State Bd. of Education, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Our conclusion is bolstered by the court\u2019s decision in <em>California Union Ins. Co. v. Poppy Ridge Partners, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d 897. There, the court determined that, to rely on the expiration of a contractual limitations period as a defense, the defendant was required to raise it in his or her answer, just as he or she would be required to raise a statutory limitations period. The court noted that the defendant had advanced \u201cno substantive, convincing reason for distinguishing [the contractual limitations period] from a statutory limitations period . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 903.) Just like a statutory limitations period, the contractual limitations period mandated by Insurance Code section 2071 could be waivable in advance by contract or a failure to plead it. (224 Cal.App.3d at p. 903.) The court recognized that, \u201c[f]or some purposes contractual and statutory limitations periods have been treated similarly.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The construction and application of section 340.9 renders it a statute which necessitates the statutorily required contractual limitation to be equated with a statutory limitation. For purposes of a proper reading of section 340.9, they are the same and should be so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>e. <em>Ahles\u2019s Claim Was Not \u201cLitigated to Finality\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Code of Civil Procedure section 340.9, subdivision (d)(1) provides that revival of the limitations period does not apply to claims which have been \u201clitigated to finality in <em>any </em>court of competent jurisdiction prior to [January 1, 2001].\u201d (Italics added.) In California, however, \u201c[a]n action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal, or until the time for appeal has passed . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1049.)  Thus, a judgment in California is not final for all purposes until \u201call possibility of direct attack thereon by way of (1) appeal, (2) motion for a new trial, or (3) motion to vacate the judgment has been exhausted.\u201d <em>(Southern Public Utilities Dist. v. Silva </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 163, 165 [301 P.2d 841]; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Judgment, \u00a7 7, p. 544); see also <em>McKee v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 282, 286 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 286].) In <em>McKee, </em>the court interpreted Insurance Code section 11580, subdivision (b)(2), which requires that every insurance policy contain a provision providing that an action may be brought on the policy after final judgment against the insured has been entered. The court interpreted section 11580, subdivision (b)(2), as meaning that \u201cthe statute and the standard policy language permit an action against an insurer only when the underlying judgment is final and \u2018final,\u2019 for this purpose, means an appeal from the underlying judgment has been concluded or the time within which to appeal has passed.\u201d <em>(McKee </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 285.) Thus, in this sense, the courts speak of \u201cfinality\u201d for <em>res judicata </em>purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">By <em>not </em>using the ambiguous term, \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d but rather limiting the exception to cases which have been \u201clitigated to finality,\u201d the Legislature has in our view, made it clear that it intends section 340.9 to apply to all cases which have not been finally decided <em>on appeal. </em>Thus, the Legislature has emphasized its intention that \u201cfinality\u201d in the res judicata sense is required before section 340.9, subdivision (d)(l)\u2019s exception will apply. Indeed, by not using the word \u201cjudgment\u201d in section 340.9, subdivision (d)(1), the Legislature avoided any suggestion that a \u201cfinal\u201d (for notice of appeal purposes) trial court judgment might make section 340.9 inapplicable. Thus, \u201c \u2018the settled rule in California . . . that a judgment is not final so long as an appeal is pending therefrom\u2019 \u201d applies here <em>(McKee v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 286, quoting <em>Jennings v. Ward </em>(1931) 114 Cal.App. 536, 537 [300 P. 129]), and section 340.9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>subdivision (d)(1), does not bar the revived statute of limitations available under section 340.9 from applying to this action.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">We therefore reject 20th Century\u2019s argument that the statute\u2019s reference to claims litigated to finality in <em>any </em>court of competent jurisdiction would apply to the trial court\u2019s earlier order sustaining 20th Century\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. While the superior court certainly is a court of competent jurisdiction, for the reasons discussed above, we cannot construe the statutory language so narrowly. Litigated finality must be read to mean a final judgment in the res judicata sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">f. <em>The Revival of Section 340.9 Extends to Ahles\u2019s Bad Faith Tort Claim but Not to Her Fraud Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Section 340.9 revives <em>\u201cany insurance claim </em>for damages <em>arising out of </em>the Northridge earthquake\u201d which is barred as of January 1, 2001, <em>solely </em>because the applicable statute of limitations has expired. Thus, the express language of the statute applies not only to contract damage claims, but also to tort claims for insurer bad faith (i.e., a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing). To determine the intent of statutory language \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(J.C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M.K. </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1009, 1020 [278 Cal.Rptr. 64, 804 P.2d 689].) A claim based on an insurer\u2019s breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is <em>implied in every policy of insurance </em>is clearly within the plain meaning of the phrase <em>\u201cany insurance claim . . . arising out of. . . </em>.\u201d (\u00a7 340.9, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Moreover, the plain reading of the statute\u2019s words comports with the legislative intent in enacting this law. The legislative history reveals \u201callegations of widespread abuse by insurers who . . . may have committed numerous acts of bad faith by denying the legitimate claims of potentially thousands of Northridge earthquake victims.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1899 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 23, 2000, pp. 2-3.) The \u201ccompanies repeatedly low-balled claims, failed to inform policyholders of their benefits and forced many claimants to sue to get full payment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3.) \u201cAccording to the author, SB 1899 seeks to provide these individuals, who . . . were victimized twice (once by the earthquake and a second time by their insurance companies) with a reasonable \u2018second chance\u2019 to seek redress for their damages.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Inclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>tort claims in section 340.9 furthers the legislative purpose \u2022 that victims obtain damages for their insurers\u2019 misconduct. \u201cThe availability of tort remedies in the limited context of an insurer\u2019s breach of the covenant advances the social policy of safeguarding an insured in an inferior bargaining position who contracts for calamity protection, not commercial advantage.\u201d <em>(Kransco </em>v. <em>American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390, 400 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 151, 2 P.3d 1], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Finally, the Legislature contemplated that the new law would revive claims barred by the insurance policies\u2019 one-year limitations provision, the minimum limitations period set by Insurance Code section 2071.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Case law has likewise applied that same one-year limitations provision to claims for insurers\u2019 breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (See, e.g., <em>Jang </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1301 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 917] [holding that \u201c[r]egardless of whether the insured elects to file a complaint alleging solely tort claims ... an action seeking damages recoverable under the policy for a risk insured under the policy is merely a \u2018transparent attempt to recover <em>on the </em>policy\u2019 \u201d (original italics)]; <em>Velasquez </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 712, 722 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] [opining that a \u201cbad faith action based on denial of a claim in the underlying policy is an action on the policy\u201d]; <em>Prieto v.

Co., supra, </em>204 Cal.App.3d at p. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">With respect to Ahles\u2019s fraud claim, however, we reach the opposite conclusion. While we are persuaded that bad faith claims that are <em>seeking damages recoverable under the policy, </em>such as those presented in <em>Jang, Velasquez, Prieto, Abari and Lawrence, </em>have the same limitations period applicable to claims for breach of contract, and constitute <em>insurance claims, </em>the rationale which justifies that conclusion has no application to Ahles\u2019s fraud claim. Her action for fraud does not rest on 20th Century\u2019s failure to perform under the policy, but rather on its alleged acts of deceit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>deception that go well beyond simple nonperformance. That the purpose of such alleged fraudulent behavior may have been to evade performance under the policy does not alter the conclusion that an entirely separate act of misconduct has been alleged. In addition, Ahles does not seek damages recoverable under the policy, but rather damages arising from 20th Century\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and Ahles\u2019s reliance, including such things as out of pocket premium expense, lost opportunity damages and recovery for resulting emotional distress. For these reasons, we do not perceive Ahles\u2019s fraud claim as an <em>\u201cinsurance claim for damages\u201d </em>as that term is used in section 340.9. Therefore, Ahles\u2019s fraud claim remains subject to the three-year limitation period set out in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, and her claim, if expired under that statute, will not be revived by section 340.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The order to show cause heretofore issued is discharged.

On or about the end of January 1994, defendant 20th Century widely disseminated a letter to its insureds and the general populace regarding common questions asked concerning earthquake coverage. This letter indicated that if damage to an insured\u2019s property appeared cosmetic only but was later discovered to be more severe that 20th Century should be called only at that time. The letter further indicated that anytime additional damage was discovered that 20th Century should be contacted and the claim would be reopened to see if a supplemental damage payment [was] warranted. The letter further indicated that 20th Century would pay for inspections to make certain the property was safe to live in. Finally, concerning \u2018formalizing\u2019 a claim the letter indicated that 20th Century would let its insureds know anything that was needed, but they wanted to keep the process as simple as possible.\u201d (The record, however, does not contain a copy of this letter.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b982-7\">These allegations raise another issue which we do not have to reach in light of our focus on the impact of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.9: \u201cWhere an insured presents a timely claim to his insurer for property damage under a policy, and the insurer\u2019s agent inspects the property but does not discover the full extent of covered damage, does California Insurance Code \u00a7 2071 [and its one-year limitations period used in all relevant insurance contracts, including 20th Century\u2019s,] bar a claim brought by the insured more than one year after the damage was sustained but within one year of his [or her] discovery of the additional damage?\u201d <em>(Vu </em>v. <em>Prudential Property &amp; Cas.

Applicable statutes are deemed part of the policy even if not specifically mentioned in the insurance contract. <em>(Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Employees\u2019 Ins.

See, for example, Insurance Code section 10089.70 (directing Department of Insurance to establish a program for the mediation of disputes between insureds and their insurers arising out of the Northridge earthquake, and any later earthquakes); Revenue and Taxation Code section 19132.5, subdivision (a) (exempting victims of Northridge earthquake from certain tax penalties); Revenue and Tax Code section 69, subdivision (a) (allowing a longer period for transfer of base-year value to comparable property for victims of Northridge earthquake than victims of other disasters); Education Code section 67359.20 (appropriating $75 million in bond funds for repair and replacement of buildings for the University of California, the California State University, and California Community Colleges arising out of Northridge earthquake).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">As the Supreme Court in <em>Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654 observed: \u201c \u2018[J]ust as the law of contracts fails to provide adequate principles for construing the terms of an insurance policy, the substantial body of law uniquely applicable to insurance contracts is practically irrelevant to commercially oriented contracts. . . .
