The defendant's trial began on 16 August 2004 and on 3 September 2004, the jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder. Following a sentencing hearing, the court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that there was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence tends to show the following facts. In 1991 or 1992, Brent Turner and a friend went to defendant's home and began harassing defendant's ex-wife's brother. When defendant went outside to see what was happening, Turner ran over defendant\n   with his car and after defendant got up and chased the car, Turner's companion shot defendant twice, causing serious injury. Although defendant won a $120,000 civil judgment against Turner, he had never been able to collect anything on it. Thereafter, defendant felt that when he saw Turner, that Turner would \"always smile at [defendant] and stuff, like, well, I got away with it or whatever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the morning of 8 May 2003, defendant drank three or four beers before leaving for work at 6:00 a.m. He took to work eight or nine beers in a cooler, which was empty when he returned home. He also stopped and drank some \"white liquor\" with a friend on his way home. Once home, he had another four or five beers. Around 6:00 p.m., defendant's live-in girlfriend, Barbara Langston, drove defendant, defendant's brother, and her children to Popeye's Gas and Grill, a local gas station and convenience store. As they were leaving Popeye's, Turner was pulling in on his red moped, and as he passed Langston's car, he \"flipped [defendant] the bird\" and yelled \"f____ you\" at him. Defendant yelled \"f____ you\" back at Turner. Langston began driving to her father's house for a cookout and defendant twice stated that he \"ought to shoot the motherf.\" Langston testified that after she turned onto Branch Chapel Church Road, defendant demanded that she stop the car and let him out; he threatened to \"beat [her] ass\" if she did not. Langston complied and defendant got out, got his gun from the trunk, and Langston handed him a Busch beer at his request. She left him standing on the side of Branch Chapel Church Road with the gun in his hand. Langston later told a detective that she thought defendant was going to shoot Turner. The State presented evidence that the most direct route from Popeye's to Turner's house was via Branch Chapel Church Road and that defendant was aware of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, a resident of Branch Chapel Church Road testified that on 8 May 2003, around 6:15 or 6:30 p.m., she was in her yard and just after she saw a man drive by on a moped, she heard two gunshots. The moped was later found 25 to 50 feet from her driveway. At about 6:30 p.m., a citizen saw a moped on the road and Turner on the side of the road. Turner's face from \"his nose down to his chin, was gone.\" The citizen called 911 and rescue workers arrived shortly before 7:00 p.m. and transported Turner to the hospital. Turner died several days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detectives and a crime scene investigator from the Johnston County Sheriff's office arrived at the crime scene beginning around 7:15 p.m. They found a Busch beer can, a pair of sunglasses, and an empty 12-gauge shotgun shell casing in the woods near where Turner was found. They also saw muddy footprints made by bare feet. Forensic testing revealed defendant's fingerprint on the sunglasses and his DNA on the beer can. About two weeks later, a logger found a shotgun in the wooded area near the crime scene. Forensic examination could not determine that the casing found by the side of the road or the pellets removed from Turner came from this gun, but did reveal that the gun had been fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Detectives Scott Richardson and Bengie Gaddis of the Johnston County Sheriff's office left the crime scene at around 11:30 p.m. to return to Selma, they saw the defendant walking down the road barefooted. He had scratches all over his body, was very dirty, and was staggering. The officers recognized defendant and observed that he was very intoxicated. They placed him in handcuffs and took him to jail for \"detox purposes,\" \"to sober up.\" The next morning defendant was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, and attempted murder. Defendant remained in custody and on 12 May 2003 after Turner died, he was charged with first-degree murder. While at the Johnston County Detention Center, defendant made incriminating statements over the phone to Langston and to his brother which were recorded, pursuant to jail policy. Inmates receive an informational handbook regarding this policy, notices are posted in the cell blocks notifying defendants that their telephone calls are monitored, and before being connected, both the caller and the person being called hear a recorded warning that \"all calls are subject to monitoring and recording,\" except for \"attorney calls.\" Defendant's\n   recorded statements that he shot Turner were introduced by the State at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, defendant did not testify and presented only one witness: Dr. Katayoun Tabrizi, a psychiatrist. She testified that in her opinion, defendant suffered from alcohol dependence and personality changes after a previous head trauma. She opined that these conditions caused loss of impulse control and that on 8 May 2003 defendant \"would have been severely impaired in knowing what he was doing, what he was doing would result in .... some consequences.\" Tabrizi also testified that defendant told her that he shot Turner and that \"I just wanted to shoot him just as they shot me.\" He also told her that he did not intend to kill Turner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant first argues that the trial court committed constitutional error when it permitted his recorded telephone conversations to be used against him. Defendant argues that his initial seizure and incarceration violated his Fourth, Fourteenth, and Sixth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. We disagree. We note at the outset that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [a] violation of the defendant's rights under the Constitution of the United States is prejudicial unless the appellate court finds that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden is upon the State to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(b) (2005). The State asserts that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, in light of the other evidence against defendant and his own concession at trial, through counsel, that he shot Mr. Turner. However, defendant was charged with first-degree murder by premeditation, deliberation, and lying in wait, and defense counsel was arguing for the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, based on lack of evidence of specific intent to kill, premeditation or deliberation, and lying in wait. Thus, we cannot conclude that the court's admitting defendant's recorded statement, \"Why'd I do it? The mother f____ shot me didn't he ... I shot his God damn ass back,\" was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We do conclude, though, that the trial court did not err, as the statement was not obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the North Carolina Constitution grant persons the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. Here, defendant was initially seized pursuant to a public intoxication statute and defendant argues that because the statutory requirements were not met, that the seizure violated his constitutional rights. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-303 (2002) provides, in pertinent part, that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   an officer may assist an individual found intoxicated in a public place by directing or transporting that individual to a city or county jail. That action may be taken only if the intoxicated individual is apparently in need of and apparently unable to provide for himself food, clothing, or shelter but is not apparently in need of immediate medical care and if no other facility is readily available to receive him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the evidence shows that defendant was observed staggering, barefoot, dirty, and very scratched up on the shoulder of a highway in an isolated area late at night, we conclude that he was \"apparently in need of and apparently unable to provide for himself\" clothing and possibly shelter. Defendant has not argued that there was no other facility available to receive him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Town of Southern Pines,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8525419\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/116/663/\">\n    116 N.C.App. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=449%20S.E.2d%20240\">\n    449 S.E.2d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994),\n   <em>\n    disc. review denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2556426,2559318,2557847,2557592,2559291\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/339/737/\">\n    339 N.C. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20S.E.2d%20648\">\n    454 S.E.2d 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), in support of his argument that the statutory requirements were not met. In addition to being a civil rather than a criminal case, we conclude that the facts of\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   make it readily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Davis,\n   </em>\n   the Court concluded that N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 122C-303 did not allow police to take a woman to jail after police saw her stumble on the sidewalk, approached her, and offered assistance which she refused.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20S.E.2d%20648\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20S.E.2d%20648\">\n    at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=449%20S.E.2d%20240\">\n    449 S.E.2d at 245-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, when approached by the police, Davis stated she was going to call a cab to take her home and her sister, who was with her, offered to call a cab and take care of her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=449%20S.E.2d%20240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant suggests that Officer Gaddis was required to transport defendant to his and Langston's\n   home because he allegedly knew where they lived. But the statute plainly states that an officer may take an intoxicated person home, just as an officer may take an intoxicated person to jail if the conditions described above are met. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 122C-303. We overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant also argues that his detention deprived him of his \"liberty interest in seeking counsel,\" in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights. Defendant cites no case law in support of his contention that the Fourteenth Amendment confers such a right and we conclude that this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant correctly asserts that under the Sixth Amendment, a person charged with a crime is entitled to counsel.\n   <em>\n    See Powell v. Alabama,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n    287 U.S. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n    53 S.Ct. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n    77 L.Ed. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169 (1932). Defendant also correctly notes that this right to counsel attaches before the commencement of trial, as the accused \"requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n    at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n    53 S.Ct. at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369864\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p66\">\n    77 L.Ed. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant contends that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by the delay in the appointment of counsel and because he made incriminating statements over the jail phone before he was afforded the \"guiding hand of counsel.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Police initially detained defendant for detoxification in the late evening of 8 May 2003. The next morning, on 9 May 2003, defendant was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury and attempted murder, and he requested counsel after police advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. At his first appearance on those charges, on 12 May 2003, the court appointed Indigent Defense Services (\"IDS\") as counsel. Later in the day on 12 May 2003, defendant was charged with first-degree murder. Defendant made his first appearance on the murder charge on 13 May 2003, at which time the court again noted that counsel was to be appointed. Defendant met with appointed counsel on 14 May 2003. On 10 May 2003, defendant made incriminating statements on the jail phone, which were recorded and introduced by the State at trial. Defendant asserts that the State deliberately denied him the \"guiding hand of counsel\" during this time so that it could exploit a situation \"likely to induce [defendant] to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant does not dispute that he received a timely first appearance or that at that appearance the court appointed IDS to represent him. The IDS attorney met with defendant two days after his first appearance on the initial charges and one day after he was charged with murder.

Our careful review of the record indicates that although Detective Gaddis told Barbara Langston some facts about the crime which she later discussed with defendant over the jail phone, Langston was not acting as an agent of, or informant for, the State. Indeed, defendant does not allege that Langston acted at the request of the State, and Detective Gaddis denied that he gave Langston information about the case in order to deliberately elicit incriminating statements from defendant. We overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant also argues that the court violated his constitutional and statutory rights to have a reasonable bail set.

Defendant concedes that the determination of what a \"reasonable\" bond is rests within the trial court's discretion. However, he argues that when the court set the bond as \"no bond\" and \"zero\", it failed to exercise its discretion. As defendant was charged with first-degree murder, a capital offense, the trial court had the discretion not to set bail. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-533(c);\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the evidence tends to show that there was a history of violence and hostility between the parties. The evidence also shows that on the night of the shooting, the victim, Turner, saw defendant as he was leaving a convenience store. As Turner left, he \"flipped [defendant] the bird\" and shouted \"f____you,\" at him. Defendant then yelled \"f____ you\" at Turner. After defendant and his girlfriend, Langston, left the store, defendant twice told Langston that \"he ought to shoot the motherf____.\" He then told her to stop the car and let him out, whereupon he got a beer and a \"big gun\" from the trunk. She left him on the side of the Branch Chapel Church Road with the gun in his hands at shortly after 6:00 p.m. She told Detective Gaddis that at that time she thought defendant was going to shoot Turner. Turner was shot on Branch Chapel Church Road at around 6:15 or 6:30 p.m. A shotgun shell casing, a beer can with defendant's DNA on it, and a pair of sunglasses with defendant's fingerprint on them were found in a bush nearby. Also, as discussed, defendant stated that he shot Turner because Turner had shot him. The State's medical examiner testified that Turner died as a result of shotgun wounds that were fired from a distance of more than two, but less than four or five feet distance. We conclude that, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation, or lying in wait, and the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court committed constitutional error when it denied his motions to dismiss and for a mistrial for discovery violations by the State. We disagree. Although N.C. Gen.

The Court is going to allow the defendant some additional time to review that evidence and to determine if experts are needed and, if so, to make contact with those experts.\" The court then suggested to defendant's trial counsel that he use the afternoon to determine the availability of experts. Counsel and the trial court then discussed the anticipated dates of the State's expert witnesses. Given the trial court's attention to the State's discovery violation, and its willingness to allow the defendant time to contact experts, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.
