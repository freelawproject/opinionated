Because assuming an unexpired lease in bankruptcy did not create a new obligation between the parties to the original lease, we find that the statute of limitations as to the sureties' obligations began to run from the time of the principal obligor's initial default and did not commence anew when the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan was confirmed. Thus, we will reverse the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Havana '59, Ltd. (Havana) opened a restaurant in Richmond, Virginia in 1994. As part of its business operations, Havana entered into four equipment lease agreements with United Leasing Corporation (United). The lease agreement at issue in this appeal bears the date of September 21, 1994 and has the designation of \"Lease No. 3084.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that agreement, Havana leased from United \"Restaurant Equipment, Furniture and Smallwares.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In two separate but identical documents, each titled \"GUARANTY,\" The Restaurant Company and Rochelle Holding Company (the Sureties), guaranteed the performance of Havana's obligations under Lease No. 3084.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part, each agreement stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [T]he Undersigned [meaning The Restaurant Company in one agreement and Rochelle Holding Company in the other agreement] jointly and severally unconditionally guarantee to [United] the full and prompt performance by [Havana] ... of all obligations which [Havana] presently or hereafter may have to [United] and payment when due of all sums presently or hereafter owing by [Havana].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the purpose of this guaranty and indemnity, all sums owing to [United] by [Havana] shall be deemed to have become immediately due and payable if (a) [Havana] defaults in any of its obligations to [United]; (b) a petition under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, as amended, or for the appointment of a receiver of any part of the property of [Havana] be filed against [Havana] ...; (c) such a petition be filed by [Havana].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This shall be a continuing guaranty and indemnity and, irrespective of the lack of any notice to or consent of [the Sureties], their obligations hereunder shall not be impared [sic] in any manner whatsoever. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Notice of your acceptance hereof, of default and non-payment by [Havana] or any other parties, of presentment, protest and demand, and of all other matters of which [Restaurant Company or Rochelle Holding Company] otherwise might be entitled, is waived.[\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Havana suffered from financial difficulties early in its operation, and first defaulted on its obligations under Lease No. 3084 in 1994. It continued to default on those obligations through at least 2002. In October 1996, Havana filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 1174 (1994 &amp; Supp. I 1996). The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia confirmed Havana's Second Amended Plan of Reorganization in September 1997. Regarding Lease No. 3084, Havana's bankruptcy plan stated, \"[t]he second [United] lease ... calls for monthly payments of $1,111.85 for 60 months. The Debtor is current on this lease and will assume it in its entirety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because Havana continued to default on Lease No. 3084 after confirmation of its bankruptcy plan, United filed an amended motion for judgment against Havana, the Sureties, and Michael J. Ripp for the amounts due and owing under all four leases, plus attorney's fees and costs. As an affirmative defense, the defendants asserted that the applicable statute of limitations barred the action. The case proceeded to a bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With regard to the statute of limitations issue before us, the circuit court, in a letter opinion, concluded that the Uniform Commercial Code governed the leases in question, and that the applicable limitations period was four years from the date of breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 8.2A-506(1). To decide when the applicable statute of limitations commenced to run, the circuit court looked to Havana's Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan. The court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   the effect of Havana[]'s recommitment to the United ... leases under its Second Amended Reorganization Agreement ... is that the [s]tatute of [l]imitations on each lease specifically referred to in the Reorganization Agreement began to run again as if a new lease had been signed as of the date of that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court viewed Havana's \"recommitment to the leases as a complete recommitment including the guarantor's obligations.\" Thus, the circuit court determined that the four-year statute of limitations on Lease No. 3084 commenced to run at the time of the first default after Havana's Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan was confirmed on September 3, 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The circuit court then decided that, per the lease agreements, a default occurred when Havana failed to timely pay an installment on a lease and United then charged a late fee. With regard to Lease No. 3084, the court concluded that the first post-bankruptcy default happened when United assessed a late fee on September 30, 1997 and that, therefore, United's filing of its motion for judgment on September 14, 2001, was within the four-year statute of limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After considering the evidence, the circuit court, as to Lease No. 3084, entered judgment against the Sureties in the amount of $88,769.20, plus attorney's fees in the amount of $17,753.84.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the Sureties assert, among other things, that the circuit court erred in finding that United's claim against them under Lease No. 3084 was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   To decide that issue, we must examine the nature of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and determine whether the assumption of an unexpired lease creates a new obligation between the parties to the original lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Relying on a leading bankruptcy law treatise, the circuit court concluded the \"[s]tatute of [l]imitations on each lease specifically referred to in the Reorganization Agreement began to run again as if a new lease had been signed as of the date of that agreement.\" In relevant part, that treatise states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If an executory contract or unexpired lease is assumed after the case is commenced, the assumption creates a new administrative obligation of the estate. Thus, a breach of the obligations after assumption gives rise to an administrative claim of first priority. Further, in a ... Chapter 11 ... case, an assumed obligation is a postpetition obligation that is not discharged, and which therefore continues to be an obligation of the reorganized debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2 William L. Norton, Jr., Norton Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice 2d \u00a7 39:27, at p. 39-87 (1997). The circuit court's decision turned on its view that assuming an unexpired lease in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan was tantamount to executing a new lease. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its most basic sense, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding allows a debtor to reorganize its business, while continuing to operate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See In re Chateaugay Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256468\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/130/162/#p166\">\n    130 B.R. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (S.D.N.Y.1991); 7 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1100.01 (Alan N. Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer, eds., 15th ed. rev. 2005). The Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession must file a reorganization plan that enables it to continue its business and to emerge from bankruptcy as a viable concern.\n   <em>\n    See Kane v.

It does this by allowing a debtor to attempt to reorganize rather than fold and by creating incentives for creditors to continue to do business with the debtor while reorganization proceeds. The Code does this, at least in part, by assuring these post-bankruptcy creditors that, if the debtor fails to rehabilitate itself and winds up in liquidation, they can move to the front of the distributive line, ahead of the debtor's pre-bankruptcy creditors. Special priority is therefore accorded to expenses incurred under new contracts with the debtor, as \"administrative expenses\" of the estate. The same priority is given to expenses arising under pre-existing contracts that the debtor \"assumes\" - contracts whose benefits and burdens the debtor decides, with the bankruptcy courts approval, are worth retaining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    In re Klein Sleep Products, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94786,6463123\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/18/\">\n    78 F.3d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (2d Cir.1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"The rights created by assumption of the lease constitute a post-petition administrative claim under section 503(b)(1)(A) of the [United States Bankruptcy] Code.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Greystone III Joint Venture,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6527299,10519013\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1274/\">\n    995 F.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1281 (5th Cir.1991). A claim is deemed administrative and thus entitled to priority status upon distribution of the bankruptcy estate \"only if it arises out of a transaction between the creditor and the bankrupt's trustee or debtor-in-possession, and only to the extent that the consideration supporting the claimant's right to payment was both supplied to and beneficial to the debtor-in-possession in the operation of the business.\"\n   <em>\n    Trustees of the Amalgamated Ins.

Contrary to the circuit court's finding, assumption of Lease No. 3084 by the debtor-in-possession was not equivalent to the execution of a new lease by Havana. Nothing about the terms of Lease No. 3084 changed; the debtor-in-possession assumed the lease in its entirety. The fact that an assumed, pre-petition unexpired lease is treated the same as a new, post-petition lease, for purposes of establishing the priority of payments from the bankruptcy estate in the event the reorganization is unsuccessful, did not transform the assumed Lease No. 3084 into a new lease with United.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nor do we agree with United's argument that assuming an unexpired lease in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding is equivalent to a new promise to pay under Code \u00a7 8.01-229(G). In pertinent part, the statute provides that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [i]f any person against whom a right of action has accrued on any contract, ... promises, by writing signed by him ..., payment of money on such contract, the person to whom the right has accrued may maintain an action for the money so promised, within such number of years after such promise as it might be maintained if such promise were the original cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-229(G)(1). \"[T]he effect of a `new promise in writing' is to begin the running of a new statute of limitations permitting suit `within such number of years after such promise as it might be maintained if such promise were the original cause of action.'\"\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors v.

Because the automatic stay did not bar United's independent right to proceed against the Sureties, Havana's filing for bankruptcy protection did not toll the statute of limitations with regard to United's claim against the Sureties.\n   <em>\n    See Fountain Sand and Gravel Co. v.

Thus, the four-year statute of limitations with regard to the Sureties' liability commenced to run in 1994 when Havana initially defaulted on its obligations under Lease No. 3084. Havana's bankruptcy proceeding did not toll the running of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the four-year statute of limitations barred the present action filed in September 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III.
