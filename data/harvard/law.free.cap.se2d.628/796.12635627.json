We uphold his convictions for possession and trafficking. With respect to his conviction on the maintaining a dwelling charge, however, we hold that the trial court erred when it allowed a police officer to testify that, prior to being Mirandized, defendant had incriminated himself by giving his home address in response to a routine booking question. Defendant is, therefore, entitled to a new trial on that charge. In addition, as the State concedes, defendant is entitled to a new sentencing hearing on the conviction of possession of cocaine because the trial court erroneously found as an aggravating factor that defendant had joined with more than one other person in committing his crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show the following facts. In late 2001, the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation into a residence located at 809 Wilson Street in Elizabeth City. During a two-month surveillance of the residence, police officers observed a steady stream of \"individuals coming to the residence and staying only a few minutes then leaving. They were on foot and also coming up in vehicles.\" On 18 January 2002, the police, using a confidential informant, completed a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from defendant at the Wilson Street residence. That same day, based on (1) the evidence from the confidential informant, (2) the officers' surveillance of the residence, and (3) information and complaints from citizens during the course of the investigation, police officers obtained a search warrant authorizing them to search both defendant and the Wilson Street residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As soon as they had obtained the warrant, several police officers knocked on the door of 809 Wilson Street and announced loudly that they were with the Sheriff's Department and they had a search warrant. When no one answered, they used a sledgehammer to break down the door. As officers entered the house, they found defendant lying on a sofa, stuffing plastic bags into his mouth. Defendant initially resisted arrest, but after he was subdued, officers observed a white chalky substance around his mouth consistent with wet cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Lisa Robinson, defendant's girlfriend, appeared at the house. Officers intercepted her outside, detained her,\n   handcuffed her, and brought her inside, where she was shown a copy of the search warrant. Witnesses described her as \"extremely upset,\" \"shaking,\" and \"extremely excited.\" As soon as she saw defendant, she said, \"[W]e gots to be more careful\" and started to cry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As police searched the residence, they found defendant's 12-year-old son in the kitchen and three young girls in one of the bedrooms. In a second bedroom, containing a single bed and children's and men's clothes, officers located 27 clear plastic bags containing various amounts of cocaine. The bags were concealed behind blinds in the space between an interior window and an exterior storm window. All told, the cocaine in the bags added up to approximately 280-300 grams, with a street value of approximately $28,000.00 to $30,000.00. In a third bedroom, containing a double bed, officers found an unloaded .12 gauge shotgun hidden in a closet behind female clothing. Officers also recovered a phone bill addressed to Lisa Robinson at the Wilson Street residence, as well as a box containing a handheld scanner and a receipt for the scanner from Advance Auto Parts. The receipt bore defendant's name and the Wilson Street address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police took defendant and Ms. Robinson to the police station, where they were each charged with (1) trafficking in cocaine; (2) possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver; and (3) maintaining a dwelling for the purpose of keeping or selling cocaine. Defendant was booked by Officer McKecuen, the same police officer who had arrested him. Prior to advising defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, Officer McKecuen asked defendant a number of routine booking questions, including his name, age, date of birth, next of kin, and home address. In response to the inquiry about his address, defendant responded that he lived at 809 Wilson Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Immediately after booking, defendant was read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and he agreed to talk to the police without exercising his right to have an attorney present. When defendant was asked whether the cocaine found in the 809 Wilson Street residence belonged to him or Ms. Robinson, defendant responded: \"It's mine.\" When he was asked to memorialize this admission in writing, defendant wrote \"it's mine\" on a piece of paper, but refused to sign the paper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant was later indicted for one count of trafficking in cocaine; one count of possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver; and one count of maintaining a dwelling for the purpose of keeping or selling cocaine. A jury convicted him of all three charges on 15 January 2003. At sentencing, the trial court imposed a presumptive range sentence of 70 to 84 months on the trafficking charge. With respect to the charges of possession of cocaine with intent to manufacture, sell, or deliver and maintaining a dwelling for the purpose of keeping or selling cocaine, the trial judge sentenced defendant in the aggravated range to consecutive terms of 10 to 12 months and 8 to 10 months respectively. As an aggravating factor for each offense, the judge found that defendant had \"joined with more than one other person in committing the offense and was not charged with committing a conspiracy.\" Although defendant did not give timely notice of appeal, this case comes before us pursuant to our grant of certiorari on 5 November 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant first assigns error to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized from the Wilson Street residence, arguing that the search warrant was invalid because of false statements contained in the affidavit submitted in support of the request for a warrant. With respect to an affidavit supporting a search warrant, if a defendant shows that \"(1) the affiant knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth made false statements; and (2) the false statements are necessary to the finding of probable cause, then `the warrant is rendered void, and evidence obtained thereby is inadmissible....'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We need not decide whether defendant sufficiently established that these were knowing or reckless falsehoods because even if those assertions are omitted, the affidavit is still sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See Rashidi,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633750\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/617/68/#p72\">\n    617 S.E.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that when the affidavit was considered without the allegedly false statements, it still indicated the presence of probable cause; therefore, it was unnecessary to reach the issue whether the false statements were made knowingly or recklessly).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   North Carolina uses a \"totality of the circumstances\" test to assess whether probable cause exists for the issuance of a search warrant.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Generally, an affidavit supporting a search warrant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   is sufficient [to establish probable cause] if it supplies reasonable cause to believe that the proposed search for evidence probably will reveal the presence upon the described premises of the items sought and that those items will aid in the apprehension or conviction of the offender....

Taken as a whole, this information, set forth in the challenged affidavit, is sufficient to support the conclusion that probable cause existed to search defendant and the Wilson Street residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the unusual traffic at the residence was not sufficient, by itself, to constitute probable cause, the additional evidence regarding the controlled buy by an informant under surveillance of the officers was sufficient to support issuance of the search warrant.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

(2) Excited Utterance. - A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\" The reason for allowing the excited utterance exception is that \"circumstances may produce a condition of excitement which temporarily stills the capacity of reflection and produces spontaneous and sincere utterances.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While a jury could find that he lived there, the State offered no evidence that he participated in the leasing of the house, the payment of the rent, or the maintenance and upkeep of the premises. The only utility bill in evidence was in Ms. Robinson's name. In sum, the only valid pieces of evidence that tied defendant to the 809 Wilson Street residence were (1) the receipt from Advance Auto Parts, (2) the civil summons served upon defendant at that address, (3) the presence of male clothing, and (4) the fact that defendant sold drugs to the informant and remained at the residence until police executed the search warrant soon after the controlled buy. This evidence is materially indistinguishable from the evidence found insufficient in\n   <em>\n    Harris, Hamilton,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bowens.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Since in the absence of the answer to the booking question, the evidence is insufficient to convict defendant of the charge of maintaining a dwelling for the purpose of keeping or selling cocaine, we must reverse that conviction and order a new trial on that charge. Defendant's response to the booking question was not, however, necessary to support his convictions on the remaining charges. Even when the challenged statement is omitted, substantial evidence of defendant's guilt on those two charges remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant next argues that his motion to dismiss his three charges for insufficiency of the evidence should have been granted.

This evidence is sufficient to support a finding of non-exclusive possession of the premises by defendant, even though the evidence does not establish that defendant was maintaining the dwelling.
