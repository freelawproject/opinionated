Plaintiff's complaint alleges that defendants Forsyth Memorial Hospital, Inc., Novant Health, Inc., and Novant Health Triad Region, L.L.C. (collectively the \"hospital defendants\") are vicariously liable for the negligence of (1) the hospital nursing staff and (2) the team assigned to administer anesthesiology to plaintiff during her gall bladder surgery. Plaintiff has appealed from the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the hospital defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based upon our review of the record, we hold that plaintiff has failed to establish a basis for holding Novant Health, Inc. (\"NHI\") or Novant Health Triad Region, L.L.C. (\"NHTR\") liable and, therefore, affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of those two defendants. With respect to Forsyth Memorial Hospital, Inc. (\"FMH\"), however, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In arguing that it is entitled to judgment as to plaintiff's claims based on the negligence of the hospital's nursing staff, FMH has only challenged the competency of the testimony of plaintiff's nursing expert.

With respect to the anesthesiology team, FMH has argued that it could not be held vicariously liable because the individuals responsible for the anesthesia were independent\n   contractors. Although we agree with FMH that plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence of actual agency, the record reveals that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the apparent agency of the anesthesiology team. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court also erred in granting summary judgment to FMH as to the claims based on the negligence of the anesthesiology team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 1999, plaintiff, who was in her early eighties, was diagnosed by her gastroenterologist, Dr. Gary Poleynard, with common duct stones and complications due to gall stone disease. Dr. Poleynard recommended surgery and referred plaintiff to defendant Dr. Ismael Goco, a board-certified general surgeon. After examining plaintiff at his office, Dr. Goco concurred with Dr. Poleynard's diagnosis and his recommendation of surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff chose to have Dr. Goco perform the gall bladder surgery. Dr. Goco had hospital privileges at two hospitals in Winston-Salem: defendant Forsyth Medical Center (\"FMC\") and Medical Park Hospital, Inc. On 12 October 1999, plaintiff was admitted to FMC. FMC is operated by defendant FMH. NHTR owns FMH and is in turn owned by NHI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff's gall bladder surgery required general anesthesia. Piedmont Anesthesia &amp; Pain Consultants, P.A. (\"Piedmont\") had a contract with FMH that granted Piedmont the exclusive right to provide anesthesia services at FMC. Piedmont employees Dr. Joseph McConville and nurse Sheila Crumb were responsible for administering anesthesia to plaintiff through an induction and intubation process. Ms. Crumb performed the intubation, which involved inserting a tube into plaintiff's trachea, under the supervision of Dr. McConville. Ms. Crumb made three attempts before successfully completing the intubation. At some point during the attempts, Ms. Crumb perforated plaintiff's esophagus, a fact that was not discovered until many hours after the gall bladder surgery was over. Plaintiff contends that as a result of that perforation, she has suffered severe and permanent injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 11 October 2002, plaintiff filed suit against not only the hospital defendants, but also Ms. Crumb, Dr. McConville, and Piedmont (collectively \"the anesthesiology defendants\"). The complaint alleged that the anesthesiology defendants were individually liable for their negligence in administering the anesthesia and that the hospital defendants were vicariously liable for the anesthesiology defendants' negligence, as well as the negligence of the hospital floor nurses who, following plaintiff's surgery, failed to immediately notice the perforation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 5 March 2004, plaintiff moved to compel the hospital defendants to respond to certain interrogatories and requests for production of documents. On 15 April 2004, the trial court entered an order allowing this motion in part and denying this motion in part. Plaintiff has appealed this order to the extent it refused to order production of certain documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 22 March 2004, the hospital defendants moved for summary judgment. On 19 April 2004, the trial court granted that motion. Since plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her claims against the anesthesiology defendants on 16 April 2004, plaintiff's appeal of this summary judgment order is properly before this Court as an appeal from a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court will uphold a trial court's grant of summary judgment \"if considering the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, there is no genuine issue of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

According to plaintiff, had the nurses done so, the perforation of her esophagus would have been identified earlier and lessened the seriousness of the injuries resulting from that perforation. In support of this claim, plaintiff relies upon the expert testimony of a nurse, Rosalyn Marie Harris-Offutt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants, however, argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because (1) Ms. Harris-Offutt was not qualified to testify as an expert witness under Rule 702(b)(2) of the Rules of Evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) Ms. Harris-Offutt, as a nurse, is not qualified to testify regarding medical causation. In opposing a motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case, a plaintiff must demonstrate that her expert witness is competent to testify and, in the absence of such a showing, summary judgment is properly granted.\n   <em>\n    See Weatherford v. Glassman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651913\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/129/618/#p623\">\n    129 N.C.App. 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 623,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20466\">\n    500 S.E.2d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469 (1998) (holding that deposition testimony offered in opposition to a motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case must reveal that the witness is competent to testify as to the matters at issue). The question before this Court is, therefore, whether the record reveals that Ms. Harris-Offutt is competent to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Rule 702(b)(2) of the Rules of Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 702(b) provides that medical malpractice experts are not qualified to testify unless they are licensed health care providers who meet certain criteria, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) During the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the action, the expert witness must have devoted a majority of his or her professional time to either or both of the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   a. The active clinical practice of the same health profession in which the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered, and if that party is a specialist, the active clinical practice of the same specialty or a similar specialty which includes within its specialty the performance of the procedure that is the subject of the complaint and have prior experience treating similar patients....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants contend that Ms. Harris-Offutt is unqualified under Rule 702(b) because she had not been active in the clinical practice of nursing in the year preceding plaintiff's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In support of their contention, defendants point to the deposition testimony of Janet Day Berrier, a representative of Thomasville Medical Center where Ms. Harris-Offutt was at one time employed. Ms. Berrier testified that the last date that Ms. Harris-Offutt worked for Thomasville Medical Center as a certified registered nurse anesthetist was 31 December 1986. Plaintiff, on the other hand, filed an affidavit from Ms.\n   Harris-Offutt, stating: \"During the year immediately preceding October 12, 1999, I devoted a majority of my professional time to the active clinical practice of nursing as a registered nurse[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although defendants point to Ms. Harris-Offutt's deposition as showing that she spends her time as a legal consultant rather than as a nurse, Ms. Harris-Offutt also stated in her deposition that she spends part of her time in the clinical practice of nursing and part of her time engaging in legal consulting. Thus, the deposition offered by defendants does not necessarily contradict the affidavit offered by plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants further argue that Ms. Harris-Offutt's clinical work is not relevant since she worked as a registered nurse and not as a floor nurse. Ms. Harris-Offutt's affidavit states, however:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is no specialty in nursing known as \"floor nursing.\" Floor nurses in hospitals are usually registered nurses. Registered nurses are not limited to the hospital setting, but work in many different settings including nursing homes, the private offices of physicians and the private offices of registered nurses[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants offered no expert testimony to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants' remaining arguments regarding the differences between Ms. Harris-Offutt's work experiences and the work experience of the hospital nursing staff go to the weight, but not the admissibility, of Ms. Harris-Offutt's evidence.\n   <em>\n    Howerton v.

The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While the language employed by these courts sometimes varies, generally they have employed tests which focus primarily on two basic factors. The first factor focuses on the hospital's manifestations and is sometimes described as an inquiry whether the hospital acted in a manner which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the individual who was alleged to be negligent was an employee or\n   agent of the hospital. Courts considering this factor often ask whether the hospital held itself out to the public as a provider of hospital care, for example, by mounting extensive advertising campaigns. In this regard, the hospital need not make express representations to the patient that the treating physician is an employee of the hospital; rather a representation also may be general and implied. The second factor focuses on the patient's reliance. It is sometimes characterized as an inquiry as to whether the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the conduct of the hospital or its agent, consistent with ordinary care and prudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11538451\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/714/142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11538451\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/714/142/\">\n    at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

Under this approach, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the hospital has held itself out as providing medical services, (2) the plaintiff looked to the hospital rather than the individual medical provider to perform those services, and (3) the patient accepted those services in the reasonable belief that the services were being rendered by the hospital or by its employees.

Piedmont doctors served as the hospital's\n   Chief of Anesthesiology and anesthesia Medical Director. As Dr. McConville put it, his group \"provide[d] the anesthesia services for the operating room at Forsyth and so there is - so our group covers the surgical caseload.\" Plaintiff and other surgical patients had no choice as to who would provide anesthesia services for their operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's affidavit states that she was unaware that Dr. McConville and Ms. Crumb were not employees of the hospital.

With respect to defendants NHTR and NHI, plaintiff argues only that \"Novant held itself out to the public as owning and/or operating Forsyth Medical Center and Plaintiff relied upon this.\" Her affidavit stated \"that the hospital held itself out to me and the public as being part of Novant.\" Plaintiff, however, cites no authority in support of her contention that NHTR and NHI may be held liable based on apparent agency for the acts of Dr. McConville and Ms. Crumb. N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (\"Assignments of error ... in support of which no reason or argument is stated or authority cited, will be taken as abandoned.\"). The record contains no evidence that NHTR and NHI, as opposed to the hospital, held themselves out as providing anesthesia services or that they, as opposed to the hospital, contracted to supply the services. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment as to NHTR and NHI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff has also argued (1) that the hospital defendants owed plaintiff a non-delegable duty and (2) that the hospital defendants are liable, even apart from agency principles, for the failure to obtain informed consent from plaintiff regarding anesthesia services.

On remand, defendants should submit affidavits specifying the author of each document, the date each document was prepared, the purpose for which the document was prepared, and the recipients - if any - of each document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Document 168 is not addressed by defendants in their brief. This document is a letter by Dr. McConville apparently to his insurance agency dated 18 October 1999 relating to plaintiff. We do not know on what basis defendants contend this document is protected from disclosure or if the trial judge considered whether this document was subject to production apart from any risk management documents otherwise protected. Plaintiff has not had any opportunity to argue why she is entitled to have this document produced. Plaintiff may even have already received this document in other discovery. Without expressing any opinion on the issue, we leave for consideration on remand whether this document should be produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With respect to the remaining documents, we believe that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that documents numbered 84-91, 108-53, 155-60, 164, 169-70, and 179-203 were protected either by the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine. Defendants have represented that copies of documents 161-63 and 165-67 have already been produced to plaintiff; these are simply copies attached to documents protected from disclosure. As to the documents specified in this paragraph, we affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Statistical Reports\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendant objected to plaintiff's request for \"[a]ll Statistical Reports for Forsyth Medical Center for infection control for 1996-2000\" on the grounds of relevance. Defendant points out that \"[t]here is no dispute in this case that the `infection' which the\n   appellant had was an internal one which came from a leaking esophagus, not from infection of her incision or other source in the hospital environment.\" While plaintiff argues, without any citation to the record, that the reports deal with all infections at FMC (and not just infections from external sources) and that the documents \"would be clearly admissible under Rule 404(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence to prove a pattern, practice, plan and\n   <em>\n    modus operandi,\n   </em>\n   \" plaintiff does not explain to what issue in this case a pattern, practice, plan, or\n   <em>\n    modus operandi\n   </em>\n   would be relevant. In the absence of such a showing, we cannot conclude that the trial court's ruling denying this request was manifestly unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of FMH and remand this action for further proceedings. We affirm the entry of summary judgment as to NHI and NHTR. We reverse the trial court's discovery order with respect to document numbers 61-68, 70-81, 92-107, 154, and 168 and remand for further review regarding whether they are entitled to protection under Rule 26(b)(3) or the attorney-client privilege.
