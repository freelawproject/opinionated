State's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   William Parker (\"Parker\") was assaulted and robbed at gunpoint upon arriving home on the evening of 20 June 2004. His assailants were two black males dressed in dark clothing and toboggan masks with the areas over the eyes cut out. One of the masks bore an NFL team logo. One robber held a gun to Parker, demanded his briefcase, which Parker did not have, took his wallet, and removed items from the rear of his vehicle. The other robber removed items from the passenger side of Parker's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   One gunman forced Parker to lay face down in the grass, placed the gun to the back of Parker's head, and threatened his accomplice would kill Parker if he moved. The two robbers ran away. Although Parker lost sight of the men, he heard them running and heard their voices. Parker stood and observed the men enter a Cadillac and drive away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Parker entered his vehicle, chased after the two men, and called 911. Parker soon caught up to the Cadillac. He observed a muzzle flash from inside the Cadillac and heard a gunshot. The Cadillac made a right turn. Parker followed and attempted to obtain the license plate number for the 911 dispatcher. The chase continued for several minutes during which an arm and pistol emerged from the rear passenger window four times. Seven shots were fired toward Parker's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Cadillac eventually eluded Parker, but was stopped by Greenville Police Officer Robert Brewington (\"Officer Brewington\") shortly thereafter. After arriving home and inspecting his vehicle, Parker observed a small hole below the front grill of his vehicle, which appeared to be a bullet hole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon stopping the Cadillac, Officer Brewington observed a black male wearing dark clothing exit the passenger side rear door and flee. Officer Brewington testified defendant, the driver of the vehicle, asked him what was going on and stated he had been stopped by two black males and ordered to drive. A stocking hat with a hole cut out was discovered in the right front passenger floor board of the Cadillac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   James Ham (\"Ham\") testified for the State. Ham was apprehended the following morning around 6:00 a.m. with a bandaged right hand. Ham testified he had known defendant for four to five years and previously shared a mobile home with him. About two weeks prior to the Parker robbery, Ham and defendant met with Lionel Grandy (\"Grandy\"). The three associated during the two weeks prior to the robbery. During that time, Ham and Grandy purchased a .38 revolver pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 20 June 2004, Ham borrowed his aunt's Cadillac. Defendant and Grandy went with Ham to visit Ham's parents' and grandparents' home in Aurora. After leaving the house, Grandy indicated he might have a \"lick\" for them or a \"get-on move\" to get some money. Grandy claimed he previously worked with Parker, who would carry a briefcase containing money to his home. The men drove by Parker's Barbecue in Greenville, where Grandy identified Parker's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Grandy then drove to Parker's neighborhood and dropped off Ham and defendant. Ham wore a Carolina Panthers toboggan hat with eye holes cut out and carried the .38 revolver. When Parker arrived, Ham and defendant approached Parker's vehicle. Ham pointed his gun at Parker and demanded his briefcase. Ham took Parker's wallet and a gray plastic container from the back of the vehicle. Defendant went through Parker's vehicle and removed two black bags. Defendant and Ham returned to the Cadillac. Shortly after Grandy drove away, he stopped the vehicle and asked defendant to drive because defendant was the only one of the three men with a driver's license. Grandy was worried Parker would call the police. Grandy exited the vehicle and sat in the rear driver's side seat. Defendant moved over into the driver's seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Parker's vehicle approached the Cadillac, Grandy and Ham grabbed the gun. The gun fired, shooting Ham in the right hand. Ham placed his hand outside the window and later bent over in the backseat, holding his hand. Grandy leaned over Ham and fired the gun out the rear passenger window toward Parker's vehicle. After eluding Parker, defendant stopped the car. Grandy fled carrying the gun. The Cadillac proceeded down the road and was stopped at an intersection by Officer Brewington. Ham jumped from the vehicle and fled. Ham was arrested and transported to the hospital the following morning. After discharge from the hospital, Ham was taken to the Greenville Police Department, where he voluntarily gave a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over defendant's objection, Ham testified to a prior robbery on 13 June 2004 involving defendant and Grandy pursuant to Rule 404(b). Ham testified he drove his aunt's Cadillac to a Pizza Hut in Zebulon around 2:00 a.m. on 13 June 2004. Defendant and Grandy exited the vehicle to rob the Pizza Hut. Ham waited in the front passenger's seat. Grandy carried the same .38 revolver that was later used in the Parker robbery. The men returned to the car carrying a clear plastic bag containing money. The men divided\n   the money and Ham received $99.00. Defendant drove the Cadillac from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    B. Defendant's Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant testified that on 20 June 2004 he drove the Cadillac to Aurora with Ham and Grandy as passengers. As they were leaving Aurora, Grandy received a call, cursed, and said he \"was coming to get [his] things girl.\" Ham drove the men to a residence defendant believed to be Grandy's girlfriend's house. Defendant waited in the car until Ham and Grandy returned with two bags and a gray container. Grandy drove off with Parker chasing them. Ham replied, \"I got him\" and reached onto the floor. Ham shot himself in the hand as he came back up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant testified he thought the man pursuing them was Grandy's girlfriend's boyfriend and he never knew it was Parker behind them. He testified that Ham continued to shoot out the right rear passenger window with his left hand as they continued to flee from the vehicle pursuing them. After the men evaded Parker, Grandy drove the car into a cul-de-sac, exited the vehicle, and fled. Defendant slid over into the driver's seat and attempted to drive Ham to the hospital. After being stopped at the intersection, Ham told defendant that he and Grandy had robbed a man. Ham exited the vehicle and fled. Defendant denied having any knowledge about the robbery of the Pizza Hut in Zebulon on 13 June 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant was convicted of: (1) possession of a firearm by a felon; (2) assault with a deadly weapon; (3) discharge of a firearm into an occupied vehicle; and (4) three counts of attempted discharge of a firearm into an occupied vehicle. The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the armed robbery charge and the court declared a mistrial for that offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, defendant offered the following mitigating factors: (1) assistance in the apprehension of another felon; (2) acknowledgment of wrongdoing; (3) being a person of good character and reputation in the community; (4) honorable discharge from the United States Army; (5) support of his family; (6) a support system in the community; and (7) positive employment history. The State offered no evidence or proffer in response. Defendant was sentenced to consecutive prison terms all within the presumptive ranges of: (1) forty-six to sixty-five months for discharging a weapon into an occupied vehicle; (2) sixteen to twenty months for the consolidated charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and assault with a deadly weapon; and (3) forty-six to sixty-five months for three consolidated counts of attempted discharge of a weapon into an occupied vehicle. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court erred by: (1) allowing the admission of uncorroborated evidence of a different, earlier armed robbery under Rule 404(b); (2) accepting jury verdicts in six of seven charges and declaring a mistrial in the remaining count when all counts were joined and consolidated for trial; (3) admitting uncorroborated hearsay statements by a third co-defendant who was not on trial or available to testify and subject to cross-examination by the defense; (4) admitting Ham's written statement containing uncorroborated hearsay statements by a third co-defendant; (5) denying his motion to dismiss at the close of the State's evidence and renewed motion to dismiss at the close of all evidence for insufficiency of the evidence; and (6) failing to make findings of fact in support of its sentences and judgments where he presented uncontradicted evidence in support of several statutory mitigating factors and failing to consider those mitigating factors prior to sentencing him and entering judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    III. Motion for Appropriate Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief with this Court on 28 February 2006 seeking to vacate his possession of a firearm by a felon conviction. He argues the prior conviction upon which the possession of a firearm conviction rests is a misdemeanor rather than a felony. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1411 (2005) provides, \"Relief from errors committed in the trial division, or other post-trial relief, may be sought by a motion for appropriate relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A prior felony conviction for breaking and entering is listed on defendant's indictment for possession of a firearm by a felon. The\n   indictment alleges the breaking and entering offense is a Class H felony. Defendant was convicted of this offense on 30 November 1992 in Wake County and was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended upon probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant filed the transcript of plea and judgment from the breaking and entering offense listed in the indictment with this Court. These documents reveal defendant pled guilty to and was convicted of misdemeanor, rather than felony, breaking and entering on 30 November 1992. The indictment for the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon offense is fatally defective and dismissed. No other felony to support the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon was alleged. Defendant's motion for appropriate relief is granted. Defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon is vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Rule 404(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant asserts evidence of the prior Pizza Hut robbery on 13 June 2004 should have been excluded and argues: (1) this evidence was not corroborated; (2) this evidence did not concern a prior offense for which he had been convicted; and (3) the crime remained under investigation at the time of his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Similarities between the robberies of the Pizza Hut and Parker that occurred within one week of each other are sufficient evidence to support a finding that the probative value of the evidence of the Pizza Hut robbery was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion by providing a supplemental instruction to the jury which did not threaten to require the jury to deliberate for an unreasonable length of time or for unreasonable intervals.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony. Presuming Grandy's hearsay statement claiming responsibility for the Pizza Hut robbery was improperly admitted, in the absence of an objection by defendant or showing a different result would have occurred at trial, the admission of the statement does not warrant a new trial under plain or prejudicial error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reasonably conclude shots were fired at Parker's vehicle. Because the State proceeded under an acting in concert theory, liability for firing the shots and possession of the firearm are imputed to defendant, who was present in the vehicle and acted in concert with his co-conspirators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion by failing to sentence defendant in the mitigated range.
