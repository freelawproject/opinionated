Brown was sentenced to a minimum of 15 months and maximum of 18 months on the common law robbery conviction, and a minimum of 19 months and maximum of 23 months on the assault conviction. Gadson also pleaded guilty to the status of habitual felon and was sentenced to a minimum of 120 months and maximum of 153 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence at trial tended to show that in November 2002, Steven Allen Hall (Hall) was introduced to defendants by a friend, Stanley Blair (Blair). Defendants introduced themselves as brothers. Hall and Blair agreed to do some roofing work on Brown's home. Before Hall and Blair began work on the roof, they met defendants at Home Depot to purchase lumber. Hall testified that Brown paid for the lumber and gave Hall and Blair a check to cover partial payment of the roofing work and to cover the cost of shingles that Hall was to purchase later. Gadson spent eight hours one day helping Hall and Blair with the roofing job. Hall and Blair paid Gadson forty dollars for his help and owed him another forty dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the afternoon of 21 November 2002, defendants went to the apartment Hall shared with his girlfriend and demanded the forty dollars owed to Gadson. Defendants told Hall they were going to find Blair and collect the forty dollars. Brown told Hall they were \"going to get that money because they'd been known to f___ people up before.\" Defendants left Hall's apartment, and Hall called the police because he felt \"threatened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next day, defendants returned to Hall's apartment and ordered Hall to go with them to find Blair. Hall attempted to call 911, but Brown yanked the phone cord out of the wall. Gadson hit Hall in the mouth, knocking out one of Hall's teeth. Defendants grabbed Hall in order to take him out to their vehicle, but Hall fell to the ground, and defendants stomped on his head. Defendants went back inside Hall's apartment, and Hall followed. Gadson again hit Hall in the mouth, and Brown threw a coffee table at Hall. Hall's neighbor, Joel Chapman (Chapman), testified that he saw defendants take two television sets from Hall's apartment and saw defendants load the televisions into the trunk of their vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Mark Hess (Dr. Hess) testified that Hall suffered multiple facial fractures around his eye and multiple lacerations. He also testified that Hall had lost a lower tooth. Hall's vision in his injured eye was 20/100 after the assault and his vision was still affected at the time of trial two years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Brown argues eight assignments of error, and Gadson argues four assignments of error. Defendants' assignments of error not argued on appeal are deemed abandoned.

Brown filed a pretrial motion to sequester, and Gadson made an oral motion at trial. The trial court denied the motions, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Well, the last couple of times I've tried to sequester witnesses, frankly stated, it's been a miserable experience.... There's no central place where I can put witnesses. It inevitably becomes a time-consuming process. And when I weigh what, if any, gain might be had by keeping the witnesses out versus keeping them in, in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to deny that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"A ruling on a motion to sequester witnesses rests within the sound discretion of the trial court[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the present case, neither defendant identified any instance of a witness\n   conforming testimony to that of another witness. Accordingly, we find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue the trial court erred in allowing Hall's father, Clarence Hall, to testify at trial when Clarence Hall's name did not appear on the witness list disclosed by the State prior to trial. For the reasons below, we find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gadson argues the State was required, under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(3), to provide a written list of the names of all witnesses the State reasonably expected to call at trial. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-903 provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Upon motion of the defendant,\n   </em>\n   the court must order the State to:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) Give the defendant, at the beginning of jury selection, a written list of the names of all other witnesses whom the State reasonably expects to call during the trial.... If there are witnesses that the State did not reasonably expect to call at the time of the provision of the witness list, and as a result are not listed, the court upon a good faith showing shall allow the witnesses to be called. Additionally, in the interest of justice, the court may in its discretion permit any undisclosed witness to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (emphasis added). The record does not reveal that either defendant made a motion requesting the trial court to order the State to provide a list of witnesses. Therefore, the State was not required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(3) to provide defendants with a list of the witnesses it intended to call during trial. Gadson's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Brown concedes the State was not required to provide defendants with a witness list under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-903(a)(3). Instead, he argues that because the State volunteered to provide defendants with a witness list, the State's voluntary list should have complied with N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(b) and should have provided the names of all witnesses the State expected to call. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-903(b) (2005) provides that \"[i]f the State voluntarily provides disclosure under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-902(a), the disclosure shall be to the same extent as required by subsection (a) of this section.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-902 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (a) A party seeking discovery under [Article 48] must, before filing any motion before a judge, request in writing that the other party comply voluntarily with the discovery request. A written request is not required if the parties agree in writing to voluntarily comply with the provisions of [this Article]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (b) To the extent that discovery authorized in this Article is voluntarily made in response to a request or written agreement, the discovery is deemed to have been made under an order of the court for the purposes of this Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-902(a)(b) (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Brown cites\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558753\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/291/505/\">\n    291 N.C. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20S.E.2d%20663\">\n    231 S.E.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977), in which our Supreme Court held that where the State provides a list of witnesses pursuant to a court order, and the State subsequently seeks to call a witness not on the list, the trial court must \"look to see whether the district attorney acted in bad faith, and whether the defendant was prejudiced thereby.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 523,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20S.E.2d%20663\">\n    231 S.E.2d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). Brown argues the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   should be \"equally applicable in the case of a voluntary disclosure as court ordered disclosure.\" In noting the distinction between court-ordered discovery and voluntary discovery, Brown presages our analysis. Unlike the facts of\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   in the present case, there is no indication from the record that either defendant made a request for voluntary discovery by the State. Nor is there any evidence in the record of a written agreement between the State and either defendant to voluntarily comply with the provisions of Article 48. Reading the plain language of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-902(b), it seems that absent a request or written agreement, the State's witness list is not deemed to have been made under an order of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-902(b) (\"To the extent that discovery authorized in this Article is voluntarily made\n   <em>\n    in response to a request or written agreement,\n   </em>\n   the discovery is deemed\n   to have been made under an order of the court for the purposes of this Article.\") (emphasis added). If not deemed to have been made under a court order, such voluntary discovery would seem not to need to be \"to the same extent as required by [N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-902(a)].\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-903(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, we note that North Carolina cases since\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   have used the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   standard in cases where discovery was not court-ordered. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Myers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8575737\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/299/671/\">\n    299 N.C. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20S.E.2d%20768\">\n    263 S.E.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), the defendant made an oral request during jury selection that the State orally list the names of all witnesses the State planned to call to testify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 675,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=263%20S.E.2d%20768\">\n    263 S.E.2d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the State complied with the oral request, but then later sought to call witnesses not named during jury selection, our Supreme Court analyzed the case pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Smith.\n   </em>\n   The Court held that the trial court's\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   examination of the jury satisfied the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Smith:\n   </em>\n   \"The voir dire established that the jurors did not know either of the witnesses the State had failed to name during jury selection.

The trial court conducted a\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of Clarence Hall, who testified that he had not previously spoken with the State about the case.

The trial court omitted the word \"impairment\" from the instruction regarding Brown. Since a defendant may not be convicted of an offense on a theory different from that presented to a jury, our Court must determine whether the State presented substantial evidence of each element of assault inflicting serious bodily injury based on the definition of the offense given to the jury in the trial court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9081768\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/150/497/#p501\">\n    150 N.C.App. at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563 S.E.2d at 620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   our Court addressed the sufficiency of evidence of serious bodily injury where a jury instruction limited the definition of serious bodily injury to \"`an injury that creates or causes a permanent or protracted condition that causes extreme pain.'\"\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9081768\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/150/497/#p501\">\n    150 N.C.App. at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563 S.E.2d at 620.

This evidence of a forceful taking is sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer Brown intended to deprive Hall and Hall's girlfriend of the property.

Therefore, we have only the colloquy regarding Brown's objection and motion for mistrial in the record for our review. Without the transcript of the State's argument, we cannot be certain of the accuracy of Brown's characterization of the State's argument. However, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Brown's characterization is proper, we find no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The contested argument did not unfairly prejudice Brown. As discussed in Part III of this opinion, there was sufficient evidence to support the charge of assault inflicting serious bodily injury. The trial court, in its discretion, did not find the contested statements in the State's argument to constitute an impropriety sufficient for a mistrial. Given the degree of deference afforded a trial court's decision on a motion for a mistrial, we are not persuaded that the trial court's denial of Brown's motion amounted to an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Brown next argues the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of an exhibit pertaining to a real estate transaction between Gadson and Blair. The State called Blair as a witness and questioned him about a proposed real estate sale between Blair and Gadson. Blair testified that Gadson offered to sell Blair some real property, but Gadson did not in fact own the property. The State then moved to introduce Exhibit 27, a bill for a survey of the property Gadson claimed to own. Over Gadson's objection, the trial court admitted Exhibit 27, stating: \"I'll let it in as to Gadson only, to explain the relationship between the parties. Do not consider that land deal against Defendant Brown, members of the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We first note that Brown failed to object to either the exhibit or the related testimony at trial. Therefore, Brown must show that any error by the trial court amounted to plain error, an error \"so fundamental that it undermine[d] the fairness of the trial, or ... had a probable impact on the guilty verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

What felony have you been convicted of in the last ten years for which you could have received a penalty of more than 60 days, Mr. Brown?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A.

And the reason you're denying any involvement in even going over to Mr. Hall's house is because you know it would violate this federal probation, don't you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   MR. JORDAN: Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT: Overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. My question to you, Mr. Brown, is the reason why you don't want to admit any involvement in this thing is because you know you're going to have to do this federal time as a result of it. Correct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On appeal, Brown concedes the State's initial questions about Brown's felony conviction were permissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 609, which permits evidence that a witness has been convicted of a felony, for purposes of impeachment. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 609 (2005). Brown argues the State's follow-up question about Brown's motivation for denying involvement went beyond the permissible scope of Rule 609, which limits details of a prior conviction to \"name of the crime, the time and place of the conviction, and the punishment imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Lynch,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2532283\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/334/402/#p409\">\n    334 N.C. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=432%20S.E.2d%20349\">\n    432 S.E.2d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (1993). Brown's reliance on Rule 609 is misplaced. The State's question about Brown's denial of involvement did not concern any impermissible details about Brown's prior felony conviction. Rather, the State sought to elicit that Brown had a motive for untruthfulness when he denied involvement in the crime. The State concedes the question could be considered a question concerning a prior bad act, but contends the question was permissible under Rule 404(b), in that it was admitted for the purpose of showing motive. We agree. Under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404(b) (2005), evidence of prior bad acts or crimes is admissible for purposes other than to prove a witness's conformity with the prior act. Such evidence is admissible to show,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the witness's motive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=432%20S.E.2d%20349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Brown argues the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing him to consecutive sentences upon conviction of the two offenses. Brown acknowledges the trial court's authority, under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1354, to impose a sentence consecutively, but urges this Court to reconsider its rulings upholding the trial court's statutory authority. We decline.
