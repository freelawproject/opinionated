Defendants orally agreed to take them.

He delivered the same to defendants who accepted and retained it, and requested Eich to sell the prunes whenever he could get a profit. After the thirty days had elapsed one of the plaintiffs called upon defendants for the pay. They asked to have the matter left for a few days, as they had $10,000 to raise. The prunes had been weighed for plaintiffs at the time they bought. They received from the vendors the warehouse order delivered to Eich.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b685-13\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence defendants\u2019 counsel moved to dismiss the complaint upon the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b685-14\">First. That the agreement to purchase was within the statute of frauds and void, because no memorandum was subscribed by the defendants or by their authority, and because no memorandum was subscribed by or on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>plaintiffs, and because there was no acceptance of the prunes by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-6\">Second. The action is for goods sold and delivered, and there is not sufficient proof of delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-7\">Third. The alleged agreement was not for any specific prunes, nor at the time it was made were the ten casks designated, or their weights known. The defendants have not authorized or assented to the designation or appropriation to the agreement of any particular prunes. Ho property in any prunes has, therefore, passed to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-8\">The court denied the motion, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-9\">Ho testimony was offered by the defendants, and the jury, under the direction of the court, rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of $2,128, including interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-10\">The court, ordered judgment to be suspended, and directed the defendants\u2019 exceptions to be heard, in the first instance, at the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b686-11\"><em>Edwards </em>c\u00a7 Odell, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS7-\">The broker was not the agent of defendants.

An inspection of the warehouse delivery order shows that it came from the plaintiffs, and gave to the defendants the knowledge or the means of knowledge, that the plaintiffs were the vendors of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">It is held, that though there is no employment of a person in the first instance his acts may be subsequently adopted. The adoption relates back to the time of the original transaction, and is deemed in law the same to all purposes, as if authority had been given before. <em>(Lawrence </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 Hill, 107; <em>Maclean </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>4 Bing., 722; 15 E. C. R., 129.) It seems then, that the action of the defendants, being with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>knowledge of the acts of Rich, was an adoption of those acts and a ratification of them. <em>(Maclean </em>v. Dunn, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">And as Rich, when he signed and delivered to the plaintiffs the bought note, did make a note or memorandum of the contract in writing subscribed by the party to be charged thereby, there was a valid contract for the sale of the goods. <em>(Maclean </em>v. Dunn, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Holding that there was a valid contract of sale, we need treat the question of a delivery only as it was necessary to charge the vendees on that contract, and to put the goods at their risk and maintain an action for goods sold and delivered. There was no manual delivery. But an actual delivery is not required. A symbolical delivery suffices. A delivery of an order on a warehouseman may be enough. <em>(Hollingsworth </em>v. Napier, 3 Caines, 132, and note <em>a; </em>and see <em>Dunham </em>v. Mann, 4 Seld., 508.) Hor did anything remain to be done to the goods by the plaintiffs. They had been weighed to the plaintiffs, and reweighed for the defendants. They had been separated to the plaintiffs from the larger quantity owned by their vendors. These ten casks were all that the plaintiffs owned at the warehouse on which the delivery order was given. So that it was these specific ten casks which the plaintiffs sold and delivered to the defendants. And though no testimony was given of the weight, yet that is alleged in the complaint, and, as no point was made of it upon the motion for a nonsuit, it must have been assumed at the trial as correctly stated therein. It was an omission so easily supplied, had attention been called to it, that we would not be warranted in now reversing a judgment because of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs to the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
