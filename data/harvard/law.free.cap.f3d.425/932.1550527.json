(\u201cCSCS\u201d) as an oiler on two ships owned by Costa Crociere, S.p.A. (\u201cCosta\u201d). CSCS is a Netherlands Antilles company whose only land-based office is in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. Costa is an Italian corporation, headquartered in Genoa, It<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>aly. Through an intermediary Italian holding company, Costa is a fully owned subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, a Panamanian corporation with its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. Costa maintains no officers or employees in the United States. Both of the ships on which Membre\u00f1o worked are Italian-flagged vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Membre\u00f1o joined the <em>COSTA ATLAN-TICA </em>the first Costa ship on which he worked, on June 12, 2000 in Helsinki, Finland. On January 23, 2001, the <em>COSTA ATLANTICA </em>was engaged in a seven-day Caribbean cruise beginning and ending in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. On that date, Membre\u00f1o alleges that his right wrist was injured when a smokestack door closed on it. When the alleged injury occurred, the <em>COSTA ATLANTICA </em>was in international waters. Membre\u00f1o contends that, though he reported his injury to his supervisor and the ship\u2019s doctor, he did not receive prompt medical attention. Membre\u00f1o\u2019s employment contract ended five days after the alleged accident. He disembarked the ship and was flown back to Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In March 2001, Membre\u00f1o traveled back to Fort Lauderdale and began working on the <em>COSTA VICTORIA </em>The defendants contend that Membre\u00f1o\u2019s wrist injury actually occurred during this voyage. Mem-bre\u00f1o alleges he complained to the ship\u2019s doctor that he had not received any medical care for the wrist injury he had sustained while working on the <em>COSTA AT-LANTICA </em>and that his wrist was still bothering him. On September 14, 2001, Membre\u00f1o received medical attention for his wrist in Barcelona, Spain. Two days later, he disembarked the ship in Naples and was flown home to Honduras by CSCS for medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">In Honduras, Dr. Francisco Murrillo diagnosed Membre\u00f1o with Kienbock\u2019s disease and recommended surgery. Mem-bre\u00f1o requested a second opinion, and CSCS offered him the opportunity to procure a second opinion from Dr. Jorge Ose-jo, another Honduran doctor. Instead, Membre\u00f1o chose to travel to Miami to see Dr. Jay Dennis, an orthopedic surgeon and wrist and elbow specialist. On May 14, 2002, Dr. Dennis performed surgery on Membre\u00f1o\u2019s wrist. On October 16, 2002, Membre\u00f1o returned to Honduras and underwent physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">On June 18, 2003, Membre\u00f1o filed a complaint in the district court alleging counts under the Jones Act and under general maritime law relating to his wrist injury. There were originally four defendants to the suit: Costa Crociere, S.p.A. (\u201cCosta\u201d); Cruise Ships Catering &amp; Service International, N.V. (\u201cCSCS\u201d); Prestige Cruises, N.V.; and Costa Cruise Lines, N.V. The parties stipulated to the dismissal of two defendants, Prestige Cruises, N.V. and Costa Cruise Lines, N.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">On October 20, 2003, the remaining defendants, Costa and CSCS, filed a motion to dismiss based on <em>forum non conve-niens. </em>The district court determined that the law of the United States did not apply to Membre\u00f1o\u2019s suit, granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss based on <em>forum non conveniens, </em>and dismissed the case without prejudice on November 23, 2004. Membre\u00f1o appeals from that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">We review choice of law determinations <em>de novo. S\u00edgalas v. Lido Mar., Inc., </em>776 F.2d 1512, 1516 (11th Cir.1985). We review a district court\u2019s factual determination concerning whether a shipowner has a substantial base of operations in the United States only for clear error. <em>Szum-licz v. Norwegian Am. Line, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 1192, 1196 (11th Cir.1983). We may only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>reverse a district court\u2019s dismissal based <em>on forum non conveniens </em>if it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. <em>S\u00edgalas, </em>776 F.2d at 1519.</p>\n<p id=\"Aph\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">The first step in determining whether an action should be dismissed for <em>forum non conveniens </em>is to determine whether United States law should be applied to the case. <em>See Szumlicz, </em>698 F.2d at 1195. The Supreme Court has set out eight factors that should be considered in determining whether the Jones Act and the general maritime law of the United States should be applied: (1) the place of the wrongful act; (2) the flag under which the ship sails; (3) the allegiance or domicile of the injured party; (4) the allegiance of the defendant shipowner; (5) the place of the. contract between the injured party and the shipowner; (6) the accessibility of a foreign forum; (7) the law of the forum; and (8) the shipowner\u2019s base of operations. <em>Id. </em>at 1195 (citing <em>Lauritzen v. Larsen, </em>345 U.S. 571, 73 S.Ct. 921, 97 L.Ed. 1254 (1953) and <em>Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v. Rhoditis, </em>398 U.S. 306, 90 S.Ct. 1731, 26 L.Ed.2d 252 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">In this case, six of the eight factors point in favor of the defendants\u2019 contention that United States law should not apply. Taking Membre\u00f1o\u2019s version of events to be true, the wrongful act occurred in the Caribbean Sea, outside the territorial waters of the United States. The vessels on which Membre\u00f1o worked were Italian-flagged ships. Membre\u00f1o lives in and is a citizen of Honduras. The shipowner, Cos-ta, is an Italian corporation. Membre\u00f1o entered into a contract to work onboard Costa\u2019s ships in Helsinki, Finland. Foreign fora are accessible to Membre\u00f1o in Italy, Honduras, and the Netherlands Antilles; the defendants have waived any time-bar defenses and have consented to personal jurisdiction in each of these fora. The seventh factor, the law of the forum, \u201cis entitled to little weight because \u2018fortuitous circumstances ... often determine the forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>S\u00edgalas, </em>776 F.2d at 1517 (quoting <em>Lauritzen, </em>345 U.S. at 591, 73 S.Ct. at 932).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Thus, the only significant question is whether the defendants have a substantial base of operations in the United States warranting the application of United States law. If the defendants have a substantial base of operations in the United States, this factor alone can justify the application of United States law. <em>See Szumlicz, </em>698 F.2d at 1195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Membre\u00f1o\u2019s argument that Costa has a substantial base of operations in the United States is based primarily on the fact that, through an intermediary Italian holding company, Costa is a fully owned subsidiary of Carnival Corporation. It is undisputed that Carnival maintains its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. We conclude that this fact is insufficient to establish that Costa has a substantial base of operations in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Corporate distinctions generally may not be disregarded absent fraud, improper conduct, illegality, or bad faith. <em>See Johnson Enters, of Jacksonville, Inc. v. FPL Group, Inc., </em>162 F.3d 1290, 1320-22 (11th Cir.1998) (applying Florida law to determine whether the corporate veil should be pierced). Membre\u00f1o has made no such showing here. The record indicates that Carnival does not exercise day-to-day control over Costa and that corporate formalities are properly maintained. Costa\u2019s day-to-day operations are run from a 450-person office in Genoa, Italy. Though Costa contracts with Carnival for the provision of certain goods and services, these contracts are the product of arms-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>length negotiations between the two companies in which corporate distinctions are properly maintained. Many of these contracts give Costa great discretion in determining whether to procure goods through Carnival or through other vendors. Had Costa not entered into these contracts with Carnival, it would have been necessary for Costa to enter into similar contracts with other entities. And, as the district court noted, these contracts would not be necessary if Carnival actually were in charge of Costa\u2019s day-to-day operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Though Costa markets some of its cruises in the United States, 80 to 85% of its business comes from the European market. Only a small number of Costa\u2019s cruises originate from or call at American ports. During the relevant period, Costa\u2019s fleet spent only 3.4% of its sailing days at American ports. Costa maintains a United States subsidiary, Costa Cruise Lines, N.V., that markets and sells passenger tickets in the United States, but that subsidiary is just one of eight separate companies that markets Costa cruises.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">There is ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s determination that Costa does not maintain a substantial base of operations in the United States. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that United States law should not be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">After concluding that Membre-\u00f1o\u2019s claims are governed by foreign law, we proceed with the <em>forum non conve-niens </em>analysis. <em>See Szumlicz, </em>698 F.2d at 1195. The party seeking to have a case dismissed based on <em>forum non conveniens </em>\u201cmust demonstrate that (1) an adequate alternative forum is available, (2) the public and private factors weigh in favor of dismissal, and (3) the plaintiff can reinstate his suit in the alternative forum without undue inconvenience or prejudice.\u201d <em>Leon v. Million Air, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). The first and third elements are clearly satisfied here. Alternative fora are available in Honduras, Italy, and the Netherlands Antilles, and the defendants have waived jurisdictional and time-bar defenses in those fora.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">Private-interest factors \u201cinclude ... \u2018ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses ... and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (quoting <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 508, 67 S.Ct. 839, 843, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947)). Though we ordinarily presume \u201cthat a plaintiff has chosen a sufficiently convenient forum,\u201d that presumption \u201cweakens when the plaintiff is a foreigner litigating far from home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (internal marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Except for the existence of Membre\u00f1o\u2019s surgeon in South Florida, all the private-interest factors weigh in favor of dismissal. Membre\u00f1o is not a United States citizen. With the exception of the surgeon, no United States citizen or resident is likely to be a witness. Most of the witnesses, medical records, and documentary evidence are located in Italy, Spain, Monaco, and Honduras. Membre\u00f1o can obtain an enforceable judgment in another forum. In short, the \u201cpractical problems\u201d of litigation favor an alternative forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">Public-interest factors \u201cinclude the sovereigns\u2019 interests in deciding the dispute, the administrative burdens posed by trial, and the need to apply foreign law.\u201d <em>Republic of Panama v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A., </em>119 F.3d 935, 953 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. at 508-09, 67 S.Ct. at 843). The need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>apply foreign law is a public-interest factor that mitigates strongly in favor of dismissal. <em>S\u00edgalas, </em>776 F.2d at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Here, the public-interest factors favor dismissal. No significant relationship exists between the parties or the wrongful act and the United States. Membre\u00f1o is a foreign plaintiff, and foreign law will apply. Clearly, Honduras and Italy have a much stronger interest in adjudicating disputes involving their citizens, corporations, and vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Because the <em>forum non conveniens </em>factors weigh in favor of dismissal, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
