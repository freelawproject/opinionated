The complaint then concluded in the words following:] \u201c amounting in the whole to the sum of two hundred and twenty dollars and thirty-five cents, upon account of which said goods and chattels the defendants remain indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of two hundred and twenty dollars and thirty-five cents, together with interest thereon. \u201cWherefore, the plaintiffs demand judgment against the <em>defendant </em>for the said sum of,\u201d &amp;c.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-8\"><em>Held, </em>that a demurrer, specifying as the objeetion to the complaint, that it did not appear therein or thereby, at w:hat time, or for what prices, or to whom the goods were delivered, was properly overruled in respect to these <em>specific grounds </em>assigned for the demurrer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-9\">Whether the complaint in question contains a statement of facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and whether it ought not to contain some averment of the promise to pay, or of terms of sale, showing that payment is due, and the credit, if any, expired, or some allegation showing the defendant to be in default; and whether such a complaint could be sustained upon a demurrer, which should fully specify the grounds of objection appearing on its face; <em>quere ?</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b150-10\">Where a complaint, entitled against two defendants, consisted of a printed form, with the blank spaces therein filled in writing, and alleged a sale of goods \u201c to the <em>defendant </em>it was <em>held, </em>that the omission of the letter \u201c s,\u201d being apparently a clerical error merely, should b^ disregarded on demurrer, and the allegation lie deemed to charge both the defendants.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">This was an appeal from an order, made at special term, overruling a demurrer. The complaint was for goods sold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and was drawn by filling up the blanks in a printed form. The following is an exact copy, the <em>written </em>words being italicized:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\"><em>In the Court of Common Pleas for the eity and </em>county of <em>New Torh.

The complaint of the above named plaintiffs respectfully show to this court, that the plaintiffs sold and delivered to the defendant the following described goods and chattels, at the times and for the prices below specified as to each article, that is to say :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">1852, <em>October </em>20, <em>To </em>450 <em>Phil, </em>brick,....... $9 90</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">&lt;6 <em>Nodr </em>9, \u201c 900 <em>do. </em>$22, 19 80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8c\">66 <em>Dedr </em>8, \u201c 800 &lt;6 66 176 10</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATP\">\u00cd6 u 9 \u201c 666 66 66 14 65</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">$220 35</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">amounting, in the whole, to the sum of <em>two hundred and twenty dollars and thirty-fvoe </em>cents, upon account of which said goods and chattels, the defendants remain indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of <em>two hundred and twenty dollars and thirty-fi/oe cents, </em>together with interest thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">Wherefore the plaintiffs demand judgment <em>against the defendant </em>for the said sum of <em>two hundred and t/uoenty dollars and thirty-fine cents, </em>with interest from <em>the tenth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two, and their costs of this action.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-11\">To this complaint the defendants served a demurrer, in the words following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-12\">\u201c The above named parties, John Kaylor and Daniel Kaylor, demur to the complaint of the plaintiffs in this action, and specify for grounds of their objection thereto\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-13\">\u201cFirst.\u2014That the said complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the said John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>and Daniel Kaylor in this, that it does not appear in or by said complaint at what time, or for what prices, or to whom the said goods and chattels, in said complaint mentioned, were delivered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">The motion was argued at special term, before Ingbaham, Fibst J., who delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">\u201cThere can be no doubt that the demurrer in this case is without foundation. \u201cThe complaint avers a sale and delivery of goods by the plaintiff to the defendants, specifying the amount claimed therefor. \u201c If there are defects in it, or passages which should be made more explicit, still there cannot be any doubt that a cause of action is stated. \u201c The mere omission, on the part of the plaintiff, to add the letter \u2018s\u2019 to the printed word \u2018defendant,\u2019 is a mere clerical error, which, under the present system, at any rate, should not be allowed to constitute a ground of demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">\u201c The motion is granted, with costs, but the defendants may, in five days, withdraw the demurrer and serve an answer, provided the same is accompanied with an affidavit of merits.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-8\"><em>Albert </em>Mathews, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-9\">The complaint states, \u201c <em>that the complaint </em>shows\u201d the plaintiffs\u2014without naming who they are\u2014sold and delivered to the defendant\u2014in the singular, not naming which of the five individuals named in the heading of the paper\u201420th October, 1852,450 bricks for $9 90 ; and then follows a mass of unintelligible cyphers and hieroglyphics\u2014\u201c amounting in the whole to $220 35,\u201d and alleges, as a conclusion of law, that the defendants\u2014not yet named and no joint obligation or undertaking of any one alleged\u2014remain indebted thereon in $220 35. The papers served must govern. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>5 Johns. 286; <em>Grahams. McCown, </em>5 P. R. 353; 1 C. R. N. S. 43; <em>George </em>v. <em>McEvoy, </em>1 C. R. N. S. 318.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-10\">I. The averment that <em>the complaint shows, </em>c., is bad. It cannot be pleaded to, so as to frame a proper issue. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>affidavit may be true, and yet no goods sold to any one. The complaint either shows what it pretends to, or it does not. If it does, the defendants cannot deny it, whether they ever had the goods or not. If it does not, it fails to state a cause of action, and is only to be reached by demurrer.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-5\">II. There is no averment of any assumpsit or undertaking to pay; and <em>non </em>constat, but the goods were paid for on delivery, or by exchange of other goods, or were sold for a <em>past </em>consideration. The averment, \u201c <em>remain </em>indebted,\u201d cannot aid, as it is only a conclusion of law, and cannot be denied in the answer or put in issue. <em>(Daniels </em>v. <em>Hallenback, </em>19 Wend. 408 ; <em>Pierson </em>v. Cooley, 1 Co. R. 91; <em>Beers </em>v. Squire, Ib. 84; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>7 Barb. 482; <em>McMurray </em>v. Gifford, 5 How. Pr. Rep. 14 ; 6 Ib. 86.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-6\">HI. The complaint does not state where the goods were sold or delivered, and is uncertain as to the time and place, nor does it state that the parties are residents or within the jurisdiction of the court. (Court of Appeals, <em>Trees </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>1 C. R. N. S. 413; <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>7 Barb. S. C. R. 80; <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Mattison, </em>5 Ib. 375; <em>Gillett </em>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>4 Denio, 80.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-7\">IT. The complaint does not show a <em>joint </em>indebtedness, or an indebtedness of either the Kaylors; at most it avers a sale to <em>one, </em>without saying which one, and it does not aver a co-partnership or joint undertaking or liability of any kind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">Y. The complaint is also irregular in stating no place of trial, as required by the Code. (Code, sec. 172 ; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>1 C. R. N. S. 26, n.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-9\"><em>Francis Tillou, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b153-10\">Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABN\">The omission of the letter \u201cs,\u201d in the word defendants, in the printed form, was a clerical error, which the court will overlook. It is not, of itself, a sufficient ground for demurring to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The complaint avers the delivery of goods and chattels at certain times, the dates whereof are given, and the amounts or value of them. The dates or times of delivery are stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>by words and numerals; that is, the year and the days by numerals, the months by words, with two of the months abbreviated, as follows: \u201cNov.,\u201d \u201cDec.,\u201d\u2014arising from the plaintiffs embodying the items of the account in the complaint. They were not obliged to do so, (Code, \u00a7 158,) but there is no objection to their doing it, if they see fit; and when they do, and the cause of action can be distinctly made out, the pleading is good. Such is the case here. A question might arise as to the manner of stating the times of delivery, but in that respect I think it sufficiently explicit and unmistakable. We are now to construe pleadings liberally, with a view to substantial justice, and it would not be promoted by seriously entertaining demurrers of this description. The defendants are fully apprised of the motive of the complaint against them. The cause of action is pointed out with unrequired particularity. No doubt or misconception respecting it could have led them to resort to a demurrer, the putting in of which must be attributed to a desire for delay, or to a love for hypercritical accuracy. The day for extreme precision in pleading is past.</p>\n<author id=\"b154-5\">Woodruff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Act\">I agree with my brethren, that the specific grounds assigned for the demurrer herein are properly overruled, but I am not willing to give my sanction to such a complaint as the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In my judgment, it fails to aver <em>foots, </em>upon the admission of which the court can say the defendants are liable to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">There is no averment of any promise to pay for the goods alleged to have been sold by the defendants to the plaintiffs. If it be said that the law implies a promise where it finds the legal duty, it may be answered, that until the <em>terms </em>of the sale are disclosed, we cannot discover what was the defendants\u2019 legal duty. Those <em>terms </em>are not given. Whether, according to the terms of sale, any thing is due, does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The defendants are not, by the averments in the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>put m <em>default. </em>It is not averred that they have broken any contract, failed to comply with any terms of sale, or omitted to pay moneys due.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We have often suggested that a statement that the defendant \u201c is indebted,\u201d or \u201c remains indebted,\u201d is a mere inference, and that it goes for nothing, unless the <em>facts alleged </em>warrant and sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Order at special term, overruling the demurrer, affirmed, with the usual leave to answer, on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
