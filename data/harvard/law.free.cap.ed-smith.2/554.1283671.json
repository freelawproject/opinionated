Where a contract is made with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">2. Where a contract is made with the contractor, with the owner commonly called the first or original contractor, and the work, &amp;c., done and performed, is in conformity with the .contract made with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">The first contractor might put up a different building or structure than that provided for by the contract; and the party who performed work or furnished materials towards the erebtion of such a structure, would have no lien against the owner of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">A lien against the owner, in favor of a sub-contractor, exists only when the work performed or the materials furnished by the sub-contractor are contemplated by the contract between the owner and the first contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">By the very terms of the statute, the work and labor or materials done or furnished by a sub-contractor, must not only be performed or furnished in pursuance of an agreement with the first contractor, but must be performed or furnished in conformity with the original contract made by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">The complaint must be amended. In its present form it does not set forth a sufficient cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
