Accordingly, although the owner, being prosecuted under that statute, puts his indebtedness in issue, so that the same, as well as the existence of the lien, is .determined by the trial; yet the judgment cannot be against the owner generally, but must direct a sale of his interest in the specific premises upon which the lien exists, to the extent of his right at the time the notice was filed, and must provide that the proceeds be applied to the payment of the costs and the amount found due, with interest\u2014that the residue of such proceeds, if any, be paid to the county clerk to abide the further order of the court\u2014and that, in case of a deficiency, the sheriff certify the amount in his report of sale, and that the claimant have execution therefor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b673-11\">Form of a judgment or decree, as settled and approved in this case.</headnotes>\n<court data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b673-12\">Special Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_u\">June, 1856.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b673-13\">Before Daly, J.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-14\">This was a proceeding under the \u201cact for the better security of mechanics and others erecting buildings and furnishing materials therefor, in the city and county of New York,\u201d passed July 11, 1851, and amended April 13,1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>The defendant, Edward Warren, being the owner of leasehold property, situate at numbers 252 and 254 Greenwich street-, whereon he was erecting two stores, contracted with the plaintiffs, under the firm name of S. B. Althause &amp; Co., to furnish the iron work required in the buildings. Upon the completion of the work by the plaintiffs, in conformity with their contract with the defendant, the former took from the latter his two promissory notes for the contract price, and gave him an ordinary receipt in full, at the foot of their bill as rendered. The notes were dated August 27, 1855, and \"were payable, one, for $1,500, ninety days after date, and the other, for $1,968 31, four months after date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">The first note having matured and remaining unpaid, the contractors, on the fifth of December, 1855, filed with the county clerk the notice prescribed in the sixth section of the act of 1851, for the purpose of effecting a lien upon the premises for the value of the iron and labor, \u201cperformed and furnished by them, by virtue of a contract with the owner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">After the maturity and non-payment of the second note, the contractors served upon the owner, under the fourth section, a notice to appear in this court, and submit to an accounting and settlement; in pursuance of which notice all the parties duly appeared by attorney. The usual order for the joining of issues and for the service of pleadings was entered, and the cause proceeded to issue upon complaint and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-7\">The answer averred, first, payment; and secondly, that before proceedings had been commenced to foreclose the lien, the defendant had conveyed the premises to one Henry Warren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-8\">On the trial, the defendant insisted that the acceptance of the notes and the receipt in full amounted to a payment of the contract price, and worked a waiver of the right to a lien; that Henry Warren, therefore, took the property unincumbered with the lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-9\">The cause was tried before Daly, J., without a jury, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the court, held, in substance, that the notes of the owner for his own debt did not constitute an absolute payment, but merely suspended the right of action until their maturity; that taking such notes did not divest the contractors of the right to <em>acquire </em>a lien, even before their maturity, but merely suspended the right to <em>enforce </em>it; and that the conveyance of the premises by the owner to a third party, after the notice had been filed, did not affect the right of the lienor to enforce the lien upon the non-payment of the notes at maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">Judgment was accordingly directed in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-6\">\u201d The counsel for the respective parties thereupon attended before the same judge, at the special term held in June, 1856, to settle the form of the judgment or decree to be entered in the cause, upon such settlement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-7\"><em>Andrew </em>Boardman, for the contractors, (plaintiffs,)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avh\">contended, that, inasmuch as the question of debt or no debt, as well as that of lien or no lien, had been put in issue, and the owner and contractor met in the same person, the plaintiffs were entitled to docket a personal\u2014as well as lien\u2014judgment; that otherwise, in pursuing their remedy under the lien in this case\u2014it appearing that there was a large prior mortgage, as well as also a prior lien\u2014the claimants might lose their claim ; that the lien might ultimately prove worthless ; that the defendant, in the mean time, might dispose of his property other than his interest in the premises in question, and thus the law, instead of affording \u201c better security \u201d to the plaintiffs, would have operated only to induce them, in reliance upon their lien, to neglect the prosecution of their claim in an ordinary action, which would have reached the general property of the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b675-8\"><em>Henry B. </em>Pierson, for the owner, (defendant,)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auf\">maintained, that a special decree must be entered, and that the court could not direct a general personal judgment in the cause.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b673-16\"> See <em>Teaz </em>v. <em>Chrystie, ante, </em>p. 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Daly, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arq\">J., sustained, substantially, the principles stated in the third, fourth and fifth of the reporter\u2019s head notes to this case.
