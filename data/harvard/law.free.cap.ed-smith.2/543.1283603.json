Clark covenants</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">\u2022.to sell to them the land, at the price of $4,500, with interest, payable half yearly, from November 1st, 1853; and 2. To lend them, in aid of the construction by them of three buildings upon the land, $4,500, payable in instalments during the course of the erection,' provided, however, the materials and workmanship shall prove, during the progress of the buildings, equal to those in a pattern house ; each instalment to bear interest from the day of payment. 3. All taxes and assessments now existing upon the land, to be paid-by Clark.. 4. The interest which shall have accrued, with any premium of insurance, tax or assessment, hereafter becoming a lien upon the premises, to be retained by Clark out of the last instalment of the loan. 5. O\u2019Brien and McNeven covenant to .erect upon the land three buildings, of a prescribed style, to be completed on the first day of January, 1854, in accordance with law and with the regulations of the fire department; and, upon notice, remove any lien that may be effected upon their interest in the premises, or that can affect the land under the lien law of this state, and cause any proceeding taken under that act to be discharged. 6. In default of a full performance of the covenants last above mentioned, the whole contract, at the option of Clark, to \u201c cease and determine,\u201d and he <em>\u201c </em>to have the right to sell all the right, title and interest of O\u2019Brien and McNeven in the premises, under this contract, at public auction,\u201d giving them ten days\u2019 notice thereof, \u201c and the surplus, after paying Clark, to be paid to them.\u201d <em>7. </em>They are to insure the buildings, when enclosed, in a satisfactory company, for a reasonable amount, and assign the policies to him as security; in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>fault whereof, Clark to insure and charge the premium to them. 8. When the -buildings are completed, Clark to-convey them and the land, in fee simple, to O\u2019Brien and McNeven, by a warranty deed, they at the same time executing to him three bonds, with mortgages upon the premises, \u201c in which their wives shall unite,\u201d the same to be for $3,000 each, payable within three years, with interest semiannually, and containing \u201c the usual thirty days interest and insurance clauses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-5\">The erection of the buildings was proceeded with by O\u2019Brien and McNeven. On the ninth of November, 1853, they received the fourth of the nine instalments provided for. On the 16th and 17th of the same month, the plaintiff, in pursuance of an agreement with them, and in conformity with the terms of their contract with Clark, furnished lumber to the buildings. On the 16th, O\u2019Brien and McNeven being insolvent, executed to the defendants, John W. Miller and Daniel Crane, a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">On the 18th, two days subsequently, the plaintiff filed a notice, pursuant to the sixth section of the \u201c act for the better security of mechanics,\u201d &amp;e., passed July 11,1851, specifying Clark as the owner, and O\u2019Brien and McNeven, and their assignees, as the persons against whom the claim was made; and afterwards proceedings were taken in the Sixth District Court to bring the supposed lien to a close. It was claimed, that at the time the notice was filed, the work upon the buildings had progressed so far and was of such quality as to render the fifth instalment due and payable. This was denied. Judgment was given in favor of the plaintiff, from which the defendant, Clark, appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">It appeared that afterwards, on the first day of December, 1853, without availing himself of the right to sell at auction, the defendant, Clark, entered into a contract with the assignees, to convey the premises to them, for their own personal use, and that they proceeded with the erection of the buildings on their own account.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>Augustus E. King, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoD\">Clark, urged, among other arguments, the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\">The contract between Clark, and O\u2019Brien and McNeven, was for the sale of the lots in question, and by it money was to be advanced only as a loan. It was not such a contract as is contemplated by the act commonly known as the lien law of July 11, 1851. The appellant was not erecting a house or houses on the premises. He was, it is true, owner in fee of the land, but he never had the slightest ownership in <em>the </em>houses erected thereon, except by the possibility of their reverting to him on non-compliance with the contract, and even then the contract provided that he might sell the property at auction, so that he was virtually dispossessed of all ownership in the property. And as matter of fact, since the appeal in this action was taken, the appellant has, in consequence of such dispossession, conveyed the property in fee under a contract with the assignees of the contractors for $5,000, being $475 less than the price agreed upon for the lots and the money actually advanced by him up to and including the said ninth day of November. He was not, in any sense, contemplated by the statute an \u201c owner.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-6\"><em>John M. Cooper </em>and <em>John B. Scoles, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbC\">argued the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">I. It makes no possible difference as to Clark\u2019s liability, whether the materials are to be considered as furnished to <em>Mm </em>through O\u2019Brien and McNeven as his agents, or furnished to <em>\u2018them </em>as contractors; in either case he is equally liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">II. It is not pretended that Clark should have notified the <em>\u201c material menP </em>We do say that he was bound to object to the boards when he saw them on the ground, and knew that they were to be used in the roofing of the houses by the contractors. If he was dissatisfied with them, of course the objection could be made to the <em>contractors. </em>By remaining silent and suffering the materials to be used in the houses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>he assented to their use and <em>accepted </em>the materials. This is the well established legal rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\">III. Parties cannot evade the lien law by such a contract as this. Until the land is conveyed by deed executed, the fee continues in the owner, and he is in law as in reality the owner of the houses which are being erected upon his land. If the contractors should never become entitled to a conveyance by the terms of the contract, the land and the houses are alike the property of the owner of the land. If the contractors become entitled to a conveyance, and get one, even then they do not obtain an entire seisin of the land, for they have immediately to execute a mortgage upon the property for the purchase money. That, under such circumstances, the contractors do not obtain an entire seisin of the land, has been clearly settled by adjudication. The wife, for this reason, is not dowable against the mortgage. (4 <em>Kent's </em>Commentaries, p. 39.) The houses, then, are going up on the owner\u2019s land, for the owner\u2019s benefit, and the lien of the material man attaches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-6\">IV. Calling the payment a \u201cloan \u201d does not alter the fact, nor vary the rule of law. O\u2019Brien and McNeven become entitled to their payment when their work and materials are received without objections, even though inferior to what the contract calls for, subject to deduction under circumstances of proof of deficiency, &amp;c. Otherwise, see the absurd conclusion that follows. The contractor furnishes labor and material, the owner of the land stands by, inspects and makes no objection, and after having thus received the benefit of the contractor\u2019s labor and materials, refuses to pay anything for them, alleging that they are inferior to what the contract calls for, and so the owner is to have his houses built for <em>nothing, </em>because they are not equal in materials or workmanship to the pattern house. This p Dsition, absurd upon its face, is the one seriously contended for on the other side. The true doctrine is laid in <em>Hollingshead </em>v. <em>Macher, </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>276, and <em>Korress </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>3 Fairf., 293.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-7\">We will quote the language of the authority from note in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Ohitty on Contracts, p. 451: \u201c Where one has interest into a special agreement to perform work for another and furnish materials, and the work is done, and the materials furnished, but <em>not in the niwrmer stipulated in the </em>contract, yet if the materials are of <em>any value or benefit </em>to the other party, he is answerable to the amount whereby benefitted.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-5\">This is the rule of law, and it is equally applicable to the ordinary contract for building a house, or a special contract like the present calling for advance of money, as work is performed and materials furnished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b564-6\">The defendant, Clark, was liable, first, on the ground that the hemlock boards were furnished <em>to </em>him, through O\u2019Brien and McNeven, as his agents; and secondly, on the ground that they were furnished to O\u2019Brien and McNeven as contractors, Clark being the owner.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b564-7\">By the Court. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEI\">It was decided by this court, in <em>McDermott </em>v. Palmer, that an owner of land who agrees, under what is usually denominated a building contract, to advance to the builder sums of money, from time to time, to be applied towards the erection of a building on the land, and when the building is finished, to convey the land to the builder, in fee, receiving from him a mortgage for the advances made, is not the owner of the building within the meaning of the lien law. Our decision in that case (which was made when the decisions of the Common Pleas were subject to review in the Supreme Court) was reversed by that court; (11 Barbour, 9;) but this court having made the same decision in <em>Loonie </em>v. Hogan, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, and the decision of this court sustained. (See 6 Selden\u2019s notes of cases in Court of Appeals, April, 1854, p. 42. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> That case arose under the act of 1830, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Gay v. Brown, </em>(1 E. D. Smith, 725,) the same construction was given to the act of 1851, under which the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>arises. This is decisive of the question of Clark\u2019s liability in this suit. There are several other grounds stated in the notice of appeal, upon which this judgment should be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>versed, but the ground above stated being conclusive, it be comes unnecessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\"> See, also, \u201c Notes of oases decided in the Court of Appeals, April 18, 1854,\u201d No. 6, p. <em>42, </em>prepared by Mr. Selden. The fourth volume of his regular reporte\u2014being the last as yet published by him\u2014concludes with the decisions of October, 1858; while the first publication of his successor, Mr. Keenan, commences with those of June, 1854.
