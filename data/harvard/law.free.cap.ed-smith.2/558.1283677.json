The usual order for a joinder of issues was entered, and the plaintiff filed his complaint, wherein he averred the performance of his labor in accordance with a ' contract of employment made with him by McOliff. There was no allegation that such labor conformed to any contract between McOliff and the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-11\">The cause now came before the court, upon an application for an injunction to restrain the defendants from tearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>down the building whereon the lien existed. Notice of the motion was served, by an order to show cause, upon both of the defendants, and was founded upon the complaint and upon affidavits that the plaintiffs were apprehensive of a design to destroy the building, whereby the efficiency of the lien would be impaired.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-5\"><em>James M. Sweeny </em>and <em>Rufus F. </em>Andrews, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-6\"><em>Robert J. </em>Dillon, counsel to the corporation, for the Mayor, &amp;e.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-7\"><em>Andrew C. </em>Morris, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK_\">McOliff, argued against the motion, as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-8\">The order to show cause why an injunction should not be granted, was served upon McOliff. The plaintiff seeks to restrain him, as well as the corporation, and he is entitled to appear at this stage of the proceedings, to oppose the application, although he is in default in failing to appear on the return of the notice to account and join issue. The plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction, unless it appears by his complaint that he is entitled to the relief demanded. (Code, \u00a7 219.) His complaint shows no cause of action. It merely states that he performed work in pursuance of a contract with McOliff. This is not enough to give him a lien.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b575-9\">Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">The corporation being the owner and McOliff the contractor, it should appear by the complaint that the work was performed and that the materials were furnished by the plaintiff to McOliff, <em>in conformity with the terms of the contract made by McOliff with the </em>owner, <em>the corporation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">This was essential to the right of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">The complaint contains no such averment, nor does that fact appear even by the notice filed with the county clerk. No right of action was shown in the complaint, and no injunction can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Motion for an injunction denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
