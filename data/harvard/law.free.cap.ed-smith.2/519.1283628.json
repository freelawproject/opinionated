The application was founded upon an affidavit of Van Wart, that he had never been the \u201c managing agent \u201d of the company, but simply a special agent in this city, and that he had resigned his post before the date of the alleged service. Further affidavits stated corroborative declarations on his part, and an attorney in the cause deposed, upon information and belief, to the same effect. No affidavit was produced from any officer of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">The hearing, on the order to show cause, took place at the end of January following, when the plaintiff read an explanatory affidavit from Van W art, averring that his resignation was in fact never accepted\u2014that an officer of the defendants had requested him to continue his agency, to which he had consented, for the purpose of closing their affairs in this city'\u2014\u2022 that subsequently to the service of the process, he had acted for them in investigating the origin of a fire\u2014and that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>promptly transmitted the summons to the company. Many of these statements were also corroborated by additional affidavits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">The court, at special term, refused to open the judgment, and awarded costs of the motion to the plaintiff, with leave to the defendants to renew.- The defendants appealed to. the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-6\"><em>Benjamin C. </em>Thayer, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGK\">cited Code, \u00a7 134; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Michigan Railroad </em>Company, How. Pr. Rep. 183; <em>Flinn </em>v. <em>Hudson River Railroad </em>Company, 6 Id. 308.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-8\"><em>Patrick </em>Callaghan, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b536-9\">By the Court. Woodruff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agn\">I am not satisfied that Yan Wart, upon whom the summons in this cause was served, ever was the \u201cmanaging agent\u201d of the defendants, within the meaning of \u00a7 134 of the Code of Procedure. Still less, that he was such \u201cmanaging agent\u201d after he had resigned his agency, although he consented to act as agent <em>\u201cto settle thevr business in New York.\u201d </em>But his relation to the company, and the extent of his agency and powers, are so imperfectly disclosed by the affidavits\u2014and the affidavits of Yan Wart himself, upon which the motion was founded, are so thoroughly impeached by his own counter affidavit, that I think the court at special term very properly refused to set aside the judgment, upon the single ground specified in the order to show cause. The defendants were, I think, properly required to establish the irregularity more clearly, \u25a0especially when it is obviously within <em>thei/r </em>power to show what was the precise nature and extent of Yan Wart\u2019s agency for them in this city. An opportunity was given to the def\u00e9ndahts to do this, by renewing their motion, if so advised. And I think the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Order affirmed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
