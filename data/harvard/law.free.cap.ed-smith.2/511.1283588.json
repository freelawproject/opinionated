J. Henyon: \u201c The columns are square by casing; they are not so deep as wide ; they are about 5 inches deep; there is no passage from one story to another; you have to go from the corner house to each floor. \u201cI made the diagram'; I made it from the building on Eighth street; the height is 30 feet <em>2-} </em>inches; the width on Eighth street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>and in the rear is fifteen feet, and the depth is 27 feet; it is three stories; the first story is a little over 9 feet high, the other two stories a little over 9 feet each in height; the front is all wood work; the opening between the front store and this rear building is 10 feet 6 inches; the rear building is part of the front store; as the uprights now stand, they are ordinary columns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">And by J. Scofield: \u201c I was the builder of this piazza; the upper floors are supported entirely by beams running from wall to wall; the upright casings on the side on Eighth street and the side opposite are no support, and were not intended as supports to the platforms; there are no posts within those casings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">It was contended, in behalf of the defendant, that the provision for a <em>continuing </em>penalty, which does not attach until notice, was inapplicable to this case, on the ground that the notice given by the fire warden was insufficient. This notice was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">\u201c Mr. Buffum, No. \u2014, cor. Eighth street and Avenue B.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">\u201cSir,\u2014You are hereby directed to remove the following named violation of the fire laws, to wit: A piazza, three stories high, the two upper stories enclosed with wood, the same being contrary to law, on or before the 13th day of July, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">\u201cNew York, 3d day of July, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-10\">\u201c James Gilmore,</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-11\">\u201c 168 Orchard street,</p>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-12\">\u201c Fire Warden of the city of New York.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-13\">The defendant offered to prove that the building was constructed with the consent and approbation of a fire warden. This testimony was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-14\">The cause was tried before a jury, and a verdict rendered in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for $2,000. Judgment was perfected for that sum and costs. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-15\"><em>Alfred Dickinson, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am9\">made and argued the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>I. The judge erred in refusing to allow the defendant to show, that in the putting up or finishing the alleged violation, he acted under the direction and with the approbation of the fire wardens. 1st. This was an issue expressly raised by the pleadings. 2d. The fire wardens were the officers of the Fire Department, within whose express province it was to decide whether the alleged violation was a violation of the law, and after they had decided that the building was not a violation, and it had been erected or finished under their approbation, the plaintiffs could not insist to the contrary. 3d. The notice of Gilmore could not be construed as showing that he, as one of the fire wardens, considered it a violation. After the alleged violation had, in its erection, received his approval, if his notice was not calculated to mislead as not applying to the erection in question, it was too late for him to change his opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-5\">II. The judge erred in refusing to allow the defendant to show for what purpose the alleged violation was used,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-6\">III. The judge erred in refusing to grant a nonsuit and dismissal of the complaint, as applied for on the trial. 1st The notice served on the defendant was to take down <em>\u201c </em>a piazza, three stories high, the two upper stories enclosed with wood.\u201d And it was not shown that the defendant had erected or was in possession of any such piazza at the time. The evidence shows that the lower part of the alleged violation was not a piazza, but was a part of the store, corner of Eighth street and Avenue B., being enclosed with brick, with the exception of the door and windows in Eighth street; and the two upper stories (so called) were not enclosed with wood, but that two sides were wholly of brick, and on the other two only so much wood was used as to prevent persons from falling therefrom, to wit, a panel work of about 2\u00a3 feet high. This certainly cannot be said to be enclosed with wood. The notice to the defendant calls the alleged violation <em>a piazza. </em>Then it must be an appurtenance to a house, and being an appurtenance of a house, it must not be looked upon as a separate building, erected and finished on Eighth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>street, but what the plaintiffs call in their testimony the front and rear, are properly the sides. 2d. The notice and complaint do not agree in the character and description of the alleged violation. The notice calls it a piazza, three stories high, the two upper stories enclosed with wood. The complaint calls it a building or shed, erected on the rear of land situate on the northerly corner of Avenue B. and Eighth street. 3d. The notice served on the defendant does not specify a building, or any violation within the meaning of the statute. The term <em>piazza </em>is of well known signification. It is a mere appurtenance to a building, and does not exist separate and apart therefrom. It is not mentioned in the fire laws, and is not included in the term building or shed. 4th. The evidence does not sustain the allegations of the complaint in the description or character of the alleged violation, and the evidence had shown no violation of the statute within the meaning thereof. The complaint charges, \u201cthat the said building or shed so erected or limited, was not and is not made or constructed of stone or brick, or any fire proof materials, nor was, nor is it constructed with party or outside walls of stone or brick, but on the contrary thereof, the said building or shed was and is and the only outside walls the said alleged violation had or has, were and are, made and constructed of wood.\u201d Now if the alleged violation is to be considered as a building or shed, and separate, distinct and disconnected from any other building, except in so far as it adjoins and lies contiguous toother buildings, then the allegations of the-complaint are not sustained by the evidence; for, 1st. The first floor or story is shown to be enclosed by brick walls on the two sides and in the rear, and the front only is composed of a door and windows; and 2d. The two upper stories are not enclosed, except on the two sides, and they are brick party walls; the front and rear are not enclosed with walls of any materials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">IY. The plaintiffs have brought their action under the statute for a <em>penalty, </em>which goes on to increase day by day during the whole course of legal proceedings, and which, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ever honestly defended for the purpose of maintaining Ms legal rights, subjects the defendant to the risk of being ruined in case of failure to sustain Ms position. This, therefore, is a highly penal statute, and is in this action so considered and used by the plaintiffs. It is in derogation of the common law, and the plaintiffs must bring this case within the strict and literal terms of the statute, which in this case can receive no liberal or equitable construction. (Dwarris on Stat. p. 64; 4 Term R. 665 ; <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Birdsall, </em>2 Cowen, 419; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>5 Ib. 210; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>6 Ib. 567; <em>Van Valkenburgh </em>v. <em>Torrey, </em>7 Ib. 252; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Hopper, </em>1 Strange, 258.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-5\">V. The alleged violation does not come within the 19th section of the statute. This was so held by the judge on the trial, and was so admitted by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. It must, therefore, be urged b.y the plaintiffs to come under the words \u201cand other buildings,\u201d in sections 2 and 3 of the statute. Here the plaintiffs must fail, because, 1st. It cannot be considered a building within the meaning of the statute, a part of it being actually an incorporated part of the corner store, and in no manner built contrary to the statute, and the other part being a mere adjunct of a building. 2d. The words \u201c and other buildings\u201d must be construed in this, a penal statute, as meaning a building of the kind mentioned in these sections immediately preceding those words, to wit, \u201c dwelling-houses, stores, storehouses.\u201d (Dwarris on Stat. p. 69; Com. Dig. Act Parl. R. 20.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">VI. The judgment in behalf of the plaintiffs is erroneous and should be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-7\"><em>Augustus F. Smith, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae1\">made and argued the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-8\">I. The fire warden has by law no authority, direct or indirect, to permit a citizen to violate the fire law, and whatever he may have said to the defendant, cannot affect his liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-9\">II. The motion for nonsuit was properly denied. 1. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>first penalty is given without reference to the notice, and though that may be defective, the nonsuit could not be granted. 2. The notice was good in form; no particular form is prescribed. It was only necessary that it should call the attention of the defendant to the violation complained of. (\u00a7\u00a7 24 and 29.) 3. The evidence showed a clear violation of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-5\">III. The opinion of a witness that the building was not a violation, or evidence that the defendant did not design to violate the law, was not admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\">IV. Nor was evidence admissible of the purpose to which the building was appropriated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-7\">By the Court. Daly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApdK\">There can be no doubt that the building put up by the defendant was in violation of the second and third sections of the act. (Laws of 1849, p. 118.) The act requires that all buildings erected within certain limits shall be constructed of brick, stone, or other fire proof material. This was a building within the meaning of the act, and was not so constructed. It was of three stories. The first was composed entirely of wood and glass, and the rear, above the first story, was of the same material.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The proposed evidence was inadmissible. The consent of the fire warden, if it had been obtained, would have been no protection to the defendant. A fire warden could not dispense with the requisitions of the statute, nor authorize the putting up of a prohibited structure. Whether the lower part was finished in the manner the defendant told the warden he intended to finish it, or what the warden said to the defendant, was equally immaterial. This was not an action for damages, which could be increased or diminished by the jury, but an action to recover a specific penalty for putting up a building in violation of the fire laws. The only thing to be ascertained was, whether the defendant had put up such a building, for if he had, the penalty was incurred, whoever may have advised him to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">There was no ground for the motion for a nonsuit. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>motion was founded upon the alleged insufficiency in the notice. But the plaintiff was entitled to recover a penalty of $500, independently of any notice, the proof of which was material only in respect to the additional penalties claimed for the continuation of the violation. The plaintiff, therefore, was entitled to recover the $500 penalty, though his notice may have been defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The material point in- the case is, whether the notice given was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to the additional penalties. Where a statute prescribes the form, or the substance of a notice, it must be fully and strictly complied with. <em>(Reg. </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>Cowp. 30; <em>Dorsan </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>1 East, 64; <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Esp. 198.) No form of notice is prescribed by the act, nor does it declare what it shall contain, otherwise than that it shall be a notice to the party to remove the violations. The notice given was certainly very general. Except in its being directed to the defendant, at the place, it did not point out where the building was situated. He was required to remove, and the building itself was described as, a piazza. Still we cannot say that it was not sufficient to apprise the defendant that he was required to remove the building he had put up in violation of the act. This is a remedial statute, and both in respect to the cases intended to be embraced by it, and the form of proceeding under it, it is to be liberally construed. <em>(Johns </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>3 Dow\u2019s R. 15; <em>Atcheson </em>v. <em>Everitt, </em>Cowp. 391; <em>Sickles </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>13 Johns. 497.) If the defendant wished to avail himself of the alleged insufficiency in the notice, he should have asked the judge to instruct the jury, that if they believed, from the notice and from all the circumstances in the case, that the defendant was not apprised and did not know what he was called upon to remove, that then the plaintiffs could not recover the additional penalties. But as the case comes before us, we cannot say, as matter of law, that the notice was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
