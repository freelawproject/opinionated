The Court sentenced him to confinement in the Maryland House of Correction for a term of eight years. He is applying here for leave to appeal from denial of a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">First, petitioner contends that the Court admitted evidence against him which had been obtained by illegal search and seizure. ,We have repeatedly stated that the legality of a search and seizure may be raised on appeal, but cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. Presley v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, 201 </em>Md. 660, 92 A. 2d 754; <em>Dodson v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, 201 </em>Md. 655, 92 A. 2d 754; <em>Sykes v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>201 Md. 662, 93 A. 2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Secondly, petitioner contends that the weapon used to commit the crimes was never introduced at his trial, and that the evidence produced- against him was not sufficient to convict him. The question of guilt or innocence or the sufficiency of evidence to sustain a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>viction cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. Lombardi v. Warden, Maryland Penitentiary, </em>203 Md. 664, 99 A. 2d 729; <em>Bonsuk v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>203 Md. 671, 100 A. 2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Thirdly, petitioner contends that a revolver was obtained by the police by illegal search and seizure, but it was devoid of any bullets, and therefore the indictment was faulty in charging possession of a deadly weapon. Although petitioner alleges a defect in the indictment, which cannot be considered on <em>habeas corpus, Ahern v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>203 Md. 679, 102 A. 2d 567, he is actually complaining of insufficiency of evidence, which also cannot be considered on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
