In an action on the case brought by appellants, the minor children of John Hedlund, under section 9 of the Dram-Shop Act, against appellees for injury to plaintiffs\u2019 means of support occasioned by the habitual intoxication of their father, the second count of the declaration averred that the defendant Geyer, by selling and giving intoxicating liquor to plaintiffs\u2019 father, caused his habitual intoxication, in whole or in part, for a period of years, etc.; that the defendants Uihlein and the Brewing Company owned, rented, leased or permitted the occupancy of certain saloons and dram-shops on premises other than those occupied by the defendant Geyer, having knowledge that intoxicating liquors were to be sold therein, and knowingly permitted therein the sale and gift, by their tenant Lundquist and other tenants, of intoxicating liquors which caused the intoxication, in whole or in part, of plaintiffs\u2019 father; that by means of the premises the plaintiffs had been injured in their means of support, etc. So far as the question here presented is concerned, the first count may be regarded as in substance the same as the second.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\" pgmap=\"246\">Each defendant demurred specially to the declaration, upon the ground that upon the facts stated in either count there was no joint liability between Geyer and the other defendants, and the other defendants were improperly joined as defendants with Geyer. The demurrers were sustained, \u201con the ground of the misjoinder of the defendants,\u201d an&amp; the plaintiffs abiding by their declaration, there was final judgment for defendants, and plaintiffs appealed.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-6\" pgmap=\"246\">Carl A.

The only provision as to damages in section 9 is that found in the second clause. That there is no distinction in respect to damages between the seller and the owner of the building; that both are liable for'exemplary damages, was decided in Hackett v. Smelsley, 77 Ill. 109, cited and approved in Beckerle v. Brandon, 229 id. 323.</p> <p id=\"b248-5\" pgmap=\"248\">The second clause creates the liability on the part of the owner or lessor, and the last sentence of that clause provides that such owner or lessor, in the contingencies therein specified, \u201cshall be liable, severally or jointly, with the person or persons selling or giving intoxicating liquors aforesaid, for all damages sustained and for exemplary damages.\u201d The words, \u201cperson or persons selling or giving intoxicating liquors,\u201d had not theretofore been used in the second clause, but only in the first clause of the section. The words, \u201cintoxicating liquors,\u201d had been twice used in the last clause, in the sentence that provides that if the owner, etc., \u201chaving knowledge that intoxicating liquors are to be sold therein, or who having leased the same for other purposes shall knowingly permit therein the sale of any intoxicating liquorsetc. In construing the section we are to take the words which make the owner, \u201cliable, jointly or severally, with the person or persons selling or giving intoxicating liquors aforesaid,\u201d and determine with whom the owner is thereby made liable, \u201cjointly or severally.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b248-6\" pgmap=\"248(99) 249(246)\">The owner\u2019s tenant is not liable unless he, by selling or giving intoxicating liquors, caused the intoxication \u201cin whole or in part.\u201d The owner is not liable unless his tenant is liable for selling or giving intoxicating liquors in the premises of the owner. To hold that the owners in this case are liable jointly with Geyer, who was not their tenant, is not to extend their liability, but only to join with them another defendant. If liable, they are liable, not for the acts of Geyer, but for the act of their tenants alone, and are so liable because they leased to him to sell, or knowingly permitted him to sell, in tbeir premises, and he did sell therein, intoxicating liquors which caused, \u201cin whole or in part,\u201d the intoxication of John Hedlund. The owner\u2019s liability is, by the provisions of that statute, put upon the same grounds as that of the seller, which is, that each has caused or contributed to the intoxication of a person, in consequence of which intoxication another person has been injured. It matters not under the statute that the owner and seller may have caused or contributed to such intoxication in different ways, the one by selling, the other by knowingly leasing or permitting in his premises the selling by another. The causing or contributing to the intoxication of one person, in consequence of which intoxication another person is injured, is the cause of action and only cause of action created by the statute. In Emory v. Addis, 71 Ill. 273, it was said, pp. 277-8: \u201cThere can be but one recovery for an injury done under this statute. A recovery and satisfaction by a party injured against one, would constitute an effectual bar to any recovery against another who \u2018in part\u2019 may have contributed to the intoxication of the person who committed the injury. The party injured may elect to proceed severally or jointly against the persons who cause the intoxication, but he can have but one satisfaction for the injury.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b249-4\" pgmap=\"249\">I think that the statute makes the owner, if liable with Ms tenant, liable with every other seller, whether such seller was or was not his tenant, and that in tMs case there was no misjoinder of defendants.</p> <p id=\"b249-5\" pgmap=\"249\">The judgment of the Circuit Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b249-6\" pgmap=\"249\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b249-7\" pgmap=\"249\">Mr. Presiding Justice Baker, dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
