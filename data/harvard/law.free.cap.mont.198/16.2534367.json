The fact the Defendant received a nondangerous designation would well indicate the sentence imposed was not too severe under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We wish to thank Brian Holland of the Montana Defender Project for his assistance to the Defendant and to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-8\">Leonard Langen, Chairman; Joseph Gary, James Salansky</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
