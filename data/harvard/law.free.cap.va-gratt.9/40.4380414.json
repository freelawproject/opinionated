Wood against John Slack in the Circuit court of Kanawha. Slack had been the high sheriff of Kanawha county, and Wood, James T. Swindler and others were his sureties. \u2022 Several judgments had been recovered against Slack and his sureties for the defaults of one of his deputies. Upon these judgments executions issued which were returned by the sheriff as .paid by James T. Swindler and Henry H. Wood. Subsequently Wood gave Slack notice that he would ask for a judgment against him for the amount of these executions as having been paid by himself; and Slack not appearing, there was a judgment in favor of Wood against Slack for the amount of 318 dollars 61 cents, with interest thereon from the 24th of May 1847, until paid and his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-11\">After this judgment had been recovered, Slack applied for an injunction thereto, on the ground that Wood had not paid one cent of the money for which the judgment had been obtained; but that it was paid by the other surety, James T. Swindler; and he alleged that these facts came to his knowledge after the judgment was rendered, and that consequently he could not by any possibility have made his defence at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The injunction was granted; and the defendant Wood without answering the bill moved to dissolve the injunction as improvidently awarded; and the court sustained the motion. From this decree dissolving the injunction, Slack applied to this court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-4\"><em>Parks, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\"><em>B.

The proceeding which resulted in this judgment was by notice in writing under the act of assembly in which it was alleged that sundry judgments specified in the notice, had been recovered against Wood as such surety aforesaid, and that he had been compelled to- pay the amount specified in the notice, on account thereof. The notice was served upon Slack, but he failed to appear and contest the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover; and the court, on hearing the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, rendered judgment in his behalf for the- amount above stated. Slack subsequently filed this bill in the Circuit court of Kanawha, stating the recovery of said judgment against him, and exhibiting a copy of the record of the proceeding in which it was had: And he alleged that he had been informed and believed \u201c that Wood had never paid one cent of one of the judgments set out in his aforesaid notice, but that the said judgments being not against the said Wood alone, but against\u201d himself (said Slack) and his securities in his official bond, they were paid by James T. Swindler, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>(then deceased,) another of his said sureties. He further alleged that those facts came to his knowledge after the said judgment had heen rendered, and that he had had no knowledge or intimation of them until after that period; and that consequently he could not by any possibility have made his defence at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The bill made Wood and the sheriff of Kanawha parties defendants, and prayed an injunction to restrain the collection of the said judgment, and such other and further relief as justice and equity might require. The injunction prayed for was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The defendants appeared by counsel, and without filing an answer to the bill, gave notice that they would move to dissolve the injunction as improvidently allowed, at a future day of the court. And subsequently the motion having been made, the court by its order did dissolve the injunction on the ground assigned: And to this decree a <em>supersedeas </em>has been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">The grounds on which a court of equity will interfere to grant relief against a judgment at law in the nature of a new trial, are confessedly somewhat narrow and restricted. It is not sufficient to show that injustice has been done, but it must appear also that it was not occasioned by the inattention of the party complaining: And a bill seeking relief of this character is watched by equity with extreme jealousy. <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Willoe, </em>1 Sch. &amp; Lef. 201. In delivering his opinion in that case, Lord Redesdale said that \u201cRules are established, some by the legislature, some by the courts themselves, for the purpose of putting an end to litigation; and it is more important that an end should be put to litigation than that justice be done in every case.\u201d Ib. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">In the case of <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Jayne, </em>6 John. Ch. R. 479, Chancellor Kent states the settled doctrine and practice of the court of equity as well as of courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>law, to be, that a party is not entitled to relief after verdict upon testimony which with ordinary care and diligence he might have procured and used upon the trial at law: And he adds that \u201c it would be establishing a grievous precedent, and one of great public inconvenience, to interfere in any other case than one of indispensable necessity and wholly free from any kind of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">This doctrine has been fully recognized in this court by repeated adjudications. <em>Beirne </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>5 Leigh 364; <em>Oswald &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Tyler &amp;c., </em>4 Rand. 19 ; <em>Faulkner\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Harwood, </em>6 Rand. 125. And to the same effect are <em>De Lima </em>v. <em>Glassell\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 369; <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>139; Tapp </em>v. <em>Rankin, </em>9 Leigh 478; <em>Donally </em>v. <em>Ginnatt\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>5 Leigh 359 ; <em>Haden </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>7 Leigh 157 ; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>Id. 227; <em>Auditor </em>v. <em>Nicholas, </em>2 Munf. 31; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>6 Rand. 142; <em>Fenwick </em>v. <em>Macmurdo, </em>2 Munf. 244. In the case of <em>Faulkner\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Harwood, </em>it was held that a court of equity, will not grant relief merely because injustice has been done: The party applying for a new trial, to entitle himself to it, must show that he has been guilty of no <em>laches; </em>that he has done everything that could reasonably be required of him to render his defence effectual at law. And the reasons for establishing and enforcing this rule and practice are given by Judge Carr, in his opinion, with his accustomed clearness; and they seem to apply in all their force to the present case. The complainant alleges that at the time of the rendition of the judgment at law against him he was ignorant of the fact that the money due on the judgments recovered against him and his sureties had been paid by James T. Swindler, and that no part whatever had been paid by Wood. But he does not allege that he used due diligence or made any efforts or enquiries before the trial at law to obtain information upon this subject. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>it would appear that by the exercise of reasonable diligence, and by making proper enquiry in the proper quarters, he might have been readily led to discover whether Wood had in fact paid any of the moneys claimed to have been paid by him for the complainant, and if any, the amount <em>thereof; </em>and of this information when obtained he could have fully availed himself in his defence in the court of law. His failure to institute any such enquiry when served with Wood\u2019s notice would seem to be exactly that sort of inattention and <em>laches </em>on his part which should serve to debar him from any claim for relief in a court of equity against its. consequences. The court is therefore of opinion that the injunction to the judgment at law upon the grounds assigned in the bill was improvidently granted ; and that there is no error in the order of the court dissolving the same; which is accordingly affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
