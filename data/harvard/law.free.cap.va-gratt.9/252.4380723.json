In June 1823, Archibald Stuart sold to Abbott a tract of land then in the county of Monroe, but now in the county of Mercer, for 300 dollars, retaining the title. In 1826 Abbott made payments amounting to about 212 dollars 85 cents, and in 1829 he paid 6 dollars. In 1831 he sold the land to William Brown for 300 dollars, who paid him 210 dollars of the purchase money. In 1833 Brown paid to Gerard B. Stuart, one of the executors, 50 dollars, when Stuart gave to him the following paper:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-14\">\u201c Received of William Brown 50 dollars, being part of a balance due on a bond executed by St. Clair Abbott to Archibald Stuart for 100 acres of land lying on Simmon\u2019s fork in the county of Giles, which land was sold by said Abbott to said Brown. Said Stuart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>executors agree to make a title to said Brown for the land as soon as Brown pays to them the balance of the purchase money due to said Abbott, provided that said balance amounts to 40 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\"><em>Gerard B.

Stuart, one of the executors, to the defendant William Brown, should be regarded as intended to make a new and substantive contract variant from that made by the testator in his lifetime with the defendant Abbott. Conceding, however, that it was so intended, yet under the circumstances of the case, it should not be allowed to have that effect. There were three representatives (of whom Gerard B. Stuart was one) charged with the official duty of collecting the assets of the estate; and with the further duty of conveying the land in the bill mentioned when the price of it should be paid. The only available security for the debt, which is part of the assets, is the land itself, inasmuch as Abbott, the purchaser, is utterly insolvent; and the arrangement made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Gferard B. Stuart, as understood by the appellees\u2019 counsel, is an executory contract to waive and renounce the only means of collecting a large proportion of the debt: In effect they would make it a contract to commit waste of the assets committed to the charge of the executors. 2 Wms. on Ex\u2019ors 1104. Such a contract, if made, should receive no countenance in any court; it should not be enforced against Gferard B. Stuart himself; much less should the other executor and the executrix be compelled to unite in the <em>devastavit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">I am of opinion that the decree should be reversed, with costs to the <em>appellants; </em>that the cause should be remanded to the Circuit court with directions to render a decree in favor of complainants against St. Clair Abbott for the balance due on his bond of June <em>26, </em>1823, with interest until paid, and costs of suit; and if the amount be not paid in a reasonable time to be fixed by the court, that the land in the proceedings mentioned, or so much thereof as may be necessary, be sold to pay the same and the costs of sale, on credits of six, eighteen and thirty months, for equal portions thereof, bearing interest, retaining the title as security for the price. If the money decreed to complainants shall be paid, that the deed filed in the papers be delivered to the defendant William Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Judge <em>Samuels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
