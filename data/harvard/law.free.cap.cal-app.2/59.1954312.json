B. Fincher, of the age of thirteen years, with the intent then and there to arouse, appeal to, and gratify the lust, passions and sexual desires of the said Harry B. Zuell and the said George B. Fincher. \u2019 \u2019 Then follows a statement of the acts of the said defendant. The defendant demurred to the information upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a crime, in that the act charged is alleged to have been committed between two male persons. The court sustained the demurrer and held \u201cthat the words \u2018lewd and lascivious, \u2019 as used in the statute, had reference only to an act attempted or committed between persons of the opposite sex.\u201d The people prosecute this appeal from the judgment and order sustaining the demurrer. An information similar to the one here was held by this court to state facts sufficient to constitute a public offense in <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>1 Cal.
