In support of this ruling, it is contended by the respondent that the contract was void under the statute of frauds, for the reasons: (1) That it was \u201cnot to be performed within a year from the making thereof\u201d; and (2) that the contract was to purchase goods, wares, and merchandise of greater value than $200. And in support of these positions section 1973 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 1739 of the Civil Code, are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"Av2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>But as to the first contention, it is clear that it cannot be sustained. The time for the performance of defendant's promise was within a year from the sixteenth day of June, 1903, which is to be taken as the date of the contract. Prior to that time there was no contract, but-a pollicitation only from the defendant. (Holland\u2019s Jurisprudence, 196.) The second point, we think, is also untenable.- The consideration of the defendant\u2019s promise was not the sale of the stock, but its purchase by the plaintiff, which was carried into execution; and the transfer of the stock contemplated was a mere condition of the defendant\u2019s promise, and therefore merely inci- \u25a0 dental. The case is in principle the same as that of <em>Kilbride </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>113 Cal. 432, 54 Am. St. Rep. 361, 45 Pac. 812, and no substantial distinction can be made between the two cases. This conclusion is also supported by the decision in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brookins, </em>23 Mich. 48, [9 Am. Rep. 74), which seems to be directly in point, and with the reasoning nf which we are entirely satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Gray, P. J., and Allen, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
