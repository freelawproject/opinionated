The judgment and order so appealed from were affirmed. (See <em>County of Mendocino </em>v. <em>Peters, ante, </em>p. 24, [82 Pac. 1122].) The present appeal is from an order, made after such judgment was entered, decreeing \u201cthat said plaintiff take possession of and use the property described therein during the pendency of and until the final conclusion of the litigation herein.\u201d The judgment having been affirmed, no judgment which could be rendered on this appeal would afford appellants any relief. Reversal could not benefit nor affirmance injure him. The order cannot add to nor subtract from the judgment this day affirmed, for the effect of such judgment is to pass title and right of possession to plaintiff. The affirmance, therefore, renders the order <em>functus officio, </em>and the questions presented become entirely moot. \u201cIt thus appears that the parties to the litigation have no rights which can be affected by a reversal of the order, and that the correctness of the order has become merely an abstract question. The demands of actual practical litigation are too pressing to permit the examination or discussion of academic questions, such as this ease in its present situation presents.\u201d <em>(Foster </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Cal. 612, [47 Pac. 591, 592]; <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Reddy, </em>135 Cal. 430, [67 Pac. 683]; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Voorsanger, </em>143 Cal. 214, [76 Pac. 1031]; <em>San Diego </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>97 Cal. 438, [32 Pac. 517].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Chipman, P.
