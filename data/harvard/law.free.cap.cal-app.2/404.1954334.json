A demurrer was interposed to the petition; the main objections being that the petition does not state facts sufficient to authorize the issuance of a writ of mandate, because the demand was based upon a certain water right and contract which provided for furnishing other lands along said ditch with certain quantities of water, and the petition fails to state whether the defendant has sufficient water to furnish for irrigating said other lands and to give the plaintiffs the water demanded. There were many other objections to the petition raised by said -demurrer, but it seems to have been sustained upon the ground above stated. The plaintiffs decline to amend, and judgment was rendered denying the writ; hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The defendant is the owner of a water system established for the purpose of furnishing water for irrigating a large tract of land in the San Juan grant, Sacramento county, and for domestic use. The owners of said land to be irrigated from said system caused the same to be subdivided into lots, and sold the same to different purchasers. The plaintiffs became the purchasers and owners of three of said lots, to wit, lot 1 in block 11, and lots 5 and 7 in block 12, containing thirty acres in all, and became the owners of a water right from defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The said water right is as follows, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cWATER RIGHT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u201cThis agreement (subject to the terms and conditions of a certain contract made and entered into on the 14th day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of April, 1896, and April 14, 1899, between first parties hereto and the Howard &amp; Wilson Publishing Company), made and entered into this 18th day of April, 1900, by and between C.

Thompson, both as to the lots mentioned and the water right set out. The petition alleges that the said land of plaintiffs was and is contiguous to and within the flow of the main pipe line of defendant for the carrying of water, and is under cultivation. The petition sets forth: That the water rates are due and payable on the 1st of November of each year, and the irrigating season is from April 1st to November 10th. Plaintiffs notified defendant, before the irrigating season of 1904 commenced, of the amount of water they would need. That defendant is furnishing plaintiffs with water for irrigating, but in quantities less than twenty-six thousand four hundred gallons of water per day during the irrigating season, and that this is delivered at irregular intervals, and defendant states that it will not, at any time, furnish any greater quantity of water. That any less quantity than the maximum, as specified in the water right, is wholly inadequate and insufficient. That said Thompson would not have purchased said lots if it had not been for the terms and conditions of the water right, nor would he have planted said lots to trees, and, but for the said water right, the plaintiffs would not have purchased said lots from said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Thompson. Without the maximum quantity of water the trees will be permanently injured. That defendant has at all times been, and is, the owner of a sufficient quantity of water to supply plaintiffs with all the water necessary for their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Under these conditions, facts, and circumstances,\u00bb and the limitations found in the water right above set out in full, can the writ of mandate be invoked to compel the defendant to do what the plaintiffs claim it should do 1 The water appropriated by defendant for its system is taken from the North Fork of the American river, and is appropriated for. the purpose of selling, renting, and furnishing for irrigation and other useful purposes, and it is therefore in the exercise of a public trust, and, of course, owes a public duty which the law will require it to perform irrespective of any contract. The constitution of California provides (section 1, article XIV) that \u201cthe right of all water now appropriated, or that may hereafter be appropriated, for sale, rental, or distribution, is hereby declared to be a public trust.\u201d Section 552 of the Civil Code also provides: \u201cWhenever any person who is cultivating land on the line and within the flow of any ditch owned by such corporation, has been furnished water by it, with which to irrigate his land, such person shall be entitled to the continued use of said water, upon the same terms as those who have purchased their land of the corporation.\u201d Not only is the land of plaintiffs being cultivated and within the flow of the ditch and water system of defendant, but it is a part of the tract for which the water was appropriated by defendant to irrigate, and there is therefore a duty, under the law, resting upon the defendant to furnish this tract of land with water; and, had the defendant failed to furnish such water, it could be compelled by a writ of mandate to furnish it in the quantity needed, if it (the defendant) has a sufficient supply for all the lands within the flow requiring water.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">As we understand the duties imposed on corporations which have appropriated water for sale and for irrigating purposes, before they can be compelled to perform that duty, there must exist the following conditions; the same appearing in the complaint or petition for a writ: 1. The land for which water is sought to irrigate must lie within the flow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of said ditch; 2. A showing that such corporation has the water in quantity required to supply the one demanding and all the others equally entitled (see <em>Price </em>v. <em>Riverside L. &amp; I. Co., </em>56 Cal. 439); 3. That notice be given the irrigating company of the amount of water required <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Riverside L. &amp; I. Co., </em>supra); and 4. Payment of the rates of tender thereof when due, and an allegation of willingness to pay when due <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Riverside L. &amp; I. Co., </em>56 Cal. 439). All of the prerequisites are admitted to be necessary by the appellants, except the second, for they set them out in the complaint, and, as to the second, plaintiffs allege that defendant \u201cis the owner of a sufficient quantity of water to supply plaintiffs with all the water necessary for their use,\u201d and do not allege, as we think they must, that the quantity is sufficient to supply plaintiffs, and all others entitled to water, the quantity required. Each water taker in a municipality, by paying the rates fixed, has a right to use a reasonable quantity of the water appropriated for public use, to be used in a reasonable manner <em>(McCrary </em>v. <em>Beaudry, </em>67 Cal. 120, [7 Pac. 264]), and this evidently depends upon the supply of water; but the right of one member is no greater than that of each of the others. To illustrate; if the supply should run so low during any season that there remained only enough to supply domestic uses alone, the water company could not supply to any one individual water for irrigating a lawn or garden, and refuse to supply water to others for the same purpose. While there are doubtless many differences between the rules governing the water question, when being supplied to the inhabitants of a municipality, and when being supplied alone to agricultural lands for irrigation, yet we think the same rule applies to both, so far as supply is concerned, except that in the case of one within the municipality would not be required to allege the supply was sufficient to furnish all the inhabitants alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In <em>Price </em>v. <em>Riverside L. &amp; I. Co., </em>56 Cal. 439, which was a <em>mandamus </em>case, defendant being a corporation formed to appropriate and furnish water to irrigate certain lands of a colony,- plaintiff\u2019s lands were a part of the colony to be irrigated. The court held'the defendant was \u201cbound to furnish \u25a0plaintiff with water to irrigate his lands on payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>rates fixed in the manner prescribed by law, it having the water to furnish. The ease shows that defendant has an ample supply of water to furnish the quantity demanded by those entitled to receive, including the quantity alleged on agreement to be needed by plaintiff. \u2019 \u2019 It was also held in that case that the rates which the defendant may charge had never been fixed in the manner required by law, but that defendant had .fixed the rates and could not be permitted to refuse water to one, otherwise entitled to receive it, who should offer to pay their rates. And that is the case here. In that case there was not sufficient demand, presumably made, nor offer to pay the rates, and this was taken advantage of by special demurrer. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>South Side Irr. Co., </em>112 Cal. 426, [44 Pac. 720], which was cited by plaintiffs in support of their contention that a writ must issue to compel defendants to furnish the amount of water asked. In that case the mandate did issue and was upheld on the ground that the defendant, in running its main pipe line, passed over the lands of plaintiff, said plaintiff having conveyed a right of way to defendant for that purpose, the consideration being an understanding that plaintiff could have water from defendant\u2019s said pipe to irrigate his land, \u201cthe west half of the southeast quarter of section 21, etc., to the extent of one-half the flow of a twenty-two inch round pipe, twice per month, for thirty-six hours each time, once on or about the first day of each month, and once on or about the fifteenth day of each month,\u201d upon tender of payment of reasonable and customary charges; and after defendant had supplied this water for use on plaintiff\u2019s land for a considerable time, it extended its pipe line beyond and below the land of the plaintiff, and began supplying water for lands among the extension of its pipe line, and then took from plaintiff, and sold to others, the water it had been accustomed to furnish her. The defendant was in the exercise of a public use, and had the water to supply her as demanded, and the writ issued. In that case it would seem the contract the defendant made with plaintiff was made prior to the extension of defendant \u2019s main line, and certainly not with a view by either party thereto to furnishing other land below plaintiff\u2019s with water for irrigating same, while in the case at bar the contract of water right was entered into with the express view of supplying all others in the San Juan grant with water in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>quantity according to trees planted, and so forth, as to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The water right contained this clause: \u201cWater will be delivered [at any point on the main line] to the grantees . . . who are the owners of water rights under the before-mentioned contract, at the following rates per acre per year, such rates to be enforced with each after the first year: for oranges and nurseries, $4; for deciduous trees and vines over three years old, for alfalfa, garden truck and berries, $3; for trees and vines less than three years old, $2; for grain, $1. Water for domestic purposes shall be charged for, for each household of six persons or less at the rate of $1 per month and a proportionate rate for a number in excess of six persons.\u201d The defendant, under the water right contract, had the right to sell and deliver water to lands either on or off the lands in the said San Juan grant, providing that each sale or diversion of water should not reduce the volume of water in its main canal or pipes below the requirements of irrigation, domestic and public uses on the San Juan grant lands, and if, at any time, the quantity of water should be reduced from any cause .other than selling water for other purposes than those mentioned, \u201cthen each water right or privilege so rented or otherwise granted by the parties of the first part, including the right of the parties of the second part by virtue thereof, shall be scaled down so that each person entitled to water from said main ditch, or canal or pipes, or from said laterals, instead of receiving the quantity he would receive if said main canal or ditch or pipes were full, shall only receive his proportionate share of the water in said ditch or canal or pipes, and the quantity so received shall satisfy the covenants in this contract contained.\u201d It will thus be seen that, when the water right was conveyed to the grantors of plaintiffs, all persons purchasing and owning lands in the part of the San Juan grant subdivided and brought under cultivation would own a similar water right contract, and would be just as much entitled as plaintiff to water to irrigate his trees, vines, grain, and so forth, and to give to plaintiffs the quantity of water demanded might deprive many others of the water they might be entitled to; and, as said by the learned judge of the trial court, \u201cin the absence of a pleading that there are no others who are entitled to the common benefit of the various contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>attached to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, or of a statement of their number, the court might render a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, giving them such an amount of available water as would render the court powerless, in a subsequent suit by another party, based upon the identical instruments here relied upon, and equally entitled with these plaintiffs, to render a similar judgment in the latter case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In our opinion the petition must state that the defendant has water in sufficient quantity, not only to supply plaintiffs, but to supply all water takers in compliance with the legal duty imposed upon the defendant. As the complaint fails in this respect, it fails to state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiffs to the writ of mandate prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Chipman, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b455-7\">McLAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS2\">I concur in the order affirming the judgment. But I do not desire to be understood as concurring in the view that rights purely contractual, even though they relate to the sale, rental, or distribution of water, can be enforced through the medium of a writ of mandate. Mandate will issue only to compel the performance of an act which the law specially .enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. Water appropriated for sale, rental, or distribution is a public use, and subject to the regulation and control of the state. (Const., art. XIV, sec. 1.) Hence, every person, company, or corporation engaged in the sale, rental, or distribution of water may be compelled to furnish water to all who require it, to the full extent of the supply of water under the control of such person, company, or corporation. This is a duty specially enjoined by law, and mandate will lie to enforce it. But the legal duty of the respondent in the ease at bar is measured and limited by the quantity of water which it has the ability to supply. When the supply is exhausted by the requirements of those having a legal right to its use, the legal duty as to others ceases. Therefore it was incumbent upon petitioners to show in their petition, not only that respondent had sufficient water to supply their demand, but that it had such quantity over and above the amount of water actually being supplied to those entitled to demand and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ceive water. The contractual duties of respondent extend to the full amount of water which it agreed to furnish, but its \u25a0 legal duty, enforceable by mandate, extends only to the surplus water which remains subject to petitioner\u2019s use and demand after the needs of others actually receiving water, and entitled thereto by reason of prior demand and use, have been satisfied. In my opinion, therefore, the right asserted under the contract is a false quantity in determining petitioners\u2019 right to the. particular remedy and relief here sought. The petition is framed on the theory that, because respondent contracted to furnish a certain definite quantity of water, mandate will lie to compel it to do so. This being the case, the majority opinion might be construed as holding that this would follow if the omitted statement of fact had been inserted. Waiving consideration of all other rights arising under this or similar contracts, I am of the opinion that it is only rights to water arising under the constitution and statutes which can be enforced by mandate, and hence deem it proper, if not necessary, that the ground of my concurrence should be separately stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on February 7, 1906.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
