No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">First, we reject Guerrier\u2019s contention that he pleaded guilty only to the lesser-included offense of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i), not to discharging a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, under section 924(c)(l)(A)(iii). Guerrier\u2019s indictment, plea agreement, and presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), as well as the district court\u2019s comments during sentencing, all refer expressly to Guerrier\u2019s offense as being a violation of section 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (iii). Furthermore, the record demonstrates clearly that the parties contemplated\u2014and that Guerrier understood\u2014that Guerrier was facing a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, consistent with a violation of section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">In the alternative, Guerrier argues'that, to the extent he pleaded guilty to a violation of section 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Because Guerrier failed to file written objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (which recommended that the district court accept Guerrier\u2019s knowing and voluntary guilty plea), Guerrier has waived his challenge to the validity of his guilty plea. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 59(b)(2); United States v. Garcia-Sandobal, 708 F.3d 1278, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2013); United States v. Lewis, 492 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">Guerrier next argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level sentencing enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12), for maintaining a premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing drugs. Guerrier raised no objection at sentencing; we review this issue only for plain error. See United States v. Maddox, 803 F.3d 1215, 1223 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">Both the stipulated factual basis for Gu-errier\u2019s guilty plea and Guerrier\u2019s PSI provided that, during the conspiracy, Guerrier used his residence as a \u201cstash house\u201d from which he distributed drugs. Guerrier made no objection to these facts contained in the PSI; thus, the facts are deemed admitted for purposes of sentencing. See United States v. Bennett, 472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir. 2006). Furthermore, evidence recovered from Guerrier\u2019s residence\u2014including several kinds of drugs, three guns, two digital scales, and a metal grinder\u2014 supports a finding that distribution of drugs was one of the \u201cprimary or principal uses\u201d of the house. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.17). On this record, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>trict court committed no plain error in imposing a sentencing enhancement under section 2Dl.l(b)(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">On appeal, Guillaume challenges his above-guidelines sentence as both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court calculates incorrectly the guidelines range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, chooses a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain the chosen sentence. United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir. 2008). Guillaume has failed to demonstrate that his sentence is procedurally unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">First, the' district court committed no clear error in finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Guillaume was responsible for gunshot injuries sustained by two police officers during Guillaume\u2019s arrest. Guillaume concedes that he fired a single shot as police officers attempted to enter the stash house, but he contends that at least one of the officers was injured by weapon fire coming from police officers. The district court, however, accepted testimony from the injured officers that multiple shots were fired from inside the house. Because the officers\u2019 testimony was not <em>\u201cexceedingly </em>improbable\u201d such that \u201cno reasonable factfinder could accept it,\u201d we accept the district court\u2019s credibility determination. See United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, 289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). Also, even under Guillaume\u2019s version of the facts, Guill-aume\u2019s shooting was at least the proximate cause of both officers\u2019 injuries. Thus, Guill-aume has not shown that the district court relied on clearly erroneous facts in selecting a sentence based in part on Guill-aume\u2019s responsibility for serious injuries to two officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">We also reject Guillaume\u2019s argument that the district court erred by permitting the two injured officers to testify as \u201ccrime victims\u201d under the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3771 (\u201cCVRA\u201d). The CVRA defines \u201ccrime victim\u201d broadly to include \u201ca person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(e). Nothing evidences that police officers are categorically excluded from the definition of \u201ccrime victim.\u201d Nor does Guillaume deny that the injured officers suffered direct or proximate harm as a result of his offense. The injured officers\u2019 testimony about the extent and severity of their injuries was pertinent to the district court\u2019s consideration of whether an above-guidelines sentence was warranted. And the district court has broad discretion to consider diverse evidence at sentencing. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">Guillaume also argues that the district court erred procedurally in departing upward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2 instead of applying an upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2. Because the district court explained expressly that it would have imposed the same sentence based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>factors, we need not address Guillaume\u2019s arguments about application of section 5K2.2. Instead, we must only determine whether the sentence imposed was reasonable in the light of the section 3558(a) factors. See United States v. Keene, 470 F.3d 1347, 1348-50 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence\u2014whether inside or outside the guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including ... whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d Gonzalez, 550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">When a sentence is above the guidelines range, we \u201cmay consider the deviation, \u2018but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Williams, 526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir. 2008). \u2018We may vacate a sentence because of the variance only \u2018if we are left with the definite and' Arm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Shaw, 560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201c[T]hat we \u2018might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors. United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Guillaume has failed to demonstrate that his above-guidelines sentence substantively was unreasonable. The record demonstrates that Guillaume (together \u25a0with co-conspirator Guerrier) maintained a stash house from which both men sold drugs as part of a larger drug trafficking operation. On the day of Guillaume\u2019s arrest, several officers arrived at the stash house, knocked on the door, and announced their presence. As officers attempted to enter the front door, Guillaume fired at least one gunshot in the officers\u2019 direction, causing the officers to return fire. As a result of the encounter, two officers were shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Based on the nature and circumstances of Guillaume\u2019s offense, the district court concluded that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary to reflect the-seriousness of the offense, to protect the public, and to provide adequate deterrence. The district court stressed that Guillaume knowingly created a risk of harm by maintaining a stash house for drugs, by keeping guns af the stash house, and by firing intentionally a gun toward persons at the front door. Guillaume\u2019s conduct demonstrated a clear disregard for human life and, as a result of Guillaume\u2019s conduct, two officers were seriously injured (one of whom is now permanently disabled).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">In the light of the record as a whole, the district court abused no discretion in determining that an above-guidelines sentence was warranted. Although' the degree of the deviation is substantial, the sentence imposed is proportionate to the seriousness of Guillaume\u2019s offense and is supported by the section 3553(a) factors. In addition, that Guillaume\u2019s sentence of 188 months for Count I is well below the statutory maximum sentence of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment is further evidence of its reasonableness. See Gonzalez, 550 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>1324 (concluding a sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On this record, we are not convinced that Guillaume\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was unreasonable or that \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3653(a) factors.\u201d See Shaw, 560 F.3d at 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Guillaume contends that his trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance during sentencing. Because the record is not yet sufficiently developed on this issue, we decline to consider' Guillaume\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal. See United States v. Bender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir. 2002) (in general, we will not. \u201cconsider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim or develop a factual record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-10\"> Guillaume\u2019s guidelines range for Count I was 60 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment; the district court sentenced Guillaume to 188 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
