The BIA consolidated the cases and issued one decision. The BIA noted that all of the claims were based on the persecution claims of Odhiambo.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the applications for asylum were untimely. The Odhiambos abandon the issue here by not briefing it. <em>See Justiss Oil Co. v. Kerr-McGee Ref. Corp., </em>75 F.3d 1057, 1067 (5th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The IJ also concluded Odhiambo and his wife were not credible witnesses. The BIA did not address the credibility finding but considered that all of the testimony was credible in addressing the appeal. Accordingly, we will not consider the challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility ruling because the BIA did not consider it. <em>See Yang v. Holder, </em>664 F.3d 580, 584 n.3 (5th Cir. 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2772, 183 L.Ed.2d 638 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">\u201cWithholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir. 2002). Concerning withholding of removal, petitioners claim the denial is not supported by substantial evidence. Under the substantial-evidence standard, \u201creversal is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but [also] that the evidence compels it\u201d. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">Odhiambo testified he suffered persecution, the standard for asylum, when he visited his village in 1997 and 1999. He stated that, in 1997, he was threatened and was locked in a house as it was set on fire, though he was able to escape; In 1999, his brother\u2019s house was burned after Odhiam-bo left the village. Odhiambo testified that neither he nor his family were physically harmed while in Kenya. This evidence was insufficient to compel a reasonable factfin-der to determine that Odhiambo suffered past persecution. <em>See Abdel-Masieh v. I.N.S., </em>73 F.3d 579, 583-84 (5th Cir. 1996) (our court saw no error when the BIA found beatings during unfounded arrests did not constitute past persecution because they were not severe and the arrests were seemingly random). Odhiambo offers no additional evidence of past persecution. The challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination that Odhiambo did not suffer-past persecution is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AR3\">Absent evidence of past persecution, an alien must establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing a subjective fear of persecution that is also objectively reasonable to obtain asylum. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306-07 (5th Cir. 2005). An applicant for withholding of removal bears the burden to demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that his or her life or freedom would be threatened by persecution. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907 (quoting 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). The substantial evidence in the record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioners have not shown a likely future threat to life or freedom if they return to Kenya.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The Odhiambos also challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. To obtain relief under the CAT, an applicant must demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he or she would be tortured if he or she returned to his or her home country. <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344-45 (quoting <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 354 (5th Cir. 2002)). The substantial evidence in the record does not show that it is more likely than not that the petitioners will be subject to torture if they return to Kenya.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. r. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
