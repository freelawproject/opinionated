On appeal, Tolliver contends that, after the district court lowered his offense level pursuant to Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, the court erred in calculating his amended offense level. He asserts that the district court should have included a one-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). After a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we disagree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">The government charged Tolliver in a superseding information with (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base and to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), and 846, and (2) carrying and using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">Tqlliver pleaded guilty. In the plea agreement, the government agreed (1) to recommend that Tolliver receive a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a), and (2) to file a motion for a one-leyel downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(b), provided that Tolliver\u2019s offense level prior to the operation of \u00a7 3El.l(a) was 16 or greater.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">At the sentencing, the district court calculated Tolliver\u2019s base offense level as 16. The district court then reduced the offense level by two levels under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and by one level under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Based on an offense level of 13 and his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>history category of V, Tolliver\u2019s advisory guideline range was 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. Tolliver also faced an 84-month mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment because of his conviction under \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Because Tolliver provided substantial assistance to the government, the district court granted a four-level reduction under \u00a7 5K1.1, resulting an offense level of 9 and a guideline range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Tolliver to 102 months\u2019 imprisonment\u201418 months as to Count 1 and 84 months as to Count 2, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Tolliver recently moved for a reduction in his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782. Amendment 782 revised the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by decreasing the base offense level from 16 to 14 where the amount of cocaine base involved was at least 2.8 grams but less than 5.6 grams. U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 782 (2014). Amendment 782 became effective on November 1, 2014, and was made retroactive by Amendment 788 on the same date. U.S.S.G. App. C, amends. 782 <em>&amp; </em>788 (2014); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The government agreed that under Amendment 782 Tolliver was eligible for a reduction in his sentence. After recalculating Tolliver\u2019s base offense level as 14, the district court awarded a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. But the district court refused to apply a one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) because Tolliver\u2019s offense level was less than 16. The court reasoned that this result was consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which was to give Tolliver the opportunity to receive the same sentence that he would have received had Amendment 782 applied at his sentencing. Accordingly, the court calculated Tolliver\u2019s amended offense level as 12 and his amended guideline range as 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The district court then considered how to reduce Tolliver\u2019s sentence to reflect his substantial assistance. The court granted a 40-percent reduction and resentenced Tol-liver to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because Tolliver\u2019s consecutive 84 month sentence remained in effect, he was sentenced to a total of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. Tolliver timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Tolliver argues that the district court erred by \u201crescinding\u201d the one-level acceptance of responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) in its calculation of his amended guideline range. We disagree. The district court did not err by ruling that Tolliver\u2019s amended guideline range should not include the one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). The grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir. 2012). For a defendant to be eligible for such a reduction, the Sentencing Commission must have amended the guideline at issue, that amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>and the amendment must also be listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; cmt. n.l(A). The applicable guideline range is the defendant\u2019s guideline range before any departures or variances. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B.10 cmt. n.l(A). When determining the extent to which a reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is warranted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced,\u201d but \u201cshall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Even if \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s base requirements are met, however, a defendant \u201cis not to receive a lower sentence than he would have received if the amendment had been in effect at the time of his sentencing.\u201d <em>Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206. In <em>Glover </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cgives the defendant an opportunity to receive the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after the amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We are unpersuaded by Tolliver\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a sentence reduction. If Amendment 782 had been in effect at the time of Tolliver\u2019s sentencing, he would not have been eligible for the one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) because his initial offense level would have been below 16. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 (b). Therefore, in order to comply with \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), the district court could not have awarded the one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b). <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Tolliver also argues that the district court erred because \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) states that a court should leave other guideline application decisions unaffected after substituting the retroactive changes. This argument similarly fails. Although \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) prevents courts from conducting <em>de novo </em>resentencing hearings when evaluating a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, it does not prevent a court from ensuring that. a defendant\u2019s amended guideline range accounts for any effects to other guidelines that a change to a defendant\u2019s base offense level may create. Indeed, \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l)\u2019s commentary contemplates the situation where the \u201coperation of another guideline\u201d prevents the lowering of the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B.10 cmt. n.l(A). In this case, the retroactive change to Amendment 782 rendered Tolliver ineligible for a \u00a7 3El.l(a) reduction because his base offense dropped to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>14 after the application of the amendment. The district court complied with the purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) by declining to include the reduction in its amended guidelihe calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Tolliver\u2019s final argument also fails to persuade us. He contends that <em>Dillon v. United, States </em>required the district court to leave his acceptance of responsibility adjustment unaltered. In <em>Dillon, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a district court properly declined to address challenges to aspects of the defendant\u2019s original sentence that were unaffected by Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 782, altered the drug quantity table. 560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Dillon contended that the district court should have corrected two mistakes committed at the initial' sentencing involving the sentencing court\u2019s treatment of the guidelines as mandatory and its calculation of the defendant\u2019s criminal history category. <em>Id. </em>But relying on \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), the Supreme Court concluded that the sentencing court did not err in refusing to consider these purported mistakes because the district court\u2019s original determinations were unchanged by Amendment 706, and, therefore, were outside the scope of the proceeding as authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><em>Dillon </em>makes clear that under \u00a7 3852(c)(2), a district court cannot correct a sentencing error (unless recognized by the retroactive amendment) from the initial sentencing because that would amount to a resentencing, which \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize. But that situation does not present itself here. Unlike in <em>Dillon, </em>where the error occurred in the initial sentencing, the \u201cerror\u201d that Tolliver alleges occurred upon resentencing after Amendment 782. Moreover, as discussed above, the district court committed no error in that sentencing. The district court\u2019s removal of the one-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction was not the re-litigation of a prior guideline application issue, but rather was the result of the proper calculation of Tol-liver\u2019s guideline range after the application of Amendment 782\u2019s changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order reducing Tolliver\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\">. A defendant may receive up to three levels off of his offense level if he clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The first two levels are granted when a defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a). The third level may only be granted if the defendant\u2019s offense level was 16 or greater before the first two levels' were deducted and the government files a motion stating that the defendant assisted authorities by timely notifying them of his intention to plead guilty. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">. We reject Tolliver\u2019s assertion . that that Amendment 780 abrogated <em>Glover </em>in its entirety. In <em>Glover, </em>we considered whether a defendant who was sentenced to life imprisonment was eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. 686 F,3d at 1206-07. We held that the defendant was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Amendment 780 later clarified that, where an offender provides substantial assistance to the government so as to become eligible for a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum, a court should not consider the mandatory minimum when ruling on the offender\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Although Amendment 780 may have undermined <em>Glover's </em>conclusion that a defendant could not receive a new sentence below the statutory minimum in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the Amendment leaves intact <em>Glover\u2019s </em>principle reasoning: the overarching purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to sentence a defendant as if the retroactively changed guideline was in place at the time of the defendant's original sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 1206.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
