The district court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals his convictions and sentence, arguing that the district court (1) abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial, (2) improperly imposed a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.4 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the Guidelines) for using a minor in the commission of a crime, (3) erroneously denied him safety-valve relief under \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 and 5C1.2 of the Guidelines, and (4) imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Cervante-Sanchez first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. During trial, the Government offered into evidence text messages obtained from Cervante-Sanchez\u2019s cell phone between Cervante-Sanchez and an alleged co-conspirator. However, the Government had not provided those messages to Cervante-Sanchez in discovery. In his motion for new trial, Cervante-Sanchez claimed that a new trial was. warranted because the Government\u2019s failure to provide the text messages in discovery substantially prejudiced his defense. Specifically, he asserted that the introduction of the text messages was a surprise and crucially undercut his argument that he did not conspire with any individuals who were not undercover law enforcement officers or informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam). A discovery violation is only grounds for a new trial if it violated the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>See United States v. Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d 993, 998 (11th Cir. 1995). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are violated if the defendant is \u201cunduly surprised and lacks an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense,\u201d or \u201cif the mistake substantially influences the jury.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 998-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cervante-Sanchez\u2019s motion for a new trial. It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to find that the Government\u2019s failure to produce the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>messages during discovery did not substantially prejudice Cervante-Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">First, the record belies the notion that Cervante-Sanchez was unduly surprised by the text messages at trial. The text messages were Cervante-Sanchez\u2019s own correspondences, \u201cwhich he should have had some knowledge of.-\u201d <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>944 F.2d 1563, 1566 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that a defendant was pot unduly surprised by the delayed disclosure of evidence showing that he made an inculpatory statement). And, \u201c[mjore importantly, if [Cervante-Sanchez] had, in fact, been prejudiced by the delayed disclosure of th[e] [text messages], he should have\u201d raised a discovery violation objection at trial. <em>See id. </em>However, he lodged no such objection. Instead, he only complained about the violation in his motion for new trial\u2014which he filed after the jury rendered a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Second, the record shows that the Government\u2019s mistake did not have a substantial influence on the jury. As the district court found, the text message evidence of a conspiracy with non-law-enforcement actors was cumulative of other evidence offered at trial. For example, the Government put forth evidence that, during a conversation with an undercover law enforcement officer about a drug transaction, Cervante-Sanchez stated that he would obtain drugs for the transaction from his drug supplier source. Given that the text messages were cumulative of other evidence showing that Cervante-Sanchez conspired with persons not affiliated with law enforcement, the Government\u2019s late disclosure of the evidence did not have a substantial effect on the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 1566-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Cer-vante-Sanchez\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AoA\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Cervante-Sanchez next asserts that the district court erroneously imposed a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.4 of the Guidelines for using a minor in the commission of a crime. Cer-vante-Sanchez drove to the city where the relevant drug transaction was to be conducted, bringing three children on the trip. The children included an infant and a baby. And, during the trip, Cervante-San-chez hid drugs in diaper boxes in his ear. He also packed substances in the diaper boxes that are typically used to conceal the scent of drugs. The district court imposed the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement after concluding that Cervante-Sanchez used the children to avoid detection by law enforcement. The court determined that Cervante-Sanchez brought the children on the trip because the combination of the diaper boxes and the children in his car would make it less likely that law enforcement would be suspicious of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">\u201cWe peview a sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the [Guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Victor, </em>719 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir. 2013). \u201cFor a finding to be clearly erroneous, this Court must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, 6</em>10 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level upward adjustment if \u201cthe defendant used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of, or apprehension for, the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. This adjustment is designed \u201cto protect minors as a class from being solicited, procured, recruited, counseled, encouraged, trained, directed, commanded, intimidated, or <em>otherwise used </em>to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Futch, </em>518 F.3d 887, 896 (11th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The adjustment is \u201cwarranted only where the defendant takes some affirmative step to involve a minor in the commission of the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Here, the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement. Cer-vante-Sanchez took the affirmative steps of (1) bringing young children with him on a trip in which he was transporting drugs to a city for the purpose of selling the drugs and (2) hiding the drugs in diaper boxes\u2014boxes that, due to their association with young children, would seem normal in a car full of children. Moreover, Cervante-Sanchez put substances that are normally used to conceal the scent of drugs from law enforcement canine in the boxes, demonstrating that he contemplated that he might be stopped by law enforcement during the trip. That decision supports the district court\u2019s finding that Cervante-San-chez also brought the children on the trip to avoid detection of his illicit activity. Taking these circumstances together, \u201c[w]e cannot say the district court clearly erred in its factfinding that [Cervantes-Sanchez] was using the [children] to ... conceal\u201d drugs or that the court \u201ccommitted legal error in its conclusion that the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement applied to the facts here.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 897 (holding that the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement was appropriate where the defendant placed a baby on top of cocaine to hide the cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Cervante-Sanchez also claims that the district court erred in denying his request for safety-valve relief. He argues that he is entitled to such relief because he fully and completely confessed to law enforcement at the time of his arrest. The district court rejected Cervante-Sanchez\u2019s request for safety-valve relief after finding that he was not truthful about his role in his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">We review a district court\u2019s factual determinations in denying safety-valve relief for clear error. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir. 1997). Section 2Dl.l(b)(17) of the Guidelines provides that a defendant may receive a two-level reduction if he meets the safety-valve criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2(a) of the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17). The defendant has the burden of proving that he meets all of the safety-valve criteria. <em>See Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. Among those criteria is the requirement that: \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). Under this requirement, \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the [GJovernment all the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others \u2014 \u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. \u201c[L]ies and omissions do not, as a matter of law, disqualify a defendant from safety-valve relief so long as the defendant makes a complete and truthful proffer not later than the commencement of the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">There is sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Cer-vante-Sanchez did not satisfy the safety-valve provision\u2019s \u201ccomplete and truthful proffer\u201d requirement. Although Cervante-Sanchez substantially cooperated with law enforcement at the time of his arrest, he ultimately claimed that he did not know he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>was transporting illegal drugs in his car. That is, he asserted that he was unaware of the exact contents of the packages inside the diaper boxes. However, there was substantial evidence at trial that suggested Cervante-Sanchez knew the packages contained illegal drugs. Under these circumstances, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Cervante-Sanchez failed to \u201ccome forward and ... supply truthfully to the [Government all the information that he possesse[d] about his involvement in the offense.\u201d <em>See Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557 (affirming denial of safety-valve relief because the defendant denied \u201cthat he knew that [his vehicle] contained illegal drugs,\u201d despite \u201csubstantial evidence to suggest that [he] knew the [vehicle] contained illegal drugs\u201d). Therefore, the district court properly denied Cer-vante-Sanchez safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Finally, Cervante-Sanchez asserts that his 180-month sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of various mitigating factors and because he was subjected to a guideline range of 151 to 188 months even though the Government, at the plea negotiation stage, viewed a range of 70 to 87 months as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party who challenges the substantive reasonableness of a sentence must show that the sentence is unreasonable in light of -the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3653(a) factors and the record. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Cervante-Sanchez has not demonstrated that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. His sentence is within the guideline range and is substantially below the statutory maximum.-We ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). In addition, the -district court addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found that a within-guideline-range sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate. The district court considered Cervante-Sanchez\u2019s lack of criminal history and other mitigating factors. Nevertheless, it found that a guideline sentence was appropriate in light of, <em>inter alia, </em>the total amount of drugs involved in his offenses. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
