Stat. \u00a7 559.715 (\u201c[T]he assignee [of a consumer debt] must give the debtor written notice of such assignment as soon as practical after the assignment is made, but at least 30 days before any action to collect the debt.\u201d). Arencibia alleged that Mortgage Guaranty violated the FDCPA under \u00a7 1692e by failing to provide him, and numerous others, prior notice under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.715.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-18\">For Mortgage Guaranty to be liable under \u00a7 1692e, Arencibia needed to show that it was a \u201cdebt collector,\u201d as that term is defined in the statute. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e (\u201cA debt collector may not use any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d)- The statute defines \u201cdebt collector\u201d in two ways: (1) \u201cany person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principle purpose of which is the collection of any debts\u201d; or (2) any person \u201cwho regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). The statute also provides a list of exclusions to these definitions, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1692a(6)(A)-(F), such as \u201cany person collecting or attempting to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another to the extent such activity ... concerns a debt which was not. in default at the time it was obtained by such person,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Arencibia attempted to qualify Mortgage Guaranty as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the second definition. Arencibia alleged that Mortgage Guaranty regularly collected or attempted to collect debts that were <em>originally </em>owed to others and acquired after default. Mortgage Guaranty moved for summary judgment, arguing that it was not a \u201cdebt collector\u201d because, <em>at the time of collection, </em>it was collecting on debts it owned and not collecting a debt owed or due another.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Little more than a week after Mortgage Guaranty filed for summary judgment, this Court issued its decision in <em>Davidson v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., </em>797 F.3d 1309 (11th Cir. 2015), which settled the dispute in Mortgage Guaranty\u2019s favor, <em>Davidson, </em>like this case, involved an FDCPA claim under \u00a7 1692e against an entity which regularly collected debts owed to it, but did not collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due another. The panel in <em>Davidson </em>held that \u201ca person must regularly collect or attempt to collect debts <em>for others </em>in order to qualify as a \u2018debt collector\u2019 under the second definition of the term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316 (emphasis in original). An entity collecting on its own debts\u2014even debts originally owned by another and acquired after default\u2014does not qualify as a \u201cdebt collector.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">On appeal from the dismissal of his complaint, Davidson had argued that an entity which collects on debts it acquires after default qualifies as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the second definition. Relying on the exclusion in \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii), Davidson asserted that \u201ccreditors\u201d and \u201cdebt collectors\u201d are mutually exclusive terms under the FDCPA, and the line that separates the two, in the case of acquired debt, is \u201cthe default status of the debt at the time it was acquired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. In other words, as succinctly summarized by the <em>Davidson </em>panel, \u201cif the debt was <em>not </em>in default when it was acquired, .\u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii) excludes the entity from the definition of \u2018debt collector,\u2019 and the entity is a \u2018creditor\u2019; on the other hand, if the debt was in default when it was acquired, \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii) does not apply, and the entity is a \u2018debt collector.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\"><em>Davidson </em>rejected the argument that the line between \u201ccreditors,\u201d who \u201ctypically are not subject to the FDCPA,\u201d and \u201cdebt collectors,\u201d who are, \u201cis drawn by the default status of the debt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313-14. The panel found Davidson\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii). unavailing because \u201c\u00a7 1692a(6)(F)\u2019s exclusions do not obviate the substantive requirements of \u00a7 1692(a)(6)\u2019s definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. In other words, the exclusions come into play only once one of the two substantive definitions of \u201cdebt collector,\u201d set forth above, is satisfied; the exclusions do not alter the substantive definitions. <em>Id. </em>at 1314-15. And, while default status of the debt may affect the application of the \u00a7 1692a(6)(F)(iii) exclusion, \u201cthe statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>definition of \u2018debt collector\u2019 applies without regal\u2019d to the default status of the underlying debt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314. Therefore, \u201ca person who does not otherwise meet the requirements of \u00a7 1692a(6) is not a \u2018debt collector\u2019 under the FDCPA, even where the consumer\u2019s debt was in default at the time the person acquired it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Looking to the \u201centirely transparent\u201d statutory text, the <em>Davidson </em>panel held that the second definition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d unambiguously is limited \u201cto those persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due <em>another.\u201d Id. </em>at 1316 (emphasis in original). In common usage, \u201c[t]he term \u2018another\u2019 most naturally connotes \u2018one that is different from the first or present one,\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>This means, according to the panel, that a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the second definition must collect debts or attempt to collect debt <em>\u201cfor others.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The Court went on to affirm the dismissal of Davidson\u2019s complaint because it made \u201cno factual allegations from which we could plausibly infer that [the defendant] regularly collects or attempts to collect debts owed or due to someone other than [the defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Finding <em>Davidson </em>controlling, the district court in this case granted summary judgment to Mortgage Guaranty. The court ruled that Mortgage Guaranty was not a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the FDCPA because \u201c[t]he undisputed facts show that Defendant does not regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due someone other than Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Arencibia appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, arguing that <em>Davidson </em>was wrongly decided. He asserts that <em>Davidson </em>conflicts with the decisions of a majority of other circuit courts to have addressed the same issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bridge v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB, </em>681 F.3d 355, 359 (6th Cir. 2012) (\u201cFor an entity that did not originate the debt in question but acquired it and attempts to collect on it, that entity is either a creditor or a debt collector depending on the default status of the debt at the time it was acquired.\u201d); <em>Ruth v. Triumph P\u2019ships, </em>577 F.3d 790, 796 (7th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[A] party that seeks to collect on a debt that was in default when acquired is a debt collector under the FDCPA, even though it owns the debt and is collecting for itself.\u201d). Arencibia also asserts that the <em>Davidson </em>panel\u2019s rationale contravenes several canons of statutory interpretation and undermines the broad, remedial purposes of the FDCPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">As Arencibia acknowledges, however, we are bound by <em>Davidson </em>under the prior panel precedent rule, which provides that the holding of a prior panel is binding \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008). Arencibia makes no claim that an exception to this rule applies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, even if we believed that <em>Davidson </em>had been wrongly decided, which, to be clear, we offer no opinion on the matter, we would nevertheless be bound by <em>Davidson\u2019s </em>holding. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir. 1998) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cUnder our prior precedent rule, a panel cannot overrule a prior one\u2019s holding even though convinced it is wrong.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Applying <em>Davidson </em>to the facts of this case, the district court quite clearly was correct to grant summary judgment to Mortgage Guaranty. There is no evidence that Mortgage Guaranty regularly collected or attempted to collect on debts \u201cfor others.\u201d <em>See Davidson, </em>797 F.3d at 1316. Accordingly, Mortgage Guaranty does not qualify as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the second definition of that term in the FDCPA. <em>See id.-, </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-12\">. Arencibia was joined in the district court by Plaintiff Jose Ayala. We dismissed the appeal as to Ayala at his request. <em>See </em>11th Cir. Dkt.
