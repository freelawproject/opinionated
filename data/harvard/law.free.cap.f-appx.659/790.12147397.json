She is serving a 180-month sentence. Ball did not pursue a direct appeal. Her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was denied, as was her attempt to pursue a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Ball contests the dismissal of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, urging she is entitled to relief because she is actually innocent of the firearms offense, and her continued incarceration will result in a miscarriage of justice. The dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition is reviewed <em>de novo. See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Through that petition, a federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir. 2001). The prisoner must establish the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901. To make that showing, a prisoner must make a claim (1) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d that (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">Ball fails to make the required showing. To the extent she relies on <em>Rosemond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), she has not demonstrated it applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 663, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001) (\u201c[A] new rule is not \u2018made retroactive to cases on collateral review\u2019 unless the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactive\u201d)'. Moreover, assuming, <em>arguendo, Rosemond </em>is retroactively applicable, Ball has not shown it establishes she may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. Ball was charged and convicted under \u00a7 924(c); because she was neither charged nor convicted under the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, <em>Rose-mond </em>does not apply. <em>See </em>134 S.Ct. at 1243 (concerning cases where the Government charges a defendant with aiding or abetting, under 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 2, conduct that violates \u00a7 924(c)). Furthermore, Ball acknowledged in her written plea agreement and factual basis that she \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d the loaded pistol underlying the \u00a7 924 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">Ball\u2019s \u201cactual innocence\u201d argument is unavailing. She presents no authority for an \u201cactual innocence\u201d gateway to challenge a conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition if the petitioner fails to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s sayings clause. <em>See McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct 1924, 1928, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); <em>Foster v. Quarterman, </em>466 F.3d 359, 367-68 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
