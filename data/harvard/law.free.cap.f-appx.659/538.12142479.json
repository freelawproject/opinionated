He raises two issues on appeal, which we address in turn. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm Antunes-Rivera\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">\n<em>A. Application of sentencing enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Antunes-Rivera first argues the district court incorrectly imposed a 16-level enhancement for a prior Florida conviction that did not qualify as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Specifically, he contends Florida\u2019s resisting-with-violence statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, criminalizes behavior such as wiggling and struggling, which does not meet the definition of \u201cuse of physical force\u201d as defined in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), and that pursuant to <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), we are required to assume that his conviction rested upon nothing more than wiggling and struggling. He also asserts our precedent in <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246 (11th Cir. 2012), is in conflict with Supreme Court precedent in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 2L1.2 sets a base offense level of eight for a defendant convicted of unlawful reentry into the United States. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). A defendant will receive a 16-level enhancement if he was previously deported following a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). For the purposes of this enhancement, the Guidelines define a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-22\">any of the following offenses under federal, state, or local law: Murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses ... statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-23\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u2018 2L1.2, comment. n.l(B)(iii). The Florida statute under which Antunes-Rivera was convicted provides that \u201c[wjhoever knowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer ... is guilty of a felony of the third degree.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-24\">In <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>using the categorical approach, we held that a conviction under \u00a7 843.01, for resisting an officer with violence, was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because Florida courts have held that violence is a necessary element of \u00a7 843.01. 674 F.3d at 1248-\u00cd51. In so holding, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that Florida courts have held that the element of violence in \u00a7 843.01 can be satisfied by <em>de minimis </em>force, such as wiggling or struggling. <em>Id. </em>at 1249. We also rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 843.01, a general intent crime, can be violated with mere reckless conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The district court did not err in imposing the 16-level enhancement. Antunes-Rivera\u2019s argument that \u00a7 843.01 is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is foreclosed by <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>and we are bound by that opinion until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc. See Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d at 1248-51; <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008) (stating we must follow the holding of a prior panel of this Court \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this [Cjourt sitting <em>en banc\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Descamps </em>and <em>Moncrieffe </em>did not undermine <em>Romo-Villalobos </em>to the point of abrogation, as this Court did not fail to assume that the defendant\u2019s conviction rested upon the least act criminalized. <em>See Moncrieffe, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1682, 1684 (holding, in the <em>context of </em>determining whether a state conviction qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Naturalization Act, that, if a statute criminalizes several acts, a court must assume \u201cthat the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized, and then determine whether even those acts are encompassed by the generic offense\u201d (quotations and alterations omitted)); <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281 (holding, under the categorical approach, the prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense only if the statute\u2019s elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense). Rather, this Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 843.01 criminalized wiggling or struggling. <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d at 1249. Moreover, this Court reaffirmed that \u00a7 843.01 categorically qualified as a violent felony after <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Moncrieffe </em>were decided. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>799 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding a Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence under \u00a7 843.01 was categorically a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s elements clause); <em>see also United States v. Palomino-Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir. 2010) (recognizing we have employed ACCA\u2019s categorical approach in cases that interpret guideline enhancements).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Antunes-Rivera\u2019s argument that <em>Romo-Villalobos </em>is in conflict with <em>Leocal </em>also lacks merit. <em>See Leocal, </em>543 U.S. at 3-4, 9, 11, 125 S.Ct. 377 (concluding Florida\u2019s drunk driving statute did not meet the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 because an individual could be convicted under the statute for neglig\u00e9nt or accidental conduct, and a crime of violence must involve \u201cactive employment\u201d of physical force). Antunes-Rivera was convicted of \u201cunlawfully, knowingly, and willfully resisting], obstructing] or opposing]\u201d an officer in the lawful executing of a legal duty by offering or doing violence to the officer in the lawful execution of a legal duty by offering or doing violence to the officer, qnd this Court expressly held that intentional or knowing action may satisfy the \u201cuse of physical force\u201d requirement under \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1336 (determining, in light of <em>Leocal, </em>that a conviction predicated on a <em>mens rea </em>of recklessness did not satisfy fhe \u201cuse of physical force\u201d require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ment under \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing a 16-level enhancement because Antunes-Rivera\u2019s resisting-with-violenee conviction is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, and we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>B. Substantive reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Second, Antunes-Rivera argues the district imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence because his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing, and the district court failed to adequately explain why a sentence even more below the advisory guideline range would not accomplish the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Antunes-Rivera has failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence in light of both the record and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating a party who challenges a sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a)\u201d (quotations and alteration omitted)). His 41-month sentence is below the advisory guideline range, and well below the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (using the fact a sentence is well below the statutory maximum is an indicator of reasonableness). Moreover, his combined state and federal sentence\u2014a total of 52 months and 25 days\u2014is also within the advisory guideline range, and well below the statutory maximum sentence. Antunes-Rivera\u2019s history and characteristics, as well as the district court\u2019s stated need to promote respect for the law, perve as an adequate deterrent, and reflect the seriousness of the crime, support a finding that the district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (explaining a court abuses it discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably). Further, the district court did not give an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight when it considered the nature of the offense, noting that Antunes-Rivera violated both state and federal law and should be sentenced as such. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Antunes-Riv-era\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-17\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a 'crime of violence' under the Sentencing Guidelines.\" <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1240 (11th Cir. 2011). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v.
