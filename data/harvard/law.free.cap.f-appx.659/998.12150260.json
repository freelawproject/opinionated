The district court imposed a sentence of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Brewton now appeals his conviction and sentence on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">On the afternoon of July 25, 2014, two men robbed Oceans Jewelers, a jewelry store in Davies, Florida. One of the robbers was unarmed. The other used a gun to threaten and coerce the store\u2019s manager, Abraham Bendahan. After relieving the store of cash and jewels, and unsuccessfully attempting to smash its surveillance equipment, the robbers fled. Although Bendahan was the only eyewitness present at the time, much of the robbery was caught on the store\u2019s security footage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">During the ensuing investigation, the police quickly discovered evidence of Brew-ton\u2019s involvement in the robbery. One of the robbers, the unarmed one, left behind palm and fingerprints, which crime scene technicians later identified as Brewton\u2019s. Bendahan also positively identified Brew-ton from a photographic lineup as one of the robbers. Based on the print evidence and Bendahan\u2019s identification, the police arrested Brewton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">After the arrest, police interviewed two of Brewton\u2019s former girlfriends. Both women said that Brewton gave or attempted to give them jewelry as gifts toward the end of July 2014. Both women turned over the jewelry to the police and those pieces matched missing inventory from the jewelry store. Both women positively identified Brewton from the jewelry store\u2019s security footage. One woman also told police that Brewton had showed her a video clip of the robbery (which had appeared on the news), asked her if she could identify him from the video, and asked whether she thought he would get caught.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">For Br\u00e9wton\u2019s involvement in the July 2014 robbery, the government charged him with four counts: (i) conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act Robbery, (ii) Hobbs Act Robbery, (iii) conspiracy to use and brandish a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, and (iv) using and brandishing a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. At trial, the government introduced evidence and testimony from Bendahan, Brewton\u2019s former girlfriends, and police investigators. The parties also stipulated that \u201cOceans Jewelers is a company that operates in interstate commerce by selling products that travel in and affect interstate commerce.\u201d Brewton did not testify at trial and the defense rested without presenting any evidence or calling any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">At the close of trial, Brewton moved for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court denied the motion. Before excusing the jurors to deliberate, the district court asked Brewton\u2019s counsel whether he had any objections to the proposed jury instructions. Defense counsel replied that he had no objections. The jury found Brewton guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Brewton first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him. \u201cWe review de novo whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal trial, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d United States v. Jiminez, 564 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201cAccordingly, the evidence will be sufficient to support a conviction if a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Brewton contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he used or brandished a firearm during the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), or that he conspired to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o). He argues that the evidence shows that he was unarmed and that only his confederate used and brandished a gun during- the robbery. According to Brewton, that is not enough to establish that he used or agreed to the use of a gun during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), the government must show that the defendant: \u201c(1) knowingly (2) possessed a firearm (3) during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime or a crime of violence.\u201d United States v. Isnadin, 742 F.3d 1278, 1307 (11th Cir. 2014). \u201cPossession may be actual or constructive, joint or sole.\u201d United States v. Gunn, 369 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201c[Ujnder \u00a7 924(c), a defendant may be liable for a co-conspirator\u2019s possession [of a firearm] if possession was reasonably foreseeable.\u201d Id. And \u201cif a defendant continues to participate in a crime after a gun was displayed or used by a confederate, the jury can permissibly infer from his failure to object or withdraw that he had such knowledge.\u201d Rosemond v. United States, 572 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 1250 n.9, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 924(o), the government must show: \u201c(1) a conspiracy existed to commit the substantive offense; (2) [the defendant] knew of the conspiracy, and (3) [the defendant], with knowledge, voluntarily'joined it.\u201d Isnadin, 742 F.3d at 1307. \u201cThe existence of a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence and may be inferred from concert of action.\u201d United States v. Thompson, 422 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir, 2005) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIndeed, because the crime of conspiracy is predominantly mental in composition, it is frequently necessary to resort to circumstantial evidence to provp its elements.\u201d United States v. Pineiro, 389 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-13\">The evidence shows that Brewton and his confederate acted in concert to rob the jewelry store. When Brewton\u2019s confederate pulled out the gun, Brewton did not object or withdraw from the robbery. Instead, - when Brewton\u2019s confederate revealed the gun, trained it on the store\u2019s manager, and threatened him with it, Brewton emptied the manager\u2019s pockets, took his money, and grabbed the store\u2019s cash and jewelry. The jury could reasonably infer from that concerted effort that Brewton knew that his confederate would use and brandish a gun to execute the robbery. As such, the evidence was sufficient to sustain Brewton\u2019s convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and 924(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">Brewton next contends that the evidence was insufficient to show the interstate commerce nexus necessary to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>his convictions for committing and conspiring to commit Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). He points to the fact that the government, in its superseding indictment, and the district court, in responding to a question from the jury, identified Bendahan as the victim of the robbery. He argues that because the victim was an individual, rather than a business engaged in interstate commerce, the government failed to show an interstate commerce nexus. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">\u201cThe Hobbs Act prohibits robbery or extortion, and attempts or conspiracies to commit robbery or extortion, that in any way or degree obstruct, delay or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce.\u201d United States v. Diaz, 248 F.3d 1065, 1084 (11th Cir. 2001) (quotation marks and' alterations omitted). \u201cOnly a de minimis nexus with interstate commerce is required.\u201d United States v. Farrell, 877 F.2d 870, 875 (11th Cir. 1989). And \u201c[wjhile the Hobbs Act usually is applied to robberies of businesses, criminal acts directed toward individuals also may violate the Hobbs Act.\u201d Diaz, 248 F.3d at 1084. The government may, for instance, prosecute a defendant for Hobbs Act robbery aimed at an individual when \u201cthe crime causes the individual to deplete the assets of an entity engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d Id. at 1084-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The parties stipulated that Oceans Jewelers was a company that operated in interstate commerce by selling products that travel in and affect interstate commerce. The evidence presented at trial showed that the robbery was directed toward Ben-dahan, who also testified that \u00d3ceans Jewelers suffered a total loss of about $250,000. That evidence, in combination with the parties\u2019 stipulation, showed that Brewton\u2019s actions caused Bendahan to deplete the assets of an entity engaged in interstate commerce. That was all that was needed to show an interstate commerce nexus to support Brewton\u2019s Hobbs Act robbery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Brewton next contends that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the government\u2019s theory of aiding and abetting the use or brandishing of a fire arm during the robbery. We have said that \u201cwhere a defendant agrees to the court\u2019s proposed instructions, the doctrine of invited error applies, meaning that review is waived even if plain error would result.\u201d United States v. Carter, 776 F.3d 1309, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015). Here, Brew-ton\u2019s attorney accepted the court\u2019s proposed jury instructions by affirmatively stating that he had no objections to them. As such, any error was invited and Brew-ton has waived his right to challenge the jury instruction on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Brewton contends that the district court violated his due process rights when it admitted Bendahan\u2019s out-of-court identification. Because Brewton failed to object to the introduction of Bendahan\u2019s out-of-court identification in the district court, we review only for plain error. United States v. Chilcote, 724 F.2d 1498, 1503 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">We use \u201ca two-step analysis in assessing the constitutionality of a trial court\u2019s decision to admit an out-of-court identification.\u201d Diaz, 248 F.3d at 1102. We must first \u201cdetermine whether the original identification procedure was unduly suggestive.\u201d Id. \u201cIf we conclude that it was suggestive, we then must consider whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was nonetheless reliable.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>There is absolutely no indication that the procedure by which Bendahan identified Brewton was unduly suggestive. Indeed, Brewton does not allege that the identification procedure was unduly suggestive. He instead asserts that Benda-han\u2019s identification was unreliable \u201cbecause the robbery lasted only a few minutes and Mr. Bendahan ... was under a great amount of stress.\u201d Without more, that is insufficient to show that the district court plainly erred by admitting Bendahan\u2019s out-of-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Brewton also contends that the combination of trial errors warrant reversal of his conviction under the cumulative error doctrine. Because Brewton has failed to establish that any of the district court\u2019s rulings were erroneous, \u201cthe argument that cumulative trial error requires that this Court reverse [his] convictions is without merit.\u201d United States v. Taylor, 417 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Finally, Brewton challenges his sentence on three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">He first argues that the district court erred in calculating his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 and in applying the career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Under \u00a7 2K2.1, a defendant\u2019s base offense level is 24 \u201cif the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement applies when, among other thiAgs, \u201cthe defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is the same in both \u00a7 2K2.1 and \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">The district court identified five potential predicate offenses, all from Florida: (1) robbery; (2) burglary of a dwelling; (3) battery on a law enforcement officer; (4) escape; and (5) resisting an officer with violence. Brewton contends that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), his convictions for Florida burglary, battery on law enforcement officer, and escape no longer qualify as crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">Brewton\u2019s argument fails for two independently sufficient reasons. The first independently sufficient reason that his argument fails is because, as Brewton himself concedes, his convictions for robbery and resisting arrest an officer with violence still qualify as crimes of violence under our circuit\u2019s binding precedent. See United States v. Lockley, 632 F.3d 1238, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2011); United States v. Hill, 799 F.3d 1318, 1321-23 (11th Cir. 2015). Thus, even if his convictions for Florida burglary, battery on law enforcement officer, and escape no longer qualify as crimes of violence, he still has at least two other felony convictions that do qualify has crimes of violence. Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating his base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1 and in applying the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">The second independently sufficient reason his argument fails is because it is foreclosed by our decision in United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 2015). There, we held that the vagueness doctrine and the holding of Johnson do not apply to the career offender guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>line. Id. at 1193-96. Brewton cites the Supreme Court\u2019s recent grant of certiorari in Beckles v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2510, 195 L.Ed.2d 838 (2016), which involves the question whether Johnson applies to the sentencing. guidelines, and Brewton suggests that the Court may abrogate our Matchett decision in Beckles. As we have explained before, however, \u201cgrants of certiorari do not themselves change the law,\u201d and \u201c[u]ntil the Supreme Court issues a decision that actually changes the law, we are duty-bound to apply this Court\u2019s precedent.\u201d Gissendaner v. Comm\u2019r, Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 779 F.3d 1275, 1283-84 (11th Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted). We are therefore bound to apply Matchett here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Brewton next argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) constituted Impermissible double counting. Because Brewton did not raise that argument in the district court, we review only for plain error. See United States v. Duncan, 400 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">\u201cImpermissible double count occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d United States v. Dudley, 463 F.3d 1221, 1226-27 (11th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cDouble counting a factor during sentencing is permitted if the Sentencing Commission intended that result and each guideline section in question concerns conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing.\u201d Id. at 1227 (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Section 2K2.1(b)(6) directs a sentencing judge to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by four if the defendant \u201c[u]sed or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). The commentary to the guidelines provides that \u201c[i]f a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any.specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive, or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2K2.4 cmt. n.4. That means that \u201cwhen a defendant is convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) violation and an underlying offense, the defendant\u2019s possession of a weapon cannot be used to enhance the level of the underlying offense.\u201d Diaz, 248 F.3d at 1107 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Brewton argues that the district court applied \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) to enhance his offense level for possessing a gun during the underlying Hobbs Act robbery offense even though he was convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) violation in relation to that robbery. However, even if the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement, that error did not prejudice Brewton because it did not affect his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Brewton\u2019s adjusted offense level with the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was 30. But, after determining that Brewton qualified fop the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement, the court increased his offense level to 37 because that offense level was \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Thus, the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement had no effect on Brewton\u2019s total offense level and ultimate guideline range because, absent the enhancement, his total offense level would have still been 37 under \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, Brewton cannot establish plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">Lastly, Brewton argues that his 360-month total sentence was procedurally and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>substantively unreasonable. He first argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because it was based on the district court\u2019s erroneous application of the guidelines. As we have already explained, however, the court did not err in calculating Brewton\u2019s base offense level or in applying the guideline enhancements. His sentence was therefore procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"ATm\">Brewton next argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the court improperly weighed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors by failing to adequately consider his mitigating factors such as his minor child, mental health issues, and drug addictions. That assertion, without more, is not enough to show that the district court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. See United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cWe will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unless the district court has made a clear error of judgment and has imposed a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Moreover, his sentence was at the low end of his advisory guideline range, which we ordinarily expect to be reasonable. See United States v. Hunt, 526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir. 2008). He has failed to show that his sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AoI\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
