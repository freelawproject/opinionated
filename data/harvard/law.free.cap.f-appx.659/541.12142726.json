Mills contends the ALJ committed reversible error in failing to analyze his mental impairment using the special technique required by the Social Security regulations and <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1213-14 (11th Cir. 2005), because the evidence in the record established that he presented a colorable claim of mental impairment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-16\">The ALJ did not make a specific finding regarding whether Mills presented a color-able claim of mental impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 1214 (discussing \u201ca colorable claim of mental impairment\u201d). However, because the ALJ analyzed and discussed Mills\u2019 evidence of mental impairment including complaints of depression and a bipolar diagnosis, we infer from that analysis and discussion that the ALJ determined that Mills\u2019 claim was' at least colorable. <em>See Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 326 n.6, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984) (\u201cA colorable claim, of course, presupposes that there is some possible validity to a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">Because the ALJ implicitly found that Mills presented a colorable claim of mental impairment, our precedent and the Social Security regulations require the ALJ to complete a Psychiatric Review Technique <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Form (PRTF) or incorporate the analysis of a PRTF into the decision. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1214 (construing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 4024.1520a and stating \u201cthe social security regulations require the ALJ to complete a PRTF and append it to the decision, or incorporate its mode of analysis into [the ALJ\u2019s] findings and conclusions\u201d if a claimant has presented a colorable claim of mental irfipairment). It is undisputed that the ALJ did not complete a PRTF and append it to the decision;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thus, we must determine if the ALJ\u2019s analysis of Mills\u2019 mental impairment incorporated the PRTF technique into the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The PRTF technique requires rating the degree of a claimant\u2019s functional limitations in four broad areas: \u201c[activities of daily living; social functioning; concentration, persistence, or pace; and episodes of decompensation.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(c)(3). The regulations provide the first three factors (activities of daily living; social functioning; and concentration, persistence, or pace) are rated on a five-point scale of \u201c[n]one, mild, moderate, marked, and extreme\u201d while the \u201cfourth functional area (episodes of decompensation)\u201d is rated using \u201cthe following four-point scale: [n]one, one or two, three, four or more.\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a(c)(4). The regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">At the [ALJ] hearing and Appeals Council levels, the written decision must incorporate the pertinent findings and conclusions based on the technique. The decision must show the significant history, including examination and laboratory findings, and the functional limitations that were considered in reaching a con- \u25a0 elusion about the severity of the mental \u25a0 impairment(s). <em>The decision must include a specific finding as to the degree of limitation in each of the functional areas described in paragraph (c) of this section.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.l520a(e)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The ALJ\u2019s decision does not specifically reference the PRTF technique. The ALJ discusses some of the functional areas in analyzing Mills\u2019 claim, however, so we must determine whether the ALJ\u2019s reasoning was enough to comply with the PRTF requirement. <em>See Moore, </em>403 F.3d at 1214. As to activities of daily living, the ALJ found \u201c[t]he claimant\u2019s activities of daily living do no[t] evidence any limitations due to mental impairments.\u201d As to concentration, persistence, and pace, the ALJ\u2019s decision discussed that Mills reported difficulty with concentration because of pain, but that the limitation was the result of his physical condition. .The ALJ also noted that Mills alleged problems completing tasks, but then reported he finishes what he starts. This limitation was as a result of Mills\u2019 physical condition, however. The ALJ noted that on an October 2010, report, that Mills no longer alleged problems with concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">The ALJ\u2019s opinion references one episode of decompensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>cussed Mills\u2019 involuntary hospitalization under the Baker Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in January 2009. In this episode of decompensation, the claimant\u2019s wife \u201ccalled the police after [Mills] turned off the electricity in his home, kept his father-in-law confined to his room, and indicated that he thought he was God and Bin Laden lived next door.\u201d Mills denied feeling depressed, having hallucinations, or having suicidal or homicidal ideations. Mills denied ever seeing a psychiatrist or taking any psychotropic medications. Mills admitted to mood swings and racing thoughts, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Mills was discharged with medications, and was to follow up with an outpatient clinic. There was no record of any follow up treatment, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Thus, at the time of the ALJ\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mills had one episode of decompensation in the record. The ALJ then found, despite that single hospital admission, that Mills did not have a severe mental impairment. The ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Despite, that single admission, there is no evidence of any mental functional limitations, no complaints of depression to any treating source, and no treatment for a mental health complaint. The claimant\u2019s activities of daily living do no[t] evidence any limitations due to mental impairments. Accordingly, the claimant does not have a severe mental impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Although the ALJ\u2019s opinion incorporated analysis of three of the four functional limitations, the decision does not reference social functioning. The regulations state \u201c[t]he decision must include a specific finding as to the degree of limitation in <em>each </em>of the functional areas described.... \u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a(e)(4) (emphasis added). The ALJ\u2019s decision does not include a specific finding as to the degree of limitation in social functioning, and therefore does not comply with the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to remand the matter to the ALJ for an evaluation of Mills\u2019 mental impairment that complies with the applicable regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\">.

While the record contains a PRTF prepared by a psychologist in December 2010, that PRTF makes no mention of Mills\u2019 diagnosed bipolar disorder and was not attached to or referenced in the All's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">. Episodes of decompensation are exacer-bations or temporary increases in symptoms or signs accompanied by a loss of adaptive functioning, as manifested by difficulties in performing activities of daily living, maintaining social relationships, or maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace. Episodes of decompensation may be demonstrated by an exacerbation in symptoms or signs that would ordinarily require increased treatment or a less stressful situation (or a combination of the two). Episodes of decompensation may be inferred from medical records showing significant alteration in medication; or documenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tion of the need for a more structured psychological support system (e.g. hospitalizations, placement in a halfway house, or a highly structured and directing household); or other relevant information in the record about the existence, severity, and duration of the episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">20 C.F.R.
