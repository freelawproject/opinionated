Arnold appeals from the District Court for the Southern District of Alabama\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendant-appellee Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (\u201cBay-view\u201d). Arnold\u2019s complaint alleged in relevant part that Bayview, the servicer of Arnold\u2019s mortgage loan, sent Arnold two mortgage statements in December 2013, a year after Arnold had received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge and several weeks after the property had been foreclosed. Arnold alleged that Bayview\u2019s issuance of these statements violated the Fair Debt collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 et seg. Specifically, Arnold alleged three causes of action based on the two December statements: (1) harassment in connection with the collection of a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692d; (2) false or misleading representation in connection with the collection of a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e; and (3) use of unfair or unconscionable means to attempt to collect a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(l). The district court granted summary judgment to Bayview on the ground that there was no genuine question of fact that\u201d the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c). On appeal, Arnold argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on the bona fide error defense. Upon review of the briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo. Mais v. Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc., 768 F.3d 1110, 1119 (11th Cir. 2014). A motion for summary judgment is properly granted when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">The FDCPA is a consumer protection statute that \u201cimposes open-ended prohibitions on, inter alia, false, deceptive or unfair\u201d debt-collection practices. Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich LPA, 559 U.S. 573, 587, 130 S.Ct. 1605, 176 L.Ed.2d 519 (2010) (quotation marks and citations omitted). To enforce the FDCPA\u2019s prohibitions, Congress equipped consumer debtors with a private right of action, rendering \u201cdebt collectors who vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>late the Act liable for actual damages, statutory damages up to $1,000, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d Owen v. I.C. Sys., Inc., 629 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir. 2011), \u201c[T]he FDCPA affords a narrow carve-out to the general rule of strict liability, known as the \u2018bona fide error\u2019 defense.\u201d Id at 1271. The defense is provided in 15 US.C. \u00a7 1692k(c), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adxm\">(c) Intent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-4\">A debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under this sub-chapter if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIX-\">As we have explained, this defense \u201cinsulates [debt collectors] from liability even when they have failed to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements.\u201d Edwards v. Niagara Credit Solutions, Inc., 584 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">\u201cA debt collector asserting the bona fide error defense must show by a preponderance of the evidence that its violation of the Act: (1) was not intentional; (2) was a bona fide error; and (3) occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u2019.\u2019 Id., 584 F.3d at 1352-53 (citing Johnson v. Riddle, 443 F.3d 723, 727-28 (10th Cir. 2006)). The failure to meet any one of those three requirements is fatal to the defense. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">On appeal, Arnold argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Bayview because there are genuine questions of fact as to each of the three prongs of the bona fide error defense. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The first prong of the bona fide error defense is that Bayview must show that its violation of the act \u201cwas not intentional.\u201d Id. at 1353. This element requires a showing \u201cthat the violation was unintentional, not that the underlying act was unintentional,\u201d such that Bayview must \u201cestablish the lack of specific intent to violate the Act. Riddle, 443 F.3d at 728. As discussed in detail by the district court, Bayview put forward ample evidence to show that the December statements were sent to Arnold due to what can only be described as a mistake. See Docket 81 at 14-15. The dispatch of the December statements was triggered by an employee performing a routine pre-foreclosure review of the computerized record of Arnold\u2019s loan and accidentally changing one letter in one field such that the computerized system began sending out statements automatically. This changed the coding for the loan from \u201cF\u201d (\u201cForeclosure\u201d)\u2014which automatically prevented any outgoing statements\u2014to \u201cA\u201d (\u201cAsset Management\u201d)\u2014an active loan status which caused statements to be issued. This occurred despite the fact that Arnold\u2019s loan had previously been specifically coded not to receive statements as a result of the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Arnold argues on appeal that the evidence proffered by Bayview is insufficient to show that the violation was unintentional because \u201c[t]he act of sending of a statement is not and has never been what Arnold\u2019s case is about. Instead, the ease is about the format and content of the statements used.\u201d Br. For Appellant at 27. More specifically Arnold argues that \u201c[i]t is irrelevant that Bayview claims that [the]statements were sent in error because it intentionally uses the form statements at issue to bill mortgage borrowers with discharged debts.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 35. In other words, Arnold argues that Bayview\u2019s defense is belied by the fact that Bayview allegedly had no system in place to prevent the sending of form statements to mortgage borrowers with discharged debts. It is difficult to understand this argument. The violations complained of\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>harassment in connection with the collection of a debt, false or misleading representation in connection with the collection of a debt, and the use of unfair or unconscionable means to attempt to collect a debt\u2014all stem from the two statements sent by Bayview in December 2013. If Bayview did not intend to send these statements\u2014a point which Arnold does not contest\u2014then there can be doubt that its violation of the act \u201cwas not intentional.\u201d Edwards, 584 F.3d at 1353. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that Bay-view has readily satisfied the first prong of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The second prong of the bona fide error defense is that Bayview must show that its violation of the act \u201cwas a bona fide error.\u201d Id. at 1353. \u201cAs used in the Act, \u2018bona fide\u2019 means that the error resulting in a violation was \u2018made in good faith; a genuine mistake, as opposed to a contrived mistake.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1353 (citing Kort v. Diversified Collection Servs., Inc., 394 F.3d 530, 538 (7th Cir. 2005)). \u201cTo be considered a bona fide error, the debt collector\u2019s mistake must be objectively reasonable.\u201d Id. As discussed by the district court, Bayview argued that it was objectively reasonable to rely on its coding system to prevent the dispatch of statements in violation of the Act. Bayview had no reason to believe that the code would be changed during the pre-foreclosure review process. That routine process was performed by employees trained in the requirements of the FDCPA and guided by a detailed checklist.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Arnold argues on appeal that the evidence proffered by Bayview to demonstrate that its violation of the Act was a bona fide error is insufficient because Bay-view intentionally uses the form statements at issue to bill mortgage borrowers with discharged debts. Br. For Appellant at 26-27. This is simply a reprise of Ar-. nold\u2019s argument on the first prong, which we rejected above. We agree with the district court that Bayview\u2019s mistake in issuing the December 2013 billing statements to Arnold was a bona fide error.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">The third prong of the bona fide error defense is that Bayview must show that its violation of the act \u201coccurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such error.\u201d Edwards, 584 F.3d at 1353. As discussed by the district court, Bayview argued that its general training procedures, as well as its specific procedures or pre-closure review, were designed to avoid sending statements like the December 2013 statements. In addition to the coded computerized record system and detailed pre-foreclosure checklist discussed above, Bayview also points to its written policies and ongoing training procedures instructing employees about FDCPA prohibitions on false, deceptive, or misleading representations. Bayview argues that these procedures are adapted to avoid error, and that no statement would have been sent but for an employee mistakenly changing a field.in the computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Arnold argues on appeal that Bay-view\u2019s procedures are not reasonably adapted to avoid the error in the instant case \u25a0 because Bayview allegedly had no system in place to prevent the sending of form statements to mortgage borrowers with discharged debts. Specifically, Arnold points out that the Bayview computer system had no code for discharged debts. But such a code, even if it did exist, would not have prevented the error here: an employee mistakenly changing a field in the computer system. Just as an employee here mistakenly changed the code from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cA\u201d an employee could have mistakenly changed the field from Discharged to Active. Arnold also argues that Bayview could have drafted a different wording for the statement that would have made clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that it was not seeking payment from Arnold. However, whether or not the alternative wording suggested by Arnold would have cured the alleged violation, the existence of such an alternative does not challenge the substantial evidence put forward by Bayview that it maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid error. We agree with the district court that Bayview maintained adequate procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">We conclude that there is no genuine question of fact that Bayview has established all three elements of the bona fide error defense. Therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
