The district court ruled that Banner\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Banner\u2019s sentence based on judicial vindictiveness. The Secretary argues that the \u2019district court failed to give appropriate deference to the decision of the state court that trial counsel was not required to object after Banner received a sentence longer than that offered to him before trial because of the facts disclosed at his trial and his lengthy criminal history. Because the district court refused to credit the reasonable factual findings of the state court that its sentence was not attributable to vindictiveness and its reasonable determination that counsel was not deficient in failing to object to Banner\u2019s sentence, we reverse and remand with an instruction that the district court deny Banner\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">We divide our discussion of the background into four parts. First, we discuss Banner\u2019s rejection of a plea offer and his trial. Second, we discuss his belated direct appeal. Third, we discuss his state postcon-viction proceedings. Fourth, we discuss Banner\u2019s, federal habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">\n<em>A, Banner\u2019s Rejection of a Plea Offer and Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">Banner appeared in a Florida court for trial on five criminal charges: burglary of a dwelling, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(1), (3); aggravated fleeing or eluding, <em>id, </em>\u00a7 316.1935(3)(a); grand theft, <em>id, </em>\u00a7 812,014(1), (2)(c)(6); exposure of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>organs, <em>id, </em>\u00a7 800.03; and resisting an officer without violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 843.02. Before jury selection, the prosecutor asked to record a plea offer that Banner had rejected. The prosecutor represented that she had offered to reduce Banner\u2019s charges for his burglary and fleeing offenses, which would have lowered both his maximum penalty as an habitual felony offender from 30 years to 5 years and 1 day and his minimum penalty as a prison release reoffender from 15 years to 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">Banner declared that he \u201calready [knew] what [he was] looking at.\u201d The trial judge remarked that he was unfamiliar with Banner\u2019s' case and conducted a brief colloquy with Banner. Banner stated that he understood the charges against him and the accompanying penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Banner said he did not \u201cunderstand the [State\u2019s] offer.\u201d The trial judge explained that Banner faced \u201cup to 30 years [for his burglary and fleeing offenses] because they\u2019re second degree felonies,\u201d but the prosecutor had offered to reduce the charges to \u201cattempted burglary of a dwelling\u201d and \u201cattempted aggravated fleeing or eluding,\u201d which were \u201cthird-degree felonies,\u201d and to recommend a sentence of \u201cfive years and one day as an habitual felony offender with a five year minimum mandatory as a prison release reoffender.\u201d Banner interjected that he was innocent; his \u201ccharges [were] weak\u201d; and he \u201cwas invited in\u201d the person\u2019s house, which \u201c[s]hould basically be a trespass.\u201d When the trial judge remarked that the prosecutor was \u201cnot offering you a trespass,\u201d Banner responded, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to give me the maximum on these look like charges, but I\u2019m ready to let the jury decide my fate. I just come back on appeal now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">The trial judge questioned Banner again, and he reaffirmed that he understood his charges, his potential sentence, and the State\u2019s offer to plead guilty. The trial judge told Banner that he was entitled to \u201cdecline [the] offer and exercise your constitutional right to go to trial and that means that if the jury was to find you guilty, then their offer would be revoked, so you\u2019re looking at whatever your penalties are. If they find you not guilty, then of course you walk out of here without a problem.\u201d Banner said that he understood his rights and that he had discussed his case with his attorney, although they \u201c[did not] come to terms with a lot of things.\u201d The trial judge stated that Banner should confer with his attorney \u201ca couple more minutes,\u201d but when \u201cthe panel [was] here, the Court will not be accepting any further negotiated pleas.\u201d After the break, Banner announced that he wanted to \u201c[g]o to trial. I\u2019m going to proceed on the jury trial,\u201d and the prosecutor \u201crevok[ed] [the] offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">After the parties seated a jury, the prosecutor announced that the trial would be limited to the charges of aggravated fleeing and grand theft. And the prosecutor remarked that Banner no longer qualified as a prison release reoffender so he faced a minimum sentence of 31.425 months. The prosecutor had offered Banner 32 months \u201cto resolve this,\u201d but she \u201c[did not] believe they\u2019re interested in that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">When questioned by the trial judge a third time, Banner acknowledged that he understood the two charges against him, his sentencing range, and the State\u2019s offer to plead guilty, but he wanted to proceed to trial. Banner stated that he was \u201chaving problems\u201d with counsel and he wanted \u201csomebody to listen ... and understand where [he was] coming from.\u201d Banner complained that he was \u201cnot getting the proper attention\u201d and needed \u201c[c]ounseling ... being that I\u2019m going to trial, jury trial. ... I don\u2019t need somebody come to me telling me about\u2014threatening me about what I\u2019m facing, I\u2019m habitual ... I want to hear something about going to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>The trial judge explained to Banner that it was counsel\u2019s responsibility'to defend his client and to inform Banner \u201cthat there\u2019s a big difference ... between 32 months in Florida State Prison and 30 years in Florida State Prison.\u201d \u201c[I]f you tell [counsel] that you\u2019re not taking the offer,\u201d the trial judge assured Banner, counsel \u201cwill be the strongest advocate that you have seen on your behalf.\u201d \u201cBut at the same time,\u201d the trial judge cautioned Banner, \u201cI don\u2019t want later on, if things don\u2019t go your way and the jury does not find you not guilty, and this Court sentences you to 30 years in Florida State Prison as an habitual felony offender for you to say well, you know what, my lawyer should have discussed that with me.\u201d The trial judge said that he would give Banner \u201csome time to talk to [counsel], but you have to regroup a little bit your thinking\u201d to focus on the task counsel faced \u201cto open holes on the credibility of the police officers without any other witnesses other than putting you on the stand\u201d and, \u201c[i]f he puts you on the stand, 10 prior felony convictions the jury is going to hear.\u201d That, the trial judge stated, is \u201cwhat maybe [counsel] is trying to attempt for you to think about.\u201d The trial judge reminded Banner that, even if the State proved the lesser charge of fleeing and eluding, he could receive up to 10 years in prison, which was \u201cdifferen[t] ... [from] 31.425 months in Florida State Prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">The trial judge said, \u201cI love to try cases and I\u2019m ready to try this case,\u201d yet \u201cI take no pleasure ... of entering long sentences. But that\u2019s what I will do if it\u2019s what I\u2019m required to do if the jury finds you guilty.\u201d Banner remarked, \u201cIf I take it to trial, it\u2019s your job to give me whatever the max is on.\u201d But the judge responded that Banner\u2019s sentence would be \u201c[w]hatever is appropriate\u201d based on \u201cwhatever is presented at the sentencing hearing, if in fact there is a guilty verdict.\u201d The trial judge explained that counsel\u2019s job was to inform Banner about \u201cthe good, the bad, and the ugly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">The trial judge twice inquired if Banner wanted to discharge counsel, but Banner responded negatively. The trial judge assured Banner that he would receive a fair trial and added, \u201csometimes, unfortunately, what defendants don\u2019t like in repeat offender court, it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t get a fair trial, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t like the sentences at the end because they face [the] reality of the statute they\u2019re designated under and the intent of the legislature.\u201d Banner conferred with counsel and elected to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">At trial, the State proved that Banner was driving a stolen rental van and he refused to stop for police officers, drove through a gas station, crashed his car into a fence, and attempted unsuccessfully to flee on foot. The jury convicted Banner of aggravated fleeing or eluding and trespass to a conveyance, a lesser-included offense of grand theft. Banner requested a presen-tence investigation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">At sentencing, Banner stipulated that he had prior felony convictions for four counts of grand theft and one count of resisting a law enforcement officer without violence, of fleeing a police officer, and of driving with a suspended license. Banner also stipulated that he had been released from jail on March 7, 2003. The trial judge sentenced Banner, as an habitual felony offender, to 30 years of imprisonment for aggravated fleeing or eluding, with a mandatory minimum \u201csentence of 15 years as a prison release reoffender,\u201d and to time served for trespass to a conveyance. The sentence, the trial judge explained, was based on the evidence at trial; the arguments of the parties; the charging document; Banner\u2019s presentence report that \u201ccontained] four and a half pages of prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>criminal history that started [on] July 12 of 1981 [and] continued in \u201982, \u201983, in \u201984, in \u201985, \u201989, \u201999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004\u201d; and \u201cthe crime for which [he was] being sentenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">\n<em>B.Banner\u2019s Belated Direct Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Banner filed a belated direct appeal and challenged his classification as a prison release reoffender. The State conceded error. The Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed Banner\u2019s sentence of 30 years of imprisonment, but vacated his mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment. <em>Banner v. State, 4 </em>So.3d 789 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">\n<em>C.Banner\u2019s State Postconviction Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Banner twice moved for postconviction relief in the state courts. Banner first filed a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus and argued that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge as insufficient the evidence of aggravated fleeing or eluding. The state court denied Banner\u2019s petition summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Banner next moved for state postconviction relief on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to \u201cthe vindictive sentence the court imposed after [he] elected to proceed to trial after the court injected itself into the unsuccessful plea negotiations.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The State responded that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object when, under Florida law, Banner was not entitled to a presumption of judicial vindictiveness. According to the State, the record proved that the trial judge did not initiate plea discussions; he participated to ensure that Banner understood his charges, potential penalties, and the State\u2019s offer; and the trial judge stated that Banner\u2019s sentence would be based on the evidence presented and not his decision to proceed to trial. The state court denied Banner\u2019s motion based on the \u201creasons articulated in the State\u2019s response,\u201d and j;he appellate court affirmed summarily, <em>Banner v. State, </em>93 So.3d 1041 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">\n<em>D.Banner\u2019s Federal Habeas Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">Banner repeated his claim of ineffectiveness in his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Secretary answered that Banner was not entitled to a presumption of judicial vindictiveness and that trial counsel was not required to make a merit-less objection to Banner\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">A magistrate judge appointed counsel to represent Banner. Federal counsel argued that a reasonable attorney would have litigated whether Banner was entitled to a presumption of vindictiveness because the trial judge intervened in plea discussions without a request from either party; the trial judge suggested that Banner would receive a harsher penalty if he exercised his right to proceed to trial; there was a substantial disparity between the sentence offered before trial and that imposed after trial; and there was no new information presented after the offer to warrant a 30-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-13\">The magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant Banner\u2019s petition. The magistrate judge determined that the state court unreasonably applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), because trial counsel should have objected to Banner\u2019s sentence based on judicial vindictiveness. After <em>de novo </em>review, the district court \u201cdecline[d] to adopt the [initial] Report and re-refer[red] [the] matter to [the magistrate judge] for further recommendation, including the manner and procedure by which the Florida Court could correct the putative constitutional error, and to whom such directive should issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The magistrate judge prepared a supplemental report containing the same conclusion as the initial report. The magistrate judge faulted the state court for failing to \u201cmake its own factual findings\u201d and \u201cdeny[ing] relief for the reasons stated in the State\u2019s response.\u201d After classifying \u201c[tjhose factual findings [as] objectively unreasonable,\u201d the magistrate judge found that \u201cthe [trial] court inserted itself into the plea negotiations, urged Banner to accept a thirty-two month plea offer, suggested the jury would not find him credible due to his criminal history, and suggested that a maximum sentence of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment would be imposed if the jury found him guilty.\u201d That reading of \u201cthe record satisfie[d] all four prongs of\u2019 the totality of the circumstances test applied by the Florida courts and entitled Banner, the magistrate judge determined, to a \u201cpresumption of vindictiveness\u201d that should have been litigated by trial counsel. And Banner was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object, the magistrate judge decided, because \u201cBanner would have been entitled to sentencing before a new judge.\u201d The magistrate judge ruled, in the alternative, that \u201c[e]ven if [the] claim is analyzed with the deference normally afforded State court\u2019s decisions the outcome would be the same\u201d because \u201cit is not possible that fairminded jurists could disagree that [the] arguments and theories [relied on by the state court] conflict with <em>Strickland.\u201d </em>Over the Secretary\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge, granted Banner a writ of habeas corpus, and ordered the State either to resentence Banner or to release him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">A petition for a writ of habeas corpus involving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Reed v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>767 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir. 2014). A state prisoner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The prisoner bears the burden of rebutting the factual findings of the state court \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1). \u201cA state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as \u2018fairminded jurists could disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Woods v. Etherton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1149, 1151, 194 L.Ed.2d 333 (2016) (quoting <em>Harrington v. </em>Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)). To warrant habe-as relief, the decision of the state court \u201cmust be \u2018so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>White v. Woodall, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1697, 1702, 188 L.Ed.2d 698 (2014)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">The Supreme Court has stated repeatedly that a federal court reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must apply a \u201c\u2018doubly deferential\u2019 standard of review that gives both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Burt v. Titlow, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 10, 13, 187 L.Ed.2d 348 (2013) (citing <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011)); <em>see Woods, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1151; <em>Premo v. Moore, </em>562 U.S. 115, 131 S.Ct. 733, 740,178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011). Under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201cthe standard for judging counsel\u2019s performance is a most deferential one\u201d that focuses on \u201cwhether [counsel\u2019s] repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>sentation amounted to incompetence under prevailing professional norms, not whether [he] deviated from best practices or most common custom.\u201d <em>Premo, </em>131 S.Ct. at 740 (quoting <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. at 105, 131 S.Ct. 770). And when counsel\u2019s performance is reviewed in federal habeas court, \u201cthe question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable\u201d; instead, \u201c[t]he question is whether there is. any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Richter, </em>562 U.S. at 105, 131 S.Ct. 770).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">The factual findings of the state court are entitled to deference from federal courts. The \u201cdetermination of a factual issue ... by a State court [is] presumed to be correct\u201d unless the state prisoner can rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Accordingly, \u201ca state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u201d <em>Titlow, </em>134 S.Ct. at 15 (quoting <em>Wood v. Allen, </em>558 U.S. 290, 301, 130 S.Ct. 841, 175 L.Ed.2d 738 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Banner argues that the factual findings of the magistrate judge should be reviewed for plain error because the Secretary failed to object to the initial report and recommendation, but we disagree. The district court \u201cdeclined to adopt\u201d the initial report. Instead, the district court \u201cre-refer[red] [the] matter back to [the] magistrate judge to make further recommendation, including the manner and procedure\u201d to give Banner relief. Later, the district court construed its order as \u201cre-referring the ... cause ... [solely] for further recommendation regarding the manner and procedure\u201d for relief, but the order rejected the initial report. And the magistrate judge interpreted the order as requiring a \u201cfurther recommendation <em>including </em>the manner and procedure\u201d to correct the purported constitutional error. Consistent with that interpretation, the magistrate judge did not reincorporate or refer to his initial report. The magistrate judge prepared a new report, entitled a supplemental report, in which he- made findings of fact about the conduct of the trial judge and defense counsel, concluded that the conduct of the trial judge created a presumption of judicial vindictiveness that counsel was deficient for failing to challenge, and recommended that the district court grant Banner a writ of habeas corpus. The Secretary timely objected to the supplemental report. By so doing, the Secretary preserved for review its objection to the finding that Banner\u2019s sentence was based on vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">The district court erred. The record supports the finding of the state court that no presumption of vindictiveness arose from the imposition of a sentence exceeding the offer extended to Banner before trial. Florida courts examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that a sentence evidences reprisal by the trial court. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>845 So.2d 142, 156 (Fla. 2003). The factors considered include whether the trial judge initiated the plea discussion with the defendant; whether the judge urged the defendant to plead guilty or suggested his sentence \u201cwould hinge on future procedural choices, such as exercising the right to trial\u201d; \u201cthe disparity between the plea offer and the ultimate sentence imposed\u201d; and \u201cthe lack of any facts ... [to] explain the reason for the increased sentence other than that the defendant exercised his ... right to a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the magistrate judge faulted the state trial judge for interfering in plea negotiations and \u201curg[ing] Banner to accept a thirty-two month plea offer,\u201d the trial judge was entitled to \u201cparticipate in such discussions\u201d after Banner said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>did not understand the plea offer, <em>see State v. Warner, </em>762 So.2d 507, 513 (Fla. 2000), to ensure that Banner understood he faced a significantly greater punishment if convicted and that he wished to proceed to trial with an attorney whom he had criticized. Instead of \u201csuggest[ing] the jury would not find [Banner] credible due to his criminal history,\u201d the trial judge mentioned Banner\u2019s criminal history to explain that his attorney was obligated to educate him about his case and to advise him whether a plea deal or trial was most advantageous. And the trial judge assured Banner that his sentence would ' be \u201c[w]hatever is appropriate\u201d based on \u201cwhatever is presented at the sentencing hearing, if in fact there is a guilty verdict.\u201d The trial judge informed Banner that the sentencing guidelines mandated that an habitual offender receive a sentence of 30 years because Banner refused to credit that information from his attorney. Furthermore, the record reflects that the trial judge imposed a sentence greater than that offered before trial based on the change in Banner\u2019s situation and additional information garnered about Banner. <em>See Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 801-02, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989); <em>Frank v. Blackburn, </em>646 F.2d 873, 883-87 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Cousin v. Blackburn, </em>597 F.2d 511, 512-13 (5th Cir. 1979). The offense for which Banner was convicted was more serious than the charge to which he could have pleaded guilty, and the trial judge learned at trial and sentencing about the circumstances of Banner\u2019s offense and the full extent of his criminal history, which was described in his presentence investigation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">.The district court was \u201cdoubly wrong to conclude that it would have been unreasonable to find that the defense attorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>Premo, </em>131 S.Ct. at 740. Because Banner failed to \u201cdemon-stratet ] a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing judge,\u201d counsel could not be faulted for failing to object- on that ground to Banner\u2019s sentence. <em>See Miller v. Dugger, </em>858 F.2d 1536, 1538 (11th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[C]ounsel may be effective and yet not raise claims reasonably considered to be without merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
