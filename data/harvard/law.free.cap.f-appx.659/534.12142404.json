DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>A. Voluntary statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Stinson first contends the district court erred when it found that incriminating statements he made to law enforcement were knowingly and voluntarily made, and elicited outside the context of custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), \u201cestablished that custodial interrogation cannot occur before a suspect is warned of [his] rights against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1224 (11th Cir. 2007). Pre-custodial questioning, in contrast, does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1309 (11th Cir. 2006). We have described the test for determining custody as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">A defendant is in custody for the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>when there has been a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. Whether [a defendant] was in custody prior to his formal arrest depends on whether under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable man in his position would feel a restraint on his freedom of movement to such extent that he would not feel free to leave. The test is objective: the actual, subjective beliefs of the defendant and the interviewing officer on whether \u25a0 the defendant was free to leave are irrelevant. Under the objective standard, the reasonable person from whose perspective \u2018custody\u2019 is defined is a reasonable innocent person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-9\"><em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1347 (11th Cir. 2006) (quotations, citations, alteration, and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">We consider several factors in determining custody, \u201cincluding whether the officers brandished weapons, touched the suspect, or used language or a tone that indicated that compliance with the officers could be compelled.\u201d <em>Street, </em>472 F.3d at 1309 (quotation omitted). An interviewee\u2019s \u201cstatus as a suspect, and the \u2018coercive environment\u2019 that exists in virtually every interview by <em>a - </em>police officer of a crime suspect,\u201d does not automatically create a custodial situation. <em>United States v. Muegge, </em>225 F.3d 1267, 1270 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The district court did not err in finding that Stinson\u2019s statements were vol-' untary and not made while he was under custodial interrogation, Although Stinson had some restriction in his movement while the search of his home was ongoing, the officers did not restrict his freedom to such a degree that a reasonable innocent person would believe he was in \u201ccustody.\u201d <em>See Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1348-49 (holding the defendant was not in custody in part because he was in a familiar setting and because, \u201c[a]lthough an officer accompanied him throughout the house for safety reasons, he was free to eat, smoke, use the phone, and move about as he wished\u201d). Importantly, Stinson was not physically restrained and he terminated the interview and left, without interference from the officers. <em>See Muegge, </em>225 F.3d at 1271 (stating a reasonable person who is told that he may leave an interview at any time is not under custodial interrogation, provided the interrogators did not restrain the suspect in such a way to make the statement meaningless). Moreover, while the officers had visible firearms, the weapons re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>mained in their holsters throughout the interview. Lastly, the interview, which was conducted at Stinson\u2019s home, did not occur in an unfamiliar environment, such as a police station. Therefore, considering the totality of the circumstances, Stinson was not in custody during the interview and, given these circumstances as well as the absence of threats, violence, or other forms of coercion, his statements to the police were made voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Lall, </em>607 F.3d 1277, 1285 (11th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[T]he issue of voluntariness must be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>B. Leadership role</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Stinson also contends the district court clearly erred by finding he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants and enhancing his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Section 3Bl.l(a) provides a four-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.1 sets out several factors for courts to consider in determining if the defendant is an organizer or leader, as opposed to a mere manager or supervisor, including the following: (1) the defendant\u2019s exercise of decision making authority; (2) the nature of participation in the offense; (3) recruiting accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the crime; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Stinson was subject to an aggravating role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). First, Stinson was the owner of the stores wherein the fraud occurred, such that he had ultimate control and authority over the actions of the other actors in the fraud. Second, the undisputed PSI facts reveal that Stinson was the primary instigator of the fraud. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833-34 (11th Cir. 2006) (stating the failure to object to facts contained in a PSI admits them for sentencing purposes). Stinson directed his employees to participate in the fraud, trained employees how to participate, and brought cash to the store in order to assist his employees in realizing his scheme. The PSI facts also revealed that Stinson was integral to the planning and organization of the crime\u2014he maintained the lists of \u201cspecial customers\u201d and took control when those extraordinary transactions occurred. Lastly, as the owner of the businesses, Stinson would have the highest share of the fruits of the crime. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that the four-level enhancement applied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">The district court did not err in finding that Stinson voluntarily made the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>portedly incriminating statements because Stinson made the statements at his home, was free to leave, and terminated the interview and left of his own volition. Moreover, the district court did not err in imposing a four-level enhancement to Stinson\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for being a leader in a criminal scheme that involved five or more participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-13\">. \u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmann, </em>741 F.3d 1170, 1177 (11th Cir. 2013) (quotations omitted). We review the district court's factual findings for clear error and the court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is subject to an aggravating role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>clear error. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>179 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">. While Stinson argues it is disproportional for him to receive the four-level leadership-role enhancement when his accomplice and general manager, Doby, received a two-level reduction, the calculation of Doby\u2019s guideline range has no probative value with respect to whether Stinson was a leader in the criminal activity. Additionally, sentencing disparities between codefendants are typically an inappropriate basis for relief on appeal. <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir. 2001). Therefore, Stinson\u2019s dispro-portionality argument was not a valid reason to change Stinson\u2019s advisory guideline range and is not a valid basis for reversal on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
