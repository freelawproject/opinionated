Before McClung, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">At the trial, it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s son, Louis, a boy between twelve and thirteen years of age, was killed by one of plaintiff\u2019s cars on May 31, 1893. The evidence for plaintiff tended to show that at the time of the accident defendant operated a double line of electric railway on Frankstown avenue; and that workmen were laying a gas pipe on the side of the avenue between Torrens street and Findlay street. A ditch had been opened between the curb and track. The ditch itself was about two feet wide, and the space between the ditch and the first rail of the track was about two and one half feet wide. Plaintiff\u2019s son, according to plaintiff\u2019s proofs, jumped over the ditch, and while standing in the space between the ditch and track and looking down into the ditch, was struck by a car running at an unusually high rate of speed without any bell being rung.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">Defendant offered testimony which tended to show that the boy ran on the pavement for some distance parallel to the track and then jumped the ditch and ran in front of the car and was immediately run over. The evidence for defendant also tended to show that the motonnan was running his car at the usual rate of speed, and that he sounded his gong repeatedly as he approached Torrens street. The accident occurred apparently just beyond the crossing of Torrens street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-9\">Defendant\u2019s request for binding instruction was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-10\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above instruction, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-12\"><em>George C. </em>Wilson, <em>Wm.

Chief Justice Stebbett,</author>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Refusal of the court to direct a verdict for defendant, and thus withdraw the case from the jury, is the only error assigned. In view of the conflicting testimony, bearing on the questions of defendant\u2019s negligence and the alleged contributory negligence of the deceased boy, this could not have been done without manifest usurpation of authority and invasion of the province of the jury. If the testimony relied on by the plaintiff was believed, there could be no doubt as to the gross negligence of the defendant, in recklessly running its car at a* dangerously high rate of speed without exercising any of the precautions necessary to warn the deceased and others on the public street of the danger to which they were exposed. On the other hand, the testimony on which defendant relied as tending to prove contributory negligence was of such a conflicting character that it had to be submitted to the jury for their consideration. In any view that can possibly be taken of the case, it involved questions of fact which were exclusivel}'- for the 'determination of the jury ; and to them they were fairly submitted in a clear and able charge, distinctly presenting all the issues of fact, and the law applicable thereto, in such a way that no complaint is made by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Further elaboration is unnecessary. The case was well tried, and there is no error apparent on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
