Hannum, Esq., as master, who reported the facts to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-10\">\u201c 1. That William Marlor, the plaintiff, at the time of the filing of the bill, was seized in fee of a certain lot of ground, situate on the west side of Madison street, in the city of Chester, in the county of Delaware, Pennsylvania; bounded, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-11\">\u201c 2. That erected on said lot was a two-story frame dwelling house, thirty feet in length by fourteen feet in width, with two-story back buildings; also a two-story frame store building, seventeen feet front by thirty feet deep, with two-story back buildings; also a one-story frame store building, twelve feet front. These buildings all adjoin, but there is no communication between the cellars, although there is a communication between all the buildings above ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-12\">\u201c 8. That the southernmost building, and the second story of the middle building, is used by the plaintiff and his family as a dwelling house, the lower part of the middle building\u2019 being used by the plaintiff\u2019s wife as a store. The one-story building at present is not used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u201c 4. That the defendant company is a corporation incorporated by the provisions of the acts of assembly of Pennsylvania, approved April 2, 1831, entitled, \u2018 An act authorizing the governor to incorporate the Philadelphia and Delaware County and Southwark Railroad Companies;\u2019 and March 14, 1836, entitled, \u2018 An act supplementary to the act entitled, \u201c An act authorizing the governor to incorporate the Philadelphia and Delaware and Southwark Railroad Companies,\u201d passed the second day of April, Anno Domini One Thousand Eight Hundred and Thirty-one.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\">\u201c 5. That at a meeting of the board of directors of the defendant company, held at the office of the company, in the city of Philadelphia, on the 26th day of March, 1890, the following resolution was adopted: \u2018 Resolved, that the plan submitted by the chief engineer, showing the proposed widening and improvement of the railroad and station grounds in the city of Chester, Pennsylvania, be and the same is hereby approved; and that the proper officers are hereby authorized to acquire for this company, by purchase or by process of condemnation, the real estate required for said widening and improvements,\u2019 as per certified copy of said resolution and plan, hereto annexed and made a part of this report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-4\">\u201c 6. That by virtue of the authority of its charter and the act of assembly approved March 17, 1869, entitled, \u2018An act to enable railroad, canal and slack-water navigation companies to straighten, widen, deepen and otherwise improve their lines of railroads, canals and slack-water navigation, and the bridges, aqueducts, piers and structures thereof,\u2019 and the foregoing resolution and plan, the said defendant company is proceeding to take and occupy the said premises of the plaintiff for railroad purposes, in the widening, straightening and improving of its line of railroad through the city of Chester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">\u201c 7. That the said appropriation was made by the defendant company under its alleged power of eminent domain, and is without the consent of the plaintiff; and that on November 2, 1891, the said defendant company filed a bond, in the sum of twelve thousand dollars, in the court of common pleas of Delaware county, with security approved by the court, to secure to the plaintiff such damages as he might be entitled to by reason of the taking of his said premises by said company, said bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>being given in accordance with the provisions of the second section of the act of March 17, 1869; and that the said defendant company is proceeding to condemn the said premises under the provisions of the said act of March 17, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\">\u201c 8. That in order to widen the road of the defendant company, in accordance with the plan referred to in the resolution of March 26, 1890, it is necessary that the said railroad company should take all the land of the said plaintiff described in the deed of John Marlor et ux., and the buildings thereon erected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">The master recommended that the bill should be dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">Exceptions to the master\u2019s report were dismissed by the court, Clayton, P. J., filing the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">\u201c The bill alleges that the defendant, in proceedings to widen its road, is about to condemn the land upon which his dwelling house stands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-8\">\u201c The plaintiff claims that his dwelling is exempt from condemnation for railroad purposes, under the 10th section of the act of 1849, P. L. 83. This act is known as the general railroad act, and applies to all railroads chartered under it since its passage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-9\">\u201c The answer admits the proposed condemnation, but claims the right of the defendant\u2019s charter, by special act of assembly of April 2, 1831, P. L. 363, and its supplement of March 14, 1836, P. L. 86, to take a dwelling house if necessar}1-, after securing to the plaintiff full compensation. The company defendant further sets up the act of 1869, P. L, 12, as extending its chartered privilege to the same right it had under its original charter, whenever it became necessary, for public convenience, to widen its road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-10\">\u201c The issue is therefore narrowed down to the following question : Is the act of 1869 to be read as a supplement to all the railroad charters of the state, and to be construed as applying to each charter ? or is it to be read as only a supplement to the act of 1849 (the general railroad law)? It will be observed that the act itself contains no repealing clause, nor does it call itself a supplement to a former law. It gives, in general terms, the absolute right to any railroad, whenever public necessity shall require it, to widen any such road, and to take, in addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tion to its original location, as much adjoining land as may be necessary. It does not restrict the companies from taking lands occupied by dwelling houses. All it provides for is that adequate security shall be first given. The only reference to the act of 1849 is, that the damages shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided by the 11th section of the act of 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-3\">\u201c We are of opinion that the act of 1869 is to be read as a supplement to all charters granted by special laws before the general act of 1849. We decline to pass upon the question, whether, as to charters under the act of 1849, it gives any additional poAVerS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-4\">\u201cWe can see some good reasons why the act of 1869 should be construed as an independent law, giving to all railroads the power, in widening their roads, to take, if necessary, the land' of a dAvelling house. When originally opened, the company could easily avoid dwelling houses, but when a road of a single track was opened some sixty years ago, making two trips in tAventy-four hours through a sparsely populated country, and by the outer suburbs of villages Avhich ha\\Te since become large' cities, it is not difficult to understand Avhy the legislature saw proper, in its wisdom, to grant the right to take the land of a dwelling house, which had been erected, perhaps, since the location of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">\u201c As the strength of a chain is its weakest link, so the capacity of a highway is its narrowest part. What advantage will the public receive by widening this road from Philadelphia to Chester, and from Chester to Baltimore, if it must be confined to a single track in Chester ? It is quite possible that for this and other reasons, the legislature intended the act of 1869 as an independent laAV, granting the commonwealth\u2019s right of eminent domain to all railroads, however chartered, where public necessity requires a widening of the roadbed. We, hoA\\reA7er, do not deem it necessary to pass upon this part of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">\u201c In the case of Stahl v. The Penna. R. R., 155 Pa. 309, the Supreme Court barely touch the issue presented in this case. Using the language quoted by the loAver court in that case, we do not think this is a proper case for an injunction, but a clear-case for damages. The plaintiff cannot be condemned for defending his dwelling house, however humble, and when we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>consider the great advantage to the defendant of having this important question settled, we think it a proper case for a division of the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-4\">\u201c Let the exceptions be dismissed and report of the master be confirmed, costs to be divided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-5\"><em>Error assigned, </em>among others, was (4) decree, dismissing bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-6\"><em>W.
