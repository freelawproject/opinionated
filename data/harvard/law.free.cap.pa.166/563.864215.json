M. Hunter\u2019s Invisible Powder,\u201d viz, deponent and one Charles M. Hooper, each of whom was in that business as competitors as was well known to plaintiff. On August 31, 1892, one L. E. Player, who was the purchasing agent of plaintiffs, and who was the only person with whom defendant had any dealing in relation to the subject-matter of this suit, stated to defendant that plaintiffs desired to purchase from defendant one hundred gross of boxes of said powder, but that said Charles M. Hooper had offered to sell the same to plaintiffs for $12 per gross, and that plaintiffs would give defendant the order if she would sell them at the same price as said Hooper, to wit, $12 per gross. Believing that said statement was true, and in reliance thereupon, defendant made the contract of August 31, 1892, as sued upon. In point of fact said statement was false and untrue and was wholly a malicious lie of said Heyer intentionally and wickedly made for the purpose of cheating and defrauding defendant into selling said powder far below its market price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">\u201c On September 29, 1892, when tbe second of said contracts was made, the same fraud and deception were practiced upon defendant by said Heyer. Deponent cannot say that the prior allegation of an offer by said Hooper to sell said powder at the reduced price was in terms repeated by said Heyer, but all that was said and done was said and done by both parties on the basis that that malicious lie was the truth, and said Heyer knew that defendant was acting in reliance thereupon and was deceived thereby. Said Heyer also then agreed with defendant that if she would sell said powder at said reduced price plaintiffs would not lower the price to consumers and would not interfere with defendant\u2019s other customers in an}&gt;- way. Yet after plaintiffs received the first one hundred gross thereof they at once began to cut the prices and to sell to other cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>tomers of defendant, thereby demoralizing the trade and seriously injuring her business to an extent beyond plaintiffs\u2019 claim in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-3\">\u201c Of the falsity of said representation made as aforesaid by said Heyer, defendant had no knowledge whatever, until some time after the last of said contracts was made and after the one hundred gross were delivered, when defendant at once elected to rescind the same and so notified plaintiffs. All of which facts deponent avers are true and she expects to be able to prove them on the trial of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-4\">\u201c And deponent further says she is advised by counsel and suggests to the court that plaintiffs\u2019 statement is insufficient in law upon which to found a judgment for want of an affidavit or a sufficient affidavit of defence, and also that plaintiffs have not in and by said statement shown that they at any time made any endeavor to supply themselves with said powder to replace that which defendant refused to deliver, or that if they had it would have cost them the price alleged to be the market price in said statement, or that they have not purchased the same at a much less price or' that they have suffered anything more than nominal damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-7\"><em>Alex.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">It is not worth while to enter into the elaborate discussions in the cases about the right of a vendor to praise his wares, and the insufficiency of general affirmations of value, and false representations, which the other party should have known better than to rely upon, to justify a rescission. In Graffenstein v. Epstein, 23 Kans. 443, it was held that a false and fraudulent representation as to the market price of a commodity made by a purchaser who knew the price, to a seller who did not, would not avoid the contract. The opinion of Bbeweb, J., contains as strong a presentation of that view as we have found anywhere, but even it puts the case on the absence of any confidential relation between the parties, or peculiar means of knowledge on the part of the purchaser, as the article, wool, was one of general commerce, whose market price was matter of public knowledge and could be ascertained by any one by reasonable effort and inquiry. We may concede all this, though no Pennsylvania case has been cited which goes so far, but what the defendant here sets up in her affidavit is not a mere opinion or even a false representation as to value, or market price, or other matter of general knowledge which the vendor was bound to know or to inquire about, but an explicit, circumstantial misstatement of a fact conducing and intended to influence the vendor\u2019s action, and whose falsehood she could not reasonably detect. A very slight knowledge of the competition of business will suffice to show that one dealer may be willing to sell under the market price to gain a new customer, and the inducement to the other to do likewise to retain a customer in danger of going over to his rival. An explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>positive false statement by the purchaser of such fact, under such circumstances is a fraud which will justify a rescission of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The other matters of defence as to breaches of agreement not to cut prices etc. are not averred explicitly enough to be available in the affidavit. Whether they were conditions or inducements of the sale, or mere promises as to future action does not clearly appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The objections to the plaintiff\u2019s statement cannot be sustained. That it sets out the cause of action more formally and elaborately than is absolutely necessary under the act of 1887, and in so doing uses some of the language of the time honored forms of declaration is not a defect. The main requirement of the statement under that act is to secure to the defendant clear and exact information as to what is claimed of him. A common count in the old form, without a bill of particulars, would be demurrable for vagueness, but using the general form with the insertion of the exact dates, amounts and particulars of the contract sued on but with no irrelevant or impertinent matter, could hardly be objectionable for furnishing too much information instead of too little.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
