Plaintiffs aver that defendants accepted the said oil and used it, but have, nevertheless, since such acceptance and user, brought a suit against the plaintiffs here\u00cd2i whicli is now pending in this court to March Term, 1894, No. 832, wherein they (the defendants herein) seek to recover from the plaintiffs herein damages for an alleged injury to them (the defendants herein) arising out of the alleged poor qualitjr of the said oil. The said sum of $731.38 is now due and unpaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-8\">Defendants in their affidavit of defence averred that they are engaged \u201c\u00cd21 the business of ta2iniug and dressing the skhis of goats and other animals, and for the purpose of their business use large quantities of neats\u2019 foot oil. That plaintiff, before and at the time of the purchase of the oil as set forth in the statement of claim filed, promised and warranted defendants in writing (a copy of which is hereto annexed), that said oil was and should be absolutely pure a2id free fro2n adulter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ants of all and every kind, and relying upon this promise and warranty, defendants purchased said oil. That said oil was not pure and free from adulterants, but, on the contrary, was impure and adulterated. That said impurities and adulterations were not known to defendants, and could not have been known to them,, until after the said oil was used upon the skins to be dressed. That twenty-nine hundred and forty-six (2946) dozen of goat skins were thus tanned with the said oil so purchased from, and for which suit is brought by, plaintiff. That in endeavoring to overcome the defects in certain of the skins caused by the impurities in said oil so purchased from the said plaintiff by defendants, the defendants actually paid out in cash, for extracting grease, the sum of $336.64; for scrubbing the said skins with benzine, $164.50 ; for reglazing said skins, the sum of $33.25, and for recoloring said skins the sum of $449.75, or a total of cash paid out of $786.39, by reason of said impurities and adulterations in the oil so purchased*from plaintiff, and that these prices were the cheapest and lowest at which the same could be done. ' That, in addition thereto, the skins upon which said oil purchased from plaintiff was used were so much damaged by impurities that twelve hundred and ninety-three dozen of said skins are worth $2.00 less per dozen, or $2,585, than they would have been if the oil had been pure, and sixteen hundred and fifty-three dozen (1653) of said skins are worth $1.00 less per dozen, or $1,653, than they would have been if the said oil had been pure, as promised and represented. That previous to the bringing of said suit the defendants had brought suit in Court of Common Pleas, No. 4 of March Term, 1894, No. 832, to recover damages for the losses sustained by them as aforesaid, and said suit is pending and undetermined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">The following letters were annexed to the affidavit of defeDCe \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHQ\">\u201c BAUGH &amp; SONS COMPANY.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">\u201cManufacturers and importers.

Here defendants brought the suit first. If there be two suits pending, it is through no fault of defendants. Whatever force there may be in the decision of Railroad v. Davenport, it applies to the plaintiff and not to defendants. Plaintiff falls directly within its ruling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-6\">Where goods are bought for a special purpose, and are expressly warranted to be such as are suitable for the purpose, a breach of the warranty is a good defence to an action for the price: Badger v.

There is no averment of equality, and the statement that the oil \u201c will stand a cold test of twenty degrees \u201d is not denied in the affidavit of defence. There is no averment that the oil was sold for a particular purpose, or that plaintiff knew for what purpose the oil was to be used: Port Carbon Iron Co. v. Grove, 68 Pa. 149; Connett v. Brooks, 11 W. N. C. 283; Roebling v. Brown, 9 W. N. C. 170; Shisler v. Baxter, 109 Pa. 443; Macbeth v. Lee &amp; Co., 5 Pa. C. C, 225; Whitaker v.

Davenport, 154 Pa. 111.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ART\">March 11, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AVI\">Mb. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is upon an ordinary book account for the sale of a quantity of 20 degrees Neats\u2019 Foot Oil. The affidavit of defence alleges that the oil was warranted to be pure and free from adulterants, and then asserts that the oil sold was not free from adulterants but on the contrary was impure and adulterated, and that the defendants had sustained heavy losses in consequence of the defects of the oil. The learned court below, it is alleged by the appellants, gave judgment for the plaintiffs because there was no warranty disclosed by the affidavit of defence. It is true that the letter of plaintiffs dated Dec. 30,1892, and which contains a copy of the warranty, does not describe a warranty in the same terms as the affidavit of defence alleges, but it does contain an acknowledgment of the receipt of a postal card from the defendants dated Dec. 29th, and a reference of the postal to the plaintiffs\u2019 superintendent who reported that, \u201cThe Neats\u2019 Foot Oil is guaranteed and all made exactly the same way; no change in the way of chilling, pressing or bleaching for years.\u201d The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ants\u2019 postal of Dec. 29th, is not now in the ease, and without it the full interpretation of the meaning of the plaintiffs\u2019 letter is not certain. We cannot know at present what the contents of the defendants\u2019 letter were, and we think it is premature to declare judicially the meaning of the plaintiffs\u2019 letter until the contents of the defendants\u2019 postal are seen as they doubtless will be on the trial. We think it apparent that there, at least, might be a warranty which would sustain the defendants\u2019 contention. The plaintiffs\u2019 letter of Dec. 30, certainly does contain an admission that there was a \u2018guarantee \u2019 which may be a warranty, and that all the Neats\u2019 Foot Oil sold to the defendants was made in \u201c exactly the same way, no change in the way of chilling, pressing, or bleaching for years.\u201d Just what this means may depend upon explanatory parol testimony as to the previous dealings of the parties. We think there is sufficient matter in the affidavit of defence to carry the case to the jury. We do not think the case of Pa. R. R. Co. v. Davenport, 154 Pa. 111, rules this case. The question raised there was in different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
