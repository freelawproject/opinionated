Plaintiff assigned one half of his interest in the patent to defendant. He alleged that the consideration for the transfer was a promise on part of defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ant to divide with him all profits made by the sale of the device, and also all damages which might be recovered from people who infringed the patent. On Nov. 18, 1892, plaintiff and defendant applied for a re-issue of the patent. The application was rejected Dec. 12,1892, on the ground of unreasonable delay, and also upon the further ground that the new claims asked for had been substantially anticipated by other patents. Defendant claimed that the article which was manufactured was different in its parts and in its arrangements from the article covered by the patent, and that it was a distinct and independent invention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were among others as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">\u201c 2.

The action of the patent office in refusing to re-issue the patent in suit, did not affect its validity, and the contract between the plaintiff and defendant in reference thereto was not rendered invalid by such action.\u201d Affirmed.

If after the alleged making by the defendant of a promise to account to the plaintiff for past profits on the patented machines previously manufactured by the defendant, the parties joined in a surrender of the patent and an application for a reissue thereof, such act amounts in law to an extinguishment of the patent and to a legal cancellation of any claim based thereon for profits on the patented machines made prior to that date.\u201d <em>Ansioer: </em>Refused.

The joint act of the parties in surrendering the patent in question, and applying for a re-issue thereof, on Nov. 18, 1892, amounted to a cancellation of the patent, and being followed by a refusal on the part of Ihe government to grant the re-issue, operated to end and determine the contract sued upon as to any of the patented machines made after such surrender.\u201d Refused.

The only subjects of complaint are the affirmance of plaintiff\u2019s second and fourth points, for charge, recited in the first two specifications, and the refusal of the court to affirm defendant\u2019s fifth and sixth points recited in the two remaining specifications. There is nothing in the record that would justify us in' sustaining either of the specifications of error. The points recited therein were each correctly answered. As embodied in his sixth point, the contention of defendant, that \u201c the joint action of the parties in surrendering the patent in question and applying for a re-issue thereof .... amounted to a cancellation of the patent,\u201d etc., is untenable. Section 4916 of the Revised Code provides that \u201csuch surrender shall take effect upon the issue of the amended patent.\u201d The alleged surrender therefore never became effective, because the re-issue which the parties applied for was refused. The case appears to have been carefully and correctly tried, and we think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
