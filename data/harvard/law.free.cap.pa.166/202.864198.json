Before Gordon, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-13\">At the trial it appeared that plaintiff was a mechanical engineer, and was originally employed by defendants under a contract which had expired in December, 1891. Defendant\u2019s firm consisted of three partners, one of whom, George L. Harrison, was in Europe. Plaintiff had written to the absent partner in reference to his further connection with the firm, but had received no definite reply. On March 15, 1892, plaintiff notified the two resident partners that he had an offer of a salary of $5,000 a year from other parties. Plaintiff testified m effect that the two resident partners requested him not to leave them, and offered him, if he would remain, a new contract for ten years at a salary of $5,000 a year, or in the alternative at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>$4,000 a year with an increase of $250 per annum until $6,000 a year was reached. Plaintiff insisted that the new contract should only be terminable upon a year\u2019s prior notice being given. He averred that the two partners agreed to this, and a verbal contract was entered into by which plaintiff was to receive $4,000 the first year, with an increase of $250 until $6,000 was reached, the contract not to be terminated by either party without twelve months\u2019 prior notice thereof being given. Defendants admitted that an agreement had been made that plaintiff should receive a salary at the rate of $4,000 per year until Greoi\u2019ge L. Harrison should return, but denied that any further contract was made, and denied that any terms were made as to dismissal, or that one year\u2019s notice, or one year\u2019s wages was agreed upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-3\">Defendants offered evidence which tended to show that plaintiff used violent, profane and abusive language towards George L. Harrison when he was criticised for permitting an engine to be out of order in one of the buildings. Plaintiff denied that he used the language attributed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\">Plaintiff was discharged May 11, 1898. The writ issued July 1, 1893. The trial occurred on Jan. 24, 1894.

The case appears to have been carefully tried and submitted to the jury with instructions which, with the exception of said points, were satisfactory to both parties. We find nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining either of the specifications. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
