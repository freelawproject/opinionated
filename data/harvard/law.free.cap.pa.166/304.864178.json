Mr. Freedley offered in evidence the partition of the estate of George Pepper, deceased, made by deed dated January 13,1847, recorded at Philadelphia, in Deed Book A. W. M., No. 29, page 4; deed being made by Coleman Fisher; George N. Baker, John M. Ogden, D. Henry Flickwin, and Andrew D. Cook, being the five persons appointed in pursuance of the will of George Pepper, to make partition and division of his estate; on page 29 of which deed, and subsequent pages, a particular share of the estate is set apart and allotted to Charles Pepper, under the limitations contained in the will of George Pepper, concerning that particular share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">\u2022'' \u201c3. Charles Rockland Pepper was the only child of Charles Pepper living at his death, which occurred May 3d, 1887. The son Charles Rockland Pepper died without issue March 7, 1890. By deed of trust, executed July 2, 1868, recorded in Deed Book J. T. 0., No. 238, page 436, etc., Charles Rockland Pepper provided that one-half of the estate, real and personal, to which he would or might become entitled in case he survived his father, Charles Pepper, under the provisions of the will of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>his grandfather, George Pepper, should, in the event of his, the said Charles Rockland Pepper, dying without lawful issue surviving him, be held \u2018in trust to giant, convey, assign, and pay the said trust estate and premises unto such person or persons as would have been entitled to the same under the will of the said George Pepper, deceased, and for such estates and interests, and with and under the same powers, conditions, and limitations as far as subsisting and applicable, and with the same effect as if the said Charles Rockland Pepper had never been born.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">\u201c 4. The question submitted to the auditor by the learned counsel (Mr. George Wharton Pepper and Mr. Freedley on the one side, and Messrs. Biddle &amp; Ward on the other) is whether the trust estate of Charles Rockland Pepper should be distributed under the general clause of George Pepper\u2019s will or the particular clause of that will which relates to the trust estate of Charles Pepper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">\u201c 5. To support the affirmative of the last branch of the inquiry, it is cogently said that the will of George Pepper explicitly provides how the trust estate of Charles Pepper shall go in case he dies without issue, namely, to the use of his (George Pepper\u2019s) surviving children, and the issue of any of his children then deceased, \u2018 in the shares and proportions, and for the estates which they would have taken under the intestate law of Pennsylvania,\u2019 if the said Charles Pepper had died seized in fee simple of such estate without any wife surviving him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">\u201c 6. Who then would have been entitled to this share, to wit, the trust estate of Charles Pepper, if Charles Rockland Pepper had never been born ? The answer is, that if Charles Rockland Pepper had never been born, then his father, Charles Pepper, would have died without issue, and thereupon become the propositus, from whom the line of descent is to be traced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-8\">\u201c 7. The auditor agrees with this contention, which he thinks it is needless to elaborate, and holds that the estate before him for distribution descends to and becomes divisible in eighths or multiples thereof among the surviving brothers and sisters of Chas. Pepper, and the issue of deceased brothers and sisters.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-9\">The estate covered by the deed of trust of July 2, 1868, is described in the deed as follows : \u201c One full equal and undivided moiety or half part of, in and to all and singular the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>real and personal whatsoever and wheresoever to which he the said Charles Rockland Pepper now is or may at any time hereafter be entitled in possession, reversion or remainder expectancy or otherwise howsoever, under and by virtue of the above recited last will and testament of his grandfather, the said George Pepper, deceased, as of any appointment made or to be made by his said father Charles Pepper or otherwise howsoever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">The nature of the trust was specified as follows : \u201c In trust to let and demise the real estate and to collect and receive the rents and income thereof and to place out and continue the personal estate at interest and collect and receive the interest, income and dividends thereof and after first deducting all taxes, charges, repairs and expenses of every kind and nature whatever attending the management of the trust estate and the discharge of the trust, to pay over the residue and remainder of the said rents, interest, income and dividends in quarter yearly payments unto such person or persons as the said Charles Rock-land Pepper, from time to time but not by way of assignment or anticipation, nominate and appoint in writing to receive the same or in default of such nomination unto the said Charles Rockland Pepper for his own use and behoof and so as not to be liable for his debts, contracts or engagements in anywise whatsoever for and during the full end and term of his natural life and from and immediately after the decease of the said Charles Rockland Pepper, then in trust to grant, convey, assign and pay the trust estate and premises unto all the children of the said Charles Rockland Pepper that may then be living and the lawful issue of such of them as may then be deceased in such parts, shares and proportions and for such interests therein as he the said Charles Rockland Pepper may by any instrument or writing in the nature of a last will and testament direct, limit and appoint, and for want of such appointment, then in trust to grant, convey, assign and pajr the said trust estate and premises unto all his children who may then be living and the lawful issue of such of them as may then be deceased, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever in equal parts and shares so nevertheless that such issue take only and among themselves equally divide such part and share as his, her or their deceased parent would have had and taken if then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>living, and in default of lawful issue him' surviving then in trust \u25a0to grant, convey, assign and pay the said trust estate and premises unto such person or persons as would have been entitled to the same under the will of the said George Pepper, deceased, and for such estates and interests and with and under the same powers, conditions and limitations as far as subsisting and applicable and with the same effect as if 'the said Charles Rock-land Pepper had never been bom.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">The material portions of the will of Edward Pepper deceased, a son of Geo.

Edward Pepper, a son of Edward Pepper, deceased, excepted: '\u201c 1.
