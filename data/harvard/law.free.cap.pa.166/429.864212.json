When judgment was entered the defendant owned an adjoining tract of land upon which this judgment also became a lien. On December 16,1893, execution was issued with this direction indorsed thereon:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-10\">\u201cP. S. The within judgment is for purchase money for house and lot, situate in Weisenburg township, Lehigh county, bounded on lands of Jonas Snyder, Daniel Rupp and other lands of Hannah Schmick, containing about half of an acre. Condemnation waived.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-11\">On December 26,1893, the defendant after the property had been advertised, claimed the benefit of the exemption law out of the real estate levied upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-12\">The sheriff on January 5, 1894, appointed three appraisers who reported in writing: \u201cWe went upon the real estate of said Hannah Schmick, the defendant, in the above execution, levied on under the same, having found that the same is of greater value than three hundred dollars, do determine that in our opinion said real estate cannot be divided without prejudice to or spoiling the whole.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-13\">The court dismissed exceptions to the appraisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to the appraisement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-4\"><em>John Rupp, Evan Holben </em>with him, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKt\">cited: Com. v.

The sale was not delayed, nor were costs incurred that might have been avoided bj^ an earlier presentation of the claim. There was therefore no error in dismissing the exceptions and discharging the rule to set aside the appraisement. The questions presented by plaintiff\u2019s exceptions have been sufficiently considered and properly disposed of in the opinion of the court below. For reasons there given the decree should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
