The claim whs made under the act of June 24, 1885, which allowed tweutjr cents for each certificate added to the records. The court held that the act of June 24, 1885, was unconstitutional, on the ground that its subject was not sufficiently expressed in its title, citing Pierie v. Philadelphia, 139 Pa. 573. A non-suit was accordingly entered, which the court in the opinion of Albright, P. J., subsequently refused to take off. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order. v</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-11\"><em>John </em>Rupp, for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAS\">cited: Act of June 24, 1885, P.

The court can only declare an act void, when it violates the constitution clearly, palpably, plainly, and in such manner as to leave no doubt or hesitation in the mind of the judge: Com. v.
