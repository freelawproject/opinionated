G. Hobson, Esq., as master, who reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">\u201c The Pennsylvania Schuylkill Yalley Railroad Company, a corporation organized under 'the general railroad laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has built and are now operating a line of railroad reaching from a point of connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad near 52d street, in the city of Philadelphia, to New Boston, a point west of Pottsville in Schuylkill county, a distance of over 105 miles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">\u201cAt a meeting of the directors of the said Schuylkill Yalley Railroad Company held September 5, 1889, the following resolutions were adopted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-10\">\u201c Whereas, the Philadelphia, Norristown, and Phcenixviile Railroad Company, the corporate property, franchises and rights of which by virtue of consolidation and merger \"became vested in this company, did December, 1883, cause to be located a branch railroad from its main line of railroad at a point near West Manayunk, inu the township of Lower Merion, Montgomery county, extending northwardly a short distance and thence across the line of the railroad of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company and thence southwardly between the said railroad of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company and the Schuylkill river to the Pencoyd Iron Works, a distance about one and one quarter miles, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>did at that time cause the said route to be located, marked upon the ground, and a plan thereof made, which is on file in the office of this compairy, and did then acquire a portion of the property necessary for the construction of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">\u201c And whereas, the minutes of the company do not exhibit any formal action by the board of directors in reference to the said subject, therefore, that the said action may be formally evinced,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">\u201c Resolved, that the aforesaid action of this company be now formally approved and ratified, with the same effect as though formal action had been taken at the time of said location, and the secretary is directed to certify the said plan accordingly, and the president of the company is authorized to proceed in the construction of said branch railroad at and upon the line so surveyed and marked as aforesaid, with such minor changes as in his judgment may tend to economical construction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">\u201c Subsequently, on November 11th of the same year the following action was taken:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">\u201cResolved, that inasmuch as the present construction of the branch from the main line of the railroad of this company near West Manayunk to Pencoyd, in the county of Montgomery, authorized by a previous resolution, is necessary to increase the business of this company and accommodate the trade and travel of the public, the president is directed to proceed with the construction thereof upon the line of amended survey crossing the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad overhead instead of under grade, as was provided in the former location, and that the action heretofore taken by him on said amended survey is ratified and approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">\u201c Under this authority the company proceeded to locate and build the branch road specified in the foregoing resolution. In its course it passes through the barn and lot of the plaintiff, Sebastian A. Rudolph.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-9\">\u201cMr. Rudolph is the owner and occ\u00fcpier of a dwelling house in Lower Merion township, this county, fronting on the river road. The lot on which this dwelling house is built contains in front-feet, and extends in depth-feet. Fronting on a public road stands his dwelling house and his office at the distance of-feet from said road. There is a private lane running along almost the whole width of his lot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>In the rear of this lane-and fronting thereon stands a- row of eight tenement houses in the occupancy of various tenants. In a line with these tenement houses and in rear of a continuation of said lane stood the barn of plaintiff. The nearest wall of this barn was 128 feet distant from the nearest point of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-3\">\u201cThe line of this branch road passes through the corner of plaintiff\u2019s lot and completely demolishes this.barn. The railroad here is an elevated structure crossing over the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad which adjoins this property on the west by an overhead bridge. The pier of this bridge comes in the place where the stable formerly stood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\">\u201cThe nearest point the railroad comes to the dwelling house is 128 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff on May 31, 1890, filed his bill in equity, praying for an injunction restraining the said -Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company, its officers, agents, and employees from taking or occupying any portion of his dwelling house and necessary curtilage thereof for the purpose of its railroad or for any other purposes without his consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">\u201c A preliminary injunction was refused by the court. The railroad company proceeded to lay out this road and has actually built .the same and is now operating the road over the line as laid out. The bill was proceeded with and a master appointed who has taken the testimony which is herewith returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">\u201c The bill and answer raised three distinct questions. It was contended by the plaintiff:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">\u201c First. That the said Schuylkill Valley Railroad. Company and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as lessee have no right to construct and operate the said branch road, because the same is to be constructed and operated purely as a private road for the traffic and trade of the Pencoyd Iron Works.and not for public trade and travel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">\u201c Second. That this branch road was previously located over another route and that the defendant company, on February 3, 1890, filed in the Court .of Common Pleas of Montgomery county, No. 112, March Term, 1890, a petition and bond showing an actual location of their proposed branch over said other route, and gave bonds in the sum of $20,000 which was approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>by said court, and that said location is final; and the defendants have no right to change to a new location.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-4\">\u201c Third. That the route now occupied being- a portion of plaintiff\u2019s barn and a necessary part of the curtilage of his dwelling house, cannot be so occupied because of the prohibition contained in the act of February 19,1819, P. L. 83, which prohibits a railroad from \u2018passing through any burying ground or place of public worship, or any dwelling house in the occupancy of the owner or owners thereof without his or their consent.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">We will consider these objections in their order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-6\">\u201c The first objection denies the right of the defendant company to build the road in question because it is not within the purview of the act of 1868, known as the \u2018 General Railroad Laws.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\">\u201c The ninth section of that act provides \u2018 that any company incorporated under this act shall have authority to construct such branches from its main line as it may deem necessary to increase its business and accommodate the trade and travel of the public.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-8\">\u201c It cannot, of course, be denied that this railroad company has the right to build a branch when it is for the purpose of increasing its business and accommodating the trade and travel of the public. This is the expressed language'of the-act, and the question has been passed upon in many instances by the court, as in Western Pennsylvania Railroad Company\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 155; McAboy\u2019s Appeal, 107 Pa. 548.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-9\">\u201c In' the last named case the Supreme Court gives a very comprehensive definition of a branch road. It says, \u2018 The definition of a branch railroad under the act of 1868, does not depend upon either its length or its direction. A -branch of a railroad is a section of railroad which may be an offshoot from the main road or a shoot from either of its termini. The \u2019necessity for such branches and their direction rest in the will and discretion of the president and directors of the corporation by which they are to be constructed.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-10\">\u201c Plaintiff, however, contends that this branch is not intended for trade and travel of the public, but that it is intended solely for the accommodation of the private industrial firm of A. &amp; P. Roberts, who \u00e1re the owners and operators of an extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>industrial establishment known as the Peneoyd Iron Works; and they further contend that since the railroad has been built it has been used solely to convey freights to and from the above named works and has run no passenger trains whatever; nor lias it delivered freight to any other persons than the aforesaid firm. It is true that this road runs to and connects with the tracks and switches of the Peneoyd Iron Works; that no station-house is erected for the reception or unloading of freights; that no passenger coach has run over the road so far as shown by the evidence; but it is also true that'the resolution above named duder the authority of which this road was constructed recites that the building of this road is necessary \u2018 to increase the business of the company and to accommodate the trade and travel of the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-3\">\u201cPeneoyd is a village with a large number of houses and many people living in the immediate vicinity of this road. A siding runs along the public road from which ears can easily be loaded and unloaded. The village and the public are well accommodated with railroad facilities, far better than can be afforded by this branch road, and, no doubt, the other roads are better located to catch the general business of the community. But 1 can hardly conceive that, simply because of the greater convenience of another railroad, and the fact that the volume of general business that would come to a new enterprise would be small, should make it unlawful for a new railroad to enter the territory of a rival. Every reason shows that this company would be very glad to get all the trade that is offered, and no testimony has been submitted to show that any business has been refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-4\">\u201c The act of assembly of June 19,1871, provides \u2018 that where it is alleged that the private rights of individuals or the rights or franchises of other corporations are injured or invaded by any corporation claiming to have a right or franchise to do an act from which such injury results, it shall be the di^ of the court to ascertain whether the corporation does, in fact, possess the right or franchise from which the alleged injury results, and, if such rights or franchises have not been conferred upon such corporations, then to afford relief.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">\u201c This act the plaintiff invokes and asks the master to declare that this railroad has not the right to construct this branch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>road and take the private property of the defendant for the reason aboye stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-4\">\u201c He cites the familiar case of Edgewood Company\u2019s Appeal, 79 Pa. 257, where the court declared that the road there proposed to be built was not to accommodate the trade and travel of the public, but was a mere attempt by a coal company to connect their line with a railroad company without complying with the provisions of the lateral railroad statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">\u201cIn that case the incorporators and officers of the railroad company were also the owners of the mine, and the road ended in a gully in which was the opening of the mine. A part of the road was built over the land of the mine company, and their grant to the railroad contained the expressed reservation \u2018 for the right of way for their coal \u00edailroad and for no other purposes whatever except such other purposes as are necessary for the ordinary workings of coal works.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">\u201cNone of these special features exist in the case at bar. It is not A. &amp; P. Roberts attempting to evade the provisions of the law of lateral railroads; it is the effort of the railroad company reaching out to tap a rich field of freights and business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">\u201c When this branch road was building the' same question came before the court of common pleas of Montgomery county on a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the preliminary injunction was refused, and the reasons for the same are given in an able opinion by his honor, Judge Weand, reported in Schofield et al. v. Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railro.ad Company, 8 Montgomery County L. R. 125. In that case the court expressed the opinion that the company had the right to build this very road in question. The same question was raised and decided in Dobson v. Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company, 6 Montgomery County L. R. 109. The light derived from a full hearing has in no wise changed the facts nor the law as then known to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">\u201c It is, however, further contended that since those opinions were read on motions for preliminary injunction, the method of defendant company in operating this road has developed itself, and now shows that it is not operated to \u201caccommodate the trade and travel of the public; \u201d that no passenger car has been run over the road since it has been in operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\">\u201c This we. think is an objection that will not avail, even if true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201c The act of 1871 above quoted expressly says, \u2018 If such rights or franchises have not been conferred upon such corporation, then to afford relief.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-3\">\u201c The only question for the court to consider is, have the rights and franchises been conferred; not, are the duties and responsibilities incumbent upon the corporation fulfilled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-4\">\u201cJudge Allison, in Lejee v. Continental Passenger ft. ft. Company, 10 Philadelphia R. 362, says on this very subject after quoting the act as above quoted, \u2018 The inquiry which the court is here required to institute is, whether the right or franchise claimed by the corporation charged with a usurpation of power has been conferred Or granted to such corporation; whether, by virtue of such grant, it can lawfully do the act which it is alleged inflicts injuiy upon the private rights of individuals.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">\u201cIf the corporation is not fulfilling its duties and responsibilities to the public, this wrong can be righted in another way, but \u2018if the charter gives the right a court of equity cannot declare that a corporation has forfeited its franchises, on an injunction bill by a private plaintiff:\u2019 Western Pennsylvania R. R. Company\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 399.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-6\">\u201c \u2018 Whether a corporation has failed to perform the conditions of its existence is a question between the state and corporation, which cannot be raised or litigated in an action between the corporation and private parties: \u2019 Greenbrier Lumber Co. v. Ward, 3 S. E. 227, cited in American Digest for 1887, page 224.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">\u201cWe therefore conclude on these points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\">\u201c First. That the defendant company has the undoubted right to build this branch road \u2018 to increase the business of the company and accommodate the trade and travel of the public.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-9\">\u201cSecond. That nothing has been shown to make us doubt the integrity of the action taken, so as to justify us in saying that this was an attempt to connect an individual siding with tire railroad without complying with the pi'ovisions of the lateral railroad statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-10\">\u201c Third. That the court in this proceeding cannot inquire into the method of conducting the business of this corporation, and from this draw a conclusion that no right to construct the branch existed in the first instance. Testimony was also submitted to prove that this branch road, or a part'of it, was act<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ually built by the employees of tbe Pencoyd Iron Company. On the other hand, the engineer of the railroad company swore that this was a mistake and that no part of this branch road was built by-the Pencoyd Iron Company, nor paid for by it, and that the other witness was in error and had mistaken certain sidings for the road itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-4\">\u201c The master is of the opinion that this latter testimony was the correct statement of the facts of the case and that there was therefore no attempt by the Pencoyd Iron Company to evade the statutes relating to the lateral railroads.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">\u201cSecondly. The plaintiff contends that this branch road was previously located over another route and that the defendant company on February 3,1890, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery county,- No. 12, March Term, 1890, a petition and bond showing an actual location of their proposed branch over said other route, and gave bonds in the sum of $20,000, which was approved by said court, and that said location is final; and that defendants have no right to change to a new location.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">\u25a0 \u201c Whatever other location was attempted, was attempted on other property than that mentioned in the bill, and the master is of opinion that even if another location was made, this plaintiff cannot take advantage of that fact. There was but one location upon the property of the plaintiff, that is the location upon which the railroad was built. The question was virtually-decided by this court when the case was before it on motion for a preliminary injunction, and the court there refused the motion and we see nothing now before the master which could or should change the decision that was there arrived at by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">\u201c The third contention arises over the meaning of the word \u2018dwelling house \u2019 .used in the act of February 19, 1849, section 10. This section reads as follows : \u2018 Not, however, passing through any burying-ground or place of public worship, or any dwelling house in the occupancy of the owner or owners thereof without his, her, or their consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff would include in the word \u2018dwelling house \u2019 not only the actual house itself but also such curtilage as is necessary for its reasonable enjoyment,-and in the case at bar he maintains that the barn here destroyed was a part of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>curtilage and necessary for the- reasonable enjoyment of the dwelling house by its owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-3\">\u201c In support of this position, plaintiff cites a number of cases in which the word \u2018 house \u2019 has been held to include the curtilage necessary for its reasonable enjoyment. These cases arise in devises of a house as in Bennetv. Bittle etal., 4 Rawle, 339, and in construction of the same word as used in the mechanic\u2019s lien acts as in Pennock v. Hoover et al., 5 Rawle, 314.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\">\u201c I hardly think the above cases are in point. Whilst the curtilage is included in the word \u2018house\u2019 so as to make a reasonable interpretation, yet it has also been recently held by the Supreme Court in Bevan &amp; Bro. v. Thackara et al., 7 Montgomery County L. R. 177, \u2018 That a lien filed against a dwelling house, describing it, will not give the plaintiff the right to include material furnished to a stable, although a sale on the-lien would carry the lot and all the improvements including the stable.\u2019 Judge Boyek, in Clegg v. Pennsylvania Schuykill Valley R. R. Company, did not think these cases had any application to the point at issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">\u201c In two important railroad cases in England, the word \u2018 house \u2019 in an act of parliament very similar to our act of assembly, has been held to include what is necessary for the convenient occupation of the house: See Steele v. Midland R. R. Company, 1 Chancery Appeal Cases, Law Reports, 285; Grosvenor v. Hampstead Junction R. R. Company, 58 English Chancery R., star page 445.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">\u201c These English cases have never been followed in this country, nor have they been cited with approval in any case that has been called to the master\u2019s attention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">\u201c In Moses Wells v. Somerset &amp; Kennebec R. R. Company, American Law Register, vol. 2, 659, a ease decided by the Supreme Court of Maine, the Maine statutes read, \u2018No corporation shall take any meeting house, dwelling house, or public or private burying-ground without the consent of the owner thereof.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">\u201c The court there held \u2018 that the term \u201c dwelling house \u2019\u2019means only the house itself and includes no-part of the garden, orchard, or curtilage.\u2019 This act of assembly has been -before the Supreme Court of our own state three times. No definite rule has been laid by that tribunal by which to judge wliat is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>included in the word \u2018 house \u2019 arid the curtilage appurtenant' thereto. The first case is Swift and Givin\u2019s Appeal, 111 P\u00e1. 516, where the court decided that they must so construe a statute as to give a reasonable effect to its purposes and intent, and said \u2018 This necessarily includes some curtilage connected therewith.\u2019 The exact extent of that curtilage cannot be defined by any arbitrary rule as to distance. As each case arises the right' of the owner and occupier of the dwelling house, against hostile location of a railroad, must be determined byr a consideration of what is necessary for a reasonable and proper enjoyment of a\"house as a residence in view of its location and surroundings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-4\">\u201c Decided by this rule the land taken in that case which was a corner in the rear of the lot and-distant 155 feet from the nearest portion of the house was hot considered as included in the mansi\u00f3n house and necessary curtilage. This case was followed by Damon\u2019s Appeal, 119 Pa. 287. In that case the land taken by the railroad company was more than 100 feet distant from and not within the same inclosure with the dwelling, and the court held that this land was not included within the prohibitive words of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">\u201cIn delivering those opinions Judge Green saj\u2019s, \u2018It may be gravely questioned whether it is within the lawful power of the judiciary department of the government to depart from the plain letter of a statute which is free from ambiguity. As a general rule of course it cannot be, and is not done,\u2019 and in speaking of the former case of Swift and Givin\u2019s Appeal, said that the language of that case was somewhat indefinite, but said that the court certainty did mean to limit \u2018the curtilage to be exempted to that portion of it which was necessary to the enjoyment of the house, not to that which was desirable oi' convenient, or which depended alone upozi the will of the owzzer.\u2019 The taking of outbuildings has never in this commonwealth, \u00a1it least,- been held a violation of prohibitive words of the act of 1849, and we do not mean to intimate that it would or should be so held.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">\u201c The third case, Lyle v. R. R. Co., 131 Pa. 437, was decided in 1890. In this case the owners had a lot 44 feet wide fronting on a street and extending 96 feet-to an alley sixteen feet wide. Upon this lot there was a dwelling house twelve \u25a0 feet' back from Ruth -street 'and three fe\u00e9t froto an easterly line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the lot. Back of the dwelling house are several small outbuildings, to wit, a coal-house, cow-stable, chicken-house, etc. The railroad company has appropriated a strip of land 16 feet wide and 40 feet long adjoining the alley, moved the outbuildings in upon the lot, and given bond for the damages caused thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-3\">\u201c Even in a case as strong as this the Supreme Court refused to declare that the land taken was included within the prohibitive words of the statutes. The court say, \u2018 The law regards that which is essential to the enjoyment of a dwelling house, and not that which is merely ornamental and pleasant in its surroundings. The location of a railroad across a lot in which the owner has his dwelling house, or 'upon grounds which constitute part of a valuable country seat, is not in violation of the statute.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">\u201c Taking the three cases just'quoted as showing the spirit in which the court has met this question, we cannot come to any other conclusion than that the barn here taken and the land do not constitute any part of the dwelling house or curtilage which would be exempt under this statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">\u201cIt cannot include an unlimited quantity of land just because the owner of the house for his aesthetic taste or desire for wide spreading acres included a large tract within his inclosure. Here this barn and land taken was included in a small corner of an extensive lawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">\u201c Should the private lane before spoken of be extended to the west line of plaintiff\u2019s property, the barn and land taken would all fall considerably beyond this line. There still remains a lot, in front containing some 800 feet, and in depth some 200 feet. This will give ample room' for stable and carriage house. In fact, the plaintiff has, since the building of this road, erected a stable and carriage house upon this inclosure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">\u201c The master is of opinion that while this will greatly inconvenience plaintiff, and has materially lessened the market value of his elegant home, yet the land taken is not necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of his home,\u2014that his stable must be erected where it formerly stood. For his damage and inconvenience, and for the reduction of the market value of his property he will be compensated in damages by a jury. His remedy for all inconveniences is adequate. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>\u201c </em>There may be and doubtless are cases where the destruction of a barn might practically destroy the dwelling house, where from the character of the curtilage no other place could be found within the inclosure to erect a new stable, but that case is not this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">\u201c We therefore conclude that in the case before us the railroad has not passed through any dwelling house in the occupancy of the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">\u201c This disposes of all the objections mentioned in the bill or raised in the argument before the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">\u201c The master therefore recommends a decree, dismissing the bill at the costs of the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">Exceptions to the master\u2019s report were dismissed by the court, Swaktz, J., filing the following opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">\u201c The report of the learned master is a complete answer to the several exceptions filed by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">\u201c The defendant company has the right to build a branch road to increase its business and accommodate the trade and travel of the public. The necessity for the branch road in question is a matter resting in the judgment and discretion of the president and directors of the defendant company. If the branch road fails to make provision for public travel the act of June 19, 1871, gives us, as a court of equit}', no authority for interference. The right to establish a forfeiture for such reason rests wholly with the state. This question was before us in several forms and we refer to Penna. R. R. v. Montgomery County Passenger Railway, 3 Dist. R. 58, and Township of Plymouth v. Chestnut Hill Railway, 4 Dist. Reps. 8, wherein we gave our reasons for a refusal to interfere with the railroad constructions by the corporations. Such interference is in effect a finding that the rights of th\u00e9 corporations are forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-10\">\u201c Plaintiff contends that the railroad construction is .not made in good faith for the purposes of trade and travel. The master finds no evidence to support this contention. It nowhere appears that the company refused to meet a present demand for travel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\">\u201c Upon the question of a prior location, even if the plaintiff may take advantage of it in this proceeding, it does not follow that his bill must prevail. An abandonment of the original location and the adoption of a new route may become neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>sary in order that the road may be built. It is true a location once made cannot be changed to escape the payment of unsatisfactory damages. Upon this point we cite our opinion found in Hagner v. Penna. R. R., 154 Pa. 477, where the question of a second location as to the branch road now in question was fully considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-3\">\u201cWe deem it unnecessary to add anything to the master\u2019s report upon the question of the alleged interference with the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-4\">\u201c And now, October 1, 1894, the exceptions to the master\u2019s report are dismissed and the plaintiff\u2019s bill is dismissed, costs' to be paid by him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\"><em>\u00a1Error assigned </em>was, among others, (11) above decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-6\"><em>Chas.

In his s\u00e9cond conclusion,\u2014which with others was approved by the court below,\u2014the learned master says ; \u201c nothing has been shown to make us doubt the integrity of the action taken, so as to justify us in saying that this was an attempt to connect an individual siding with the railroad, without complying-with the provisions of the lateral railroad statutes.\u201d In this we think he was right. We find nothing in the case that would justify the inference of bad faith on the part of -the company, in not-carrying out its declared purpose to exercise the authority given by its charter to construct the branch line in question. If it were otherwise, the commonwealth would be the proper party to complain. -</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In view of the undisputed facts the learned master was clearly right in holding that the location and construction' of \u2018 defendants\u2019 branch road-across the southwesterly corner of plaintiff\u2019s lot- does not interfere with-'the reasonable use and enjoyment of his dwelling house,-on another part of-the lot,\u2019 at least one hundred and twenty-five feet from'said branch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>line, and therefore not in any proper sense of the words such a \u201c passing through any .... dwelling house in the occupancy of the owner,\u201d etc., as the statute was intended to prohibit. This conclusion is abundantly sustained by the authorities cited by the master in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">All the questions involved have been so fully considered and satisfactorily disposed of by the learned master and court below that further elaboration of either of them is deemed unnecessary. There was no error in dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
