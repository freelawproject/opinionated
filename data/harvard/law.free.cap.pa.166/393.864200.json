That by reason thereof this deponent was damaged in the sum of one thousand dollars from loss of rent alone, he being unable by reason of the con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>dition of said avenue as aforesaid to rent said premises, which damages he claims the right to set off in this action.\u201d -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was making rule absolute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-5\"><em>Frank P. </em>Prichard, <em>Wendell P.

If so, this obligation relieved the abutting property owner from any liability to the contractor for the paving: Phila. v. Spring Garden Market Co., 161 Pa. 522.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">The city had no authority to relieve- the company from the obligation to pave, and the ordinance of 1859 was invalid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">There is a broad distinction between this charter and a charter such as was involved in Phila. v. Evans, 139 Pa. 483, where the railway company was, by its charter, expressly made subject to all ordinances heretofore passed, or thereafter to be passed, regulating passenger railway companies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-8\">The ordinance of 1859 has no special reference to the Philadelphia &amp; Delaware River Railway Company.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-9\"><em>John M. </em>Ridings, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOW\">By ordinance, dated April 1, 1859, councils repealed so much of \u00a7 3 of the ordinance of 1857 as required railway companies to pave streets which had not theretofore^ been paved, and the real question in the present case is whether this repeal relieved the railway company from the obligation to pave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-10\">It is further submitted that the provisions of the charter under which the railway company in question was incorporated are in effect the same as in the case of Phila. v. Evans, 139 Pa. 483, cited by defendant. In that case it was stipulated in the charter that the railroad company should be subject to \u201c all ordinances which had heretofore or might thereafter be passed by councils, regulating passenger railway companies.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-11\">All the questions which have been raised in this case were decided by this court in the case of Leake et al. v.

Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">As this case raises onty a question of the sufficiency of the affidavit of defence to prevent judgment, we are of course not at liberty to regard any other'matters than such as appear in the affidavit. The action was a scire facias upon a municipal claim for paving the street in front of the defendant\u2019s lot. The defence was that a designated passenger railway company was legally bound to do the work for which the claim was made, and therefore the defendant was not liable. In the case of Philadelphia v. The Spring Garden Market Co., 161 Pa. 522, we held that where the legislature has imposed upon a street railway company the obligation of paying for the original paving of a street, an abutting landowner can set up such legislative action as a defence to a suit brought by the city against himself to recover the cost of the original paving. Our Brother Mitchell, delivering the opinion, said, \u201cWe see nothing to prevent the property holder from taking advantage of the provisions of the act of 1864. That act, it is true, is a charter, and in that sense a contract between the state and the company,to which the property owner is not a party. But, as was said by Sharswood, J., in Penn. &amp; Ohio Canal Co. v. Graham, 63 Pa. 290, \u2018 the charter is indeed a contract imposing upon the corporation the burden of performing a certain duty to the public,\u2019 and in the present case the intent is clear to put on the railway company that portion of the public duty which relates to the paving of streets, and thereby to relieve the abutting property owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In the case at bar the affidavit of defence sets up the act of June 9, 1857, P. L. 802, which is a supplement to the charter of the Philadelphia and Delaware River Railroad Company, which subjects that company to any ordinances passed by the city councils with reference to the grading, paving, repaving, etc., of the streets over which their railway is laid, and a proviso that the said streets shall be kept in repair by the railway company. The affidavit further asserts that the railway built by the said company is laid upon the street on which the defendant\u2019s property is situated, and further sets forth certain city ordinances which provide that all passenger railway companies within the city shall be at the entire cost and expense of maintaining, paving, repaving and repairing that may be necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>upon any road, street, avenue or alley occupied by them. The act of 1857 and the various ordinances of the city which are described in the affidavit of defence, make out an apparent non-liability of the defendant for the work claimed for in this action, and therefore it was error to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. A discussion appears in the paper-books upon the effect of another and later ordinance of the city upon the defendant\u2019s liability, but as that ordinance does not appear on the record, we can take no cognizance of it at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">A prima 'facie defence is set forth in the defendant\u2019s affidavit and therefore judgment must be deferred until a final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
