Deponent is further advised and believes and so avers that plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim is entirely insufficient in that it does not contain any of the ingredients of a complete caus\u00e9 of action in assumpsit, and in that it does not set forth and-aver in concise, clear and unequivocal language, the liability and indebtedness'of defendant; neither is it accompanied by copies of instruments of writing or book-entries or either, showing any liability or indebtedness whatever of defendant to-plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">\u201c3.

That-deponent, of his own knowledge and from information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>received from John F. Rau and other coal dealers, believes and says that it has been the established custom of plaintiff to collect its toll and freight bills weekly, and from and after the expiration of two weeks to retain, keep possession of, lien and even sell coal for freight due and collectible, wherefore deponent says, if this custom and usage had been enforced and carried out by plaintiff against Snowdon &amp; Rau, only one week\u2019s freight and tolls would have been due and collectible from John F.

Deponent is informed by John F. Rau, and believes that plaintiff has not, by any proceeding whatever, fixed the amount of liability or indebtedness of John F. Rau, trading as Snowdon &amp; Rau, for freight and tolls, and has not at any time, retaken, kept possession of, or liened any coal of, or carried for Snowdon &amp; Rau to secure the payment of all and every sum due and unpaid, collectible or to be collected by plaintiff for freight and tolls, from Snowdon &amp; Rau, but in violation of its custom and established usage, and the provisions of its covenants and agreements entered into with Snowdon &amp; Rau.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">\u201c 8.
