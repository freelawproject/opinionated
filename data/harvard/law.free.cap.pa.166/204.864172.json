At the audit it appeared that the decedent had been a lunatic, and had been ill for some time immediately prior to. her death, and that expenses had been incurred for her maintenance and burial. By the adjudication the court awarded the estate to the husband and to the illegitimate son, but directed the above mentioned expenses to be deducted from the husband\u2019s share: 3 Dist. R. 176.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">Exceptions filed alleged error as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">\u201c 1. In charging against the distributive share of John Waesch, the entire expense of the decedent\u2019s board and funeral expenses ; the same should have been borne by her estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-9\">\u201c 2. In awarding the sum of 1578.48 to Johann Herrmann, the illegitimate son of the decedent, who was a resident of Germany, as he was not contemplated by the act of 1855, Purdon, 934 pi. 40.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-10\">The following opinion was filed by PIanna, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-11\">\u201c As to the first exception little need be said, as the liability of the husband for the funeral expenses of his wife, medical attendance upon her, etc., even although she has a separate estate, is too well settled to admit of argument. He is primarily liable, and her estate is liable only in ease he is insolvent. But if any balance remains for distribution as in this case, then the expenses he should have paid will be deducted from his distributive share: Costigan\u2019s Estate, 13 Phila. 264; McCormick\u2019s Estate, 4 Kulp, 15; Wauhoup\u2019s Estate, 29 Pitts. L. J. 256 ; Darmody\u2019s Estate, 13 Phila. 207; Welber\u2019s Estate, 20 Phila. 8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-12\">\u201c The remaining exception is to the award to the illegitimate son of decedent, upon the ground that he is a non-resident foreigner, living in Germany and not contemplated by the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>of April 27, 1855, Purdon, 934, pi. 40. The act provides not only that illegitimate children shall take, and be known by the name of their mother, but they shall respectively have capacity to take or inherit from each other personal estate as next of kin, and real estate as heirs in fee simple; and, as respects said real or personal estate so taken and inherited, to transmit the same according to the intestate laws of this state. It will thus be observed, the act is general and comprehends all illegitimates, and makes no distinction between residents or non-residents within the state. If such had been the intention of the legislature, it certainly would not have been left the subject of conjecture nearly forty years. And in the absence of any such-expressed intention, it is not within the province of the courts to assume that the act was intended to apply to and include only illegitimate children living within the commonwealth. As we cannot so construe the act the award was properly made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\">\u201c The exceptions are accordingly dismissed and adjudication confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-2) dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-7\"><em>Charles E.
