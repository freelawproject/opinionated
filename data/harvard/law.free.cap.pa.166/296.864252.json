Barratt, Esq., it appeared that, on June 23, 1892, the Goodwin Gas Stove and Meter Co. made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to Hector T. Fenton, Esq. At the time of the assignment the property was entirely personal. Settlement for taxes had been-made against the capital stock of the company for the years 1882 to 1885 inclusive, but no tax lien had been filed in the office of the prothonotary of the county where the accounting officer of the corporation resided. The auditor found as a fact that the fund for distribution arose from personal property owned by the assignor at the time of the assignment, and that' the creditors claiming out of the fund were not lien creditors of the assigned estate. The auditor disallowed the claim of the commonwealth for taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were sustained .by the court in the following opinion, by Thayer, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">\u201c The question argued in this case was, whether the claim of the commonwealth for taxes, which, by the 14th section of the act of June 7, 1879, and the 31st section of the act of June 1, 1889, is a preferred claim \u2018 to be first allowed before any other claims are paid,\u2019 lias lost its preference by reason of noncompliance with the provision of the 4th section of the act of April 14, 1827, Purd. 1386, requiring the auditor general \u2018 to transmit to the respective counties, to be by them entered of record, certified copies of the liens which may hereafter rise by virtue of the 12fch section of the act of March 30, 1811, as soon as the same are settled and entered in the books of the accounting officers,\u2019 Purd. 1385. By the 12th section of the act of 1811, the balance found in the account is to be a lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>on all the real estate of the person indebted throughout the commonwealth.\u2019 By the act of June 7,1879, it is a lien \u2018 upon the franchise and property, both real and personal, of corporations and limited partnerships.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-4\">\u201c In Commonwealth\u2019s Ap., 4 Pa. 164, it was held that, in de fault of the filing of a certified copy in pursuance of the provisions of, the act of 1827, the commonwealth\u2019s claim was entitled to no preference over other lien claimants. The case was a contest between rival liens against real estate. Arnold\u2019s Est., 46 Pa. 277, was to the same effect, but that also was a controversy between lien claimants, and the commonwealth was postponed to judgment creditors, because no certificate had been filed. The proceeds distributed, as in the Commonwealth\u2019s Ap., 4 Pa, 164, were derived from a sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate. In his opinion in Arnold\u2019s Estate, Judge Strong treats the question entirely as one of priority of lien, and, while postponing the commonwealth to other lien claimants on account of the neglect to file a certificate, adds distinctly: \u2018 Without the notice given by filing a copy of the balance of the account, and having it entered on record, the debt ascertained to be due to the commonwealth may be a lien as against the debtor, but is inoperative against other lien creditors.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">\u201c In Silversmith Co.\u2019s Est., 150 Pa. 285, the case was again a contest between lien creditors, and the opinion of Justice Green proceeds upon the ground that, as between other lien creditors and the commonwealth, the latter must be postponed when a certificate has not been filed in pursuance of the act of 1827. \u2018 Other lien creditors,\u2019 says he, \u2018 have the same right to notice under the act of 1879 as under the acts of 1811 and 1827.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">\u201c The present case, it is to be observed, is entirely different from the cases already referred to, which were relied upon by the auditor, in his report, against the commonwealth as a preferred creditor. In the present case none of the claimants are lien creditors except the commonwealth. That fact is expressly found by the auditor, and the fund was derived from the sale of personal estate exclusively. The creditors here were all general creditors claiming under the assignment. Is the commonwealth\u2019s preference, secured bjr the strong language of the acts of 1879 and 1889, lost as against creditors who are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>lien creditors at all, but general creditors, claiming under an assignment made by the debtor seven years after the commonwealth\u2019s lien attached? We think not. The commonwealth\u2019s claim was for taxes for the years 1882, T883, 1884, and part of the year 1885. The assignment was not made until June 23, 1892. It cannot be doubted that the personal property in the hands of the debtor was subject to the lien of the commonwealth\u2019s taxes for all those years, for, by the express words of the act of 1879, the commonwealth\u2019s taxes were \u2018a lien upon the franchises and property, both real and personal, of corporations and limited partnerships,\u2019 from the time the said taxes are due and payable. It has never been asserted by any decision, and cannot be pretended with any show of reason, that the commonwealth\u2019s lien against the debtor\u2019s property, while it is still his property, is lost by not filing the certificate referred to in the act of 1827. Such a construction would be unreasonable and a total perversion of the meaning of the legislature. We entertain no doubt that Judge Strong was right in saying, as he did in Arnold\u2019s Estate, that although the failure to file the certificate postponed the commonwealth\u2019s claim to other lien claimants, it was nevertheless a lien against the debtor himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">\u201c If this be so, nothing can be plainer than that the rights of the general creditors of the gas company could rise no higher than those of the debtor himself. If the commonwealth\u2019s claim attached to the property in his possession, as it undoubtedly did, he could not divest it by making an assignment for the benefit of creditors. That an assignee for the benefit of creditors is not a purchaser within the meaning of the word which protects, lien creditors or vendees for value, is familiar law. Neither the rights of the assignee nor those of the general creditors could rise higher than those of the assignor, and, as the property was subject to the commonwealth\u2019s lien in his hands, it remained subject to it in the hands of the assignee; and inasmuch as the fund distributed arises from the sale of that properijr, the lien attaches to the proceeds as firmly as it did to the property itself in the hands of the debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">\u201c It is ordered that the exceptions filed by the commonwealth be sustained, that the report be referred back to the auditor, with instructions to're-adjust the distribution in accordance with these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>views, and to award to the commonwealth the full amount of its claim with interest thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in sustaining exceptions, quoting them, and in making the award.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-6\"><em>Charles E.
