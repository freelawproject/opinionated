Before Fell, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-11\">At the trial it appeared that defendant was the assignee for the-benefit of creditors of Marietta Heller, trading as Adolph Heller. On Oct. 29,1891, and thereafter, plaintiffs sold to Mrs. Heller considerable quantities of dry goods. Plaintiffs claimed that they had made the sales relying upon statements which she had made to Bradstreet\u2019s Mercantile Agency on April 80, 1889. After Mrs. Heller\u2019s assignment plaintiffs issued a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of replevin, and took possession of the goods found in defendant\u2019s possession, that had been sold to Mrs. Heller by them. The statement made by Mrs. Heller to the Mercantile Agency \u25a0was reported by the agency to plaintiffs, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-4\">\u201cHeller, Adolph, Dry Goods, Millinery, &amp;c., (Marietta Heller, Sole Proprietor), Philadelphia, Pa.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">N E. Cor. 8th and Arch Sts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">\u201c The following was declared by Mrs. Heller to accurately represent her condition April 30, 1889:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">\u201c Stock on hand,..... $120,000.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMs3\">Accounts Rec. good, .... 5,000.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB2\">Portion of building occupied (free from encumbrance) including machinery, etc., 95.000. 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxKo\">Cash on hand,...... 15.000. 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajn\">$235,000.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A60\">Merchandise liabilities, 25,000.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWa\">Net worth, No borrowed money.\u201d $210,000.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-14\">The above was the result of an interview with Mrs. Heller. When a statement was asked, she referred the matter to her son, David Heller, stating that he was the financial manager of the concern. The above statement was made by the son, and the amounts were afterwards stated by Mrs. Heller to be a correct statement of her condition, both in detail and in the net result. She closed the interview saying, \u201c I am worth about $200,000 clear.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A34\">Plaintiffs offered evidence which tended to show that on April 30, 1889, Mrs. Heller\u2019s merchandise account showed a balance of only $55,602, while the cash account showed a balanee of only $8,193.50. Other evidence in the case showed that Mrs. Heller after 1889 conducted a very extensive business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-16\">Under date of Oct. 30,1889, the mercantile agency reported as follows: \u201c Authorities are not informed of any material \u25a0change in her condition. She appears to do a fair trade, but \u25a0 authorities do not appear to believe that she has made money during the past season. She is said to be under considerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>expense, and a very large business will have to be transacted before she begins to add to her capital. The general opinion of those consulted is that Mrs. Heller has undertaken an enterprise of considerable magnitude, which will call for the employment of a large capital and possession of rather more than average business ability to bring it to the degree of success evidently sought after. There appears a disposition to closely watch the progress of this business, and some have not ceased to regard it as an experiment which will need time to prove its success. Her present dealings believed principally in New York; locally she is sold reasonably and payments are said to be made in short time. Authorities consider from $75,000 to $100,000 a fair estimate of her means.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-3\">In February, 1890, plaintiffs began to sell and deliver goods to Mrs. Heller, and sold her several thousands of dollars\u2019 worth between then and the date of the failure in December, 1891. Mrs. Heller paid for all the goods she bought from the plaintiffs prior to Oct. 19, 1891. When she failed she owed plaintiffs $1,800. The goods replevied were a part of those sold after Oct. 19th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-4\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit, and subsequently refused to take it off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-6\"><em>James Qollins Jones </em>and <em>Lavin W. </em>Barringer, for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY1\">cited: Hill v.

There is no such evidence of fraud as would warrant any trial court in sustaining a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.
