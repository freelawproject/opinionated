P., Del. Co., confirming sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AARd\">Before Stbrrett, C.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>land was sold as a whole for $20,000, under judgments upon two mortgages aggregating with costs etc. $78,000, but the court required that plaintiff, who was the purchaser, should release defendant and the Folsom Land Company from personal liability for balance of mortgage. The sale was made under an order of court giving plaintiff leave to sell the property as a whole or in part. The advertisement of sale was submitted to defendant\u2019s counsel, and modified by them, and then published in its modified form. Real estate experts differed in their testimony as to the adequacy of the price realized by the sale. Exceptions to the confirmation of the sale were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-3\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-4\"><em>W. Henry Sutton </em>and <em>Isaac </em>Johnson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aied\">This advertisement and the depositions plainljr show that to sell such a property as this in a lumping sale is to sacrifice it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-5\">The courts do not look with favor upon this kind of a sale: Rowley v. Brown, 1 Binn. 62; Grim v. Reinbold, 148 Pa. 446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">A lumping sale of real estate will be set aside unless it forms a clear exception to the general rule, which, in Pennsylvania, is that lots of ground, houses, etc., should be sold separately: Vastine v. Fury, 2 S. &amp; R. 426; Ryerson v. Nicholson, 2 Yeates, 516; Tate v. Carberry, 1 Phila. 133; Thomas v. Curren, 6 W. N. C. 432; Baker v. Chester Co., 73 Pa. 117.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-7\"><em>Lewis Lawrence </em>Smith, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABZ\">There was no real inadequacy of price. The property was properly sold as a whole. The tract contained about 270 acres, including a considerable number of acres of streets. Its use and development as a land association imperatively demanded that it should be sold as a whole: Morse v. Freck, 7 Pa. C. C. 456; Marsh v. Pier, 4 R. 288; Cooper v. Wilson, 96 Pa. 409.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">It is a sufficient answer to the allegations of various defects in the advertisements, that a draft was furnished to appellants\u2019 counsel under order of court, and the actual advertisements used were in accordance with their corrections: Johnson v. Johnson, 7 Lanc. Law Rev. 331; Swires v. Brotherline, 41 Pa. 135; Young\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. &amp; W. 382; Weaver v. Lyon, 3 Cent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Rep. 263; Sharp v. Long, 28 Pa. 439; Barton v. Hunter, 101 Pa. 411; Carson\u2019s Sale, 6 W. 146.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMC\">March 5, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AQK0\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u25a0 We are not convinced that either of the exceptions to the sheriff\u2019s sale should have been sustained. On the contrary, we think their dismissal, in the circumstances, was a proper exercise of judicial discretion. In the absence of any available assurance that a higher and better price would be realized by the proposed re-sale of the property, there was nothing to justify the court in setting aside the sale, and thus subjecting the plaintiff to further delay and expense in the collection of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
