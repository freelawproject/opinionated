The par value of the stock was $50 per share, and it was contended by Mr. Gorman- that there was thus created a liability on the part of Mr. Wood to the decedent for $2,500, which was available as a set-off against a claim upon the due bill for $450. There were several objections to this, however; first, it appeared that the subscriptions, by the syndicates mentioned, or by one of them at least, had not been completed, and the stock, therefore, had not yet become demandable; second, the obligation is to deliver certain shares of stock, the value of .which was not shown, and there is nothing, therefore, by which to measure the damages even had performance by the decedent been fully established. It is true that it was alleged by Mr. Gorman that the subscription was not completed because Mr. Wood, having a contract with the railway company to complete the road by a certain time, failed so to complete it, and, as a result, the company became unable to meet its obligations and thus passed into the hands of a receiver; but there was no proof of these assertions, the contract was not produced, and there was no evidence that, as between the company and himself, Mr. Wood was in any default. But if this had been shown it would by no means follow that the syndicates referred to in the paper of August 8, 1890, were relieved of the obligation to complete their subscriptions; on the contrary, it may well be that the inability to finish the road was occasioned by the fact that the subscriptions were not paid. Moreover, the contract of Mr. Wood with the decedent called'for the delivery of fifty shares of the stock to the decedent when the subscriptions of the syndicates were completed, and certainly the whole number of shares could not be demanded if the subscriptions were not completed, whether the course of the syndicates was or was not justifiable in stopping when they did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">\u201c It is ordered and adjudged that the account, corrected as hereinbefore set forth, be confirmed nisi on payment of clerk\u2019s fees, and that the balance, with all the securities coming into the hands of the said administratrix, be paid and transferred to the said administrator de bonis non of the decedent, leave being given to make all necessary transfers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">The following exception among others was filed to the adjudication: .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201c 1.

Nothing can be profitably added to what has been said by the former in the clear and concise opinion that has been sent up with the record. The decree is therefore affirmed on his opinion, and the appeal is dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
