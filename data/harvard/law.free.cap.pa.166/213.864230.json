gave the details of what had to be done to preserve the properties and retain the tenants; that such expenditures had already amounted to $600, and that absolutely necessary further repairs had to be made at once ; that the neb annual rentals, without allowance for repairs or loss of rent, was but $1,667.13; and that as all of the houses were 40 to 50 years old, much would be needed each year to maintain them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">It further answered, that Sophia Marsden, the widow of John Marsden, had been blind for 30 years, was in her 90th year when she died and had then been confined to the house for 20 years ;

asserted that he had endeavored to fulfill every filial duty; that it was his dutjq as executor, to contest the alleged will of his father; he admitted that there had not' been anjr especial intercourse between himself and his sister since 1877, but denied that he had ever manifested or possessed any unkind or unbrotherly feeling to her; he averred that his sole purpose in the administration of the trust was to perform his entire duty to.all interested; that he believed himself to be fully competent to perform such duties ; that every step taken by him had been under advice of counsel, and that there was no reason, moral, legal or otherwise, why he should not be permitted to continue in office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">Evidence was taken by both petitioner and respondent as to the value of the repairs on the real estate, etc. The expenses of visits to Philadelphia to collect the rents were not charged in the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">The case was heard on petition, answer and proofs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">The following opinion was fil\u00e9d by Penrose, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-8\">\u201cThe power of the court under the act of April 9, 1868, to appoint a new trustee, while it is not to be exercised capriciously, or at the mere whim of the cestui que trust (Stevenson\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 101), is not dependent upon the misconduct of the trustee sought to be superseded; and it is enough to show that his retention, by reason of the existence of hostile relations between him and the cestui que trust, would naturally work disadvantage, inconvenience or great discomfort to the latter: Hillis\u2019s Estate, 9 W. N. 421. See also Kellberg\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 129 ; Seyfert\u2019s Estate, 8 W. N. 565; Gaul\u2019s Estate, 12 Phila. 18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-9\">\u201c That such has been and is the character of the relations in the present case is clear from the testimony of the respondent himself, and from the admitted fact that, since 1877 to the present time, though the cestui que trust is his sister, there has been no intercourse or communication between them; while during the year or more in which he has been acting as trustee, he did not consult her, or ai^r one on her behalf, with regard to his repairs of real estate, though the amount thus expended was more than one half of the entire gross income debited in his account. And there is the further fact that the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>now lives in Towanda, and apart from the question of the additional expense occasioned by visits for the purpose of attending to the trust, it may be better for the interests of all concerned that its management should devolve upon a resident trustee.\u201d Trustee dismissed and new trustee appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\"><em>Frror assigned </em>was decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-6\"><em>Joseph de F.
