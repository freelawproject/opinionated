Bell a deed of voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, which was accepted the same day and was after-wards duly recorded. Prior to making this assignment, on Feb. 20th, they confessed three judgments in C. P. No. 1, at Nos. 310, 311 and 312 March T., 1890, D. S. B., upon which' executions were issued the same day, and on Feb. 21st confessed two other judgments in favor of W. A. Schmidt, in trust for certain creditors, at 205 and 206 of March Term of said court, upon which executions were issued about a half hour before the execution of the deed of assignment to Bell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">\u201cOn Feb.-20th,-Dickson &amp; Co. executed an assignment to Waldman A. Schmidt, trustee \u2018 for the benefit of our preferred judgment creditors, entered on the 20th day of February, 1890, all and every our book accounts, as shown by our said books against all the parties our debtors on our said books, said accounts being shown in the schedule hereunto annexed and marked Exhibit A.,\u2019 and further providing that in case the judgments were paid in full out of the proceeds of execution, said accounts should be re-transferred to Dickson &amp; Co., and if not paid in full the trustee should collect said accounts and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment in full of said judgments, the balance to be transferred to the said Dickson &amp; Co., or their assigns, for the benefit of the remaining creditors of said firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\">\u201cUpon the same paper is written an assignment to the same W. A. Schmidt, trustee, as security for other judgments confessed to him as trustee for creditors^ named, \u2018 the above mentioned balance, if any,\u2019 \u2018 upon the same terms and conditions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>above set forth; any balance remaining to be by him transferred to said Dickson &amp; Co., or their assigns.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">\u201c On Feb. 27, 1890, an agreement was entered into by the assignee, the sheriff, and the attorney of the judgment creditors, by which the sheriff delivered possession of the personal property levied, which the assignee agreed to sell and pay the proceeds to the sheriff, to be applied to the executions in his hands.The same day W. A. Schmidt, by writing, \u2018 authorized F. B. Bell, assignee of Dickson &amp; Co.,\u2019 to collect the book accounts and pay the proceeds to Schmidt until the judgments should be fully satisfied, and the balance to be held by Bell, as assignee, \u2018 according to the terms of the said assignment of said book accounts and by virtue of the aforesaid deed of assignment.\u2019 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">\u201c The assignee thereupon took charge of the entire property of the firm, personal property under execution and book accounts, and proceeded to administer the same, and has brought the entire proceeds into his account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">\u201c The property being the stock of goods in a wholesale drug store, the arrangement made -with the sheriff was advisable and politic. Such a stock would certainly have been sacrificed at a public sale, and the increased proceeds of a private sale would doubtless be more than sufficient to pay the additional expense. No objection has been made to the payment of the proceeds of the personal property to the sheriff, except as to some items of his charges, which are alleged to be excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">\u201c Some of the creditors have objected to the application of the moneys collected from loose accounts to the payment of the judgments, upon which they allege the judgment creditors had no lien. This depends upon the validity of the assignment to W. A. Schmidt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-9\">-\u201cThe assignment to W. A. Schmidt is in terms an assignment An trust for the benefit of certain creditors, made by the \u25a0debtors oh account of inability to pay their debts, as shown by their confession of judgment to \u2018preferred creditors\u2019 and their general assignment made the same day. It therefore comes expressly within the act of April 17, 1843, and must be \u2018held and construed to enure to the benefit of all the creditors, and be subject in all respects, t.o the laws now in force relative to voluntary assignments.\u2019 Miners\u2019 Nat. Bank\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>193; Wallace v. Wainwright, 87 Pa. 263. When Schmidt authorized F. P. Bell as assignee to collect their moneys, he had no power to authorize him to appropriate the money to any special creditors in exclusion of others. But as such assignment was, bjr the act of 1843, made subject to all laws relating to voluntary assignment, it should have been recorded within thirty days, and not having been so recorded became void; and the property, reverted to the assignors, by virtue of the general assignment passed to Bell as assignee. He was, therefore, bound to account for these monej-s as assignee, which he has done in his account filed. But having applied these moneys to payment of the judgment creditors, in exclusion of the general creditors, his account must be rectified in this respect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">\u201c It follows, then, that the account of the assignee is composed of two funds\u2014that derived from the sale of the personal property which he received by virtue of the agreement with the sheriff, and which lw his agreement he was bound to pay to the sheriff, to be applied by him to satisfaction of the executions in his hands; the other derived from the book accounts and distributed among the creditors generally. By the account it appears that the first of these funds amounts to $16,475.29 and the second to $8,907.56.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">\u201c Each of these funds must bear its own burden of the expense of administration. The judgment creditors having agreed that the personal property levied on should be sold by the assignee, the expense incident to such sale, including the compensation of the assignee for that part of the work, must be charged to that fund. The balance of the fund is properly applicable to the judgments. The second fund can only be charged with the expense incident to its collection and administration, including compensation to the assignee for that part of the work. When the balance of each fund has thus been ascertained, the balance of the first fund will be appropriated to payment of the judgments in the order of their lien. The balance of the second fund will be appropriated to the remaining indebtedness, including so much of the judgments as may remain unpaid. The judgment creditors having the right to participate in two funds, will be entitled to pro-rate with general creditors for the full amount of their claims in distribution of the second fund, and not merely on the balance, unless such proportion is more than sufficient to pay their claims in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201cThe account as filed does not give the data necessary to make these distributions. The amount of expenses chargeable to each fund cannot be accurately determined without some further testimony, and the standing of the execution creditors cannot be accurately determined until this has been done and the order of their lien fixed; and besides, as these changes involve considerable complication, it is proper that the parties interested should have the opportunity to be heard before the auditor and to take exceptions, if they think proper, to his action in these matters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">\u201cWe cannot anticipate all the questions which may arise, and will therefore return the case to the auditor with instructions to carefully restate the account upon the principles herein indicated, with the right in the parties to except to his findings as upon original reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">\u201cThe other exceptions filed in the case we will not dispose of now.

The exceptions in behalf of the assignee to the auditor\u2019s report originally filed are hereby renewed.\u201d [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">The court filed the following opinion on the exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">\u201c This case is before us upon exceptions to a second report. Upon a former report we held that an assignment of the book accounts of the firm to W. A. Schmidt was a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, subject to the provisions of the act of April 17, 1843, and, therefore, accrued to the benefit of all the creditors, and the proceeds having come into the hands of Frank P. Bell, and being brought into his account, should be distributed pro rata to all the creditors. The matter was referred again to the auditor to make distribution on this principle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">\u201cApplication was made by counsel of the assignee to the court to direct the auditor to receive testimony affecting the question. We did not deem it necessary to do so, and did not make any order in the premises, but suggested that the testimony should be offered to the- auditor. An offer was made to him, but the auditor, believing that his duty was limited by the former ruling of the court, declined to receive the evidence. The importance of the matter justifies a further consideration of the question, and we have considered it as if the assignee had proved what he proposed to prove.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-10\">\u201c The offer was to prove by W. A. Schmidt that prior to the 20th day of February, 1890, certain creditors named 4 constituted him their trustee, with power to collect and adjust all claims which they, or either of them, had against Dickson &amp; Co., the assignors in these proceedings.\u2019 [The detailed statement shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>that the several parties had respectively \u2018 placed their claims in the hands of said Schmidt for collection, and authorized him to collect and adjust them on their behalf.\u2019 This would not constitute him a trustee. He was a mere agent, or attorney, to collect. Being a member of the bar, he personally received them as attorney at law. It is not alleged that the claims were assigned to him. He took from Dickson &amp; Co. judgment notes payable to himself, as trustee for the parties, but calling himself trustee would not change his character as attorney or agent. The claims still belonged to the parties, and they had entire control of them. He did not become a trustee until Dickson &amp; Co. made the assignment to him as \u2018trustee of our preferred judgment creditors.\u2019] [11] By this assignment the legal title to the property was placed in Schmidt, but the beneficial interest belonged to the clients whom he represented. The legal and equitable titles did not unite in him. He had the power to dispose of the property, but solely for the purpose of paying certain indebtedness of Dickson &amp; Co., and when this purpose was accomplished to turn over the balance to Dickson &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">\u201c [The assignment was the voluntary act of Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Co. to a person to whom they were not indebted, for the benefit of other persons to whom they were indebted, made when they knew they were insolvent, as is shown by the fact that it was executed a few hours after confessing judgments to the amount of $20,000, and within one hour before the execution of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; and on its face recognizes the fact of insolvency by describing the parties inter ested as \u2018 preferred judgment creditors.\u2019] [14]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">\u201c As was said in Lucas v. S. &amp; E. R. R. Co., 32 Pa. 464: \u2018We have here property, a trustee, a trust and creditors of an insolvent company, and the simple question is whether by an ambiguous inversion of language the real meaning of this instrument can be so covered as to defeat the operation of a most salutary law.\u2019 In Wallace v. Wainwright, 87 Pa. 266, Judge Shars4VOOD says: \u2018None of the acts of assembly relating to assignments for the benefit of creditors have required that they should be drawn in any specific form. . . . Since 1818 property transferred to one person to be employed, paid over or converted for the benefit of others has been held to be property held in trust within the operation of the statutes.\u2019 In Fallon\u2019s Appeal, 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Pa. 235, Chief Justice Lowrie said: \u2018Of course the courts cannot allow the law to be evaded by any sham departure from the general form of assignments, and where the transaction is substantially an assignment for the benefit of creditors, involving no other important purpose that would be prejudiced by bringing it under the act of 1818, the substance rather than the form must be regarded.\u2019 And in Chaffin v. Risk, 24 Pa. 432,-Judge Lowrie defined a trust as existing \u2018where the legal estate is in one person and the equitable interest in another.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">\u201c [These cases in our judgment clearly establish the character of the assignment in this case as a trust for the benefit of creditors, which not being recorded was void under the act of March 24, 1818. The property was turned over by Schmidt to Bell, the general assignee, who has brought the proceeds into his account for distribution. The pi-operty was his and is .distributable under the assignment to him.] [12] Kern v. Powell, 98 Pa. 253.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">\u201cWe have carefully examined all authorities cited by counsel for the assignee and find no reason to change the conclusion to which we came upon a former hearing of the Case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-7\">\u201c This disposes of the first exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-8\">\u201c [We do not see that the fact that the accounts are said to be as collateral security affects the case as suggested in the seventh exception. The transfer is absolute, the subsequent limitation is conditional. It is still a transfer in trust for the benefit of creditor's.] [13]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-9\">\u201c The 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th exceptions relate to the disposition of the expenses of administration, as appears by reference to the former opinion filed in this case. After a levy had been made on all the personal property of Dickson &amp; Co., by agreement of the assignee and judgment creditors with the sheriff, all the property was delivered to the assignee to be sold by him, and the proceeds to be appropriated: first, to the sheriff of Allegheny county to the amount of above debt, interest and costs upon said suits of execution, if a sufficient amount be realized from said sales. Schmidt then turned over to the assignee the accounts which had been assigned to him. The proceeds o* Riese two properties constitute the fund for distribution. Dickson &amp; Co. had no other estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-10\">\u201c The court then held that \u2018 each of these funds must bear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>its own burden of the expense of administration.\u2019 We then said: \u2018We cannot anticipate all .the questions which may arise, and will therefore return the case to the auditor, with instructions to carefully re-state the account upon the principles herein indicated, with right in the parties to except to his findings as upon original reference. The other exceptions we will not dispose of now, they may be submitted to the auditor for his consideration.\u2019 The auditor has made his report, in which he has charged a portion of the expenses to each fund. The counsel for the assignee claims that no part of the expenses of administration should be charged against the proceeds of stock which had been levied on by the sheriff, because, by the agreement between the judgment creditors and the assignee, the proceeds were to be paid to the sheriff in satisfaction of his executions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">\u201c In Kent\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 165, the power of the assignee to make such assignment was recognized, but we find no case in which the question of the expenses of such transaction has been considered. The parties must have known that the sale of the goods would involve considerable expense, and when they speak of \u2018 proceeds <em>\u2019 </em>it may be assumed that they meant the amount of money produced, less the costs of sale. If there were no other fund it would scarcely be contended that under such an agreement the assignee would not have the right to retain his costs and expenses. There being another fund upon which the judgment creditors had no special claim cannot change the effect of the agreement. We doubt if the assignee could agree to impose the costs of selling the goods subject to lien upon the general fund. It would be unjust to take the fund applicable to general creditors to pay the costs of increasing the fund applicable to preferred creditors, though the general creditors might be incidentally benefited by paying those claims, and thus to a certain extent relieving the general fund. But the assignee in this case did not attempt to make such an agreement, and it certainly cannot be implied. We are therefore of the opinion that the fund derived from sale of goods should be charged with the expenses attending its administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">\u201cThe expenses incurred by the assignee were largely for rent of store, clerk hire, etc. The appraisement of the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>occupied 22 daj'S and required assistance in preparing for the appraisers. The appraisement of book accounts must have-taken but little time. Upon a careful examination of the items of expense which the auditor has charged to the stock accounts, we find but one item which is not clearly due to that part of the business. This is the allowance for counsel fee, $500. We think a fair proportion of this should be charged to the general fund, say $250. As the stock does not fully pay the first judgments, \u2018and as they are entitled to pro rata with other creditors upon the general fund until paid, it makes no practical difference, but in order to make it accord with principle we charge that much to the general fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\">\u201c This disposes also of exception eighth, which claims that both funds should have been paid on the executions in order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">\u201c The 9 th exception is that the auditor erred \u2018 in surcharging the assignee with any sum whatever.\u2019 Tenth renews exceptions originally filed which are to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">\u201c In the first report the auditor surcharged the accountant with $156 excessive payment to appraisers. He allowed them $1.00 a day for the time occupied, and $102 paid assistant in preparing the goods. The surcharge was certainly proper. He also surcharged allowance for watchmen, $127.50. These watchmen were first employed by the sheriff, and they remained some time after the agreement by which the goods were turned over to the assignee. The auditor allowed pay for ten daj's and surcharged the balance. In this we think he was right. But in this report he has made an <em>error. </em>In the first report he was dealing with a balance shown by the account. As these sums were improperly credited it could only be corrected by surcharging it, and thus increase the balance. In this report the auditor deals with funds as a whole, and deducts expenses to obtain a balance. In the matter of appraisers\u2019 fees he credits the whole amount paid, and it would be proper to place the excess on the other side.

Such an assignment is not within the terms of the acts of 1818 and 1843 relating to voluntary assignments, and would not be void if not recorded within thirty days: Chaffees v.

A. Schmidt, executed within an hour before their general assignment to appellant, was in effect a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, which, in the circumstances and under the provisions of the act of April 17, 1843, P. L. 273, enured to the benefit of all the creditors of appellant\u2019s assignors. Said act declares : \u201c That all assignments of property in trust, which \u00abhall hereafter be made bjr debtors to trustees on account of inability at the time of the assignment to pay their debts, to prefer one or more creditors (except for the payment of wages of labor), shall be held and construed to enure to the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>of all the creditors in proportion to their respective demands; and all such assignments shall be subject in all respects to the laws now in force relative to voluntary assignments.\u201d In view of the undisputed facts upon which the question arose the learned judge was clearly right in holding as he did, and in recommitting the matter to the auditor, with instructions to make distribution in accordance with his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">The auditor\u2019s second report, with schedule of distribution attached, was excepted to by appellant. In his second opinion disposing of these exceptions, the learned judge fully considered and correctly disposed of all the questions presented, including the main question,\u2014as to the effect of the assignment of the book accounts to Schmidt,\u2014which had been previously considered and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">It is unnecessary to consider the specifications of error in detail. There is nothing in either of them that would warrant a reversal or modification of the decree. All that need be said in relation to either of the questions involved will he found in the clear and 'convincing opinion of the court below. For reasons therein given we think there is no error in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
