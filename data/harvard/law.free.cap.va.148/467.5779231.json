A decree was entered awarding the appellant a divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>from bed and board, awarding her alimony in the sum of sixty-five dollars per month, and awarding her the care and custody of the two infant children for a period of nine months in the year, and awarding the care and custody of the children for the remaining three months to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Upon application to one of the judges of this court, appellant was allowed an appeal respecting that portion of the decree awarding custody of the children to the appellee for a period of three months in the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Appellee assigns cross error in this court, under the provisions of Rule 8, and seeks a reversal of the decree awarding a divorce from bed and board to the complainant, awarding her alimony and the custody of the two children, and the entry here of a decree awarding him a divorce <em>a mensa </em>and the custody of the said children.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The appellant challenges the right of the appellee to assign cross error under the provisions of Rule 8, on the ground that the only question involved in this appeal is the custody of the children. As we have concluded to affirm the decree of the trial court, it is unnecessary to pass upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">As was said in <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>118 Va. 79, 86 S. E. 835: \u201cThe evidence is of a character which, in our opinion, renders any published discussion of it improper.\u201d No principle of law is involved in a disposition of the cause. The conclusion of the chancellor, that the appellant was entitled to a divorce <em>a mensa </em>on the ground of specific acts of cruelty, is fully warranted by the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We are also of opinion that the court did not err in its disposition of the children. Should such a condition arise in the future as to warrant a change in the decree in regard to the custody of the children, ample relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>is afforded either party both in the reservations contained in the decree and under the provisions of section 5111 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, to affirm the decree of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
