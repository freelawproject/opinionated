The immigration judge (IJ) determined that Parsottambhai-Patel was not credible and had failed to establish that she was entitled to relief and ordered Parsottambhai-Patel removed to India. The BIA agreed and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">Parsottambhai-Patel contends the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision denying her motion to amend her asylum application and making an adverse credibility determination, resulting in denial of asylum, with-holding of removal, and relief under the CAT. She concedes her petition does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determinations regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>her failure to meet the burden of proof for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. Accordingly, those contentions have been abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-23\">Regarding the BIA\u2019s affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to amend the asylum application, Parsottambhai-Patel notes that, \u201cas a matter of discretion, ... [the IJ\u2019s] having jurisdiction may permit an asylum applicant to amend or supplement the application\u201d. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(c) (amending application after filing). Such denial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Alarcon-Chavez v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 343, 345 (5th Cir.2005). Parsottambhai-Patel concedes, however, that the IJ al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>lowed her to testify regarding the supplemental information at the hearing. She also does not challenge the BIA\u2019s holding that the IJ could have considered the inconsistencies between the original and amended applications for the purpose of determining credibility. Parsottambhai-Patel has shown neither that the IJ abused his discretion by making a legal error in denying the motion to amend, nor that any claimed error prejudiced her claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Regarding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, generally, this court reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cunless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on the BIA\u2019s decision\u201d. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Where the BIA affirms based on the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Id. </em>We review the factual determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum under the substantial-evidence standard. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 536-37. Under that standard, we may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could [make such an adverse credibility ruling]\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Parsottambhai-Patel contends the IJ and BIA erred in making an adverse credibility determination because the discrepancies relied upon were insubstantial. However, in making a credibility determination, the trier of fact considers the totality of the circumstances \u201cwithout regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant factor\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (credibility determinations). Although Parsottambhai-Patel provides reasonable explanations for some of the omissions and discrepancies, she has not shown, based on the totality of the circumstances, that no reasonable fact-finder could make the same adverse credibility ruling. <em>Cf. Sanchez v. Holder, </em>332 Fed.Appx. 199, 201 (5th Cir.2009) (noting Sanchez provided \u201calternative explanations for the apparent inconsistencies and contradictions\u201d but concluded the record did not \u201ccompel a different conclusion\u201d regarding his credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
