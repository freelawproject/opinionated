Although Car-dona-Morales raises several challenges to the determinations made by the IJ and the BIA with respect to the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen and the BIA\u2019s denial of her two subsequent motions for reconsideration, the only petition for review before this court challenges the BIA\u2019s May 2013 denial of Cardona-Morales\u2019s first motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, this court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those arguments relating to the BIA\u2019s May 2013 decision. <em>See Kane v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 231, 237-38 n. 14 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-21\">In its May 2013 decision, the BIA made three determinations. In this court, Car-dona-Morales has briefed no argument challenging the BIA\u2019s first determination that she failed to establish any error in the dismissal of 'her appeal as untimely. She has thus waived any argument that could have been raised. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">Next, there was no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s alternative determination that it would not have disturbed the IJ\u2019s denial of Cardona-Morales\u2019s motion to reopen, even if Cardona-Morales had filed a timely appeal of that decision. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005). As the BIA observed, the record establishes, contrary to the assertions in the motion to reopen, that Cardona-Morales received sufficient notice of the 1999 removal hearing through personal service. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229(a)(1), 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-23\">Finally, Cardona-Morales suggests that the BIA\u2019s failure to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen her removal proceedings has resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice. Because the authority to reopen an immigration proceeding sua sponte is entirely discretionary, this court lacks jurisdiction to review a challenge to the BIA\u2019s refusal to do so. <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also Ibarra-Gonzalez v. Holder, </em>542 Fed.Appx. 341, 341-42 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
