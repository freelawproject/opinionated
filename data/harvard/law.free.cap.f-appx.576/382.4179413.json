Amonte, who entered the United States in July 1973 as a lawful permanent resident, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ordered removed based on his conviction of an aggravated felony: conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (iii) (\u201cAny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d). The BIA also rejected Almonte\u2019s contention that the Government should be equitably estopped from deporting him because the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) violated his due process rights by mishandling and, later, terminating his 1981 application for naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Almonte does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that his drug conspiracy conviction is an aggravated felony. Because he is removable on that basis, we have jurisdiction only to review constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Almonte contends the INS committed affirmative misconduct by failing to notify him of the time, date, and place to appear in connection with his naturalization application. He further contends the INS failed to comply with regulations governing the processing of applications for naturalization, primarily by taking several years to process his application. Finally, he asserts the INS improperly terminated his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On petition for review of a BIA decision, we review factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law <em>de novo. E.g., Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Whether the Government should be estopped from bringing a removal proceeding constitutes a question of law, reviewed <em>de novo. See Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 542 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cCourts have been exceedingly reluctant to grant equitable estoppel against the government.\u201d <em>Robertson-Dewar v. Hold er, </em>646 F.3d 226, 229 (5th Cir.2011). The remedy of equitable estoppel, if it is available, requires a showing of, <em>inter alia, </em>affirmative misconduct on the part of the Government. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAffirmative misconduct requires an affirmative misrepresentation or affirmative concealment of a material fact by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229-30 (quoting <em>Linkous v. United States, </em>142 F.3d 271, 278 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Almonte\u2019s contentions, at most, amount to allegations of delay, inaction, and negligence on the part of the INS in handling his application for naturalization. Such action or inaction, however, does not constitute the requisite affirmative misconduct. <em>See id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
