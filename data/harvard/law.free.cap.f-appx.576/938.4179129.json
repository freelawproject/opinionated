In Files\u2019s petition, he asserted that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was inadequate and ineffective to challenge the legality of his detention because he was foreclosed from obtaining relief in a second or successive motion based on his argument that DePierre<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> announced a new statutory interpretation of law. His underlying claim was that the district court imposed enhanced statutory penalties on him under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) without first having the jury determine a drug type and amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">The district court dismissed his petition, concluding that Files\u2019s claim did not satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). Files filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">On appeal, Files argues that <em>DePierre </em>is retroactively applicable because it announced a new substantive rule by narrowing the interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). He asserts that he was previously foreclosed by <em>United States v. Hester, </em>199 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2000), from raising his argument that the type and amount of drugs are elements of the offense. However, he contends that <em>Hester </em>has since been overturned by <em>DePierre. </em>He submits that, based on our holding in <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir.2013), he was not required to show that he was actually innocent of his offenses as articulated in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999). Files does not raise any arguments specific to the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">A federal prisoner must typically bring any collateral attack on the validity of his conviction or sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Once he has filed his initial \u00a7 2255 motion, he is barred from making second and successive motions except where his claim relies upon the existence of newly discovered evidence or a new rule of retroactively applicable constitutional law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). In addition, pursuant to \u00a7 2255(e), known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if the \u00a7 2255 remedy \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant v. Warden, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir.2013). The burden is on the movant to establish the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. The savings clause is a jurisdictional provision that must be met in order for the claims to survive dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">The restriction against second and successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, cannot render \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy inadequate or ineffective under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc). </em>Rather, we have explained that a petitioner meets this burden only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>where he shows that: (1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and original \u00a7 2255 proceeding, his claim was squarely foreclosed by our binding precedent; (2) his current claim is based on a Supreme Court decision that overturned the precedent that had foreclosed his claim; (3) that Supreme Court decision is retroactively applicable on collateral review; (4) as a result of the application of the new rule, his sentences exceed the applicable statutory maximum penalties; and (5) the savings clause reaches his pure-Begay<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>er</em>ror claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. We explained that a claim of illegal detention above the applicable statutory maximum penalty was a fundamental sentencing defect within the purview of the savings clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1281-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have stated that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral appeal. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001). However, in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have explained that the enhanced penalties in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) cannot be applied unless the jury determines the drug type and quantity involved in the drug conspiracy offenses. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1309 (11th Cir.2012). In <em>DePierre, </em>the Supreme Court held that the term \u201ccocaine base,\u201d as used in \u00a7 841(b)(1), refers to not just crack cocaine, but any cocaine in its chemically basic form. <em>DePierre, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2237.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Files has not shown that he has met the requirements of the savings clause here. The problem for Files is that his argument regarding drug type and amount is based on <em>Apprendi </em>at its core. Files has already raised this argument under <em>Apprendi </em>on direct appeal, and in any event, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral appeal. <em>See McCoy, </em>266 F.3d at 1258. As such, Files cannot show that the claim he seeks to raise now was squarely foreclosed throughout his direct appeal and original \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. As Files\u2019s claim could not proceed under the savings clause, and he has failed to make any additional argument specific to the denial of his motion for reconsideration on appeal, the district court correctly denied his motion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-10\">. <em>DePierre v.
