At the time he was sentenced, Joseph was subject to a ten-year statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2009). Joseph argues that the then \u2014 applicable minimum sentence should not be applied in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, but acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by our precedent. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). A sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where it does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Further, a court usually cannot reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment below the low end of the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s (\u201cFSA\u201d) reduced statutory mandatory minimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after the date the FSA went into effect. 567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). However, in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we rejected an argument that a defendant sentenced before the FSA was entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of the FSA\u2019s statutory amendments, determining that the FSA was not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. 701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). We agreed with \u201cevery other circuit to address the issue\u201d that there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before the FSA\u2019s August 3, 2010 enactment date. <em>Id. </em>We further reasoned that nothing in <em>Dorsey </em>suggested that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory minimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were originally sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">In <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>we reaffirmed our conclusion in <em>Berry </em>that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA should apply to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. 712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013). We explained that, because the FSA did not apply to Hippolyte\u2019s case, the statutory minimums that applied were the ones that were in place at the time when he was sentenced in 1996. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Under <em>Berry </em>and <em>Hippolyte, </em>it is clear that the statutory sentencing provisions in effect at the time of Joseph\u2019s initial sentencing remain in effect today. Joseph\u2019s present ten-year sentence equals the then \u2014 applicable statutory minimum sentence. Therefore, Joseph is ineligible to receive a lower sentence, and the district court correctly denied his motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
