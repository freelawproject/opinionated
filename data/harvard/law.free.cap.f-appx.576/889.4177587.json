Applying this tolling provision, the district court determined that one of Appellant Cliff DeTemple\u2019s claims, subject to a one-year statute of limitations under Wisconsin state law, was time barred. DeTemple, a United States Coast Guard reservist who was on active-duty status for a portion of the limitation period, argues that the district court erred in calculating tolling under the SCRA. After careful review, we agree. Therefore, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">The relevant facts are undisputed. De-Temple owned and operated Turning Point Systems Group, a sole proprietorship, which had contracted with Leica Geosys-tems, Inc. (\u201cLeica\u201d), to sell survey and construction products manufactured by Leica. On September 29, 2006, Leica notified DeTemple that it would be terminating its contracts with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">On March 26, 2007, DeTemple received orders to report for active duty with the Coast Guard. DeTemple served active duty from March 28, 2007, until at least September 23, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">On March 28, 2008, DeTemple filed suit against Leica in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wiscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>sin, alleging breach of contract and violations of the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law (\u201cWFDL\u201d), Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 135.01-135.06. DeTemple was required to bring his cause of action under the WFDL within one year after receiving written notice of termination from Leica. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.93(3)(b); <em>Les Moise, Inc. v. Rossignol Ski Co. Inc., </em>122 Wis.2d 51, 361 N.W.2d 653, 654 (1985). Thus, in the absence of tolling, DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim was time barred because it was not filed by September 29, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The Wisconsin district court found that the SCRA tolled the limitation period for 180 days, based on DeTemple\u2019s active duty with the Coast Guard. Despite reaching this conclusion, the court determined that DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim was time barred because it expired on March 24, 2008. The court originally dismissed the claim with prejudice, but, in response to DeTemple\u2019s timely motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e), Fed.R.Civ.P., vacated that ruling on October 29, 2009. Citing DeTemple\u2019s imprecise allegations as to his dates of service, the court instead dismissed the WFDL claim without prejudice pursuant to forum-selection clauses in the contracts, as it had done with the breach-of-contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">On November 20, 2009, DeTemple refiled the action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Leica moved for summary judgment, again arguing that DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim was time barred. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment to Leica.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court credited DeTemple with 182 days, of tolling under the SCRA for his military service. Nonetheless, the Georgia court, like the Wisconsin court, determined that DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim was time barred because it expired on March 24, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">DeTemple moved for relief from the summary-judgment order under Rule 60, Fed.R.Civ.P., on two bases. First, De-Temple asserted that the court erred by counting the 182-day tolling period from September 23, 2007, the date he returned from active duty, rather than from September 29, 2007, the date that the limitation period would have ended without tolling. Rejecting DeTemple\u2019s contention, the district court stated that it calculated the limitation period the same way as the Wisconsin court and that DeTemple \u201cd[id] not cite any cases involving the SCRA or WFDL to show that his 182 days of tolling should be credited from the date of September 29, 2007.\u201d Second, DeTemple asserted that new evidence from the Coast Guard showed that his active duty extended seven additional days, or until September 30, 2007. Because the court found that DeTemple had not exercised reasonable diligence in discovering the new evidence, it denied his Rule 60 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">DeTemple now appeals the district court\u2019s ruling that his WFDL claim was time barred and, alternatively, the denial of his Rule 60 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards governing the district court. <em>Bradley v. Franklin Collection Serv., Inc., </em>739 F.3d 606, 608 (11th Cir.2014). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">DeTemple argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Leica on the WFDL claim because it incorrectly calculated the limitation period with tolling. He contends that the court should have added the 182 days of tolling to the end of the original one-year period, not to the end of his active-duty service. As a result, DeTemple asserts, his WFDL claim was timely filed on March 28, 2008, because the limitation period \u2014 with tolling\u2014 ended on March 29, 2008, a Saturday, and continued to run until March 31, 2008. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Section \u00a7 206 of the SCRA, entitled \u201cTolling of statutes of limitations during military service,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he period of a servicemember\u2019s military service may not be included in computing any period limited by law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in a court\u201d by or against the service-member. SCRA \u00a7 206(a), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 526(a); <em>see also </em>SCRA \u00a7 101(2)(A)(i), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 511(2)(A)(i) (defining \u201cmilitary service\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>active duty with the Coast Guard); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(d)(1) (defining \u201cactive duty\u201d). For a reservist like DeTemple, the SCRA\u2019s protection begins \u201con the date of the member\u2019s receipt of the order\u201d to report for military service. <em>See </em>SCRA \u00a7 106(a), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 516(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Under the plain meaning of the SCRA\u2019s tolling provision, the period of DeTemple\u2019s military service \u201cmay not be included in computing\u201d the one-year limitation period. <em>See </em>SCRA \u00a7 206(a), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 526(a). The SCRA\u2019s tolling command is \u201cunambiguous, unequivocal, and unlimited.\u201d <em>See Conroy v. Aniskoff, </em>507 U.S. 511, 513-14, 113 S.Ct. 1562, 1564-65, 123 L.Ed.2d 229 (1993) (describing an essentially identical tolling provision in the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940, which Congress amended in 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-189, 117 Stat. 2835, and renamed as the SCRA). Where, as here, the language of a statute is unambiguous, we inquire no further and instead simply apply the clear terms of the statute as written. <em>See Lowery v. Alabama Power Co., </em>483 F.3d 1184, 1199 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cIn interpreting a statute, we look first to the statute\u2019s plain meaning and, if the statutory language is facially unambiguous, our inquiry comes to an end.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Here, the following determinative facts are undisputed: (1) without tolling, the one-year period to file the WFDL claim would have ended on September 29, 2007; (2) DeTemple received orders to report for active duty on March 26, 2007, and he served active duty with the Coast Guard from March 28, 2007, through September 23, 2007; (3) the SCRA tolled the limitation period for 182 days for that period of military service; and (4) DeTemple filed the WFDL claim on March 28, 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Under the terms of the SCRA, then, as of September 29, 2007, DeTemple had an additional 182 days to file his WFDL claim. We respectfully reject the district court\u2019s method of calculation, which added the 182 days to DeTemple\u2019s return from service, rather than to the end of the limitation period. Employing the district court\u2019s methodology could obstruct congressional intent in enacting the SCRA. For instance, if DeTemple had served only two days, rather than 182, assuming all other facts are the same, adding the two days to the date that DeTemple returned from active duty would result in a limitation period shorter than the original one-year period. Thus, calculating tolling in this way could actually count days of military service <em>against </em>a service member. Moreover, both the original period and the period with \u201ctolling\u201d would then include days of military service which \u201cmay not be included.\u201d Instead, we agree with De-Temple\u2019s suggestion that the tolling period must be counted from the end of the limitation period and that DeTemple\u2019s limitation period therefore, with tolling, ended on March 29, 2008, a Saturday, and continued to run until Monday, March 31, 2008. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 990.001(4)(c); Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(a)(1)(C). Accordingly, DeTem-pie\u2019s WFDL claim was timely filed on March 28, 2008.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Finally, we find no merit to Leica\u2019s contentions that the lack of case law directly on point somehow insulates the district court\u2019s decision from error or that there is something unique about the calculation of the statute of limitations under the WFDL. In this case, we simply apply the unambiguous mandate that the \u201cperiod of [DeTemple\u2019s] military service may not be included in computing\u201d the one-year period of limitation for the WFDL claim. Doing so, we conclude that the district court erred in calculating the limitation period for DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim under the SCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim was not time barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Leica on that claim and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. The district court also granted Leica's motion for summary judgment with respect to the breach-of-contract claims. DeTemple expressly does not appeal that portion of the district court\u2019s order, so we do not discuss it further. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 4 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\">. Although neither party addresses the point, we note that March 28, 2008, the date that DeTemple filed the action in Wisconsin, governs the timeliness of the claim for purposes of the limitation period, rather than November 20, 2009, the date that he refiled the complaint in Georgia. Under Wisconsin state law, the limitation period in this case was tolled by the commencement of the Wisconsin action until \"the end of the period in which an appeal may be taken from a final order or judgment of the trial court.\u201d <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(a), (b). Here, DeTemple had until November 30, 2009, to appeal the Wisconsin court\u2019s decision due to his timely Rule 59(e) motion, which was resolved on October 29, 2009. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), (4) &amp; 26(a)(2)(C). Because DeTemple refiled the WFDL claim in Georgia on November 20, 2009, before the limitation period expired, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>period was again tolled. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b917-6\">. We recognize that a court may properly calculate tolling in multiple ways, but the method used should not change the ultimate result. For instance, the court may determine any applicable days of tolling and add them to the end of the original limitation period, as we have done above. Or, the court may add any days of tolling to the date tolling ended, as the district court did here, and also credit any days remaining in the original period, which the court failed to do. Finally, the court may calculate tolling like a \"clock,\u201d starting and stopping the running of the limitation period when tolling is or is not applicable. <em>See, e.g., San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1265-67 (11th Cir.2011) (discussing tolling of the one-year limitation period for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996). In this case, 177 days had run on the one-year period when the clock stopped on March 26, 2007. Once tolling ended on September 23, 2007, the clock resumed, leaving DeTemple 188 days (365 days minus 177 days), or until March 29, 2008, to file the WFDL claim. Regardless of the method used, the result is same \u2014 DeTemple\u2019s WFDL claim was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b917-14\">. For this reason, we do not address DeTem-ple\u2019s alternative argument regarding newly discovered evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
