On appeal, Merritt argues that: (1) running his sentence consecutively to his undischarged state probation revocation sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the court treated the Guidelines as mandatory and failed to consider all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; and (2) the district court\u2019s reliance on one statutory sentencing factor \u2014 the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation that the sentence run consecutively \u2014 renders his sentence substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">We review the district court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346 (11th Cir.2009). We also review reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If we conclude that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>did not procedurally err, we then review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1191. A court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a \u201csymptom of an unreasonable sentence,\u201d and a sentence may be substantively unreasonable when the court fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1191\u2014 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">When a prison sentence is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the court may elect to run the terms concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). The court must make this decision by considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b). Echoing the statute, the Sentencing Guidelines recommend that, when imposing a sentence on a defendant already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense may run concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). The Guidelines recommend that the court run the sentence in a manner that \u201cachieve[s] a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To that end, where \u201c[a] defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense\u201d and \u201chad such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked[,]\u201d the Guidelines recommend that \u201cthe sentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the sentence imposed for the revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n. 3(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">At Merritt\u2019s sentencing, the district court said that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Merritt\u2019s sentence, which was a 55-month consecutive sentence. The court specifically discussed Merritt\u2019s criminal history, agreeing with the government\u2019s characterization of it and adding that his history was \u201cextensive\u201d and \u201ctroubling.\u201d The court went on to conclude that Merritt\u2019s criminal history was not overrepresented and declined to sentence him under a lower criminal history category as Merritt urged. The also court determined the sentence should run consecutively to Merritt\u2019s undischarged state sentence. Contrary to Merritt\u2019s argument, there is no indication that the court\u2019s statement about its consideration of the sentencing factors (including criminal history) applied only to the length of the sentence. Thus, because the court clearly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Merritt\u2019s sentence, it did not abuse its discretion in imposing a consecutive sentence. <em>Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1346; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The record also indicates that the sentence was procedurally reasonable. Indeed, there is no indication, as Merritt argues, that the court treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Rather, as we\u2019ve discussed, the court made clear that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">Finally, Merritt has failed to show that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence consecutive to Merritt\u2019s state sentence was substantively unreasonable. As the record shows, the court did not fail to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or unjustifiably rely on any one factor, specifically discussing both the defendant\u2019s history and the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 recommendation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 1191. The substantive reasonableness of his sentence is further supported by the Guidelines\u2019 suggestion that the imposition of a consecutive sentence seeks to achieve a sentencing purpose set forth in \u00a7 3558(a) \u2014 providing just punishment for the offense. <em>See id. </em>(noting that a sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 comment. (n. 3(C)) (recommending that a sentence should run consecutively to a state probation sentence to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense). On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the 55-month sentence to run consecutively to Merritt\u2019s undischarged probation revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-15\">.
