(\u201cCarrier\u201d) (collectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d), alleging that he was injured or aggravated an injury while lifting a five-gallon oil drum aboard- the MW CATHERINE KNUTSEN (\u201cKNUT-SEN\u201d). Following a formal hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) ordered Petitioners to pay Murphy compensation benefits for temporary total disability as well as \u201call reasonable and necessary work expenses arising out of his work-related injuries.\u201d The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding it was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">Murphy serviced refrigerator equipment aboard vessels for his employer. He sustained a work-related back injury, a herniated disc, in June 1996. He experienced several flare-ups of his back condition between 2000 and 2010, including, relevant to this case, on August 7 and 13, 2010. He claims that he pulled his back while installing a line on a compressor aboard the M/V MORAY on August 7, then exacerbated this injury when he lifted a five-gallon oil drum aboard the KNUTSEN on August 13. Murphy has been unable to perform any work since August 13, 2010, and was terminated effective November 25, 2011. In connection with the MW MORAY injury on August 7, Murphy initially received benefits under a voluntary compensation policy from ACE/ESIS, an international carrier who covered claimant\u2019s condition because it occurred outside of United States waters in Curacao. However, these benefits stopped in January 2011 when he hired an attorney and filed a claim for benefits against Petitioners in connection with the KNUTSEN incident. Hence the issue was which incident, i.e. the one on the MORAY and/or the one on the KNUT-SEN, was the cause of Murphy\u2019s inability to do any work since August 13, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920, \u201cit shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary \u2014 (a) [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u201d For the presumption to apply, \u201ca claimant must prove (1) that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>suffered harm, and (2) that conditions existed at work, or an accident occurred at work, that could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the condition.\u201d <em>Port Cooper/T. Smith Stevedoring Co., Inc. v. Hunter, </em>227 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.2000). If the claimant establishes a <em>prima facie case, </em>the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by presenting \u201csubstantial evidence establishing the absence of a connection between the injury and the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288 (citing <em>Gooden v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>135 F.3d 1066, 1068 (5th Cir.1998)). \u201cIf the employer rebuts the presumption, then the issue of causation must be decided by looking at all of the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In a thorough 24-page order, the ALJ found that Murphy met his initial burden of proof to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case and invoke the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. The ALJ further found that Petitioners failed to present substantial evidence to rebut the presumption. Moreover, the ALJ maintained that, even if Petitioners had successfully rebutted the presumption raised by Murphy, the evidence as a whole weighed in favor of Murphy. The BRB affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">On appeal, Petitioners argue that Murphy did not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, and the ALJ\u2019s contrary finding is not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners further maintain that, even assuming Murphy established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the ALJ erred by applying the incorrect legal standard and holding that Petitioners failed to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. Finally, Petitioners assert that weighing all of the evidence indicates that the August 13 accident aboard the KNUTSEN did not aggravate \u2014 much less cause \u2014 Murphy\u2019s back injury. Hence Petitioners maintain that the BRB\u2019s same findings are neither supported by substantial evidence nor in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u201cOur review of the BRB\u2019s decision is limited in scope to considering errors of law, and making certain that the BRB adhered to its statutory standard of review of factual determinations, that is, whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and [are] consistent with the law.\u201d <em>Coastal Prod. Servs., Inc. v. Hudson, </em>555 F.3d 426, 430 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that relevant evidence \u2014 more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance \u2014 that would cause a reasonable person to accept the fact finding.\u201d <em>Ceres Gulf, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>683 F.3d 225, 228 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review the BRB\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Coastal Prod. Servs., </em>555 F.3d at 430. As the factfinder, the ALJ \u201cis exclusively entitled to assess both the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Ceres Gulf, </em>683 F.3d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">A. Establishing a <em>Prima Facie </em>Case</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Murphy maintains that (1) he suffered a gradual degradation of his low-back condition since working for Employer, culminating in his inability to work after his last job aboard the KNUTSEN on August 13; or (2) alternatively, he sustained an aggravation of his preexisting low-back injury when he lifted the five-gallon oil drum on the KNUTSEN on August 13, 2010, thereby increasing and accelerating his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">The ALJ concluded that under either theory, Murphy established a <em>prima facie </em>case. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ relied on (1) the record\u2019s ample evidence of Murphy\u2019s prior workplace back injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and resulting treatment; (2) records and testimony from Murphy\u2019s long-time physician establishing that the workplace conditions aggravated his back condition over time, that Murphy did suffer an injury in 2010, and that the August 13 accident worsened his condition; (3) Murphy\u2019s ability to work after the August 7 incident, but not after the August 13 incident; and (4) the testimony of Murphy\u2019s wife that after he arrived home on August 13, he told her that he had \u201creally finished [his] back this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Petitioners contest that Murphy cannot recover under a gradual degradation theory \u201cbecause it is not disputed that there was a definite, new, and interceding event in August 2010 that caused Murphy\u2019s need for medical treatment, not a gradual degradation of symptoms.\u201d Petitioners further maintain that Murphy did not present adequate evidence that the August 13 aggravation \u2014 rather than the August 7 injury \u2014 caused his need for treatment to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Petitioners further allege that all of the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were based only on Murphy\u2019s account, and the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination regarding Murphy\u2019s testimony cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that an accident occurred on August 13, 2010, that either exacerbated or caused Murphy\u2019s herniated disc is rational and supported by substantial evidence. Even ignoring the other evidence presented, Petitioners concede that a claimant\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, and that \u201cfinders of fact are given latitude to make credibility determinations.\u201d <em>See Ceres Gulf, Inc., </em>683 F.3d at 229. As Murphy established both a harm (the herniated disc) and the occurrence of a workplace incident on August 13, 2010, that could have caused or exacerbated the injury, we agree with the ALJ and BRB that Murphy established a <em>prima facie </em>case and is entitled to the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. <em>See Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">B. Rebutting the \u00a7 920(a) Presumption</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Once the claimant establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption through facts \u2014 not mere speculation \u2014 that the injury is not related to his employment, in this case, the August 13 incident. <em>See Conoco, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, </em>194 F.3d 684, 687-88 (5th Cir.1999). The employer\u2019s burden is one of production, not persuasion; once the employer produces substantial evidence of the absence of a causal relationship, the \u00a7 20(a) presumption is rebutted. <em>Ceres Gulf, Inc., </em>683 F.3d at 229-231 (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that this evidentiary standard [substantial evidence] is <em>less </em>demanding than the ordinary civil requirement that a party prove a fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). When aggravation of a preexisting condition is claimed, the employer must produce substantial evidence that work events neither directly caused the injury nor aggravated a preexisting condition to result in injury. <em>See Ortco Contractors, Inc. v. Charpentier, </em>332 F.3d 283, 290 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen an employment injury worsens or combines with a preexisting impairment to produce a disability greater than that which would have resulted from the employment injury alone, the entire resulting disability is compensable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The ALJ found that, whereas Petitioners presented evidence regarding Murphy\u2019s vague or delayed reporting of his injuries, the evidence presented was \u201cnot substantial enough to rebut the Section 20(a) presumption,\u201d and \u201cthe attempts to disprove the fact of the accident on August 13, 2010, were unsuccessful.\u201d Additionally, the ALJ found Petitioners did not offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>any evidence that the nature of Murphy\u2019s work aboard the KNUTSEN, which involved moderate to heavy physical activity, was not such that it could have caused or aggravated Murphy\u2019s herniated disc. The BRB found the ALJ\u2019s conclusion to be supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">On appeal, Petitioners maintain that the ALJ and BRB erred in requiring them to \u201cdisprove\u201d rather than simply produce evidence rebutting the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. Petitioners further maintain that they presented substantial evidence of the absence of a causal relationship sufficient to rebut the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. Specifically, petitioners presented evidence that Murphy did not submit a claim form until months after the injury on January 6, 2011, once he had retained counsel, and that he lumped the August 7 and August 13 injuries together in prior conversations with management and doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We agree with the ALJ and BRB that Petitioners\u2019 evidence of the vague nature of Murphy\u2019s reporting of his injuries does not constitute substantial evidence that the August 13 accident could not have caused or aggravated Murphy\u2019s injury. We further find that, despite the ALJ\u2019s use of the word \u201cdisprove,\u201d the ALJ applied the correct legal standard and only required Petitioners to bear the burden of production, not persuasion. In its order, the ALJ noted that \u201cthere was nothing substantial presented to suggest that [Murphy] was not credible in his account of the August 13, 2010, injury.\u201d The ALJ further found that Petitioners \u201cmade no attempt to show that the nature of [Murphy\u2019s] work was not such that could have caused or aggravated his back condition.\u201d As the BRB noted, these holdings indicate that \u201cany error in the administrative law judge\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018disprove the fact\u2019 in terms of Section 20(a) rebuttal is harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">C. Weighing the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">If the employer rebuts the \u00a7 20(a) presumption, it no longer controls, and the question of whether there is a causal relationship between the injury and the workplace incident must be resolved on the evidence of the record as a whole, with the claimant bearing the burden of persuasion. <em>Ceres Gulf, </em>683 F.3d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The ALJ found that even assuming that Petitioners rebutted the presumption, the evidence as a whole weighs in favor of Murphy\u2019s claim. The BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, finding that the ALJ \u201crationally credited [Murphy\u2019s] testimony regarding the August 13, 2010 incident and Dr. Corales\u2019s undisputed testimony that claimant\u2019s work for employer could have contributed to his back condition and its apparent worsening in August 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">On appeal, Petitioners maintain that Murphy offered no meaningful evidence that the August 13 evidence caused or exacerbated his injury (only his testimony), and hence the evidence they presented in rebuttal logically must outweigh Murphy\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">We earlier rejected Petitioners\u2019 argument, finding that the evidence presented by Murphy was sufficiently meaningful and substantial to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Petitioners rebutted the \u00a7 20(a) presumption, we affirm the BRB\u2019s conclusion that the evidence as a whole weighs in Murphy\u2019s favor and accordingly he is entitled to benefits. <em>See Avondale Indus., Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>977 F.2d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201c[T]he ALJ\u2019s decision need not constitute the sole inference that can be drawn from the facts.... As fact finder, the ALJ determines questions of credibility of witnesses and of conflicting evidence.\u201d); <em>Ceres Gulf, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>544 Fed.Appx. 451, 455 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished) (\u201cWhile the ALJ is required to address each issue with substantial evidence, the ALJ is not required to address each conflicting fact.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We AFFIRM the decision of the BRB. The BRB did not err in concluding that the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
