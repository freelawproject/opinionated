The district court imposed an advisory guideline sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment by imposing consecutive statutory maximum sentences for both counts, in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), which allows for consecutive sentences when the sentence for the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Ramirez-Martinez argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain the reasons for imposing a 48-month statutory maximum total sentence, even though he had made numerous arguments for a sentence below the statutory maximum. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Finally, he argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based on its finding that his prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, for resisting an officer with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>violence, was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He maintains that his prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We will address each of Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence using a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In evaluating the reasonableness of a sentence, we follow a two-step process by first determining whether the sentence is procedurally reasonable, and then if necessary, determining if the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the sentencing court fails to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), fails to properly calculate the appropriate guidelines range, or fails to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>However, given the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines, it is sufficient if there is some indication that \u201cthe district court was aware of and considered the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Consequently, the district court need not discuss or explicitly state on the record each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy [us] that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). However, \u201cwhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation. Circumstances may well make clear that the judge rests his decision upon the Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is a proper sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356-57, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. \u201cWhere the defendant or prosecutor presents non-frivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. The appropriateness of how much to write and what to say therefore depends on the circumstances of the case, and \u201c[t]he law leaves much, in this respect, to the judge\u2019s own professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we examine whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. In reviewing for substantive reasonableness, we examine the totality of the circumstances and ask \u201cwhether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will remand for resentencing only if the district court \u201ccommitted a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to deter criminal conduct, and to protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). In imposing a particular sentence, the district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). However, the district court can abuse its discretion when it (1) fails to consider factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Ramirez-Martinez has failed to show that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. On appeal, he argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its chosen sentence. However, his argument is unavailing because this was one of the situations contemplated by the Supreme Court in <em>Rita, </em>where a lengthy explanation was not required because the circumstances make clear that the district court rested its decision upon the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence was the proper sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356-57, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. Here, the advisory guideline range was a single point, 48 months, and that point was the statutory maximum with consecutive sentences. The government argued for it, noting that it was well below the bottom end of the advisory guideline range before the imposition of the statutory maximum. Ramirez-Martinez, in opposition, argued for a 24-month total sentence, and in support, maintained that it would be sufficient punishment and deterrence, because it was 8 times as long as his prior 105-day sentence for illegal entry. He also argued that because the offenses of illegal reentry and illegal entry consisted of nearly identical conduct, the district court would essentially be \u201cpunish[ing] him twice or basically committing] double jeopardy,\u201d if it imposed consecutive sentences. However, he conceded that it would not \u201clegally [be] double jeopardy.\u201d Finally, he argued that a total sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment would give him no credit for his acceptance of responsibility and timely guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">After entertaining the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court imposed the Guidelines sentence, and stated that the sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing, necessarily indicating that it had rejected Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s position and agreed with the government\u2019s position. In imposing the sentence, the district court did not need to provide a lengthy explanation for rejecting several of Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s arguments, particularly his \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d argument, which even he conceded was not \u201clegally double jeopardy.\u201d <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468 (\u201cWhere the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivo-lous reasons for imposing a different sentence, ... the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d). However, the district court did give a response to Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s acceptance of responsibility argument, essentially stating that Ramirez-Martinez had received the benefit for his acceptance of responsibility in the guideline calculations, even though it did not show up in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>the total 48-month sentence, due to the application of the statutory maximum. As for the rest of Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s arguments, they were adequately addressed by the district court\u2019s implicit agreement with the government\u2019s explanation that Ramirez-Martinez had already received a substantial benefit with the imposition of a total 48-month sentence, because, if the government had properly charged him with the offense of illegal reentry of a previously deported felon, based upon his prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 848.01, he would have faced an advisory guideline range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment and a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, under the circumstances, the district court\u2019s brief explanation was legally sufficient. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Ramirez-Martinez has also failed to show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He has not shown that his Guidelines sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment was substantively unreasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. The need for the sentence to promote respect for the law and adequate deterrence was high, given Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s history of quickly and repeatedly making illegal reentries into the United States after being deported. Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s Guidelines sentence was also reasonable in light of his own history and characteristics, particularly his criminal history of multiple arrests and convictions in the United States, including a conviction for resisting an officer with violence and a conviction for battery. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Newman, </em>614 F.3d 1232, 1235 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Diaz-Calderone, </em>716 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant being sentenced for illegal reentry into the United States may receive a 16-level enhancement if he was previously deported following a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). In <em>Romo-Villalobos, </em>we held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, for resisting an officer with violence, was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1249-1251 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 248, 184 L.Ed.2d 132 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Ramirez-Martinez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Romo-Villalobos. See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012) (\u201cWe are bound by a prior panel opinion until the opinion\u2019s holding is overruled by the Supreme Court or by our Court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d). </em>Accordingly, we affirm the sentence on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
